"1","Citizens, politicians, and journalists alike enjoy decrying political incivility. Diana C. Mutz complicates these attacks on incivility by investigating the effects of in‐your‐face politics. In‐your‐face political television includes two attributes: it contains incivility, that is, violations of face‐to‐face interaction norms, and it violates norms of interpersonal social distance by including close‐up shots that make a televised person appear physically close to the viewer. Mutz's thorough analysis suggests that in‐your‐face television, while damaging to citizens, also is more arousing and entertaining than civil political television."
"2","Mutz investigates the effects of in‐your‐face politics using a convincing multimethod approach. A series of tightly constructed lab experiments provide causal evidence that in‐your‐face political talk shows with both incivility and close‐up camera shots increase physiological arousal, entertainment value of the show, and open‐ended recall of political candidate issue positions. However, people who watched in‐your‐face television believed that the arguments made by candidates they opposed were less legitimate than people who saw other types of televised political interactions. Further, incivility alone—even without close‐up camera shots—decreased individuals’ levels of political trust. Mutz tests the external validity of her findings by conducting content analyses of political programing, replicating results using a survey experiment, and examining public opinion data to ensure that people watch this type of programming outside of the lab. Although each study has its weaknesses, together the tests paint a convincing picture that televised incivility attracts audiences to politics—especially audiences with low levels of political interest—while also undercutting their political trust."
"3","Mutz's work opens many avenues for future research regarding incivility in mediated settings. For instance, researchers should do more to investigate the extent to which Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson's politeness theory, which Mutz offers as a theoretical foundation for the work, fully applies to political interactions. Mutz persuasively argues that some impolite behaviors such as yelling, name‐calling, and interrupting other political figures on television have detrimental effects on individual viewers. Yet these behaviors represent only some of the face‐threatening acts outlined by Brown and Levinson in their book Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage. Individuals may see yelling and interruption as impolite, but do they consider a politician making a promise impolite as well? What about a candidate who discusses race or religion? Both making promises and speaking about societally sensitive topics such as race, religion, and politics are considered by Brown and Levinson to be face threatening in interpersonal interactions. These types of impoliteness are not addressed as part of in‐your‐face politics. If behaviors like these are considered impolite when they are televised, scholars should debate whether it is normatively beneficial for politicians to conform to all norms of face‐to‐face politeness or whether citizens should be encouraged to accept some types of impoliteness in public speech.         "
"4","Additionally, Mutz offers some intriguing thoughts about whether in‐your‐face politics will have stronger or weaker effects when presented online. On the one hand, the results of one of her experiments suggest that incivility presented in print news is weaker than incivility presented in audiovisual formats. Because online news is largely text based, perhaps in‐your‐face politics will have weaker effects online. On the other, Mutz points to previous research that suggests people are more likely to share arousing information with others. Perhaps videos with political incivility are likely to go viral online. Future researchers would do well to test both of these possibilities, and others, to determine whether in‐your‐face politics is both as arousing and as damaging online as it is on television."
