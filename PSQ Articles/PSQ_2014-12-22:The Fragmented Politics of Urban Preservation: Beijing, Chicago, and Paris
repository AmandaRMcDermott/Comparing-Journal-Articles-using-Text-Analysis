"1","Saving, living in, and visiting historic places is perhaps the most‐common way in which people consciously interact with the past. And yet, only in the last several decades has the movement received the sustained scholarly attention that it deserves, from historians, anthropologists, sociologists, and architects. Political scientists focusing on this key strategy of urban development in worldwide urban development, however, have been scarce. The Fragmented Politics of Urban Preservation is, therefore, an invaluable addition to the literature that should bring more attention to the central questions that preservationists ask: why is the effectiveness of preservation efforts so different in cities around the world? What accounts for success and failure in preservation struggles? Most preservationists have preferred to rely on limited answers about the relative significance of the buildings or landscapes to be preserved, or relative effectiveness of the advocacy coalition. In fact, Yue Zhang argues that we must understand not only the fragmented politics that define cities, but also the particular kind of fragmentation that is dominant in a given city.         "
"2","The author uses Beijing, Chicago, and Paris to define three types of political fragmentation, each the primary type in each of her three case studies. While Beijing is the capital of a nation with centralized authority, within the city itself, there is enormous fragmentation among different functional bureaucracies that have an ability to influence preservation initiatives, but no one organization with the skills and authority to implement plans. In Chicago, citywide preservation policies are made more difficult because of the power of local aldermen. Projects that fit neatly within an aldermanic district become tools of local development; those that cross boundaries require greater coordination and often fail. Hence, Chicago is defined by an uneven, “mosaic preservation” system (p. 69). In Paris, a powerful nationalistic preservation ethos and bureaucracy has long held sway. Only recently has a regime of “intergovernmental fragmentation” grown, as the municipality has sought to assert its control of the capital city. Overall, the author argues that Paris's form of fragmentation, intergovernmental fragmentation, “tends to have less‐severe negative effects on urban preservation” (p. 149) than either functional or territorial fragmentation. In the case of Paris, comprehensive urban preservation initiatives are possible where they are not as likely in Chicago (territorial) and Beijing (functional), even if the national and municipal governments battle over authority. Yue Zhang's theory provides an important model for understanding the politics of urban preservation."
"3","There are, however, some areas of concern that remain unresolved. The author could be forgiven for not definitively answering one of the most‐difficult of questions—what constitutes an ideal preservation initiative—except for the fact that she comes down on the side of one type of political fragmentation that produces better results. In fact, there are always unresolved tensions in preservation initiatives, and the basis for defining what constitutes the “right” form of preservation remains unclear. Second, the author repeatedly alludes to the “original meaning” (p. xv) and “original goals” (p. 147) of preservation, suggesting some golden age where there was consensus about the principles of preservation. In fact, the clash between preserving great architecture, important historic sites, and inventing politically useful urban settings from the past is longstanding and not simply a recent development. Furthermore, the author herself defines this “original” meaning in different ways at different places—as solely the preservation of architectural heritage in some places, and, at other points, something only vaguely defined—“social sustainability of cities” (p. xvi)."
"4","Finally, while the author is attentive to describing the negative effects of recent urban preservation efforts—such as in rapid displacement of lower‐income residents, in the face of the market‐based gentrification so common in U.S. cities, or displacement for tourist goals in terms of gentrification, such as happens in cities like Beijing—the connection between those failures and the particular nature of political fragmentation remains tenuous. This leads me to wonder, in the end, about the relative importance of the particular form of political fragmentation in comparison to larger shifts in the political economy of our time. What has driven the transformation of historic districts in New York into enclaves of the wealthy has little to do with the form of government and far more to do with the vast increase in wealth and consequent resorting of the city. What drives the demolition and cartoonish historic preservation in Beijing is a belief—borne out—that invented history can be crucial to harnessing international tourism and, equally important, international investment."
"5","As impressive as this book is—and it deserves to be read widely by preservationists—focusing on the political fragmentation regimes of cities might take our attention from the larger shifts in capitalism, and supportive ideologies of preservation and urban development, which provide more‐significant answers to the changing nature of historic preservation movement."
