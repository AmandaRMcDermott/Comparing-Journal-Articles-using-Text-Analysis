"1","Today we casually link conservative media names and institutions such as Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and Fox News with successful politicians from Ronald Reagan to Newt Gingrich to Donald Trump. Nicole Hemmer demonstrates that assuming conservative media and conservative politicians have always had a close relationship is a misperception. This is the story of the first generation of conservative media. The time frame is primarily the late 1940s through the 1950s. Some of the names and institutions that are discussed and appear throughout are well known, such as William F. Buckley Jr., the founding editor of National Review and the conservative activist group the John Birch Society. But Hemmer's focus is on the lesser known but equally transformative figures of the period: Clarence Manion, creator of the radio program the Manion Forum, who has been credited as one of the founders of talk radio, and Henry Regnery and William Rusher, publishers of the magazines Human Events and National Review, respectively.         "
"2","Each of the three was initially active in GOP politics, but eventually they found themselves on the outside looking in. For example, in 1953 at the start of Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, Manion was appointed chairman of the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, a highly regarded position. But Manion wanted the secretary of labor position and expected to eventually receive a U.S. Supreme Court nomination. Instead he was gone within six months after he repeatedly disagreed with Eisenhower publicly. For each of the three, choosing media activism rather than a career in institutional partisan politics would prove fortuitous. Conservative media activists did face real barriers during this period because their politics were considered too radical by the mainstream. As Messengers demonstrates throughout, by working outside the system, their contribution as conservative media activists to the conservative political cause would be profound.         "
"3","Conservative media activists in general, and especially Regnery's magazine Human Events, believed that the left controlled the institutions: media, universities, and the foreign policy establishment. Hemmer accepts this premise, which could be debated, but the larger point is that conservative media activists then (and now) clearly believed it and acted on it. The task at hand was clear: create and control a new narrative. First and foremost, as Hemmer states, “conservative media activists crafted and polarized the idea of media bias” (p. xii).         "
"4","For conservative media, the public would never discover mainstream media's liberal bias until the concept of objectivity was debunked. Objectivity was just a mask used by mainstream media to hide its own ideological agendas. Here are both the roots and meaning of Fox's “Fair and Balanced” slogan. Objectivity or nonideological media is a myth. All media is ideological, and the job of media conservatives is to control the ideological frame."
"5","By the end of the 1950s, the conservative media's dire warnings of liberalism and socialism and communism were now well known to a growing but still disenfranchised conservative audience. The next step for media conservatives was to build a political movement. The 1960s brought battles with the Federal Communications Commission over the fairness doctrine. Ironically, the fairness doctrine, which in theory could have been interpreted in a way that increased the amount of airtime that conservative opinions received, instead led to what was known as a “chilling effect” in which fewer views of any political persuasion were aired. When the Republican Party nominated Barry Goldwater in 1964, that was viewed as both a victory and then a defeat for conservative media. Nevertheless, media conservatives were now players in the inside game."
"6","Richard Nixon's victory in 1968 was viewed as a setback for media conservatives. Nixon would go on to disappoint media conservatives with his establishment of relations with China, much as he had disappointed them as Eisenhower's vice president when he greeted Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, known among conservatives as the “butcher of Budapest” (p. 72). But Messengers neglects Nixon's famous “Silent Majority” speech, which echoed the same themes of media conservatives: that there existed a vast majority of political conservatives and, most importantly, patriotic Americans whose voices were not being heard.         "
"7","What needs to be explored in more detail beyond Hemmer's discussion is the evolution of how objectivity moved from separating facts from opinion to the point that “objective” merely became defined as the presentation of all sides—when the “game” frame replaced factual accuracy, where objectivity is achieved by just reporting both sides. Which, of course, leads to the story of the alt‐right and Breitbart News. Thanks to the Messengers, we now have a better understanding of how we got here.         "
