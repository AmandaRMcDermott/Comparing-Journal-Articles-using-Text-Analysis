"1","U.S. Supreme Court justices can be some of the most compelling, although elusive, figures in American government. One of the most personally and intellectually compelling justices on the current Supreme Court—arguably, the most—is Clarence Thomas, the subject of Ralph A. Rossum's engaging new book. Justice Thomas has a remarkable and inspiring life story and, in more than 20 years on the Court, a body of jurisprudence that has helped him become one of the most original and intellectually serious constitutional decision makers in American law. Still, Thomas remains a misunderstood, and often vilified, figure. Rossum, however, deftly navigates Thomas's background and writings in a way that—even if not enough to change the minds of Thomas's critics—at least should improve public appreciation for Thomas's work. Understanding Clarence Thomas is an apt title.         "
"2","Rossum offers the reader a detailed journey through a judicial labyrinth, exploring both well‐known and obscure Thomas opinions. Rossum does not review every area of constitutional law on which Thomas has written. But because his depth is so impressive, it feels as if he does. Rossum's chief purpose (at which he succeeds) is to reveal and dissect Thomas's approach to adjudication, what Rossum calls the “original general meaning” approach to the Constitution. Rossum distinguishes other originalist approaches to judging, such as Justice Antonin Scalia's “original public meaning” approach. Thomas's version, Rossum observes, is broader and deeper, incorporating not merely the constitutional text but also the understanding of its drafters and ratifiers, as well as the “higher law principles” (p. 20) of the Declaration of Independence. Thomas's originalism has long been the subject of spirited debate among scholars, with many concluding that Thomas is the most faithful originalist on the Court (although there is dispute over this). Rossum's book is a worthy contribution to this debate. To understand Thomas, we must better understand originalism and Thomas's unique brand of it. And Rossum educates us."
"3","Of course—Justice Thomas being such a controversial figure—one may wonder whether this is the perspective that other American political or legal scholars would offer. Rossum acknowledges, but resists, many of the conventional criticisms of Thomas (on race, on equal rights, on judging alongside Scalia). Rather, Rossum shows how appreciation for Thomas has grown over time among academics across the ideological spectrum, and the reader senses that Rossum admires much about Thomas. Still, Rossum is no chump. He does not blindly praise Thomas or uncritically embrace his work. In evaluating Thomas's defense of judicially enforced federalism through the interstate commerce clause, for example, Rossum calls Thomas's work “powerful but somewhat myopic, in that it does not address the question of how adherence to the original understanding of the text is to be secured” (p. 45). Rossum then details key historical materials to show that the political structure of the federal system—and not judicial review—was to be the chief method for protecting the interests of the states. Rossum also explains that Thomas has “regrettably drifted far” (p. 94) from his otherwise steady version of originalism by joining those justices who have endorsed an expansive view of state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment."
"4","Rossum's book, then, is neither embarrassing adoration nor tired criticism. It is a serious work for readers interested in a comprehensive and mature assessment of constitutional adjudication in a system of limited government and ordered liberty. But it also personally examines a disputed judicial figure who is frustrated by his sense that courts have pulled the Constitution from its moorings. Rossum's insights help us better understand how Thomas, although imperfect, is driven—in his own way—to recover the Constitution."
