"1","It is easy, and unexceptional, to criticize litigation as a means of policymaking. Much more difficult, and rare, is demonstrating the extent to which litigation differs—for better or worse—from its alternatives."
"2","Through an insightful and lively examination of injury compensation policies, How Policy Shapes Politics attempts such comparison by pitting two contrasting modes of policymaking, termed “adversarial legalism” and “bureaucratic legalism,” against one another. Three case studies selected by the authors illustrate the terms. The hierarchically determined rules and socialized funding of Social Security Disability Insurance provide an example of bureaucratic legalism. The waves of court battles defining the United States’ response to the asbestos crisis illustrate a form of adversarial legalism. The third case study—involving vaccines and the injuries they cause—features policy that fluctuates between the two poles.         "
"3","By exploring the politics that are implicated over time and across these contrasting policy regimes, How Policy Shapes Politics considers a subtler critique of adversarial legalism—that it comes with too high a political cost—and finds that the much‐maligned mode of policymaking fares surprisingly well. The authors’ evidence does not, for example, support the frequently made assertion that litigation acts as “political flypaper” (p. 16), crowding out other forms of advocacy. Rather, claimant interests in the asbestos and vaccine contexts sought both judicial recourse and bureaucratic reforms. Nor does the evidence support the conclusion that adversarial legalism is more path dependent than bureaucratic legalism. If anything, it supports the opposite, with courts repeatedly serving as effective agents of change. The authors also find little evidence of litigation creating polarizing backlash; instead, they find “a politics much more fluid” (p. 196).         "
"4","The evidence nevertheless does support a narrower claim: that there is a relationship between adversarial litigation and the “individualization” of politics. While the causality here is not entirely clear, claimant groups splintered in a manner consistent with differing prospects in litigation but tended to stand together in the context of bureaucratic legalism. Defendant groups similarly proved fractious until the enactment of a bureaucratic regime (and its socialization of costs), after which time the groups largely faded from political view. This pattern—that is, of a more chaotic and fractious politics in the context of adversarial legalism than in the context of bureaucratic legalism—appears consistent with the qualitative analysis that opens How Policy Shapes Politics. Analyzing data from 40 years of congressional testimony, the authors conclude that hearings on adversarial policies, compared with bureaucratic politics, tend to include both “more diverse types of interests” and “more conflicting testimony” (p. 26). While this qualitative analysis is narrow in scope, it is provocative and a fitting introduction to the case studies that follow.         "
"5","The considerable accomplishments of How Policy Shapes Politics do come at the expense of grand theory. Indeed, the nuance of its analyses—its insistence on acknowledging the multifaceted and rich relationships between policies and their associated politics—calls into question any crosscutting claim about the political costs of adversarial legalism. This includes even some of the authors’ own careful and narrow claims about individualization. The authors acknowledge as much, as they wonder whether counterexamples demonstrate the unusual qualities of the case studies they selected (p. 203) and otherwise resist overstating the conclusions that can be drawn from their findings. This may frustrate a reader seeking broader claims. Yet ultimately this ambiguity is to the credit of the authors, as they seek to give fuller credit to “the extraordinary, at times bewildering, complexity of the American litigation state, and the ubiquitous and protean role of litigation in American public policy” (p. 191).
