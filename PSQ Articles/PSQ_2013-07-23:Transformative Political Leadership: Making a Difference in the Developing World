"1","Surprisingly, the study of leadership is relatively new. Before Glen Paige's 1977 book, The Scientific Study of Leadership, the search of indices of political science texts would come up empty‐handed, for as Barbara Kellerman has trenchantly observed, political science was until then the study of power. Major contributors to this new field included James McGregor Burns, whose comprehensive book Leadership usefully discriminated between leaders and power wielders and made the important distinction between transformational and transactional leaders, and Robert Tucker, whose Politics as Leadership both identified the concept of non‐constituted leaders and described important leadership actions: diagnosis, signalizing, and mobilization.         "
"2","Robert Rotberg's Transformative Political Leadership is a distinguished addition to this literature. He first identifies what he calls the critical competencies of transformative leaders: emotional intelligence, emphasizing the capacity to empathize with his followers; being consummate visionaries; the ability to motivate and mobilize followers; being perceived as legitimate; being able to display and project integrity, which includes conveying a sense of being both ethical and moral, and in so doing showing prudence, courage, and self‐mastery. Central to this latter point is intellectual honesty. These characteristics are required for the leader to gain his followers' trust. The consummate leader conveys a sense of leader and followers being in a mutual subjective relationship, having a mutual shared purpose. The leader cannot artificially do this, but must tap into authentic needs, what Mazlish has identified as drawing upon a psychic repository. The author addresses the contributions of charisma, and correctly observes that it is a social phenomenon, not just a quality of the leader.         "
"3","Drawing on his extensive experience in the developing world, Rotberg then illustrates transformative leadership with four compelling cases: Nelson Mandela in South Africa, Serfetse Khama in Botswsana, Lee Kwan Yew in Singapore, and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey. Each of these was a founding father with a compelling sense of vision, creating stable institutions in an area where dictatorships and corruption were often the rule."
"4","In the last chapter, “The Crisis of Contemporary Leadership,” in vivid contrast to the four transformative leaders he has earlier characterized, Rotberg describes a series of corrupt third‐world dictators, despots, and tyrants. It would seem, though, that in making the contrast vivid, the author has somewhat idealized his heroes, and demonized the villains, when in fact several are rather more ambiguous. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is an example. The author describes the second half of his leadership, when “greed begat greed and corruption more corruption” (p. 158). But in the first part of his career, Mugabe, as leader of the Zimbabwe liberation struggle, was seen as the savior of the Zimbabwean people, leading them from the bonds of a repressive government marked by racism and discrimination into a new era of prosperity, education, equality, and advancement. His first wife Sally, the “Mother of the Nation,” provided a humanizing and stabilizing influence and a constraint against the more‐florid expressions of his self‐aggrandizing personality that were increasingly to flower after her death in 1992. In contrast, his second wife, 40 years his junior, who is known as “Grasping Grace,” has encouraged flamboyant personal excesses while neglecting his nation's disintegration. Had he stepped down when he had successfully brought his independent nation to power, under the guidance of Sally, he would have been recorded as a nation builder and achieved heroic status in his nation's history, and could well have been in the first section of this volume. Similarly, one of the heroic leaders the author depicts, Kemal Ataturk, was by no means without flaws. In his zeal to establish a homogeneous ethnic population of Turks, he denied commitments he had made in 1923 when he spoke of creating a pluralistic nation of Turks and Kurds. His duplicity in violating this commitment is at the foundation of the Kurdish problem, and of the Kurdish extremism that exists to this very day."
"5","This mild criticism aside, this is a thoroughly excellent volume on the important topic of leadership in the developing world."
