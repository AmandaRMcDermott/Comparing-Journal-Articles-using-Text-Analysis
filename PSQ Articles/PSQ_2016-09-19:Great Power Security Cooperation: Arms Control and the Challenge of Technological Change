"1","The thesis of this book by David W. Kearn, Jr., is straightforward: “This book seeks to explain the conditions under which states would most likely engage in a critical type of security cooperation: qualitative arms control” (p. 1). The author develops a new theory of international relations in his introduction, an approach he calls “military expectations theory.” According to this theory, an understanding of how military technology changes and how states respond to those changes can affect a state's security strategies and behavior, thus becoming a variable that, in turn, influences that state's approach to interstate relations and its response to security challenges. The author correctly bases his analysis on the presumption that arms control is a tool for enhancing state security and a practice that conveniently lies at the intersection of international security, military strategy, technology and innovation, and international cooperation. Thus, it serves a valuable service, but it can prove very difficult to achieve because of a multitude of intervening factors. As Kearns puts it, “the concept of cooperative arms control as a potential remedy has enjoyed a troubled theoretical and practical history” (p. 5)."
"2","The book addresses four interesting historical cases in which arms control could have played a role in enhancing international security through cooperative actions: the Washington Naval Conference, the World Disarmament Conference, the Baruch Plan for international controls on nuclear weapons, and the first Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Each of these cases is thoroughly developed, showing an impressive depth of research. The chapters are designed with parallel structures that make them easier to compare. Yet there is almost too much detail for the general reader, with chapters so long that they will only appeal to a historian or true arms control expert. Yet all are well written and quite readable, with a wealth of sources in the endnotes."
"3","My primary concern with the book is not its readability, nor its attention to detail and historical accuracy, but rather that it may be “oversubscribed” when it comes to theory. Kearn develops an in‐depth theory that was obviously a requirement for his dissertation, and he diligently applies military expectations theory in an analysis of each case. This becomes tedious. We do not need that much theory unless the book is being touted as an international relations theory volume, which it is not. The story line of his book and the cases he describes are strong enough to carry the book to its conclusion without the added burden of trying to prove a new theory as well. The most valuable use of his theory is actually in the conclusion, where he attempts to apply it to the modern international system and U.S. policy in a fast‐changing world."
"4","My criticism is that the book tries to do too much, with a theory that is simple on its face but quite complicated in its explanation (three general propositions, six hypotheses, and seven alternative hypotheses, making it nearly impossible to follow its logic throughout the case studies). That being said, it is an excellent study of several important historical cases that prove the value of arms control as a tool of cooperative security and a way to limit conflict while also showing that, in some cases, technological aspirations of states regarding the potential payoff of future military systems will trump any thought of limiting those technologies through agreement. This makes Great Power Security Cooperation a valuable addition to the bookshelf of any international security analyst.         "
