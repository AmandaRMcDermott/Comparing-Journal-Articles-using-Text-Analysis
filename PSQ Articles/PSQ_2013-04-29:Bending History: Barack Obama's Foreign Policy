"1","An evaluation of the foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration while the President is still in office requires a cautious appraisal. The President's agenda is a work in progress, and the long‐term consequences of even fully executed decisions, such as winding down the war in Iraq, are unknown. Nevertheless, the significance of the Obama administration's actions in many areas justifies an early assessment, and this book presents a comprehensive and judicious study of those policy choices."
"2","The title Bending History comes from the opening of the acceptance speech that President Obama gave upon receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. While Obama had called for transforming the American political process in his 2008 presidential campaign, his foreign policy goals were ambitious but more contained; as the authors quote from his 2009 speech, Obama wanted to “bend history in the direction of justice” (p. 11). Particularly given the domestic and global economic crises that Obama faced upon taking office, he had only limited opportunity for initiating major changes abroad. An incremental agenda also was consistent with the President's instincts—the authors describe him as a “progressive pragmatist” (p. 6), who is willing to pursue large‐scale change but is attentive to political realities. The authors find that the President's foreign policy choices illustrate a common goal of developing “a new, multilateral global order with America still in the lead … but sharing more responsibilities and more burdens with others where possible or necessary” (p. 11).         "
"3","To develop this argument, the authors build upon their wide‐ranging combined expertise in American foreign policy and international politics to present a full survey of the array of issues that Obama addressed in his first three years in office. They begin with Obama's overtures to China and broader “rebalancing toward Asia” (p. 68), which has produced advances in dialogue and trade but still has much to achieve in broader strategic goals. The authors then turn to Obama's war policies, describing the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 by U.S. Special Operations Forces as Obama's “signature accomplishment” (p. 71), but finding that in Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama's “legacy from the wars remains fundamentally uncertain” (p. 71). Subsequent chapters examine Obama's mixed record in the Middle East peace process, response to the Arab Awakenings, dealings with the “rogue” states of Iran and North Korea, and efforts in such “soft security” areas such as energy policy and climate change."
"4","With its at once complete and concise evaluation of Obama's foreign policy, this book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the President's individual choices as well as connections between them. Any conclusions about the President's leadership are, of course, premature, when actions are still under way in places such as Afghanistan, and when a re‐election campaign is under way. Still, the authors find that while Obama lacks a coherent grand strategy (due partly, they note, to the complexity of challenges the United States faces abroad), his policies have been consistently practical and directed toward achieving justice abroad. Whether the President is able to continue this approach will depend on both the election results and the American economic situation."
"5","Given that the Obama administration issued a national security strategy in 2010, the authors might have organized this analysis differently, beginning with the strategy formulated by the President and examining its application to different policy areas. Instead, they examine policy decisions first and then conclude that those policies illustrate the President's priorities and initiatives in foreign affairs—making him, as they say, “more than a global carpenter” (p. 276)—but fall short of a full‐fledged doctrine. The administration's own identification of its doctrine merits more‐sustained consideration. Still, the thoughtful, fair, and clearly written evaluation of Obama's foreign policy record will make this text of interest to scholars, policymakers, and students alike."
