"1","IN JULY 2005, REVERSING DECADES OF U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy, President George W. Bush announced a commitment to attaining “full civilian nuclear energy cooperation and trade with India.”1 In November 2006, Congress passed the Henry J. Hyde United States–India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act and, in October 2008, approved the necessary follow‐on legislation, to formally permit civilian nuclear trade with India. The nuclear agreement with India was a major U.S. foreign policy initiative, and Indian Americans strongly lobbied Congress to approve this agreement. To some, this advocacy effort heralded the emergence of Indian Americans as a leading ethnic lobby that could substantially influence future U.S. foreign policy.2"
"2","Scholarship on ethnic‐group lobbying would suggest that the Indian American effort would not have been successful. Ethnic lobbying is generally successful if the ethnic group has substantial voting power, if the opposition is weak, and if the ethnic group is well organized for foreign policy lobbying. Yet, Indian Americans did not have a large amount of voting power. Moreover, they faced significant opposition from an entrenched nonproliferation lobby. And Indian Americans were not well organized—there was no dominant association that united the dozens of very distinct Indian American professional and cultural groups across the United States. How, in these circumstances, did the Indian American effort prevail? This article argues that the mechanism of working through a broader coalition considerably augmented Indian American activism. The breadth of the advocacy coalition, its ability to draw upon the resources of well‐endowed constituencies (Indian Americans and business), and the professional expertise within the coalition helped the effort to advance nuclear agreement through Congress."
"3","This article begins by surveying the literature on Indian Americans. It goes on to examine the legislative evolution of the nuclear agreement with India. It then discusses the extent to which different lobbying mechanisms applied to the Indian American effort for the nuclear agreement. Thereafter, it analyzes the most‐relevant mechanism—that of lobbying through a broader coalition. It specifies the structure of the “India lobby” that advocated for the nuclear agreement, and the efforts and activities of this lobby. The article concludes by clarifying its empirical contributions and its relevance to the broader literature on ethnic‐group lobbying."
"4","Ethnic lobbies are defined as “political organizations established along cultural, ethnic, religious, or racial lines,” that seek to address issues of concern to the ethnic group.3 In the area of foreign policy, they may ally with non‐ethnic organizations as part of a broader country‐focused lobby. For example, the term “Israel lobby,” comprising both ethnic‐based organizations (various Jewish‐American groups) and non‐ethnic organizations, has been defined as “a loose coalition of individuals and organizations that actively work to shape U.S. foreign policy in a pro‐Israel direction.”4 Similarly, an India lobby actively worked to influence Congress on the nuclear agreement.         "
"5","Scholarship on Indian American political activism has charted important characteristics of the Indian American community, such as its relatively high income levels; its size, which, while small, has grown in the 2000s and 2010s (the Indian American population increased from 1.7 million in 2000 to 2.6 million in 2007); and its political party affiliations (while most Indian Americans are Democrats, a substantial minority are Republicans). It has also traced the evolution of the Indian American community and its patterns of organization.5"
"6","The first generation of Indian Americans formed organizations along professional and cultural lines, but was not active in foreign policy. While two early professional organizations—the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI, founded in 1984), and the Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA, founded in 1989)—were politically active, they were concerned with domestic issues rather than with foreign policy. Also, due to differing agendas, cultural and linguistic differences, and very different conceptions of their identity, the efforts of various Indian American organizations rarely overlapped.6"
"7","In the 1990s, there was a gradual increase in Indian American political activism, especially among the younger generation. The House of Representatives established an India Caucus in 1993, after a dialogue between members of Congress and the Indian American Forum for Political Education (IAFPE). At this time, IAFPE was concerned about the State Department's somewhat critical views on India. In the 2000s, Indian Americans became even more politically active, partly because of their growing numbers, and also because of their concern over prevailing policy issues.7 The U.S.–India Political Action Committee (USINPAC) was formed in 2002 to lobby Congress on these issues. USINPAC and dozens of other Indian American professional and cultural associations across the United States lobbied for the nuclear agreement.         "
"8","The civilian nuclear agreement with India was a major foreign policy initiative for the Bush administration. It aimed to remove longstanding U.S.–India differences over India's nuclear program, and to thereby boost the U.S. strategic partnership with India. It also had economic and environmental dimensions: it offered a clean source of energy for India's growing economy, and provided civilian nuclear export opportunities for U.S. firms. Still, the initiative undermined U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy and the global nonproliferation regime by giving India an exemption from the critical full‐scope safeguards rule. This rule, embedded in U.S. law and international Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) guidelines, banned civilian nuclear trade with countries that had not signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and placed all their nuclear facilities under safeguards. For this reason, Congress, influenced by nonproliferation interest groups, sought substantial nuclear restraints from India before considering any legislation to exempt it from the full‐scope safeguards rule.8"
"9","From October 2005 to 2 March 2006, the Bush administration and India's government negotiated such restraints, involving the separation of India's civilian and military nuclear facilities. Thereafter, on 9 March, the administration submitted proposed legislation that entailed a one‐step congressional approval process. Once Congress approved this legislation, the legally binding Section 123 Agreement for U.S.–India nuclear cooperation, that could have imposed additional nonproliferation‐enhancing conditions on India, and which the Bush administration had yet to negotiate, would become effective without a second congressional vote of approval. This agreement would go into effect automatically unless Congress passed a resolution of disapproval, though the President could veto such disapproval, and Congress could only override the veto with a two‐thirds vote that would be difficult to attain."
"10","Congress did not advance the one‐step bill and instead opted to act on the nuclear agreement in two steps. It would first vote on legislation supporting the principle of nuclear cooperation with India. Thereafter, once the Section 123 Agreement with India was completed, it would vote again to approve that agreement, but on a fast‐track process similar to that used in trade agreements, which permitted no changes to the agreement."
"11","The two‐step process commenced in late June, when Representatives Henry Hyde, chair of the House International Relations Committee (HIRC), and Tom Lantos, ranking minority member in the HIRC, introduced HR 5682 in the House. Senator Richard Lugar, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), introduced a different bill, S 3709, in the Senate. These bills had stronger nonproliferation provisions than those in the Bush administration's March bill."
"12","On 27 June, the HIRC approved HR 5682. On 26 July, the entire House considered HR 5682 with additional nonproliferation‐enhancing amendments. Some were accepted, but the three main amendments, introduced by Representatives Brad Sherman, Howard Berman, and Edward Markey, were defeated by votes of 155–268, 183–241, and 192–235. The House then passed its bill 359–68."
"13","On 29 June, the SFRC approved S 3709. S 3709 was then held up for several months. On 16 November, the Senate eventually voted on the bill and also considered 10 amendments. Some were accepted, but the four main nonproliferation‐enhancing amendments, introduced by Senators Jeff Bingaman, Bryon Dorgan, Russell Feingold, and Barbara Boxer, were defeated by votes of 26–73, 27–71, 25–71, and 38–59. The Senate then passed its bill 85‐12‐3. The House and Senate bills were next reconciled in a conference bill (the Hyde Act). On 18 December, President Bush signed the Hyde Act, but issued a signing statement declaring that many items of concern to India would be advisory and not binding on the administration."
"14","The Bush administration next negotiated the legally binding Section 123 Agreement with India, which was completed in July 2007. Indian domestic politics then held up the nuclear agreement until July 2008, after which the NSG approved nuclear cooperation with India on 6 September 2008. It was only then, with time running out on the congressional calendar, that the Bush administration approached Congress with second‐step legislation to approve the Section 123 Agreement. The House approved this legislation, HR 7081, on 27 September by a vote of 298‐117, and the Senate approved it on 1 October by a vote of 86‐13. On 8 October, President Bush signed the legislation."
"15","To summarize, the Bush administration spent a considerable amount of time and effort in engaging Congress on the nuclear agreement. The India lobby augmented the administration's efforts."
"16","How did Indian Americans lobby Congress on the nuclear agreement? In general, ethnic groups seek to influence foreign policy in ways similar to those of other interest groups, but also in certain unique ways.9"
"17","John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, studying the Israel lobby, observed that this lobby derives its influence in six ways: through the lobby's voting power, its financial strength and electoral contributions, its organizational strength, the absence of strong competition, its domination of public discourse, and because Jewish Americans hold positions of power. Tony Smith, in his study of ethnic lobbying, noted that ethnic groups gain policy influence through voting power, financial contributions, and organizational strengths.10"
"18","Examining the above mechanisms of influence, some were entirely absent from the Indian American lobbying effort, while others made modest rather than huge contributions. First, the issue of weak competition did not apply—the India lobby faced significant competition from a strong nonproliferation lobby. Second, in terms of domination of public discourse, while the India lobby drew upon strategic affairs experts to support its case, these experts did not dominate discourse (a major daily, The New York Times, very strongly opposed the nuclear agreement). Third, there were no Indian Americans pushing the nuclear agreement from high positions of political power (such as a senior member of the National Security Council, an assistant secretary of state, or a congressman or senior congressional staffer). Although a few Indian Americans worked on the civilian nuclear agreement at the mid‐levels of the National Security Council, the State Department, and among congressional staff, they only handled routine technical and legislative aspects of the agreement. At a different level, a leading Indian American strategist, Ashley Tellis, who served as adviser to the U.S. ambassador to India from 2001 to 2003, helped conceptualize the nuclear agreement; he also authored a significant report in June 2005 outlining the case for the agreement.11 Still, Tellis left the administration by mid‐2005 and was less involved in the post‐2005 lobbying effort. Overall, there was no senior Indian American presence within the executive and legislative branches of government that advocated for and advanced the nuclear agreement through these branches.         "
"19","Two other mechanisms were present in the Indian American effort—financial contributions and voting power. The magnitude of Indian American influence through their financial contributions to members of Congress cannot be accurately determined, largely because of data limitations. The actual impact of these financial contributions on congressional votes is likely to have been small. On this point, while it is difficult to determine the total amount of Indian American funding to all members of Congress, data is available on a more limited sample of 38 representatives receiving USINPAC funding. Among these representatives, 87 percent voted for the House bill in 2006, and 80 percent voted for the House bill in 2008. The other representatives would be expected to vote less favorably on the legislation, all other factors being equal. Confirming this, among such representatives, 84 percent voted for the House bill in 2006 and 71 percent voted for the House bill in 2008. Still, the difference in favorable votes between those receiving USINPAC funding and those not receiving such funding is relatively small—it was just 3 percent in 2006 and 9 percent in 2008."
"20","In terms of voting power, ethnic groups gain influence when they are clustered in (and constitute a large proportion of the population in) some congressional districts, or when they are widely dispersed across many congressional districts.12 Examining these issues, the clustering effect was negligible because Indian Americans do not exceed 10 percent of the population in any district, and, in 2006, they constituted 5–9 percent in just seven districts. The dispersal effect was somewhat more relevant to Indian American lobbying. Indian Americans constituted 2–5 percent of the population in 32 districts, and 1–2 percent in some 60 districts. This population dispersal enabled the advocacy campaign to viably draw upon Indian Americans in about 100 congressional districts as it pressed Congress on the civilian nuclear agreement. Still, because the percentage of Indian Americans is very small in most districts—it is less than 1 percent of the population in over 300 districts—Indian American voting power alone did not influence a large majority of congressional votes on the nuclear agreement.         "
"21","The issue of organizational leadership and strength, which is the ability of an ethnic organization to unify an ethnic group around an issue and to undertake a substantial lobbying campaign, warrants closer examination. One dedicated advocacy organization, USINPAC, undertook its own lobbying campaign and did not extensively coordinate its efforts with other Indian American professional groups. Another group, a U.S.–India Friendship Council (USIFC), whose activities are discussed below, was able to bring some established Indian American professional associations (such as AAHOA and AAPI), as well as leading Indian Americans from several states, into the lobbying effort. Yet many Indian Americans remained outside the ambit of activities where other Indian American groups were present. As one Bush administration official noted, because of professional rivalries, some Indian Americans would not join the administration's outreach activities that involved rival Indian American groups.13 Further, USIFC lacked the expertise and capabilities for large‐scale lobbying.         "
"22","To summarize, several lobbying mechanisms were present in the Indian American effort for the nuclear agreement, but only to a small degree. By themselves, they would not have substantially affected congressional views on the nuclear agreement. It was the mechanism of lobbying through a coalition that considerably enhanced the Indian American effort for the nuclear agreement. This coalition, and the broader India lobby, is next examined."
"23","The India lobby that pressed Congress to endorse the civilian nuclear agreement had several components. It comprised Indian Americans, American business, strategic affairs experts, a formal “Coalition” of these groups, the Indian government, Indian business, and additional constituencies. The degree of coordination between each component varied, as explained below. The lobby also drew upon synergies with the Bush administration's outreach effort."
"24","A first component comprised Indian American professional and community groups and the broader Indian American population. One such group was USIFC, formed in early 2006 by a North Carolina entrepreneur for the specific purpose of lobbying Congress on the nuclear agreement. Its core membership comprised approximately two dozen Indian Americans such as information technology entrepreneurs, physicians, hoteliers, and other professionals. USIFC hired a small lobbying firm that was already representing two major Indian American professional groups, AAPI and AAHOA, on domestic policy issues. AAPI, AAHOA, and several other Indian American groups were thereby drawn into the lobbying efforts of USIFC and of a broader coalition. Other groups such as USINPAC and the Indian American Security Leadership Council (a group formed in 2006, having ties with the Washington‐area public relations firm Bonner and Associates) undertook additional lobbying."
"25","Second, American business lobbied for the nuclear agreement through established associations such as the U.S.–India Business Council (USIBC) and the Contractors International Group on Nuclear Liability (CIGNL); through the professional firms hired by USIBC and CIGNL; and through the additional efforts of major American corporations. Given its limited personnel resources, USIBC hired three professional firms to assist with its lobbying effort. One was Vickery International/Stonebridge, headed by a former assistant secretary of commerce having extensive experience with India. This firm focused on overall strategy and on reaching out to Indian Americans, and organized the Coalition for the Partnership with India (discussed below). A second, Patton Boggs, focused on Capitol Hill, and its India‐related efforts were headed by Graham Wisner, brother of former ambassador to India Frank Wisner. A third, the Litchfield Group, worked on messaging. American corporations working most closely with USIBC were part of the core strategy group in the Coalition for the Partnership with India.14 They included the two firms considering nuclear reactor sales to India (General Electric [GE] and Westinghouse); and defense firms interested in strategic trade (such as Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin). These American defense and high‐technology firms promoted the nuclear agreement because they sought access to the Indian defense market; they wanted the United States to lift export control restrictions on India, as this would boost their technology sales to India; they had an interest in India not conducting additional nuclear tests, because such tests would result in sanctions that would disrupt their future exports to India; and the nuclear agreement would help correct the perception in India, stemming from U.S. sanctions imposed after India's 1998 nuclear tests, that the United States was an unreliable arms supplier. Other firms who benefited from improved U.S.–India relations (Ford, the American International Group [AIG], Bechtel, Dow Chemical, Honeywell, Textron, and ITT) also lobbied for the nuclear agreement. Moreover, since its daily operations were conducted from its headquarters at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, USIBC drew upon the broader resources of the Chamber.         "
"26","CIGNL had seven members, with General Electric‐Hitachi, the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC), and Westinghouse being especially interested in the issue of Indian nuclear liability laws being compatible with international standards.15 It hired Barbour, Griffith, & Rogers (BGR) in late 2005, and a few other lobbying firms from 2006 to 2008, to lobby for the nuclear agreement. During 2005 and 2006, it focused on lobbying Congress, whereas in 2007 and 2008, it focused on the executive branch.         "
"27","Third, while sections of the U.S. foreign policy establishment were cautious about the nuclear agreement because it undermined longstanding nuclear nonproliferation policy, some prominent strategic affairs experts supported the agreement."
"28","Fourth, USIBC and its lobbying firms reached out to several Indian American groups and strategic affairs experts to form a “Coalition for the Partnership with India.” This single‐issue Coalition played a major role in the lobbying campaign, but was dissolved after Congress approved the nuclear agreement."
"29","Fifth, India's government, through the Indian embassy, hired two professional firms to lobby for the nuclear agreement. These were the Republican‐leaning BGR, whose India practice was headed by former ambassador to India Robert Blackwill (though Blackwill himself was barred from lobbying for one year after he left government, and therefore remained outside the lobbying effort for much of 2006), and the Democrat‐leaning Venable LLP."
"30","Sixth, Indian business, through the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), actively promoted the nuclear agreement. While much of their efforts took place in India, these groups were also active in the United States, in part through joint events with USIBC."
"31","The Coalition for the Partnership with India recognized that the Bush administration was primarily responsible for advancing legislation through Congress. It considered itself to be playing a supporting role, rather than the primary role, in moving the civilian nuclear initiative forward.16 Its efforts had several dimensions.            "
"32","First, the Coalition's core group (USIBC, its professional lobbying firms, and participants from American corporations and Indian American groups) met regularly, often weekly, to coordinate their efforts. Administration officials such as Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns also briefed them, typically monthly, about the administration's position."
"33","Second, the Coalition developed a public policy communications strategy having a message, target recipients, and messengers. Its primary message to Congress was similar to the case made by the administration. It argued that the civilian nuclear agreement offered major strategic, energy, and environmental benefits; its nonproliferation drawbacks (of undermining the full‐scope safeguards rule) were offset by nonproliferation benefits (of India's separating its civilian and military facilities and placing the civilian facilities under safeguards); and that the strategic benefits would be lost and U.S.–India relations would suffer if Congress rejected the agreement."
"34","The recipients of its message were key congressional leaders—the ranking members from both parties in the SFRC and HIRC (Representatives Hyde and Lantos and Senators Lugar and Joseph Biden); other important members of these committees; the majority and minority leadership in the House and Senate; and key members of the India Caucus. The Coalition was sensitive to the issues of concern to particular representatives and senators. For example, it recognized that Senator Paul Sarbanes was more concerned with nonproliferation than with corporate interests; that Senator Barbara Boxer was critical of India's ties with Iran; and that two‐thirds of the physicians in the district represented by Representative Steny Hoyer (minority whip in the House) were Indian Americans.17 The Coalition also recognized that Republicans were more likely to support the Bush administration and it therefore focused slightly more on persuading Democrats. Overall, its lobbying effort was bipartisan and it reached out to both parties. This helped maintain the credibility of the lobbying effort when the leadership of congressional committees changed from Republican to Democrat in 2007.            "
"35","In terms of the messengers, the Coalition brought all its three constituencies—business, Indian Americans, and strategic affairs experts—to meetings with senators and representatives. This reinforced the message to Congress that the nuclear agreement was not driven by the interests of just a single constituency."
"36","Third, the Coalition's major activity was to arrange several dozen meetings with the key lawmakers noted above. In each meeting, the Coalition was represented by a business leader (often the CEO of a major corporation such as GE, Boeing, Ford, Federal Express, AIG, and Lockheed Martin); a prominent Indian American; and a defense or foreign affairs expert."
"37","The Coalition also lobbied in other ways. It recruited strategic affairs experts to the lobbying effort; distributed a March 2006 letter by 23 experts on Capitol Hill; helped draft op‐eds and letters for some experts; and organized a joint letter from its three constituencies to the Senate on 16 September 2006 (this letter was signed by 5 business organizations, 28 firms, 9 Indian American organizations, and over 20 foreign policy experts, illustrating the breadth of the Coalition).18 The Coalition also professionalized the lobbying efforts of Indian American groups, most of whom were not experienced in lobbying, and it gave Indian Americans talking points for their meetings with lawmakers.            "
"38","Another significant Coalition event took place on 2 May 2006, when USIFC recruited 150 prominent Indian Americans to visit Washington. In the morning, this group attended a White House briefing on the nuclear agreement (this enabled the White House outreach office to meet face‐to‐face with a wider audience of Indian Americans, beyond just their leadership, and to build relationships with them). The group then attended a lunch hosted by USIBC, where Indian Americans met their business counterparts. In the afternoon, Indian Americans, joined by business leaders and strategic affairs experts, met with members of Congress from their respective states and home districts. This event illustrates the manner in which the Coalition brought together Indian Americans, business, and strategic affairs experts, as well as the synergies between the Coalition and the Bush administration."
"39","Indian American groups lobbied for the nuclear agreement in numerous ways. Some of these groups coordinated their efforts with each other and with business and strategic affairs experts, while also lobbying in their individual capacities, but some were more independent in their lobbying activities. Typical Indian American lobbying efforts included placing advertisements in major dailies, sending letters to members of Congress, holding informational events, hosting fundraisers and receptions, and having private meetings with key members of Congress.19"
"40","USIFC was involved in several of the above activities. For example, on 5 April 2006, it placed an advertisement in The Washington Post titled “An Appeal to the United States Congress.” The appeal was supported by six Indian American organizations—AAPI, AAHOA, IAFPE, Alumni of the Indian Institute of Technology, Federation of Indian Associations Tri‐State Area, and National Organization of Indian Associations. On 18 June, USIFC sent a follow‐up letter to members of Congress that highlighted the breadth of Indian American interest in the nuclear agreement. It noted that “the national organizations who join us in this letter have a combined constituency of over 150,000 Americans of Indian descent who are active on this issue.” USIFC also held fundraisers. For example, on 27 June, two IT entrepreneurs hosted a fundraiser for Senator Biden under the auspices of USIFC.20 And, on 12 September, USIFC hosted a reception for senators urging them to bring legislation on the nuclear agreement to a vote.            "
"41","USINPAC undertook a range of lobbying activities. Its major event in 2005 was a reception on 8 November, hosted with Representative Eni Faleomaeaga (the ranking member of the House subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific), and attended by several members of Congress. At this event, Representative Lantos delivered an open letter to India's ambassador affirming his commitment to the nuclear agreement. USINPAC's other main effort in 2005 was to persuade Congress to include pro‐India witnesses in congressional hearings."
"42","In 2006, USINPAC held major events in April, May, and June. On 10 April, it hosted an event with Undersecretary Burns, 20 members of Congress, and the Indian American community. On 18 May, it held a lobbying day on Capitol Hill, and met the congressional leadership including Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, ranking HIRC member Tom Lantos, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee Charles Rangel, and the chief of staff for House majority leader John Boehner. That day, recognizing the importance of the issue, Speaker Hastert held a private meeting with the USINPAC chairman and Representatives Chris Cannon and Eni Faleomavaega (co‐chairs of the Congressional Task Force on U.S.–India Trade Relations), to discuss ways to advance civil nuclear legislation.21 On 21 June, ahead of the mark‐up of legislation in the House and Senate, USINPAC co‐hosted a press conference with the Congressional Task Force on U.S.–India Trade Relations, the U.S.–India Business Alliance, and Undersecretary Nicholas Burns. Again, several members of Congress attended the event.            "
"43","USINPAC also held fundraisers for members of the House, such as Representatives Ileana Ros‐Lehtinen (co‐chair of the India Caucus) and Frank Pallone (founder and past chair of the India Caucus), and for three key senators (Senators John Cornyn [co‐chair of the Friends of India group in the Senate], Christopher Bond, and Joseph Biden)."
"44","In terms of its political contributions, among members of the House, USINPAC contributed $51,200 to 20 Democrats and $58,549 to 21 Republicans during the 2006 cycle.22 Among Senators, it contributed $3,650 to four Democrats (Senators Evan Bayh, Ben Cardin, Edward Kennedy, and Mary Landrieu) and $9,100 to five Republicans (Senators Lamar Alexander, Lindsey Graham, John Kyle, John Cornyn, and Richard Lugar). During the 2008 electoral cycle, among members of the House, it contributed $51,800 to Democrats and $9,000 to Republicans, and, among Senators, contributed $9,800 to Democrats.            "
"45","Other Indian American groups pursued additional activities. For example, AAPI and AAHOA held a joint reception on 10 July 2006, where Secretary of State Rice was the keynote speaker. Further, community publications and websites such as India Abroad and News India extensively covered drafts of the nuclear legislation, and also named individual members of Congress who had expressed support for or opposition to the bills.23"
"46","Finally (often at the suggestion of Indian American groups or the Coalition for the Partnership with India), Indian Americans lobbied representatives and senators from their home districts and states. Such lobbying succeeded in getting several representatives to cosponsor the March 2006 legislation—the number of cosponsors in the House increased from 8 on April 30 to 41 by mid‐June, including 16 (mostly Republicans) from Texas, 4 Democrats from New York, 3 Democrats from Illinois, and 2 Democrats from Ohio."
"47","Thus, in Ohio, Indian Americans lobbied Representative Sherrod Brown, who was holding out against, but eventually cosponsored, the March 2006 legislation. In Texas, Indian Americans were particularly active in lobbying their representatives in May and June.24 The large number of cosponsors from Texas is notable, compared to the fact that there was only one co‐sponsor each from New Jersey and California, states with high Indian American populations. To take some other examples, in Nevada, an Indian American doctor from Las Vegas lobbied Senator John Ensign in September; late that month, Ensign dropped his hold on the Senate bill.25 In Mississippi, in early May, a prominent Indian American doctor met with Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran (they announced their support for the agreement soon thereafter), and Indian Americans also urged House members from Mississippi to support the agreement.26 In Florida, a doctor on the USINPAC Leadership Committee met with several members of Congress, including Representative Michael Bilirakis and Senator Mel Martinez. And Indian Americans focused considerable effort on lawmakers from the New York metropolitan region, which had the highest concentration of Indian Americans in the United States.27 Indian Americans also asserted that it was time for members of Congress to give back to their community.28"
"48","USIBC and American business pursued several initiatives for the nuclear agreement. Their activities included holding gala events, sending letters from business leaders to Congress, and making economic arguments for the nuclear agreement."
"49","For example, a USIBC gala event on 22 June 2006 included a keynote address by Vice President Richard Cheney and a speech by Senator Biden. Here, Biden publicly endorsed the nuclear agreement, and this influenced several Democrats in the Senate to also support the agreement. It is also worth noting that prominent Indian Americans attended this event, and a USIFC leader organized Senator Biden's participation, illustrating the close links between Indian Americans and business."
"50","To take another example, USIBC drew upon the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On 21 March, the Chamber's president sent letters to representatives and senators urging them to support the nuclear agreement. In September, when the bill was tabled in the Senate, the Chamber sent another letter urging senators to vote on the legislation."
"51","To take a third example, on 5 April, the chief executives of major U.S. firms (such as AES Corporation, Dow Chemical, Honeywell, McGraw‐Hill, J.P. Morgan Chase, Parsons Brinckeroff, and Xerox) sent a letter to members of Congress endorsing the nuclear agreement. The letter noted that the agreement would “foster technological innovation and the creation of commercial opportunities bringing prosperity to millions.”29"
"52","To take a fourth example, in December 2006, just after Congress passed the Hyde Act, USIBC, in partnership with CII, assisted in taking to India the largest American business development mission in the history of the U.S. government. The group comprised 258 executives from 200 firms, including 30 from 14 firms in the nuclear sector.30"
"53","The above examples highlight a key aspect of business lobbying, which went beyond the strategic argument made by the Bush administration: business argued that strong political ties with India would generate economic returns for American firms.31 It noted that nuclear cooperation with India would create thousands of jobs for U.S. vendors. American business initially made the argument that if U.S. vendors obtained contracts for just two civilian nuclear reactors in India, this would create 3,000–5,000 new direct jobs and 10,000–15,000 indirect jobs in the United States. Eventually, it outlined larger economic opportunities, noting that “India's nuclear‐energy market—estimated to require $100 billion in foreign direct investment—will open for U.S. companies, which till now has been a closed sector, creating a potential 270,000 American jobs in high‐technology engineering and manufacturing over the next decade.”32 And, on defense issues, American firms made the case that improved ties with India would give Boeing and Lockheed Martin a better chance at obtaining a $10 billion contract to sell 126 fighter planes to the Indian Air Force.33"
"54","In summary, USIBC undertook an extensive lobbying effort for American business. Illustrating the breadth of its endeavors, it had talked to or held meetings with some 40 major companies by July 2006, in the period before the House vote.34 Further, some U.S. corporations, beyond their efforts with USIBC, lobbied Congress in their individual capacities. These included McDermott International, the Shaw Group, United Technologies, the Chamber of Commerce, USEC, New York Life Insurance, Northrop Grumman, Nuclear Energy Institute, Raytheon, Bechtel, Boeing, Chevron, Westinghouse, General Electric, and Honeywell.35"
"55","A number of strategic affairs experts endorsed the nuclear agreement, albeit some with caution. Thus, on 10 March 2006, 23 eminent scholars, diplomats, and former policymakers wrote a letter to Congress favoring the nuclear agreement; they outlined its positive strategic, economic, energy, and environmental aspects, and they allayed nonproliferation concerns. Experts also commented favorably on the nuclear agreement in congressional testimony and in the press."
"56","It should also be noted that congressional leaders on nonproliferation, including Republicans such as Senator Lugar, held back their support for the nuclear agreement until they had thoroughly consulted and heard from experts. In the end, they were significantly influenced by the endorsement from nonproliferation experts such as director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Mohammed El Baradei; defense and foreign affairs experts with experience in nonproliferation such as Frank Wisner (who once served as a special envoy on nonproliferation) and Ashton Carter; and senior former members of the cabinet such as former defense secretaries William Perry and William Cohen and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger."
"57","The advocacy coalition drew upon additional constituencies to make its case with Congress. For example, in July 2006, one Indian American group, the Indian American Security Leadership Council (IASLC), recruited eight national veterans groups to endorse the nuclear agreement.36 Also, in November, the IASLC ran a full‐page advertisement in Roll Call, signed by veterans' organizations, urging Congress to pass nuclear legislation without tough amendments.37 To take another example, on 18 May 2006, the American Jewish Committee sent a letter to Congress endorsing the nuclear agreement.            "
"58","The Indian embassy and India's ambassador to the United States met with and reached out to dozens of members of Congress to secure their support for the nuclear agreement. The lobbying firms hired by the Indian embassy, BGR and Venable, pursued additional extensive efforts.38 BGR's lobbying effort from late 2005 to 2008 involved some 150 meetings and communications with Bush administration and State department officials, and 360 with congressional staffers and members of Congress. Most of these took place from March to December 2006, when Hyde Act legislation was making its way through Congress. In the House, it extensively reached out to five Republicans—Representatives Ros‐Lehtinen, Hyde, Dan Burton, Ed Royce, and Joe Wilson (all members of the HIRC; Wilson was also past chair of the India Caucus)—and two Democrats—Representatives Howard Berman and Steny Hoyer. In the Senate, it largely focused on leading Republicans—Senators Lincoln Chafee, Chuck Hagel, Lamar Alexander, Richard Lugar, and Mel Martinez (all members of the SFRC) and Senators John Cornyn, John McCain, and Jon Kyl (who were part of the Republican leadership).            "
"59","Venable's lobbying activities involved over 400 meetings and communications, including just under 50 with Bush administration and State Department officials, and 370 with members of Congress and congressional staff. Again, most of these occurred between March and December 2006. In the House, it interacted with five Republicans—Representatives Hyde, Ros‐Lehtinen, Boehner (the majority leader), Lewis, and Pryce. It worked more extensively with 13 Democrats—Representatives Ackerman (co‐chair of the India Caucus), Berman, Crowley, Lantos, Rangel, Faleomavaga, Napolitano, Abercrombie, Brown, Cardoza, Delahunt, Lee, and Waxman. In the Senate, it reached out to key Republicans (Senators Chafee, Cornyn, McCain, Lott, Crapo, Dole, Domenici, Isakson, and Vitter). More significantly, it held several meetings with leading Democrats (Senators Biden, Kennedy, Reed, Reid, Baucus, Dodd, and Levin), and it also met fewer times with some other Democrats (for example, in April 2006, it met Senators Akaka, Bingaman, Dorgan, who still eventually voted against the Hyde Act, as well as Senator Mikulski)."
"60","It should also be noted that for the most part, BGR and Venable's lobbying activities did not significantly overlap. Illustrating this, among members of the House International Relations Committee, BGR met with 7 members of Congress and Venable met with 16, though only 3 members of Congress met with both firms. Among members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, BGR met 8 senators and Venable met with 20, though only 3 senators met with both firms.39"
"61","Indian business groups such as CII and FICCI promoted the nuclear agreement in India as well as in the United States. CII's contributions began in the period before the nuclear agreement, when it helped advance U.S.–India relations through numerous business‐to‐business and government‐to‐business events. Among these, it hosted track‐II dialogues with the Aspen Group that began in 2002. During the 2005 dialogue, participants outlined a framework for civilian nuclear cooperation. It also sponsored congressional trips to India; from 2000 to February 2005, 18 members of Congress and 58 congressional staffers visited India on such trips.40 These relationship‐building initiatives created a greater awareness of India in Congress and in the U.S. strategic community, and thereby contributed indirectly to the success of the nuclear agreement.            "
"62","These efforts continued in the period 2005–2008, when CII promoted exchanges between Indian Members of Parliament and U.S. members of Congress; these made the members of Congress aware of the importance of the nuclear agreement for U.S.–India relations. Also, as noted above, it partnered with USIBC in bringing U.S. business delegations to India. The business‐to‐government interaction during such initiatives was also important; Indian government officials met U.S. business leaders and informed them about the significance of the nuclear agreement, and, in turn, U.S. business leaders lobbied for the agreement in the United States."
"63","The advocacy coalition and Bush administration drew upon mutual synergies in their efforts to persuade Congress. Some of their reinforcing activities, such as the 2 May 2006 event, have been noted above. The Bush administration also interacted with the advocacy coalition in other ways."
"64","First, the White House outreach office held regular, often weekly, conference calls with 10–20 officials from the main Indian American groups.41 These initiatives kept Indian Americans informed of the administration's efforts. They also helped counter the stand taken by members of Congress who, in their conversations with Indian Americans, noted that the administration was not sufficiently engaging Congress on the nuclear agreement.            "
"65","Second, administration officials regularly participated in events hosted by Indian American groups and American business. Appearances by Secretary of State Rice, Undersecretary Burns, and other officials energized these groups' members to become more involved in the lobbying effort. In the end, the administration's outreach effort was successful in building relationships with Indian Americans. This helped when the passage of the Hyde Act was delayed until the lame‐duck session of Congress in late 2006. It again helped in late 2008, when time constraints were the main concern for the advocates of the nuclear agreement. In these situations, the administration was able to engage Indian American groups, especially because of its stronger relations with them. They, in turn, pressed Congress to advance the civilian nuclear legislation."
"66","To summarize, each component of the India lobby undertook a range of activities to advance the civilian nuclear agreement. The lobbying activities during 2006, discussed above, were essentially replicated in August and September 2008, when the Bush administration sought to advance second‐step legislation through Congress."
"67","This breadth of activity was complemented by the strengths within the lobby. These strengths included the fairly vast financial and personnel resources of Indian Americans and business; endorsement from recognized foreign policy experts; the professional, legal, and public relations lobbying expertise within the coalition; and its organizational effectiveness in coordinating the activities of Indian Americans, business, and strategic affairs experts. Thus, the breadth of the India lobby, and the strong capabilities and expertise within the lobby, helped in advancing the nuclear agreement through Congress."
"68","To what extent did lobbying by interest groups influence the actual votes of members of Congress? To what extent did other mechanisms influence congressional votes? Five hypotheses offer basic assessments of these issues."
"69","The first (H1) tests the impact of lobbying by examining the votes of members of Congress who were directly lobbied by the main lobbying organizations—BGR, Venable, and USINPAC. The second (H2) tests the impact of Indian American voting power by examining the votes of members of Congress in districts having the highest percentages of Indian Americans.42 The third (H3) tests the impact of financial contributions by examining the votes of members of Congress receiving funding from USINPAC. The magnitude of these contributions was not large, because USINPAC was restricted by law from contributing more than $4,000 to a candidate. Still, members of Congress receiving USINPAC funding would be expected to vote favorably on India‐related issues. The fourth and fifth test the impact of relationship‐building activities. Thus, H4 examines the votes of members of Congress who were members of the India Caucus in the House, and the equivalent “Friends of India” group in the Senate. These members of Congress were most involved with—and thereby built relationships with—India‐related groups in the years prior to the nuclear agreement. H5 examines the votes of members of Congress who participated, or had their staff participate, in trips to India sponsored by CII in the period 2000–2005. Thus, the following five hypotheses can be tested on the main amendments and bills. These tests examine the votes against the amendments and the votes for the actual bills, because voting against the amendments is the equivalent of supporting a pro‐India policy, and voting for the bills is the equivalent of supporting a pro‐India policy.            "
"70","H1: The percentage of pro‐India votes among 70 representatives and 37 senators who were directly lobbied by BGR, Venable, and USINPAC is more than the percentage among those who were not directly lobbied by these firms."
"71","H2: The percentage of pro‐India votes among 37 representatives and 18 senators from districts and states having a proportionally higher Indian American population is more than the percentage among those from other districts and states."
"72","H3: The percentage of pro‐India votes among 38 representatives and 9 senators receiving funding from USINPAC is more than the percentage among those not receiving USINPAC funding."
"73","H4: The percentage of pro‐India votes among 182 representatives and 35 senators who were members of the India Caucus is more than the percentage among those who were not members of the Caucus."
"74","H5: The percentage of pro‐India votes among 40 representatives and 14 senators who participated (and whose staff participated) in CII‐sponsored trips to India is more than the percentage among other representatives and senators."
"75","The votes of representatives and senators are shown in Tables 1 and 2, and the results of the above hypothesis tests are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Three basic observations follow from this analysis.            "
"76","First, among all representatives and senators, very large majorities favored the final bills: 84 percent favored the 2006 House bill, 72 percent favored the 2008 House bill, 88 percent favored the 2006 Senate bill, and 87 percent favored the 2008 Senate bill. However, smaller majorities voted against the amendments to these bills (see Tables 1 and 2). In short, while most representatives and senators favored the nuclear agreement and the strategic partnership with India, a substantial number were still sensitive to nonproliferation concerns and sought to incorporate these in amendments.            "
"77","Second, many Democrats took a free vote on the amendments to affirm their nonproliferation credentials. (In the House, Democrats had a free vote in 2006 because they knew that the House legislation would eventually be changed by the Senate. In the Senate, Democrats also had free vote because, given the Republican majority, Democratic votes alone could not defeat the legislation). The majority of Democrats voted for the amendments to the House and Senate bills (that is, they took a more pro‐nonproliferation and less pro‐India approach). Thus, 66, 74, and 85 percent of the Democrats voted for the three main amendments to the July 2006 House bill. Also, 58, 58, 56, and 64 percent voted for the four main amendments to the November 2006 Senate bill. In contrast, Republicans voted almost entirely in favor of the administration's preferences."
"78","Thus, party affiliation is a stronger predictor of the congressional vote than any of the mechanisms of influence assessed in the hypotheses."
"79","Third, the majority of the cases do not support the five hypotheses assessing the influence of lobbying, voting power, financial contributions, and relationship‐building on the congressional vote (this is shown in Tables 3 and 4).            "
"80","Specifically, only one hypothesis—H1, assessing lobbying by BGR, Venable, and USINPAC—is supported across almost all the amendments and bills. In the House, this hypothesis is at least weakly supported in all five votes (that is, votes for the three amendments and two bills); among these, it is moderately supported in three of the five votes. In the Senate, the hypothesis is at least weakly supported in four out of six votes, and it is moderately supported in one of these votes."
"81","The other hypotheses are, for the most part, not supported. In the House, the hypothesis on USINPAC contributions is the only one that is supported in the majority of votes; it is at least weakly supported in three out of five votes, of which one shows a moderate level of support. (This hypothesis is also supported for the Senate, but, given the very small number of cases—only 9 senators are counted as receiving USINPAC contributions—this result is not considered in our analysis.) In the Senate, the hypothesis on India Caucus membership is supported in three out of six votes, of which one shows a moderate level of support."
"82","Some qualifications should be noted concerning these first‐cut observations. First, in many cases, party affiliation outweighed the mechanisms of influence. Illustrating this, representatives from districts with a high percentage of Indian Americans were also mostly Democrats, and therefore voted for the amendments to the House bill; this accounts for why H2 is not supported in four of the five votes in the House. Second, given the small number of cases, changes in the votes of a very few representatives and senators would change the results in terms of support for the hypotheses. Third, although the above mechanisms of influence did not always translate into pro‐India votes, they did help in moving the nuclear agreement through Congress, as discussed below."
"83","Five points should be noted in terms of the effectiveness of the lobbying campaign for the nuclear agreement with India. First, the lobbying effort had a mixed impact on advancing legislation through Congress. On the one hand, despite its strong efforts, the India lobby was unable to secure congressional support for the March 2006 one‐step bill. On the other hand, the advocacy effort helped advance the alternative bills at critical moments in late 2006 and late 2008, when time was running out on the congressional calendar."
"84","Second, each component of the India lobby had somewhat different effects.43 Thus, Indian Americans had a relatively greater impact on the House, especially because the House had a large India caucus. Business was relatively more influential in the Senate. Finally, strategic affairs experts played a useful role in influencing representatives and senators—such as Senators Biden and Lugar—who acknowledged but were not hardcore adherents to nonproliferation.44"
"85","Third, the groups that lobbied—business, Indian Americans, and arms control groups—had motivations that went beyond just influencing Congress. They also sought to convey their activism to their constituents and to create a record of their activities.45 For example, USIBC's business trips to India were geared not just toward making the case for the nuclear agreement, but also toward its membership. USIBC sought to show its members that it was making connections with India's government so that U.S. firms would not lose out to French and Russian firms in nuclear reactor contracts with India.46"
"86","Fourth, in terms of shaping the technical details of congressional legislation, nonproliferation groups were more influential than was the India lobby. Some suggestions from arms control groups were incorporated into legislation. Overall, however, the administration was far more influential than arms control groups in shaping the details of the legislation. Administration officials explained to congressional staff that the administration's preferred language on a bill would have the same results as congressional language, and this influenced Congress to accept the administration's position on specific legislative items."
"87","Fifth, in the end, the technical details of legislation and many other aspects of the legislative process were primarily an insider game between the administration and Congress, rather than an outsider game that was pushed by outside lobby groups.47 The administration had the primary role in negotiating legislation with Congress, and, through its extensive activities discussed above, the India lobby reinforced the administration's efforts to persuade Congress to advance the nuclear agreement.            "
"88","Case studies that facilitate the in‐depth contextual understanding of an issue contribute to scholarship in several ways. Most important, they augment and correct limitations in existing discourse on a topic.48 In a similar manner, this case study fills a major gap in discourse about Indian American lobbying for the civilian nuclear agreement. Existing discourse (the numerous press articles and few scholarly pieces cited in this article) has documented the activities of Indian Americans on the nuclear agreement, but these writings do not comprehensively cover the lobbying effort. Further, many scholars miss the distinction between “Indian Americans” and “the India lobby” (the broader lobbying coalition that included but went much beyond Indian Americans). On a related note, they overstate the role of Indian Americans in the lobbying effort. This article clarifies that Indian Americans were only one component of a broader India lobby. Most significantly, this article has specified that this lobby had several components, that each undertook a range of activities, and that the degree of coordination between the components varied.            "
"89","The analysis in this article also offers insights into future Indian American lobbying initiatives. Here, it should be clarified that case studies are not entirely generalizable, and every case has unique aspects. This study has focused on lobbying for a high‐profile U.S. foreign policy initiative, and its main characteristics would be most likely to apply to other high‐profile policies, rather than to all cases of Indian American lobbying and to all U.S. policies toward India.49 Possible cases include initiatives to make India a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council; initiatives to strongly tilt U.S. policy toward India and away from Pakistan and China; and efforts to establish a U.S.–India free trade zone in the service sector. Some of the main unknowns in these cases would be the extent to which Indian Americans mobilize; the extent to which the advocacy coalition will draw from the strategic affairs, business, and other constituencies; the strength of the opposition; and changes in Indian American voting power, financial power, and organizational patterns. These factors would determine the extent to which the central features of the India lobby's 2005–2008 effort would apply to future cases.            "
"90","Beyond their explanatory richness, case studies enable scholars to test how well different theoretical frameworks apply to the case concerned.50 Along these lines, this article examined several mechanisms of ethnic group lobbying. It found that some did not apply to this leading case of Indian American lobbying, while others were relevant to a small to moderate degree. It showed that the mechanism of lobbying through a coalition made Indian American activism far more effective.         "
"91","Such an analysis has implications for additional debates in the ethnic group literature, including debates on ethnic groups and coalitions. While space limitations preclude a thorough examination of these issues, two points may be briefly mentioned."
"92","First, scholars offer competing perspectives on ties between ethnic groups and other constituencies such as business and foreign policy experts (these two constituencies have the most influence in the area of foreign policy), as well as on ethnic group ties with foreign governments.51 Some observers argue that ethnic groups are an important countervailing force to lobbying by business and foreign governments, because they offer alternative perspectives on an issue, whereas others note that ethnic groups ally with these constituencies. This case study reveals that the latter perspective is more applicable to Indian American lobbying, with some qualifications. Indian Americans allied strongly with American business and foreign policy experts to make their case. The lobby also interacted with the Indian government, but with some limitations. Thus, the Indian government was actively interested in Indian American mobilization on the civilian nuclear agreement.52 Also, the Indian embassy routinely informed Indian American groups and the Coalition for the Partnership with India about its position on congressional legislation; it did this in a manner similar to, but much less frequently than, the Bush administration. Still, Indian Americans and the Coalition did not extensively work with the lobbying firms hired by the Indian government. The efforts of the Indian government's lobbyists largely duplicated those of Indian Americans and American business.53"
"93","Second, the literature is divided on whether coalitions enhance or detract from the lobbying efforts of ethnic groups. One perspective is that coalitions can be detrimental because they reduce group autonomy and are subject to collective action problems. Another perspective is that coalitions enable each constituent to complement the activities of the other, and this increases the effectiveness of the lobbying effort.54 This case supports the latter perspective. It also reveals that partnering with other constituencies (in this case, business) helped overcome fissures within the ethnic group. As noted previously, because of professional rivalries, Indian American groups were hesitant to team with each other, but they were willing to ally with business and with the broader Coalition for the Partnership with India. This made their efforts far more effective than they would have been if each Indian American group had lobbied separately.         "
"94","Finally, this article offers a basis for further research on ethnic group lobbying. Its main points can be compared with additional studies that examine foreign policy lobbying by other ethnic groups.55 Such studies could identify the principal lobbying mechanisms applying to different ethnic groups. They could also examine whether there were special circumstances behind the coalition for the nuclear agreement with India, and whether any ethnic group lobby can successfully engage in a similar coalition‐building strategy.         "
"95","On this point, some unique circumstances and professional relationships brought together the three constituencies of the India lobby. The ties between Indian business and the Indian government on the one hand, and between Indian business and U.S. business on the other, facilitated interaction between India's government and U.S. business. In turn, India's government provided U.S. business with an incentive to advocate for the nuclear agreement; Indian government officials frequently asserted that as India's ties with the United States improved, American business would have greater investment opportunities in India. And U.S. business, through its professional lobbyists, established links with Indian American groups and with strategic affairs experts to form a broader Coalition for the Partnership with India. Different circumstances and relationships, and differences in the collective action problems and complementarities arising from coalition building, would explain the somewhat different composition and activities of other country lobbies in particular instances of foreign policy advocacy by these lobbies."
"96","To summarize, additional studies could identify the principal lobbying mechanisms, and the characteristics and composition of advocacy coalitions, relevant to other prominent cases of ethnic group lobbying. Such research would enable scholars to better compare and contrast mechanisms of influence across ethnic groups, and to better theorize the different ways in which different ethnic groups influence U.S. foreign policy.56"
