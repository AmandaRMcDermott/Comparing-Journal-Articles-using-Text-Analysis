"1","Do the words that policymakers use to talk about national security, and the way they deploy those words, matter for the actual practice of national security? The traditional response by American international relations scholars is either no—the material conditions of the international system drive security unmediated—or that discourses of national security objectively reflect the material security conditions in the international system. In this erudite and well‐argued book, Ronald R. Krebs argues otherwise: events do not speak for themselves, and national security policy fundamentally relies on practices of interpretation that manifest as national security narratives. Krebs makes his case through two primarily theoretical chapters and four empirical chapters divided into two parts with extensive methodological appendices, with attendant chapters exploring the implications of his findings."
"2","The core premise of the book is that humans use narratives to make sense of their world. Krebs distinguishes between two types of discourse, argument and storytelling/narrative. Argument takes place within the context of established or dominant narratives and the range of legitimacy that the dominant narrative establishes. Thus, argument relies on the priorities, understandings, and general principles established by the dominant narrative. Often, but not always, these take the form of cost–benefit analyses, with the factors informing assessments of cost and benefit established by the dominant narrative. If argument takes place within the scope of a dominant narrative, then storytelling is the rhetorical mode that gives rise to the dominant narrative. Whereas an argument seeks to establish and persuade others regarding the correct course of action, storytelling establishes the foundations for understanding the world, laying out a framework of causality and imparting structure or relations onto events in a disorderly world. Storytelling tells the audience what the world is, and argumentation tells them what to do about it."
"3","Krebs's central theoretical insight is that the mode of rhetoric used by security actors is crucial to understanding security policy outcomes, and this insight is the focus of the first section of the book. When a well‐established dominant narrative exists, security actors using storytelling discourses are unlikely to be successful, either because they will be delegitimized if their proffered story strays too far from the dominant narrative or because they are vulnerable to more finely focused and thus persuasive arguments. Krebs holds up Ronald Reagan's use of storytelling in the context of his desire to support the Contras in Nicaragua, and the failure of that policy, as an exemplar."
"4","Conversely, when a well‐established dominant narrative does not exist, policymakers need to turn to storytelling and shun argumentation. Because argumentation relies on an established narrative that imparts meaning and structure onto the world, when common belief or acceptance of that shared meaning waivers, the argument built on top of it fails. Thus, in times of narrative flux, policymakers need to turn to storytelling to chart a path forward. Here Krebs examines Franklin D. Roosevelt's early failure and later success in opposing Adolf Hitler in Europe. Interestingly, Krebs finds that while Roosevelt was eventually successful in establishing a new dominant narrative, he was also bound by it. Specifically, Roosevelt identified the Nazi regime, rather than Germans, as the enemy. When, in 1943, Roosevelt began to change his mind about collective punishment of the German public, he found himself constrained by the very narrative he was central to crafting."
"5","When do dominant narratives weaken? In the second part of the book, Krebs explores a counterintuitive answer to this question. Krebs argues that in situations of policy failure (Krebs examines the impacts of the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam), the dominant narrative is strengthened. Policy opponents, having argued within the bounds of the dominant narrative before the policy failure are rhetorically trapped, are unable to present an alternative narrative. Situations of policy success, conversely, provide political space to introduce new security narratives, although their success is by no means assured."
"6","Krebs has written an important and fascinating book that deserves widespread attention. Like all ambitious intellectual projects, the book is not without its frustrations. For example, Krebs's explanation regarding why policy success creates space for narrative change would have been much stronger had he drawn on securitization theory, which he nods to in his introduction but does not fully engage. Some implications of his approach seem in tension with his argumentation. For example, Krebs argues the success of the Cuban missile crisis gave John F. Kennedy the space to introduce a new contending security narrative. This, in turn, facilitated greater policy flexibility toward the Soviets and resulted in an easing of tensions that reached its apex under Richard Nixon's détente. But if the Cuban missile crisis was a success for Kennedy, it was undoubtedly a failure for Nikita Khrushchev—so why did it not result in a hardening of the Soviet position? It may be that there was a security narrative that enabled flexibility on the Soviet side—Krebs alludes to Khrushchev's secret speech denouncing Joseph Stalin—and thus would have been strengthened by happy coincidence. Even so, at the very least, it remains unclear how the possibility of narrative change in the United States interacted with security practices—and, by proxy, security narratives—in its primary Cold War interlocutor. The book raises this and many other questions, but that is the hallmark of an important contribution."
