"1","In writing the history of the proposal and ratification of the Bill of Rights, Carol Berkin made the eminently sensible decision to focus on James Madison. Were it not for Madison, who proposed and shepherded the Bill of Rights through the First Congress, it is unlikely that the Bill of Rights would have taken the form it did. Indeed, it is possible that it would not have happened. This is because hardcore supporters were too few to win majority votes, and opponents believed that the First Congress had more important things to do. Hence, the Bill of Rights can be explained only by way of Madison, who himself underwent a conversion of sorts. He was against the Bill of Rights before he was for it."
"2","In Berkin's presentation, Madison became a supporter of the Bill of Rights because he believed he could crush the anti‐Federalist opposition by co‐opting the one policy that united them. But Berkin says that Madison also changed his mind about the merits of the Bill of Rights in that he came to hold a “profound, and much broader understanding of a bill of rights,” namely, that “it might be able to directly shape—and regulate the behavior of the community itself” (p. 42). There is some tension in Berkin's presentation of these two objectives. In the epilogue, she concludes that historical development has “fulfilled James Madison's fervent hope that this ‘parchment barrier’ would benefit the civic and moral development of the nation” (p. 143). Yet in the introduction, Berkin writes, “Madison's Bill of Rights was thus more a political strategy than a statement of America's most cherished values” (p. 3)."
"3","It is true, of course, that both can be true. But in my view, the story of Madison and the Bill of Rights forces students of the period to ask whether the one can be disentangled from the other, or, similarly, if one better explains Madison's actions (I have published my view on Madison's alleged conversion experience elsewhere). In particular, Berkin's account would have benefited from a book that does not appear in her bibliography, Robert Goldwin's From Parchment to Power: How James Madison Used the Bill of Rights to Save the Constitution, which makes the case that Madison believed that a Bill of Rights would be useful as an educative text. Berkin might have found Goldwin's book had she consulted Colleen Sheehan's work on Madison, which is also missing from her bibliography.         "
"4","Perhaps it is fitting and proper that historians forget to consult works on the period written by political scientists. But what is lost is any sense of what was at stake in the two objectives she outlines. Berkin alludes to but does not explain how Madison's political objective of crushing the opposition was related to the prior objective of removing proposals to limit the powers of the new Congress (especially the powers to tax and to create a standing army) from the Bill of Rights. Likewise, Berkin does not offer the reader an explanation of why it might matter that Madison flirted with the idea that the Bill of Rights could elevate and improve the opinions of the citizenry."
"5","But these are scholarly quibbles, and Berkin's audience is not an academic one. Rather, she has written an accessible and breezy history for readers who are unfamiliar with the topic. Also deserving mention is the inclusion of a handy biographical dictionary of the members of the First Congress, a resource that I will certainly use again and again."
