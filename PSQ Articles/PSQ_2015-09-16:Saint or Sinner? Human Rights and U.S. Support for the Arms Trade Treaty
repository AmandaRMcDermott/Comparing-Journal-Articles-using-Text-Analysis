"1","THE UNITED STATES IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST conventional arms exporter and sets what many consider the “gold standard” for national arms export policy. The U.S. defense industry also benefits from the world's largest defense budget, making it much less dependent on exports than companies elsewhere. As a result, the costs of multilateral arms export controls should be lower for the United States than for other countries. Even so, observers were not surprised to see the United States cast the sole no vote in the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 2006 to initiate the process to create an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and again in 2008 to continue the process. The ATT was just one of many multilateral initiatives it shunned during the same period and was by no means the first time it had resisted multilateral arms export controls. The United States has long viewed conventional arms as a special tool to be used in the service of its foreign policy goals. What was more surprising, therefore, was its October 2009 decision to change course and support the ATT."
"2","Opened for signature in 2013, the ATT sets legally binding global criteria to limit small and major conventional arms transfers to human rights violators and conflict zones. The transition to such humanitarian or “responsible” arms export controls began in the 1990s, even as defense companies were faced with tightened post–Cold War defense budgets and a dramatic downturn in global demand. Yet as companies globalized production and sought new export markets, the absence of global standards to regulate conventional arms transfers alarmed many states, non‐governmental organizations (NGOs), and multilateral organizations. As stringent as any one state's arms export controls may be, without common standards, ATT supporters argued, importers engaged in repressive practices can simply acquire weapons from other, less scrupulous countries. Numerous agreements now commit states to collectively restricting arms transfers to countries engaged in severe human rights violations.1 In addition to the ATT, the European Union (EU), Wassenaar Arrangement, and Organization for Security and Co‐operation in Europe all provide export guidelines for their members. Among democratic exporters in particular, support for such “responsible” export standards has become nearly universal.         "
"3","This article seeks to explain the change in the U.S. position on the ATT, a policy shift that is both puzzling and important. U.S. opposition to the ATT fits with a broader trend of resisting multilateral cooperation on conventional arms issues over time and across presidential administrations. What changed? As I will show, U.S. support cannot be explained as a codification of existing practice, and domestic actors have not actively pushed for the United States to sign on to the ATT. What, then, explains U.S. support? Because the United States is the world's largest arms exporter, its policy and practice have profound consequences for the international acceptance, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the new Arms Trade Treaty. A treaty without the United States leaves almost one‐third of major conventional arms transfers worldwide outside of its jurisdiction. In addition, some skeptical states are hesitant to sign in the absence of U.S. support. Even as the U.S. Congress is unlikely to ratify the ATT in the foreseeable future, U.S. support has moved negotiations forward, brought with it the support of other important exporters such as Israel, and raised the costs for others to oppose it."
"4","I begin by tracing the evolution of U.S. arms export policy, highlighting a long‐standing resistance to multilateralism in order to maintain flexibility to use arms exports as a political tool. After outlining possible explanations for the U.S. policy shift, I use a quantitative analysis to show that U.S. conventional arms exports in practice have been largely inattentive to recipients' human rights records over time. This calls into question explanations for ATT support that rely on a close match between policy and practice. I then use a qualitative study to show that the Barack Obama administration's ATT policy reversal reflects changes in its strategic attitude toward multilateralism. Rather than a nod to public pressures at home, I argue that U.S. support for the ATT was part of the Obama administration's early bid to improve the United States' image abroad through multilateral reengagement. With high export standards already on the books, no formal enforcement built into the ATT, and congressional opposition to ratification, the United States would not have to sacrifice its arms export flexibility in exchange for ATT support. Whether the ATT will manage to address problems linked to conventional arms proliferation will therefore depend on a deeper U.S. commitment to the initiative and changes in practice by all top conventional arms exporters."
"5","Until recently, multilateralism was not a concept that could easily be associated with conventional arms control. For H.C. Engelbrecht and F.C. Hanighen, “the basic problem of international control of the arms makers [is] that few governments, if any, really want international supervision of the traffic in war materials.”2 States have long considered major conventional arms transfers instruments of foreign policy, reflecting and supporting their broader priorities. During the Cold War, the superpowers transferred weapons to allies and desired allies to express their friendship and support—and to tip the balance of power in their favor. After the Cold War, states continued to use conventional arms sales as a tool of foreign and economic policy to support valued relationships, foreign policy priorities, and employment at home. As a result, states have fiercely resisted ceding power to multilateral institutions to regulate their arms trade. Instead, they have protected their right to determine their arms trade partners as a matter of international sovereignty and the right to self‐defense, as recognized by the UN Charter.         "
"6","It has only been since the mid‐1990s that (some) arms‐exporting states have become more willing to accept humanitarian guidelines for the conduct of their arms trade. This has come about as a result of the international community turning its attention to civil and ethnic conflict at the end of the Cold War, the success of the Ottawa anti‐personnel landmine treaty, and the growing importance of human security in policy circles.3 In response, the EU, Wassenaar Arrangement, and Organization for Security and Co‐operation in Europe have established multilateral arms export guidelines for their members. In 2006, the UN General Assembly voted 153–1 (the United States) to begin a formal process to create an ATT. Most major democratic supplier states announced their support in the lead‐up to the vote, not wanting to diverge from new international expectations for “good” arms trade policy.4"
"7","The United States has followed its own path on the issue of humanitarian arms control. It has set stringent national controls but opposed UN initiatives until late 2009. U.S. opposition held up consensus‐based processes and generated concerns about the effectiveness and legitimacy of an ATT without support from the world's largest arms exporter. In addition, it drew attention away from skeptical, fence‐sitting states such as Russia, China, and Israel and protected them from pressures to support the initiative. U.S. support, in contrast, lent the ATT perceptions of greater legitimacy and possible efficacy and brought new supporters on board. It also moved the process forward with negotiations, and in 2013, the new treaty passed the General Assembly 154–3 (Iran, North Korea, and Syria). U.S. support has thus been critical for the successful creation of the final ATT. This section reviews U.S. national and multilateral arms export policies over time. It highlights the recent place of human rights in U.S. national policy and demonstrates a historic reluctance to multilateral commitments that reaches far beyond the ATT and the George W. Bush administration."
"8","The United States' arms export control system is often described as the “gold standard.”5 Its arms export accountability and transparency—at least on paper—have been unrivaled by other major exporters since the 1970s,6 and experts note that its policies are largely consistent with ATT principles.7 Congress first legislated on human rights and military assistance in 1973 as part of the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act. That law stated that military aid may not be provided—except under extraordinary circumstances—“to any country, the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.”8 In 1974, the Nelson‐Bingham Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act gave Congress the unprecedented power to block arms sales exceeding $25 million. However, arms transfers have also been a major instrument of superpower relations with the developing world, and executives have sought flexibility in the interpretation and implementation of congressional restrictions.9 The Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford administrations openly avoided implementation of the 1973 law in the interest of national security10 and followed the Nixon Doctrine, sending arms to friendly countries in place of U.S. boots on the ground. President Ford signed the 1976 Arms Export Control Act only after an annual arms ceiling was removed and language regarding human rights diluted.11"
"9","U.S. policy has only inconsistently included human rights violations as cause to restrict arms transfers beyond military assistance since the late 1970s. Security interests have typically prevailed across presidential administrations whatever their ideological orientation. The Jimmy Carter administration introduced more restrictive measures in response to domestic backlash against the perceived indiscriminate and damaging use of arms as a tool of foreign policy under Nixon and Ford. Carter's Presidential Directive (PD) 13 set guidelines intended to limit conventional weapons proliferation and stated “that human rights violations would be an important consideration” in arms export decision making.12 Nevertheless, case‐by‐case exemptions for sales to “indispensable” nations were commonplace,13 and bureaucratic infighting and disagreements over transfers to “critical regions” made implementation virtually impossible.14 Set against campaign promises and “the overblown rhetoric of early administration statements,” PD‐13 was considered a failure from the start and dismissed by the Ronald Reagan administration.15"
"10","Human rights did not come back into U.S. arms export policy until 1995. Bill Clinton's Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 34 laid out criteria for arms transfer decision making, including recipient human rights.16 However, it gave equal weight to other political and economic considerations, including support for U.S. allies and industry.17 Indeed, Janne Nolan argues that, in practice, the Clinton administration was relatively permissive and, “with modest exceptions . . . consistent with the policies crafted during the preceding twelve years of Republican leadership.”18 Thus, even as the Clinton administration reintroduced human rights to export criteria, its arms export decisions—just as under the Carter administration—continued to serve U.S. security and economic interests that often trumped humanitarian concerns.            "
"11","PDD‐34 remained in place until January 2014. Its replacement, the Obama administration's Presidential Policy Directive 27, similarly seeks to ensure “that arms transfers do not contribute to human rights violations or violations of international humanitarian law,” while also meeting U.S. security and economic interests.19 Beyond presidential policy, U.S. arms transfer laws have been designed to “ensure that U.S. weapons transfers do not undermine regional and global security and stability, weaken democratic ideals, support military coups, escalate arms races, exacerbate ongoing conflicts, or cause regional arms buildups, and are not used to commit human rights abuses.”20 Yet although national export standards have been high relative to other states, arms exports have an established place in the toolbox of broader U.S. foreign policy. The long‐standing desire for foreign policy flexibility has also been accompanied by concerns about supporting the U.S. defense industry and employment, especially in the wake of the post–Cold War defense market downturn.            "
"12","Efforts to establish multilateral conventional arms controls have been few and far between and avoided addressing human rights until the 1990s. Indeed, the expectation that major exporters will resist external restrictions (especially legally binding ones) on their arms trade is commonplace.21 The United States has generally joined in this wariness of multilateral controls. U.S. opposition to the 1919 St. Germain Convention for the Control of the Trade in Arms and Ammunition stemmed in part from U.S. reluctance to grant powers supervising the international arms trade to the League of Nations and helped ensure the convention's failure. The United States also worried that the convention's ban on sales to nonsignatories could harm its arms industry and interfere with its Latin American interests.22 The 1925 Geneva Arms Traffic Convention was therefore tailored to address U.S. concerns. Rather than asking states to give up authority to multilateral institutions, it recognized state control over arms exports and took any reporting requirements off the table entirely. Even so, the United States did not ratify until 1935 as a political move in response to popular opposition to the defense industry at the time.23"
"13","Even the two key instances in which the United States spearheaded multilateral arms export control initiatives were undermined by its own actions. First, in 1977, the Carter administration instigated the Conventional Arms Transfers talks with the Soviet Union. The goal was to limit transfers to unstable regions, but the talks ended in stalemate a year later. Although the United States launched the initiative, the talks failed to overcome not only the superpowers' geopolitical interests but also U.S. bureaucratic and political interests.24 Second, in 1991, the George H.W. Bush administration took the lead in discussing restrictions on arms transfers to the Middle East among the Permanent Five members of the UN Security Council.25 The U.S. agenda was more limited than the global restrictions initially proposed by Canada. Even so, disagreement surfaced after the third round of talks in May 1992, and following a Chinese boycott in response to U.S. and French arms sales to Taiwan in September 1992, the talks formally collapsed.26 Even in its efforts to promote multilateral conventional arms export controls, U.S. interests—security, political, economic, and institutional—have thus undermined them.            "
"14","More recently, the 2001 UN Small Arms Conference concluded the politically binding Programme of Action coordinating state‐level action to curb the illegal small arms trade. However, it could not produce the consensus necessary for a legally binding document regulating state‐sanctioned (that is, legal) small arms sales that some states and NGOs wanted. This was in large part due to U.S. opposition. Yet explaining the U.S. position must go beyond the close National Rifle Association (NRA) connections of a Republican administration that are often cited:27 a Republican Congress passed legislation in 1999 requiring the president to negotiate an International Arms Sales Code of Conduct that would include human rights criteria. But the Clinton administration was generally wary of multilateral commitments that might undermine U.S. security interests and did not take this beyond a joint declaration with the EU in 2000. Indeed, it was clear from the beginning of preparatory meetings for the 2001 conference that the Clinton administration “was not prepared to accept any legally binding international agreement constraining legitimate weapons trade . . . by U.S. nationals.”28 Thus, although U.S. opposition was most vocal and visible with the ATT during the George W. Bush administration, U.S. resistance to multilateral arms export controls has crossed presidencies. The anomaly is therefore not U.S. opposition to the ATT but rather the Obama administration's support for it.            "
"15","The place of multilateralism in U.S. foreign policy generates debate among scholars.29 But even for those who highlight long‐term trends in American multilateral engagement, cooperation is typically on U.S. terms. Certainly, the ATT's lack of regulations for transfers to non‐state actors reflects U.S. preferences, but it is only by way of these specific demands in the context of broader ATT acceptance that the United States has dictated its terms. Barring a dramatic change in preferences, it seems unlikely that the United States (or any major arms‐exporting state) would have independently sought any legally binding multilateral arms export controls at all. Moreover, outside of the arms trade issue, David Forsythe observes continuity between the Bush and Obama administrations on human rights policy,30 while David Skidmore questions the Obama administration's commitment to multilateralism more generally.31"
"16","What, then, explains the U.S. choice for multilateralism in the case of the ATT? I will argue that U.S. ATT support was part of a broader policy shift toward multilateralism that the Obama administration made during its first year in an effort to repair the United States' reputation with the diplomatic community. Although the United States was less tied to international institutions to define its foreign policy identity and priorities, U.S. leaders saw a need to rebuild its diminished soft power following heavy criticism of the Bush administration's unilateralism. U.S. support for the ATT was therefore intended as one signal among others to international audiences of a more cooperative approach to U.S. foreign policy. Although the Obama administration's ideological and electoral distance from the NRA made this move somewhat less difficult than it might have been for a John McCain administration, both sides voiced a general need for multilateral reengagement during the 2008 election. Even so, a strategic commitment to multilateralism may stop short of changing U.S. arms transfers in line with ATT criteria in practice, at least in the short term."
"17","I use multiple methods to examine the reputation repair argument and alternative explanations for U.S. support. First, quantitative analyses help assess whether a shift in U.S. arms export practice precedes or accompanies its shift in ATT policy. A better understanding of U.S. practice over time can help reveal or rule out macro‐level explanations for U.S. policy. Absent the promise of relative material gain, realists expect states to sign on to treaties that codify existing practice, making only commitments that are essentially costless.32 Similarly, some normative perspectives argue that states are more likely to commit to new international norms that are similar to existing domestic norms and values.33 In both cases, U.S. arms export practice should reflect concern for recipient human rights prior to its ATT commitment. In contrast, if U.S. practice changes after its ATT support, commitment may be motivated by normative obligation34 or the prospect of future material gain from a formal cooperative arrangement.35 However, if U.S. practice fails to reflect the norms and obligations connected to its policy shift, then other explanations may be required.         "
"18","Second, the case study examines more specific domestic and international incentives for changes in U.S. policy. In domestic politics, either narrow defense industrial interests with access to the state or broader public opinion may prompt ATT support.36 I therefore seek evidence of industry lobbying or public pressure as a causal force in U.S. ATT policymaking. In international politics, changing strategic concerns may explain changes in U.S. policy. In the early 2000s, perceptions of post–September 11 security needs and the utility of arms transfers in meeting those needs—support for allies in strategic regions, for example—may dominate U.S. policymaking. In the late 2000s, in contrast, international criticism and perceptions of higher costs of interstate cooperation and/or unilateralism may motivate the need for U.S. reputation repair. Rather than an internalized sense of normative obligation, U.S. norm support in this scenario is a strategic response to its international environment.         "
"19","Unraveling patterns in U.S. arms transfer practice serves as a useful first cut for weighing explanations for U.S. arms transfer policy. A match between policy and practice might suggest that ATT support seeks to codify U.S. practice in international law or reflects U.S. normative obligations. Scholars such as Shannon Lindsey Blanton and Denise Garcia, for example, argue that human rights and moral obligation have taken a prominent place in the post–Cold War arms trade.37 Blanton in particular finds that recipient human rights began to play an important role in U.S. arms exports policy and practice in the 1990s.38 This anticipates a negative relationship between U.S. arms exports and “bad” recipient human rights since the 1990s.         "
"20","However, other studies of U.S. arms exports suggest that concern for recipient human rights may be weak in practice. Scholars have found that the Carter administration frequently waived human rights criteria in order to supply friends and allies in the interest of maintaining U.S. security and the balance of power.39 The post–Cold War buyers' market also encouraged less restrictive sales, in particular for customers with the ability to pay, regardless of their human rights records.40 After September 11, from Bush to Obama, U.S. arms transfers to Central Asia and the Middle East often set aside human rights to support allies in the war on terror and to counter regional threats.41 These studies question the causal influence of moral obligation in U.S. policy and highlight security and economic interests as a source of more liberal policies. This perspective expects a positive or null relationship between U.S. arms exports and poor recipient human rights not only during the Cold War but also since the 1990s.         "
"21","Using a data set of U.S. small and major conventional arms transfers to 189 potential importing states, I examine the relationship between U.S. arms transfers and recipient human rights from 1981 to 2010. Small and major conventional arms have historically been treated separately in international and domestic politics—even if formal export policies were the same—until the ATT initiative brought them formally together in 2006. For small arms transfers (SALW), I code a dichotomous variable based on records compiled by the Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms (NISAT).42 NISAT uses the UN definition of SALW: small arms are “those weapons designed for personal use,” and light weapons are “those designed for use by several persons serving as a crew,” such as revolvers, machine guns, rifles, and ammunition and explosives.43 A value of 0 indicates no record of an SALW transfer between the United States and a recipient state in a particular year; a value of 1 indicates a record of an SALW transfer between the United States and a recipient state in a particular year. NISAT records must be coded as dichotomous because they do not consistently report the quantity or value of transfers. Moreover, multiple reports of a single transfer may exist but cannot be identified as repeat submissions with any certainty. As a result, NISAT can indicate whether a transfer took place but not the consistent quantity of goods or the price paid.            "
"22","For major conventional arms transfers (MCW), I use data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which give a continuous, standardized dollar figure measuring the quantity and quality of actual deliveries in a given year based on a wide range of public sources.44 SIPRI defines major conventional arms as large weapons with a military purpose, including one of nine categories: aircraft, armored vehicles, artillery, sensors, air defense systems, missiles, ships, engines, or an “other” fulfilling certain qualifications.45 Because transfers can include gifts or aid, as well as sales, by way of a multitude of financing methods including barter, discounts, credit, and cash, the standardized SIPRI value is substantially more useful in making cross‐national comparisons of transfers from year to year.            "
"23","Table 1 summarizes the independent variables. The independent variable of interest is recipients' human rights records, for which I use the Political Terror Scale (PTS).46 PTS codes five levels of violations of physical integrity rights based on annual reports from the U.S. Department of State and Amnesty International. I use the PTS variable based on State Department reports for obvious reasons and break down each level into dummy variables. The very best human rights scores serve as the reference category in the analysis. Because my goal is to understand the relationship between U.S. arms exports and human rights, I limit the control variables in each model to those with a potentially confounding effect (that is, those that have a potential relationship between both U.S. arms exports and recipient human rights). Finally, I lag the independent variables one year to allow time for information about conditions in recipient states to reach U.S. decision makers and to allow them to modify their behavior, if they wish.47"
"24","I use ordinary least squares regression with the continuous MCW variable and logistic regression with the dichotomous SALW variable and panel‐corrected standard errors. Panel‐corrected standard errors must be used in order to avoid an understatement of errors due to the high number of error parameters involved in panel data.48 I use a basic single‐stage model, as it is difficult to argue that variables affecting recipient selection do not also affect the amount of goods they receive. In contrast, the accurate use of a two‐stage Heckman model49 requires that at least one independent variable relevant to the selection stage can be excluded from the amount stage.50 Finally, I run the models for three different time periods, for which U.S. policy and existing studies suggest potentially different relationships between arms exports and human rights: (1) Cold War, 1981–1990; (2) post–Cold War, 1991–2001; and (3) post–September 11, 2002–2010.            "
"25","A “saintly” United States following humanitarian arms export policies should reveal significantly negative coefficients for poor human rights in the years following the Cold War. Instead, Table 2 reports insignificant results for the relationship between recipient human rights and U.S. arms transfers (shaded in Table 2), regardless of weapon type or time period. For the most part, recipient human rights are largely a non‐issue for U.S. arms transfers in practice. Significant results (in bold type) only emerge with MCW transfers in the post–Cold War years. However, the positive coefficients indicate that “good,” “average,” and “bad” human rights all have a stronger positive influence on U.S. major conventional weapons transfers than “very good” human rights (the reference category). It is only in removing gross domestic product (GDP) per capita from the model that “very bad” human rights are significantly negative for small arms (after 1990). Similarly, removing GDP per capita from the MCW model generates significant negative results for “bad” and “very bad” human rights across all time periods. In other words, when not controlling for their wealth, recipients with poor human rights receive, on average, fewer conventional arms than the best human rights performers. However, this may have more to do with recipients' resources to acquire arms than a reflection of U.S. concern for their human rights.            "
"26","These results undermine expectations that U.S. support for the ATT was predicated on either the low cost of codifying existing practice or a sense of normative obligation. By showing a lack of attention to recipient human rights, the statistical findings suggest that preexisting U.S. arms export practice neither reflects ATT criteria nor serves as a consistent tool of human rights promotion. As a result, future U.S. ATT compliance could limit U.S. flexibility with its arms export decision making. More restrictive practices could also impose costs on the defense sector and related interest groups. The statistical analysis thus eliminates potential explanations and bolsters the puzzle about U.S. ATT support."
"27","U.S. security interests have long been thought to override concerns for human rights in arms export decision making, even when U.S. national policy has—on paper—articulated the importance of human rights. This provides some insight into initial U.S. opposition to the ATT initiative. Indeed, being tied to inflexible multilateral standards may be a costly move for a state with global security commitments. If the United States continues to prioritize arms trade flexibility, what explains its ATT support after October 2009? This section investigates the economic and political pressures for the United States to change its position in favor of the ATT."
"28","Economic incentives are frequently cited as the reason less restrictive exporters avoid multilateral controls and more restrictive exporters support them. For example, officials in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom (all top‐five MCW exporters until 2013, according to SIPRI) commonly acknowledge that their support for the ATT stems partly from their wish to “level the playing field” for their national defense industries after adopting the EU Code of Conduct for Arms Exports in 1998.51 For these states, concerns for industry competitiveness in a tight global arms market have not disappeared amid discussions of humanitarian arms export controls. Unless all exporters are subject to humanitarian controls, from this point of view, those “responsible” states that do control for recipients' human rights records will lose out. Yet the United States long refused global export standards despite high‐level national export control policies, not because of low‐level controls.            "
"29","The United States has retained a large portion of international defense markets over time, placing it in a comparatively healthy position despite its restrictive policies on paper. According to SIPRI, it is the world's top supplier of major conventional weapons, a position it overtook from the Soviet Union in 1990 and has held ever since. Figure 1 shows total global and U.S. major conventional arms export values from 1981 to 2010. Although global values peaked in 1982 and have declined over time, U.S. exports have been more consistent. Even in the early 1990s—when the world market was otherwise suffering—U.S. exports held their own. In particular, U.S. high‐tech weaponry retained and possibly increased demand after the 1991 Gulf War. While the value of U.S. major conventional arms exports did drop in the early 2000s, it has generally crept upward since 2002. Moreover, regardless of these slight shifts in value, the U.S. maintained its dominant exporter position throughout this period.            "
"30","The value of U.S. major conventional weapons exports thus seems unconnected to the timing and content of U.S. ATT policy. Indeed, despite its dominant position at the top of the global arms trade since the 1990s, the United States has been more reluctant to support multilateral restrictions than its more export‐dependent European competitors. The “level playing field” argument so appealing to European industry has not resonated strongly among U.S. firms, despite being faced with “one of the most complex and far‐reaching policy apparatuses for reviewing and regulating arms sales.”52 Although pro‐control NGOs had reached out to cooperate on ATT advocacy, the U.S. defense industry was “not really receptive.”53 It has refrained from coming out either in support of or opposition to multilateral export standards. As a result, it is difficult to attach a causal role to U.S. economic interests in this case.            "
"31","Rather than globalizing U.S. policies, industry has focused on lifting domestic restrictions with specific allied arms producers (such as Canada and the United Kingdom).54 In part, this could be because only U.S. industry has a market at home to support itself “without incurring prohibitive costs or a drastic decline of quality” or relying on exports to survive.55 Traditionally, U.S. firms produced solely for the U.S. government, which often gives preference to U.S. companies and actively promotes their products abroad.56 Rapid restructuring, a larger domestic market, and a wider foreign customer base also meant that U.S. industry fared better than defense industries elsewhere in the post–Cold War era. Although arms exports were briefly emphasized as a political issue in the mid‐1990s, “many of the [U.S.] companies that have chosen to remain in the defense business now find themselves in a monopoly or near‐monopoly position” with rising profits.57 Yet the defense industry's post–September 11 boom years were also when the United States most strongly resisted multilateral export controls. Contrary to arguments focused on economic or industrial incentives, U.S. ATT support came in 2009, amid defense market downturns resulting from the global financial crisis and the “excessively expensive” high‐end technical nature of U.S. products.58"
"32","Other domestic pressures may also influence U.S. policy choices. Although the mass public is often described as detached from foreign policy decisions,59 literature on the “NGO‐ization” of politics suggests that, with the right strategies, security issues can be popularized.60 In the case of small arms control and the ATT, pro‐control NGOs hoped that the popular success of the landmine treaty could be replicated for the conventional arms trade more broadly.61 Even so, in the United States and elsewhere, public attention to humanitarian arms export controls has been difficult to generate. One U.S. expert described U.S. public opinion on the ATT as “a blank”; another referred to the issue as a “really hard sell in general.”62"
"33","Arms export controls are a highly complex and bureaucratic topic, understood by specialists and a few officials. Moreover, unlike anti‐personnel landmines, conventional arms are a broad category of weapon that serve as basic military tools and are often legally owned by private civilians, especially in the United States. As a result, pro‐control NGO campaigns around the world have had trouble making their more nuanced message—to regulate arms exports according to certain criteria—resonate with the same ease as the landmine campaign, which called for a straightforward ban on production, exports, and imports.63 This does not mean that the American public is opposed to multilateral arms export controls. In fact, polls have found that, when asked, 57 percent to 60 percent of Americans support international arms trade regulations.64 Even so, it has not been a relevant political issue since the Carter administration. Pro‐control NGOs have therefore not invested their limited resources in convincing the public or politicians and have often taken a reactive rather than a proactive role in what policy debate there has been. Initially, efforts seemed futile against what was seen as an obstinate George W. Bush administration.65 Later, groups focused on informing members of Congress about the ATT but lagged behind NRA lobbying. As a result, pro‐ATT domestic pressures have largely been absent or weak in U.S. politics.            "
"34","Only one segment of the U.S. public was actively mobilized to express a strong preference on the ATT: the NRA membership vocally opposed to it. The NRA has argued that ATT provisions are targeted at eliminating members' guns. NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre refers to UN processes as a concerted effort “to strip the Second Amendment from our Constitution” and “take guns away from every law‐abiding citizen in the world.”66 Because of the Republican Party's often close relationship with the NRA, the Bush administration's ATT opposition played well with this constituency. But the UN has explicitly kept civilian gun possession off the table, in large part to keep the United States involved in discussions. Instead, Aaron Karp argues that the NRA position on UN initiatives is more practical than ideological, using “the UN process as a whipping‐boy” to feed into the distaste of “extreme supporters” to “anything connected to the UN.” 67 LaPierre, for example, notes that the NRA used the issue in the 2000 election to rally support around its preferred candidates and to solicit additional funds from its members.68"
"35","Many observers of the UN small arms meetings argue that U.S. opposition to legally binding export controls can be traced back to the NRA, which was given all three NGO spots on the U.S. delegation.69 Yet the ATT explicitly recognizes states' rights to set their own laws and policies about civilian ownership, perhaps making the NRA argument a convenient justification rather than a cause of U.S. opposition. Certainly, it seems unlikely that the Obama administration could win support from the core NRA constituency under any circumstances, freeing it to follow other policies at the UN. Nevertheless, it did not want to conclude ATT negotiations in July 2012 during the lead‐up to the November elections out of concern for Democratic candidates facing tight elections. Even here, however, NRA activity cannot explain the U.S. decision to support the ATT. Lacking pressures from other domestic groups or public opinion in favor of the ATT, it is necessary to look elsewhere to understand U.S. policy.            "
"36","Rather than a simple story about NRA influence, U.S. opposition and later support reflect its changing strategic interest in cultivating its international reputation for multilateralism and cooperation. The George W. Bush administration had a deep aversion to certain types of multilateralism traditionally linked to international treaties70 and less concern for U.S. reputation attached to international institutions and multilateral cooperation. For the arms trade, this meant ATT opposition rooted in preferences for foreign policy flexibility to use arms exports as a political tool.71 Yet, as I have already argued, although the Bush administration's opposition to multilateralism was perhaps more aggressive than that of previous administrations, the United States has over time consistently resisted multilateral arms export restrictions. While stringent national export controls may at first glance suggest that ATT support would be an easy commitment for the United States, understanding ATT opposition as aversion to multilateralism resolves the contradiction between its stringent national controls and its multilateral policy. But this still does not explain U.S. ATT support beginning in October 2009.            "
"37","I argue that U.S. policy changes in favor of multilateral arms export controls served as part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to repair the United States' reputation abroad, especially among allies and friendly states in Europe, Latin America, and Africa. Vocal opposition to the ATT during the George W. Bush administration, along with other high‐profile rejections of multilateralism, had built a negative reputation for unilateralism, with costs to U.S. legitimacy and soft power in world politics. Staunch U.S. opposition at the UN small arms meetings in 2001 and 2006 blocked the consensus needed to negotiate a legally binding treaty with multilateral criteria governing state‐sanctioned arms transfers. Instead, the politically binding Programme of Action was limited to national‐ and regional‐level action to curb the illicit small arms trade, and the United States was left with an “obstructionist” reputation among diplomats.72 According to pro‐control NGOs, the United States was “seen as the bad guy by a lot of states,” with an “arrogant” attitude, “no interest in abiding by the rules,” and an inability to “play well with others.”73 Other skeptical states avoided aligning their own position with U.S. policy, not wanting to pay the reputational costs of being on the “wrong side” of a popular UN initiative.            "
"38","A broad reputation for “good international citizenship” in contemporary world politics is often thought to require an active commitment by states to human rights, participation in international institutions, and other collective goods.74 Hardline U.S. opposition to multilateral conventional arms control went deeply against these international expectations, linked clearly to arms control with the popular Ottawa landmine treaty.75 Less tied to international institutions and international law to define its role in world politics, this is not unusual: the United States has consistently shown a “lack of consideration for the majority” over time.76 Studies report that international perceptions of the Bush administration's unilateralism and disregard for international norms and institutions particularly discredited U.S. policies and damaged U.S. reputation.77 Unlike other major arms‐exporting states that publicly supported the ATT out of concern for their reputations as “good international citizens,”78 reputational concerns thus do not generate U.S. ATT support in the early 2000s, with U.S. reputation abroad taking a hit as a result.            "
"39","Yet a good reputation can be a valuable asset for a superpower such as the United States to help cultivate its soft power, assuage fears of the international community, and promote a stable, rule‐bound international order in line with its preferences.79 Domestic concerns about the United States' image abroad and the decline of its world standing were palpable themes already in the 2008 presidential campaign, with both candidates vowing to make improvements.80 The Obama administration entered its first year in office by making a concerted effort to engage in reputation repair, with tangible results for public approval ratings on U.S. foreign policy among key European allies in particular.81 In addition to high‐profile international speeches, renewed engagement with U.S. adversaries, and outreach to foreign leaders and publics through the White House Global Engagement Directive and other efforts, the administration publicly adopted positions on popular international initiatives. Certainly, the United States has engaged in “public diplomacy” across administrations, but its emphasis in the early Obama administration—an explicit response to domestic and foreign opinion about the U.S. international image—was stronger and suited to meet its initial instrumental policy goals (albeit perhaps constrained in practice and falling short of the expectations of many in the longer term82).            "
"40","It was in this context that the Obama administration announced its support for the ATT process83 in October 2009. Even as it has pursued arms exports to accompany its foreign policy interests, its ATT support signals to the diplomatic community a new U.S. attitude toward its foreign policy that reflects a concern for multilateralism and an acknowledgment of a shift in arms control norms. In a similar move in April of that year, the Obama administration also proposed (without success, unsurprisingly) that the Senate ratify the Inter‐American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking of Firearms. ATT support was not targeted at domestic audiences; indeed, it only aroused the ire of NRA supporters and received very little attention at home otherwise. However, the move contributed to broader U.S. reputation repair efforts, which have been generally met with widespread domestic support.            "
"41","The reaction has been cautious but positive. Although concerns persisted that the United States would lean on consensus to derail treaty negotiations, its support was met with enthusiasm and relief. British foreign minister David Miliband greeted Clinton's announcement stating, “For many years we have sought an active U.S. partner in the drive for a strong Arms Trade Treaty. Now for the first time, we have one.”84 French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner publicly expressed France's “delight” in the new U.S. position to “[rejoin] the 145 nations already in favor of the ATT.”85 Lead NGOs Amnesty and Oxfam International declared that it “[showed] that the Obama administration is serious about reducing the negative effects caused by the uncontrolled trade in conventional weapons.”86 The U.S. signature to the treaty in September 2013, too, was welcomed by diplomats, experts, and advocates, who recognized its “critical and helpful role” in negotiations after 2009.87"
"42","In this way, the U.S. ATT policy reversal served a broader policy strategy to signal a break with the past and set a new tone for U.S. foreign policy among international audiences. Such strategic motives in the present do not preclude the possibility of norm internalization in the future. However, combined with the statistical findings, they do suggest that U.S. ATT support has not been born out of a deep commitment to enacting the treaty provisions and the norms they articulate. Behind the scenes, many long‐standing concerns with multilateral arms trade policy have remained. The U.S. delegation was reluctant to adopt more binding language in the treaty text in the lead‐up to and during the July 2012 negotiations and postponed completion until after the 2012 elections. Indeed, ATT support brought no domestic gains (and upset certain U.S. constituencies already opposed to Obama). Rather, U.S. support was made on behalf of the Obama administration's multilateral reengagement strategy to repair the United States' reputation abroad."
"43","Over time, U.S. opposition to multilateral export controls has stemmed from a desire to preserve the flexibility to use arms transfers to support other foreign policy priorities. This desire has not gone away with U.S. support for the ATT. Although the United States has what is often considered the “gold standard” of national arms export control policies and has included human rights in those policies since the mid‐1990s, its implementation of those provisions is inconsistent at best. Conventional arms transfers may serve U.S. political or economic goals, but human rights promotion often comes up short. U.S. ATT support neither matches its existing export practice nor brings with it any discernable material gain. Instead, it has been part of a more instrumental form of multilateralism, enacted early in the Obama administration's first term in the interest of U.S. reputation repair, seeking to cater to international expectations for “appropriate behavior” by a democratic power."
"44","This gap between arms export policy and practice is not unique to the United States. It is also evident among major democratic exporters, which have also supported shared “responsible” export standards.88 Changes in global arms trade practices may therefore be lukewarm. Without functional enforcement mechanisms, the ability of the ATT to produce the material incentives to change arms export behavior will be difficult. For the United States, this problem may be less relevant. The Senate is unlikely to ratify the treaty, given widespread NRA‐generated opposition89 and the general state of contemporary congressional politics. Yet if U.S. national laws already come up short in pushing the United States to prioritize recipient human rights in its arms export decisions, then the value of ATT ratification—like the U.S. signature without ratification—may be largely symbolic in any case.         "
"45","The sources of congressional inaction on this issue are widely recognized to be domestic. Nevertheless, the consequences will reach far beyond U.S. borders. The absence of formal U.S. participation could broadly undermine the ATT: not only would the world's largest arms exporter not be bound by its provisions, but other states may also hesitate to ratify or come into compliance. International pressure on Russia and China—currently the second‐ and fifth‐largest arms exporters, respectively—to come on board will hold little weight, in turn providing additional ammunition to an already intransigent Congress. Absent U.S. ratification, the ability to use domestic legal channels to produce compliance will also be missing,90 while more diffuse public pressures are unlikely to emerge. Media and public attention to arms trade issues are typically absent, except among the NRA constituency opposed to the treaty itself.         "
"46","The response by U.S. presidential administrations to international political pressures and receptiveness to multilateralism varies over time. This analysis calls attention to concerns for international image and reputation as a source of that variation that can motivate policy change in favor of foreign policy cooperation. Where superpower reputation has been badly hurt, support for multilateral cooperation may serve strategic efforts to repair it. In the case of the ATT, U.S. cooperation motivated by reputation repair spurred the negotiation process forward and brought some skeptical states on board. The United States may yet respond to the lack of Senate ratification as it has with the landmine treaty: complying with treaty provisions for the most part despite lacking domestic legal status. More likely, the United States will continue to seek to use arms exports to back its allies and industry and serve its other foreign policy interests. Doing so while signaling its role as a cooperative superpower may be a calculated move, but it nevertheless signifies a shift in U.S. conventional arms export policy and U.S. foreign policy multilateralism more broadly."
