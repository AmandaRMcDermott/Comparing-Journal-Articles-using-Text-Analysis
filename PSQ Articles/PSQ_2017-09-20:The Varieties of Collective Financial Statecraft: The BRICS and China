"1","GIVEN THEIR RISING CAPABILITIES AND similar frustrations with the existing system, the emerging economic powers of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and, since December 2010, South Africa) are bound to have an impact on global economic governance, whether individually, as in the case of China, or collectively. Many scholars and policymakers have been skeptical that this eclectic group of five, dispersed around the world and only bound by the imagination of a Goldman Sachs economist, could create an effective coalition.1 As evidenced in this article, however, over the past decade, the BRICS governments have achieved discernibly successful collective action in their financial statecraft to further common foreign policy goals.         "
"2","International “financial statecraft” may be defined as a national government's use of monetary or financial regulations, policies, or instruments to achieve foreign policy ends.2 Most analysts of financial statecraft begin with a set of assumptions about how the topic should be defined (see Table 1). Five assumptions implicit in the traditional conceptualization of financial statecraft are as follows. First, the agent, or initiator, is assumed to be an individual state, either acting alone or becoming the main mover behind a coalition of like‐minded states. Second, the target is similarly assumed to be an individual state. Third, the purpose of the action is assertive or offensive on the part of the agent, and the means employed are coercive.3 Fourth, given the preceding assumptions, it is clear that the traditional financial statecraft literature understands power principally as influence, in which one state attempts to compel another to alter its previously determined course of behavior. Finally, it follows from these standard conceptualizations that the agent state necessarily will be a hegemon or major power, as less capable states have little hope of exercising such influence.         "
"3","Yet expanded conceptualizations of financial statecraft, as in the right‐hand column of Table 1, are also possible. A basic theoretical argument of this article is that financial statecraft can be deployed collectively, and the target may also be a group of states. The means of such collective financial statecraft include inducement, persuasion, and deflection. This more inclusive definition of financial statecraft thus can accommodate state power understood as influence, but also as a defensive search for autonomy or a means of acquiring structural power in international institutions or market systems. Once one allows for collective or defensive actions, or for financial statecraft carried out through attempts to induce or persuade, it is clear that rising and middle powers, as well as major powers, can engage in this type of foreign policy activity.         "
"4","This article examines the collective financial statecraft of a group of rising powers. It includes four types of cases that vary along two analytical dimensions, yielding four basic categories of collective financial statecraft employed by the BRICS vis‐à‐vis the incumbent powers and their dominance of global financial governance. The first dimension of collective financial statecraft, along the horizontal axis in Table 2, distinguishes two types of action. The insurgent or rising states may engage in “inside reforms,” or instances of joint pressure aimed at altering existing structures and systems dominated by the status quo powers by working within established confines. Alternatively, dissatisfied states may instead use collective financial statecraft to exercise their “outside options” through the construction of new and competing structures and systems, with de facto or de jure rules and procedures more attuned to the rising powers’ preferences. The vertical axis in Table 2 demarcates two types of venues for collective financial statecraft, which may focus on either international “institutions” or global “markets.” Both institutions and markets may be subject to attempts by states employing financial statecraft to execute either inside reforms or outside options.         "
"5","Collective international action, principally through club mechanisms, has been one means through which the individual BRICS states have pursued their overlapping goals. BRICS governments discovered focal points for their common interests during transgovernmental meetings of senior officials from the BRICS countries. BRICS collaboration includes ministers and deputy ministers of foreign affairs, finance, economy, and other government departments unrelated to financial and economic matters, as well as their sherpas and sous‐sherpas. Evidence of their transgovernmental collaboration can be found in 10 years of joint communiqués and other public statements by leaders and officials as well as interviews of officials conducted by scholars.4 Together, they coordinated common positions on key issues concerning the four cases discussed here. The five countries also established working groups, with high‐level representatives from each country, on, among other things, a special BRICS visa, joint investment possibilities, single window trade clearance, intellectual property rights protection, energy efficiency, urban infrastructure, and agricultural research. In addition, prominent institutions and civil society groups are now designated as “BRICS think tanks,” “BRICS universities,” “BRICS business associations,” “BRICS media,” and the like. These sectoral groups receive government funding to meet and establish ongoing transnational expert networks (nascent “epistemic communities”), in most cases where virtually none existed previously.5"
"6","When the BRICS reached common or overlapping positions, they used opportunities to bargain jointly with their American and G7 counterparts as well as to strategize about other collective actions. These encounters often occurred on the sidelines of the meetings of multilateral organizations or in the G20 setting, after that group was elevated to become the top global economic governance steering group in 2008 during the global financial crisis.6"
"7","This article examines four cases in which the four (through 2010) and later five BRICS governments worked to coordinate the international financial statecraft of their national governments from 2008 to mid‐2016. The cases were selected on the basis of two criteria. First, as a set, they represent each of the four types of collective financial statecraft summarized in Table 2. Second, the financial statecraft actions taken in these cases are substantive and nontrivial tests of the proposition that the BRICS countries are a club pursuing members’ shared interests, as opposed to a merely rhetorical or symbolic group incapable of sustained and significant collective action.7 Success in any of these collective financial statecraft actions over the medium term will constitute a significant bid by the BRICS to influence the rules, norms, and distribution of influence in global financial governance or markets.         "
"8","The first cell (upper left) in Table 2 represents inside reforms of existing institutions currently dominated by the incumbent powers. Our case (Case 1) examines collective efforts by the BRICS to reform the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, with an emphasis on the former. The second cell (lower left) corresponds to inside options for influencing markets, or for resisting the efforts of dominant states to employ their market‐based financial or monetary power for political ends. Our case (Case 2) shows the BRICS joining together to oppose Western financial sanctions on Russia over the latter's intervention in Ukraine. The table's third cell (upper right) illustrates the situation of countries exercising their outside option to create new institutions or instruments (Case 3). The BRICS coordinated to establish their own New Development Bank (NDB) and Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) as parallel financial and monetary institutions run by and for the BRICS and other developing or emerging economies. China also chose to exercise its own outside option to create a bank in which it would be the indisputable leader, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Finally, the fourth cell (lower right) in Table 2 represents outside options to influence the shape of international markets. The primary case (Case 4) discusses collective BRICS efforts to challenge U.S. dollar dominance in the global monetary order through group support for China's efforts to promote the enhanced use of the Chinese renminbi (RMB) for international transactions. Here, rather than simply coordinating to counteract the market power enjoyed by economically dominant states, the BRICS have consciously expanded their own global market power.         "
"9","The IMF and the World Bank have been guardian institutions for the global economic and financial governance led by the major incumbent powers such as the United States and Western European countries throughout the last 70 years. Despite the increased economic weight and financial capabilities of the emerging powers in recent years, several aspects of these institutions continue to privilege the incumbent powers. The first set of BRICS collective financial statecraft actions challenges these privileges and biases through inside reform. The BRICS have pursued changes in the Bretton Woods institutions by pushing for enhanced “chairs and shares,” an openly competitive process for leadership (or at least assured positions for themselves), and for policies and economic ideas less biased toward U.S. and Western preferences."
"10","First, the BRICS addressed the bias in the distribution of “chairs and shares” that has privileged the incumbent powers. Despite periodic adjustments of shares (quotas) of capital subscriptions and votes associated with the quotas at these institutions, the United States still holds veto power with its 15 percent quota in the World Bank and 17.41 percent quota at the IMF (most recently as part of the 2010 reforms). European powers are also overrepresented in their shares at both institutions. In addition, the distribution of “chairs,” or country representation on the current 24‐member Board of Executive Directors (EDs), which is authorized to supervise IMF activities, reflects power politics.8"
"11","Under the IMF statutes, the five countries with the largest quotas are each guaranteed a single‐country ED chair on the board. In accordance with the 14th General Review, these include the major Western powers: the United States, Japan, Germany, and (by mutual consent) a tie between fifth placed United Kingdom, and France, and, as of 2016, also China which now ranks a close third in voting shares, 0.07 percentage points behind Japan. This new ordering leaves Russia and Saudi Arabia as the two other countries that each occupy single‐constituency seats. The other 17 chairs are grouped in unbalanced constituencies under elected EDs, whose fortunes involve some measure of bargaining while constraining individual member states from forming alternative coalitions.9 As the 14th General Review took effect in 2016, the advanced European countries lost two of their nine chairs in total given their reduced position in the world economy.10 Throughout this long process, BRICS collaboration benefited from quantitative analytical work done by government and academic experts in BRICS countries, for example, working on proposals to revise the existing IMF formula for determining quota shares to break the informal power of Western countries.11"
"12","Previously, after the 2008 Quota and Voice Reforms were finally implemented in 2011, the IMF also introduced an ad hoc shift of shares. There were increases for 54 countries, including, at the top in percentage terms, China, India, and Brazil among the BRICS and Korea, Japan, and the United States among the developed countries. Among the top losers in percentage terms were the United Kingdom, France, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Among the BRICS countries’, South Africa has lost in every IMF reform since the 2006 Singapore agreement, decreasing 21 percent from 0.8670 to 0.634. Russia declined from 2.734 to 2.386 but then increased 8 percent in the 2010 package to rise back to 2.587.12 The 14th General Review, finally implemented in 2016, marks the most important readjustment to date, shifting more than 6 percent of quota shares from overrepresented to underrepresented member countries, the latter primarily dynamic emerging market and developing countries. In the realignment, China is the third‐largest member country (up from the seventh) in the IMF, after the United States and Japan, while Brazil, India, and Russia now rank among the top‐10 largest shareholders in the IMF.13 Using a similar approach for calculating the relationship of global economic weight to institutional quotas and voting shares, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, or the World Bank) currently underweights China, whose shares reflect only 33 percent of its economic weight; India (72 percent); Brazil (74 percent); and the United States, whose shares represent only 83 percent of its global economic importance. The BRICS governments applauded the results but agreed that more needed to be done so that IMF quotas reflect “global economic realities” and their nationals are better represented in the top management of the IMF and World Bank.14"
"13","A second issue relates to the leadership positions of the Bretton Woods institutions and the BRICS countries’ desire to see prominent non‐Western economists have the opportunity to head these institutions.15 Since their founding, the managing director of the IMF has always been a Western European, and the president of the World Bank an American,16 although the numbers of very senior staff from BRICS and other emerging economies have increased notably in the last 15 years. On this issue, the BRICS were unable to coordinate their financial statecraft positions and did not influence the selection by uniting around a common developing country candidate.17 When IMF managing director Dominique Strauss‐Kahn resigned suddenly in May 2011, the BRICS members issued a statement reiterating their collective desire that the selection should be fair and based on merit, not on the convention of the IMF managing director always coming from Europe.18 After several contenders’ names were raised and disappeared19 at the final stage of selection, two major candidates remained: Agustín Carstens, president of Mexico's central bank, and Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister. In a pointed contrast with the backroom negotiations that had characterized previous selection processes, both Carstens and Lagarde openly campaigned for the job, with Lagarde rapidly flying off to visit, in succession, Brazil, China, India, and Russia—all of which refrained from early endorsement of either candidate. In the end, Brazil and Russia publicly supported Lagarde. The government of Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, of the left‐leaning Workers’ Party, was uncomfortable with Carstens's orthodox financial views and likely was also influenced by Brazil's long‐standing rivalry with Mexico as the leading country within Latin America.         "
"14","The 2012 election of a new World Bank president proceeded similarly. In principle, the BRICS wished to support a common candidate from the developing world, but in practice, they were unable to agree. While former Colombian finance minister José Antonio Ocampo, whose unofficial campaign manager was the Brazilian ED of the IMF, drew the support of much of the Western Hemisphere, all parties understood from the beginning that his views were likely too left‐leaning for the United States to accept. South Africa strongly backed neoclassical economist and current Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo‐Iweala, while the United States nominated Korean American university president and public health specialist Jim Yong Kim. Although Ocampo very publicly withdrew in favor of Okonjo‐Iweala shortly before the official balloting, hoping to force unity among the various pro‐diversity constituencies, Russia endorsed Dr. Kim, who was offered the post. In the end, 80 percent of the votes cast in the official balloting at the World Bank board went to Kim, although the African EDs continued to support Okonjo‐Iweala.20"
"15","Even though the BRICS members could not achieve their goal of a common candidate, some individual BRICS countries were able to shake out some backroom quid pro quo deals. The appointment of Kausik Basu, a Cornell University professor of Indian origin, as World Bank chief economist (2012–2016) and of Chinese economist, Jin‐Yong Cai (2012–2015), as chief executive officer of the International Finance Corporation, the private sector funding wing of the World Bank, were in part rewards offered by the dominant Western powers to China and India for their flexibility and patience in the negotiations over the top positions at the World Bank and the IMF.21 Lagarde's active courting of China was reflected in the creation of a new deputy managing director position in July 2011, which was filled by Zhu Min for a five‐year term. Zhu was replaced by Zhang Tao in August 2016. The former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), Zhang had years of experience at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and as an ED for China at the IMF from 2011 to 2015.22 Lagarde also reappointed David Lipton and gave senior management positions to a Japanese national (Takatoshi Kato), and one dual national of Brazil and Italy (Carla Grasso). At the World Bank, as of late July 2016, the two managing directors (immediately subordinate to the president) were a former Brazilian finance minister, Joaquim Levy, and a former senior finance ministry official in China, Shaolin Yang.         "
"16","The third element of BRICS cooperation around reforming the Bretton Woods institutions from within has been aimed at changing IMF economic ideas and policies. Particular targets included the IMF's promotion of capital account liberalization and the perceived neoliberal bias within IMF surveillance activities.23 Throughout the several financial crises experienced by middle‐income countries from Latin America to Asia to Russia during the 1980s through the 2000s, these institutions came to be seen as the bulwark of neoliberal and financial interests, imposing conditionality and structural adjustment on struggling debtors and forcing them to restructure their economies in support of economic liberalization. Emerging and developing economies resented the fact that many developing economies are scrutinized by the IMF and are found wanting, while the United States and some other advanced economies have escaped systematic surveillance. After the global financial crisis, the BRICS repeatedly emphasized in G20 meetings and in joint communiqués from the sidelines of such gatherings that the IMF needs “better‐focused even‐handed surveillance across all IMF members, especially . . . advanced economies with major international financial centers and large cross‐border capital flows.”24"
"17","In general, all of the BRICS share a common aversion to IMF pressure, preferring to protect their autonomy and financial stability through national policy discretion. For example, the BRICS believe that capital controls are a necessary part of the arsenal of emerging economies exposed to external financial contagion. The IMF's drive in the 1990s to amend its Articles of Agreement to force member states to endorse eventual full capital account liberalization was derailed by the Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998, and since then, the IMF's assessment of capital controls has been mixed.25 In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it is obvious to most observers that the BRICS countries mitigated their experience of the crisis by utilizing capital controls. Overall, the BRICS governments have had solid success in reframing capital controls as a legitimate policy option for IMF members, an outcome related to their pivotal role in the G20 and the large financial contributions they have made in support of the IMF's European rescue programs. As Kevin Gallagher has shown, the push by the BRICS and other emerging economies tipped already divided opinion within the IMF toward a preference for allowing capital controls on both financial inflows and outflows.26 As a result, the IMF now debates capital controls more openly than in the past, even as some BRICS members have been gradually reducing restrictions on the movement of capital while insisting that such decisions are their prerogative.27"
"18","There had also been tension over global imbalances in tackling the vast trade surplus of China at the expense of the United States. In August 2007, the IMF announced a U.S.‐promoted plan to monitor global imbalances. According to this proposal, countries whose exchange rates demonstrated “fundamental misalignment” would be audited by the IMF. China objected, and it found allies among the BRIC governments: in early 2009, the four BRIC finance ministers publicly called on the IMF to extend its surveillance to the wealthy countries. By mid‐2009, the IMF had responded to pressure from the BRIC countries to drop the judgmental language on exchange rate levels in its new Article IV guidelines, and in September 2010, the IMF announced mandatory surveillance of “systemically important countries,” including all of the large economies in the G20.28 By late 2010, G20 members Brazil, China, Germany, and Russia (later joined by India and South Africa) all had criticized U.S. monetary expansion, or “quantitative easing,” as tending to promote currency and trade instability. The communiqué from the 2013 BRICS summit in Durban, South Africa, similarly referred to “unconventional monetary policy actions which have increased global liquidity,” noting “unintended consequences . . . which may have negative growth effects on other economies, in particular developing countries.”29"
"19","To address these reform challenges of the Bretton Woods institutions, the BRICS coordinated extensively, mostly on the sidelines of the G20 and similar meetings of multilateral institutions.30 The degree of BRICS coordination varied from informal and ad hoc, such as among EDs in the IMF, to more focused and concrete at BRICS summits and when senior ministers met at the G20 and on the sidelines of other multilateral gatherings.31"
"20","The BRICS’ rising financial capabilities also helped strengthen their influence on inside reform in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The IMF's financial resource requirements to tackle what developing countries termed the “North Atlantic” crisis tripled from $250 billion in 2008 to about $750 billion as of early 2011.32 In response, the BRICS issued a joint statement in March 2009 linking expanded contributions from their governments to increased votes at the IMF and the World Bank. Beijing agreed to contribute $50 billion to bolster the IMF and coordinated with the other BRICS governments to leverage their contributions in a public attempt to make a down payment on more rapid reforms and to set the terms on how their contributions would be structured.         "
"21","As creditors, the BRICS were not prepared to give the IMF open‐ended funding. As Eswar Prasad observed, “They don't want to get locked into providing more money until they get their (shares) increased.”33 They wanted the IMF to issue its first SDRs (special drawing rights)‐denominated bond with short‐term maturities to signal their preference that the IMF needed to make adjustments to the international monetary regime and stop relying on a single national currency as the world's sole reserve.34 At the same time, the four BRIC countries planned to shift some foreign reserves into these IMF bonds, showing that they had a large voice in global markets. The BRICS finally affirmed their commitment to help provide a financial safety net before the 2012 Los Cabos summit.         "
"22","Moreover, the Eurozone sought direct bilateral bailouts to help manage its sovereign debt crisis, but the BRICS insisted on helping through the existing institutional structure, the IMF, instead of a European special‐purpose vehicle. In fact, India and the other BRICS countries publicly complained about double standards by the IMF, as it was prepared to extend a “flexible credit line,” which would give Eurozone countries easier conditions without a stigma attached,35 and ruled out lending to the Eurozone except through the IMF. In short, the financial and economic crisis in the West and demand for financial resources had a silver lining for the BRICS countries. It marked a major step toward perceived multipolarity and raised questions about whether the United States and the G7 countries were “responsible” stewards while leaving no doubt that the BRICS increasingly were becoming major stakeholders in the existing order.36"
"23","The second case of BRICS cooperation in financial statecraft, illustrating the lower left‐hand cell in Table 2, concerns their choice to collectively oppose attempts by the incumbent powers to use their financial market leverage to further their political goals. This case involves each of the other four countries deciding to support Russia's efforts to resist U.S. and European Union (EU) financial sanctions following Russia's 2014 intervention in Eastern Ukraine, subsequent annexation of Crimea, and ongoing support of separatists in Eastern Ukraine.         "
"24","Economic and other forms of targeted sanctions have been sequentially deployed to change Russia's international behavior in the short run by imposing costs on Russia that escalate over the medium term.37 Rather than bring Russia's economy to its knees by targeting Russian sovereign debt, U.S. sanctions have been designed to demonstrate a sustainable and scalable ability to generate overwhelming costs while avoiding unwanted spillover effects, such as disrupting global financial markets or provoking the Kremlin to shut off gas supplies to Europe. The Barack Obama administration believed that sanctions would affect Vladimir Putin's calculus (viewing him as risk acceptant and revisionist) and deter Russian escalation of the war while also giving Ukraine time to reform its military and economy. The product of Euro‐Atlantic political compromises, the sanctions were considered a second‐best option by many U.S. policymakers who favored arming Ukraine.         "
"25","Intended to avoid a disruption of the global economy or the interruption of oil and gas flows to Europe given its reliance on Russian energy imports, the financial sanctions first targeted individuals close to President Putin, freezing their financial assets in the West and imposing travel restrictions beginning in March 2014. Next came sectoral sanctions focusing on pressure points on Russian financial, energy, and defense firms with close government ties. U.S. sanctions restricted their access to Western markets, credit (especially U.S. dollar financing), and technology, including equity or debt instruments with maturities longer than 30 days, effectively closing the capital markets to Russian corporate borrowers. U.S. firms were blocked from doing deals with Russia on deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale projects.38"
"26","After Russia was implicated in the downing of a passenger airplane over Ukraine in July 2014, and following reports that Russian armor and troops had moved into Eastern Ukraine in November, there were additional asset freezes, travel bans, and a stiffening of Western support for sanctions. Periodically, new sanctions have been added to signal to businesses, and particularly the financial sector in Europe and China, the potential costs of doing business with Russia. Following revelations about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and continued conflict in Ukraine, in June 2017 the U.S. Senate voted 97‐2 to significantly escalate and expand the sanctions campaign, including to impose U.S. extraterritorial restrictions on pipeline projects for oil and gas, on investment in Russian hydrocarbon development, in privatizations of Russian state‐owned assets, and in Russian sovereign debt and derivatives. The bill (which passed the House of Representatives 419‐3 with minor revisions in July) breaks the united front with the EU. It also codifies President Obama's executive orders on sanctions into law and requires Congressional approval to ease the penalties, which will make the sanctions regime extremely difficult for President Donald Trump and future administrations to remove.39"
"27","Before this move, the most significant financial deterrent to Russian escalation of aggression in Ukraine was public consideration by the United States and the EU of turning off Russia's access to the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) global financial messaging system. Russian prime minister Dmitri Medvedev threatened to escalate to the “unlimited” use of force in the event of a SWIFT cutoff. Such a possible “weaponization of finance” reverberated through some of the BRICS countries, prompting China to accelerate work on its own Cross‐border Interbank Payment System given concerns about U.S. intelligence targeting of SWIFT.40 The Russian case also demonstrated the vulnerability of U.S. payment cards such as Visa and MasterCard to sanctions, leading the Russian authorities to establish a national payment card system from scratch, followed by co‐branding agreements with many international counterparts.         "
"28","Unable to refinance their external debt obligations, many Russian firms were forced to repay, causing a sharp rise in net private capital outflows in 2014. Trade between Russia and the EU declined significantly in the sanctioned sectors, and near‐term prospects were dimmed as countries imposing the sanctions accounted for 80 percent of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Russia. Together with a 50 percent plunge in the price of oil and a correlated collapse of the ruble beginning in mid‐June 2014, the sanctions had a negative economic impact on the Russian economy. Still, Russian president Vladimir Putin did not blink. The Russian economy did not collapse, sanctions did not diminish Russian hydrocarbon production, import substitution benefited important protectionist constituencies that “rallied round the flag,” and sanctioned firms were bailed out by the Kremlin.41 Russian authorities avoided a severe balance of payments and banking crisis by allowing the ruble to float, keeping credit markets open, and buying back foreign exchange debt. Moreover, by blocking Russia from the bond markets, sanctions also, paradoxically, capped foreign currency liabilities and imposed greater financial discipline on Kremlin‐connected firms such as Rosneft. Two years later, in May 2016, Russia reentered the Eurobond markets despite warnings from Western governments to investors to stay away, and again successfully tapped the international debt markets in June 2017 with high American participation in purchases of Russian sovereign debt. Russia also marketed corporate issuances, showing that it could chip away at financial sanctions.42"
"29","Facing coercive pressure against one of its own, the BRICS club stood firmly in opposition to sanctions but, unsurprisingly, did not demonstrate enthusiastic support of Russian foreign policy. In March 2014, Brazil, India, China, and South Africa joined 54 other countries that abstained in the vote on the United Nations (UN) General Assembly resolution to condemn the Russian annexation of Crimea (which passed 100:11:58). Russia had already vetoed a Western‐backed UN Security Council resolution (13:1:1) condemning the referendum in Crimea. In that vote, China abstained, evidently because it did not want to give the appearance of supporting separatist movements fighting for self‐determination and secession given its own positions in Tibet and toward the indigenous Uighur population in the Xinjiang Province. The Chinese government called for a political settlement, while several articles in the Chinese press blamed the West for supporting regime change in Ukraine."
"30","All of the BRICS refused to participate in the sanctions regime, just as they rebuffed unilateral sanctions against Iran that were not approved by the UN. President Putin was welcomed collegially at the 6th BRICS Summit in Fortaleza, Brazil, in July 2014 and at the 8th BRICS Summit in Goa, India, in October 2016, and also hosted the 7th BRICS Summit in July 2015 in Ufa, Russia, with all the BRICS heads of state in attendance. In Ufa, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi insisted that “[u]nilateral sanctions are hurting the global economy. So it is very essential that BRICS economies deepen their cooperation.” The summit declarations from 2014 through 2016 consistently emphasized BRICS opposition to unilateral economic sanctions as a violation of international law.43"
"31","President Xi Jinping also paved the way for economic deals with Russia despite the reluctance of Chinese commercial banks to ignore sanctions. Moreover, Russian‐Chinese trade rebounded in the first three quarters of 2016 after dropping almost 30 percent in 2015 following the collapse in oil prices. The volume of Russian oil exports actually increased, making Russia the largest or second‐largest supplier of crude to China, roughly equivalent to Saudi Arabia. Russian arms sales of advanced weapons, such as the S‐400 surface‐to‐air missile and SU‐35 fighters to China and India, also boomed. China became Russia's largest source of foreign capital in 2015 (excluding Russian capital reimported from Cyprus), and the two authoritarian BRICS countries reinforced their support for principles of nonintervention in the internal affairs of states in a joint declaration in June 2016.44 These were strong signals that Washington could not impose the diplomatic isolation of a major power.         "
"32","Notwithstanding incremental progress in pushing for greater influence within the World Bank and the IMF, the BRICS have found it slow and strenuous to change existing institutions from within. An alternative strategy is to exercise their outside options: they can step outside Western‐controlled institutions to create new institutions answerable to themselves. The pursuit of outside options to establish new institutions constitutes this article's third case of collective financial statecraft, illustrating the upper right‐hand cell in Table 2. According to former Brazilian IMF ED Paulo Nogueira Batista and other officials from BRICS countries, an important motivation to create new institutions was the frustration over prolonged inaction on governance reforms by “the Washington‐based institutions.”45 The priority for investments to be made through such parallel institutions would be infrastructure, as BRICS policymakers find the current low levels of infrastructure funding sorely lacking.46"
"33","The first parallel financial institution established by the BRICS is the New Development Bank, with a subscribed starting capital of $50 billion and authorized capital of $100 billion. The NDB resulted from an Indian initiative, influenced by discussions elaborated in the UN General Assembly under the auspices of the working group that came to be known as the Stiglitz Commission, which was critical of the flow of capital from poor countries to rich ones, as well as the way in which the major Western economies had handled the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. Although Brazil was enthusiastic, the Chinese initially resisted India's idea for a BRICS bank but were persuaded by the time of the 2014 BRICS Summit in Goa.47"
"34","When the NDB launched in Shanghai on 22 July 2015, its first president, Indian private sector banker K.V. Kamath, noted, “Our objective is not to challenge the existing system as it is, but to improve and complement the system in our own way.”48 Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei, also in attendance, added, “This bank will place greater emphasis on the needs of developing countries, have greater respect for developing countries’ national situation, and more fully embody the value of developing countries.” Lou further observed that the NDB would like to move development finance “from best practice to next practice” by moving beyond the existing multilateral development banks, which are “too rigid, inflexible, and slow.”49 The priority of the NDB governance is a streamlined, low‐cost, less bureaucratic, “string‐free” operation (focused more on projects than shaping domestic policies). The BRICS sought to prioritize the objective of processing loans more rapidly than the lumbering World Bank, whose relative advantage is being able to borrow at low rates given its triple‐A credit rating.50"
"35","The BRICS overcame some important intra‐BRICS disagreements to achieve this unity. One disagreement was about the weighting of founding member's shares, and hence the size of the bank. Both India and Brazil strongly insisted that initial capital subscriptions, and thus voting shares, be allocated equally among the five countries; the others agreed, except China, whose leaders wanted to have voting shares reflect economic weight, which would give Beijing the dominant position. China's compromise is the most significant signal to its partners that this club not only serves Chinese interests but also provides club goods. The second disagreement arose between India and China regarding the NDB site as well as its leadership. India, considering itself the source of the NDB idea and, sotto voce, clearly better qualified than either China or Russia in terms of the sophistication and expertise of its domestic financial regulators, hoped to host the proposed BRICS bank. India nonetheless was obliged to yield to China's greater economic and financial power resources—in particular, large foreign exchange reserves—and agreed to the NDB being sited in Shanghai. Russia and Brazil each also wanted to host the bank but did not put up a fight.51 China argued in favor of a permanent NDB presidency for itself, rather than the rotating one ultimately chosen, but was persuaded to back down on this demand.52 Moreover, India was granted the right to appoint the NDB's first president, while each of the other countries would appoint a vice president.

"36","The second institution attached to the NBD is the Contingent Reserve Arrangement, with pledged funds to total $100 billion.53 It is the BRICS's own small monetary fund, whose treaty was signed by all five BRICS members on 15 July 2015. Like the IMF, its statutory role is to provide a framework for short‐term balance of payments lending in times of balance‐of‐payments crisis. Unlike the NDB, for which the initial capital subscriptions were equally shared among the five BRICS members, China commits to contribute the bulk of funding for the $100 billion CRA. China's share is $41 billion; that of Russia, India, and Brazil $18 billion each; and South Africa has committed $5 billion. Like the East Asian counterpart to the CRA, the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM), the CRA has an IMF link: countries may access a maximum of 30 percent of the funding to which they formally are entitled without a prior agreement with the IMF. This is arguably one way to secure the repayment of the emergency funds disbursed, but it also represents a pragmatic recognition of the current weakness of the monitoring and surveillance capabilities of the BRICS themselves.54 However, some critics question whether the CRA has “the requisite firepower,” in that it is equivalent to only about 1 percent of China's reserves or 80 percent of India's budget deficit for the 2013–2014 fiscal year. In 2002 Brazil's emergency IMF borrowing, during a tense election campaign that distressed investors, rose to $30.4 billion.55"
"37","These new BRICS institutions give the club credibility in global economic governance, and the members were eager to go operational. In April 2016, after caucusing on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF spring meetings in Washington, the NDB's board of directors announced that the NDB's first loans would go to four of the five BRICS countries (all but Russia) and that all would target the renewable energy sector, “supporting 2,370 megawatts” of capacity.56 Later, at the July board meeting, a loan was approved to support the construction of two hydropower generation plants in the Republic of Karelia in the Russian Federation.57"
"38","The other parallel institution that features the new financial statecraft by emerging powers is the AIIB. Under China's unilateral initiative, the AIIB was officially founded in 2015 with 57 members, despite initial opposition by the United States.58 The AIIB focuses on lending to infrastructure projects in Asia with $100 billion capital subscription. As of May 2017, the AIIB had approved 13 projects in Azerbaijan (1), Bangladesh (2), India (1), Indonesia (3), Myanmar (1), Oman (2), Pakistan (2), and Tajikistan (1), mostly in the energy and transportation sectors, with most of these projects co‐financed by the World Bank, the ADB, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. AIIB officials foresee that its lending in 2017 will reach $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in 2018.59"
"39","The AIIB is headquartered in Beijing, and China holds a 26.1 percent voting share.60 Although the AIIB spectacle stole some thunder from the near‐simultaneous launch of the NDB, both in mid‐2015, the BRICS members are treated quite well in the AIIB. India, Russia, and Germany hold the second‐, third‐, and fourth‐highest voting shares in the AIIB, with 7.5 percent, 5.9 percent, and 4.2 percent, respectively. Even Brazil, the only AIIB member from the Western Hemisphere prior to the AIIB membership expansion in spring 2017, holds a 3.0 percent voting share, nearly equivalent to those of France, the United Kingdom, and Indonesia. Russia was delayed in signing on to the AIIB, because the finance ministry was ready to reject the initiative given that the falling oil price and sectoral sanctions were forcing painful budget cuts. Word went out that “we have no money to participate in Chinese geopolitical projects,” which led the Russian foreign ministry to send a “polite rejection” to China. However, when the issue finally reached the Kremlin, Putin immediately overturned the bureaucratic response and decreed that Russia would indeed join the AIIB.61"
"40","Although Jin Liqun, the bank's first president and former vice minister of China's finance ministry, has vowed to run a “clean, lean, and green” operation to the “highest international standards,” the establishment of the AIIB was seen as a challenge to the G7 powers.62 The World Bank in recent decades had dropped its support for heavy infrastructure, once a dominant focus of lending, to only about 10 percent of the total, in part to focus on new priorities, including antipoverty lending and rural development.63 In contrast, the AIIB brought back the priority on infrastructure in response to reported $8 trillion infrastructure needs in the next 10 years in Asia alone.64 Regionally, the AIIB becomes a direct rival to the ADB, traditionally headed by a president nominated by G7 member, Japan, and with the controlling shareholding of 32 percent divided equally between Japan and the United States.65"
"41","The AIIB is representative of Chinese international initiatives that reveal China's disproportionate power among the BRICS and its own outside options. With its massive foreign exchange reserves, budding international currency, and military and productive prowess backing the economy, China can go it alone all the way, if it wishes, to implement financial statecraft to defend itself or to shape global economic governance. China has the financial power to entice and coerce others to its advantage, but it has been unequivocally supportive of the BRICS process. Especially under Xi Jinping, China has been eager to wrap itself in the mantle of collaborative and benign multilateralism to tamp down rising regional threat perceptions while also enhancing its geostrategic influence. Joint initiatives with the BRICS help serve both aims.66"
"42","China has founded or cofounded three international infrastructure initiatives, all within a short time, that importantly contribute to extending China's soft power and geostrategic role. The One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative was first announced in 2013 by President Xi Jinping, who subsequently hailed it as “the project of the century” at a summit in May 2017 with delegates from 100 countries, including 28 heads of state, to promote this ambitious initiative. With nearly $1 trillion in planned and ongoing investment projects, OBOR is aimed at expanding economic integration centered on China as well as projecting China's geoeconomic influence.67 Along with the NDB and the AIIB, the three initiatives perform different and complementary roles from the Chinese viewpoint and allow China to exert more influence within the BRICS and globally.         "
"43","In addition, China has utilized more than $3 trillion of its foreign exchange reserves through state‐owned banks and its sovereign wealth funds. A large quantity of investible funds, combined with domestic overcapacity, stimulates China to locate demand abroad to absorb excess capacity in industries such as steel and manufacturing inputs. This stimulates complementarity among the BRICS as the rest of the BRICS countries seek investment. Chinese investment funded Russia's $400 billion deal in Gazprom and supported Brazil's state petroleum firm, Petrobras. Moreover, as investors in Europe and Asia started in 2016 and 2017 to return to the markets for Russian corporate bonds and sovereign debt issue, China also sought more deals in the unsanctioned, investment‐grade domain, including some medium‐term untied financing. Sanctions remain a concern, but they are more flexibly implemented by individual European countries, not retroactively, and with greater regulatory discretion than in the United States. In the export credit agency–backed market, China's National Petroleum Corporation and Silk Road Fund combined acquired a 30 percent stake in Russia's Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas project as two Chinese banks extended $12 billion in credit lines. Likewise, a consortium of Indian firms acquired a 26 percent stake in Russian oil company Vankorneft from Rosneft.68 At the BRICS summit hosted by India in October 2016, it was also announced that Rosneft and its partners would take over India's second largest—and heavily indebted—private oil firm, Essar Oil, in a cash deal valued at $12.9 billion, making it the biggest acquisition in India and Russia's largest outbound foreign direct investment.69"
"44","The fourth and final case in this article involves BRICS collaboration to support the internationalization of China's currency, the RMB, as a means to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar in the world. It provides an example of the type of financial statecraft collaboration identified in the lower right‐hand cell of Table 2. RMB internationalization creates an outside option for these countries to change global market realities by encouraging others to use their currencies for international transactions and official reserves purposes.         "
"45","Leaders in each of the BRICS countries have long complained about the overwhelming power and “exorbitant privilege”70 accruing to the United States. The U.S.’ home currency has served since the mid‐twentieth century as the global reserve currency and the major transactions and trade invoicing currency, while the U.S. government's low‐yielding Treasury securities are understood to be the world's safest and most liquid asset for investment. Such dollar dominance has imposed on other governments the constant imperative to provide de facto cheap loans to the United States. Particularly for China, which had accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves and dollar‐denominated assets in recent years, the “dollar trap”71 and uncertainty of U.S. monetary policy had become an acute problem, particularly when the United States began massive quantitative easing in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.72 To protect their assets in the face of potential dollar collapse, surplus countries like China were virtually forced to continue to loan funds to the United States by retaining their large investments in U.S. Treasury securities. Moreover, many of the BRICS’ currencies were quite volatile against the U.S. dollar.         "
"46","The high opportunity cost of dollar reserves and uncertainty related to U.S. monetary policy has led leaders of these emerging or reemerging powers to prefer, in principle, to have an alternative to the U.S. dollar through actions to promote a greater multiplicity of reserve and transactions currencies.73 In practice, the only viable alternative to the USD‐only global reserve currency system would be one with multiple‐currency reserves, adding increased use of the euro and the RMB over time, although the yen, pound sterling, and Swiss franc also are considered hard currencies. As much of Western Europe has experienced economic turmoil or has been teetering on the edge since the global financial crisis, the attractiveness of the euro has been greatly reduced. For some observers, the obvious choice has become the RMB.74 In 2011, a World Bank report forecast that the dollar's dominance would end before 2025 and that it would likely be replaced by a monetary system based on the dollar, euro, and RMB.75"
"47","In support of increased use of the RMB in global transactions, the BRICS have engaged in four tactics. First, they have talked up the RMB and moved away from the dollar, including taking the step of transferring some official reserves out of U.S. Treasury securities and into an alternative asset, although with mixed success. The Chinese central bank, the PBOC, has been said to be slowly and quietly divesting from the U.S. dollar as not to influence foreign exchange prices. Russia also reportedly shifted a significant percentage of its holdings of U.S. securities into a custodial account when the threat of sanctions emerged in 2014."
"48","Second, ever since the famous paper by PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan, released in March 2009 prior to the G20 London Summit, advocating the increased use of SDRs,76 the IMF's own virtual currency, the Chinese government has been eying the inclusion of the RMB into the SDR basket. The SDR is reviewed every five years, and requires a 70 percent majority among the IMF executive directors’ votes to revise the currency composition of the basket. When the Chinese government began to make some moves toward inclusion of the RMB in SDR, the IMF's 2010 review found this premature.77 IMF Article of Agreement XXX specifies that a currency may qualify to be included in the SDR when it is “freely usable.” This “usability” consists of two components: it should be “widely used to make payments for international transactions” and “widely traded in the principal exchange markets.”78"
"49","Given China's increasing weight in the world economy in the 2010s, the G20 at its Cannes Summit (November 2011) took it upon itself to recommend to the IMF that the question of SDR composition be revisited. At the BRICS summit in Ufa, Russia (July 2015), the other four supported China on including the RMB in the SDR in order to “counter Western dominance of the IMF.”79 Then, on 30 November 2015, the EDs of the IMF completed their review and determined that the RMB met the existing currency selection criteria for the SDR basket, and its inclusion was effected as of 1 October 2016. The revised SDR basket is now based on the following weights: 41.73 percent for the U.S. dollar, 30.93 percent for the euro, 10.92 percent for the Chinese RMB, 8.33 percent for the Japanese yen, and 8.09 percent for the British pound. These weights are derived from a new formula adopted by the IMF in its review that includes the value of the issuers’ exports, the amount of reserves denominated in the respective currencies that were held by other monetary authorities, foreign exchange turnover, and international bank liabilities and international debt securities denominated in the respective currencies.80"
"50","Third, the five BRICS countries have supported greater use of the RMB and other local currencies for trade, and they have signed currency swap agreements. China in particular has taken concrete steps to implement local currency‐denominated trade with many of its trading partners through settling the trade in RMB. In 2015, trade settlement in RMB totaled $1.7 trillion, more than 25 percent of China's annual trade. Although China is one of the largest trading states, accounting for about 12 percent of global trade, payments made in RMB in 2017 account for less than 20 percent of that, declining from 2015 given current depreciation fears and the difficulties in hedging RMB. In order to facilitate RMB settlements, the PBOC has concluded RMB swap arrangements with more than 35 countries, including Russia and Brazil. As of the summer of 2014, more than 50 central banks had invested in RMB assets using onshore and offshore RMB markets.81 In 2016, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System launched direct trading between the RMB, Korean won, and South African rand, and this system allows 23 currencies to be traded with the RMB on China's interbank FX market—all measures that will improve the prospects of the RMB as a settlement currency.82"
"51","The final category of concrete steps that would be needed to promote a shift away from the U.S. dollar and toward the RMB would be Chinese moves to open its capital account and liberalize the country's domestic financial markets and regulation, allowing them to become more liquid and opening them up more to foreign financial investors."
"52","As an exercise in collaborative financial statecraft among the BRICS countries, their attempt to cohere around the goal of tempering U.S. dollar hegemony has met with limited success. Although there has been a dramatic percentage increase in the employment of the RMB as a global transactions currency, it remains a small share of total transactions, accounting for only 1.68 percent of international payments in January 2017, according to SWIFT data. Nor is the RMB's share of official reserves large, although both are expected to rise in the medium term. The BRICS leaders have made many speeches in support of this goal, and individual countries have modified their initial positions in order to move closer to the BRICS club position. At the 2010 BRICS summit in Brasilia, the BRICS members agreed to explore monetary cooperation, including using national currencies in trade. Russia and China began to hold auctions in yuan and rubles the following year, while Brazil also emphasized shifting toward bilateral trade in national currencies and including the real in the foreign exchange reserves of other states. In 2012, Brazil and China also agreed to establish the first pool of reserves of BRICS countries for $60 billion to ensure liquidity in the event of a crisis—a precursor to the subsequent BRICS CRA.83"
"53","But the attempt to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar is still in its very early stages. It has been relatively costless for the non‐Chinese BRICS countries to support RMB internationalization.84 As the RMB becomes more internationalized, and more widely used, China's fellow BRICS, which lack influence over global currency markets, may look more carefully at whether their own national interests are served by a rising yuan, even if mainly for regional transactions. Unequivocal embrace of the goal of RMB internationalization by the principal Chinese actors—which has not yet occurred—would appear to be a prerequisite for joint BRICS actions to have any impact on global currency outcomes. The significant August 2015 RMB devaluation, which took traders by surprise, demonstrates the difficult choice that Chinese authorities face in stabilizing their currency, which is also likely to be a requirement for successful currency internationalization.85 Nonetheless, the direction of a shift in global currency power seems inevitable: the RMB is becoming more important, and the other BRICS countries will try to benefit from its rise.         "
"54","This article has examined collective financial statecraft among the BRICS, focusing on the ways in which rising or middle powers might choose this medium to seek greater power and influence in the international system, specifically vis‐à‐vis a group of dominant incumbent powers. Four ideal‐types of collective financial statecraft were analyzed: inside reforms of institutions of global governance, the outside option of creating new global financial institutions, and both inside reforms and outside options to manipulate international financial markets, resist such manipulation by others, or acquire more power and influence within such markets."
"55","In terms of the four cases, the key questions are whether the intercountry cooperation itself was a success, as well as whether joint action succeeded in achieving the group's intended aims. The challenge of evaluating success and failure of the BRICS collective financial statecraft in these four cases arises not only from the fact that these cases are relatively new developments and most of them are still ongoing, but also from the time‐inconsistency challenge. That is, thus far none of these cases has been very costly for any of the BRICS countries, which makes cooperation much easier than otherwise would be the case, and they can all see that current commitments to cooperate have potentially large rewards. However, such commitments are less credible looking into the future, as costs may grow or benefits fail to materialize. This time‐inconsistency problem becomes more acute in that the BRICS is a group housing a vast power asymmetry between the already “risen” and a very large economic power, China, compared with the rest. In this context, China may “use” the group during its time of need—such as gaining support to rebuff charges of currency manipulation and press the IMF to engage in mandatory surveillance of all large economies in the G20—but it always possesses the easiest exit option. Hence, the other four BRICS countries perhaps discount promises of benefits in the future. Moreover, there are increasingly difficult standards for defining and assessing intragroup “cooperation,” ranging from simple pursuit by BRICS members of parallel interests to joint development of newly recognized common interests to evidence that, on at least some occasions, state leaders have found the benefits provided by club membership sufficient to induce them to compromise for the sake of maintaining group unity."
"56","Notwithstanding the time‐inconsistency caveat, there has been considerable cooperation among these four, then five, countries over a number of years. Most of the cases are surprising successes. The only clear failure among these cases is their inability to unite around a new head of the IMF and World Bank in 2011 and 2012, which constitutes one piece of their attempts at inside reforms of the Bretton Woods institutions. Still, even that unsuccessful cooperation resulted in a much more transparent process. When Christine Lagarde wanted to serve a second term, she lobbied the BRICS very hard and was rewarded with their support, especially from the Chinese government following Lagarde's support for RMB inclusion in the SDR in 2015. The chairs and shares cooperation in Case 1 is a belated success and progress is expected to continue. In all of the remaining cases—the establishment of the NDB and CRA (Case 2), resistance to Western sanctions on Russia (Case 3), and promotion of RMB internationalization (Case 4)—cooperation is ongoing and has strengthened over time. The cases show examples of strategic adjustment, persuasion, and compromise for the sake of the common enterprise or common aversions: the Chinese, for example, were initially skeptical of the idea of a BRICS bank, but personal lobbying by Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, himself a prominent economist and successful former finance minister, tipped the balance. All of the other four governments agreed to resist Western financial sanctions on Russia, when in fact China, Brazil, and South Africa would rather not have been perceived as supporting Russian irredentism, even indirectly. Similarly, the non‐China BRICS countries have actively supported RMB internationalization, including in some cases RMB‐denominated loans from China, which could be problematic to repay where the borrower has a bilateral trade deficit with China."
"57","In these cases and in others not examined here, the BRICS found focal points to consider future collaboration. Of course, the four cases do not constitute a representative sample of the universe of all possible international financial interactions among these states in this time period. In particular, this analysis does not include instances of noncollaboration in collective financial statecraft that may be useful to investigate in future research. In some instances, the BRICS either collectively remained neutral or acted separately. For example, the BRICS never developed a collective position in the financial regulatory discussions of the newly established Financial Stability Board or in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to which Brazil, China, India, and Russia were admitted at the time of the March 2009 expansion.86 There is also no sign of either resistance to or collective support by the BRICS with respect to the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism discussed at the IMF.87 By comparison, the BRICS have converged on broadly similar responses to the Basel III accord on banking regulations: commercial banks in China, Brazil, and Russia each now hold capital greater than the Basel rules require.88 More contentious is Beijing's recent proposal for a BRICS free trade agreement to boost trade.89 India's trade deficit in goods with China soared from $1.1 billion in 2003–2004 to $52.7 billion in 2015–2016, while Russia's trade deficit with China ran $10.1 billion in 2016. Although in 2014 both Brazil ($16.7 billion) and South Africa ($28.9 billion) ran trade surpluses with China, all of the BRICS worry about their future trade balances with China.         "
"58","Notwithstanding these limitations, the BRICS governments have been impressively successful in hanging together despite having diverse political regimes, distinct interests, and even long‐standing tensions among some members of this group. Even more striking, there has been remarkable success in achieving the desired outcomes: enhanced voice within the IMF and World Bank, viable new institutions not controlled by the incumbent Western powers, support for Russia and for the principle that financial clout ought not to be employed as a foreign policy tool to violate the sovereignty of other great powers,90 and RMB internationalization proceeding faster than many observers expected. BRICS cooperation was clearly important for Cases 1, 2, and 3. The BRICS also supported China's case for including the RMB in the SDR (Case 4).         "
"59","Over the decade of their collaboration, the BRICS grouping has acquired “club” properties and successfully coordinated among themselves while also engaging in repeated instances of bargaining on these cases with the United States and other G7 countries. BRICS bargaining was facilitated in part by the enhanced status of the G20 governance group, which has regularly brought together both the G7 and the BRICS, and supported the interests of both members’ clubs since the first BRICS summit in 2009.91"
"60","Equally important is the signal by the BRICS that they have strongly supplemented their hybrid strategy of inside reforms with outside options, which was an important turning point in their group relations and their interaction with the incumbent powers. However, they did not transition into an oppositional stance as a spoiler; nor is it accurate to label them as shirkers.92 The BRICS are not engaged in a hostile takeover or a “destroy and replace” mission. They are persistent, disruptive change agents led by China, the most important competitor to the United States since the Soviet Union. The global financial crisis, prolonged delays by Washington to ratify the 2010 IMF quota reforms, and other acts of incumbent power resistance show both cracks in the order and increased U.S. sensitivity to China's rise. Even prior to the Donald Trump administration, there was a growing U.S. tendency to hedge on its commitment to integrate China and the BRICS as a group into a benevolent and legitimate negotiated liberal order93 as China inched toward its possible replacement.*"
