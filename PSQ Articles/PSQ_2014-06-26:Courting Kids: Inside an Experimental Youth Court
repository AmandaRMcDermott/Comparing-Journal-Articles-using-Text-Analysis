"1","The past three decades have seen the development and passage of public policies that have changed some of the core principles and philosophy of America's juvenile justice system. Across the county, state legislatures have engaged in an undermining of the concepts of parens patria, best interest of the child, and rehabilitation in favor of an accountability‐based system of juvenile justice that focuses on the goals of deterrence and proportional punishment."
"2","Courting Kids: Inside an Experimental Youth Court is an ethnographic study of an alternative approach to dealing with youthful offenders between the ages of 16 and 18 in the state of New York. States vary relative to the minimum age for adulthood, with the majority establishing 18 as the threshold. New York is one of 11 states that define 16 as the upper age limit for processing youthful offenders in the juvenile justice system. These adult‐juveniles, as labeled by Carla Barrett, are caught in a legal conundrum: adults for purposes of criminal prosecutions but juveniles in all other legal and social venues (p. 12).         "
"3","New York was the first state in the United States to pass accountability‐based public policies for juvenile offenders. In 1978, New York passed the Youthful Offender Act, which specified that juveniles of specific ages who commited specific crimes would be handled as adult offenders in the adult criminal justice system (p. 26). Subsequent to the creation of the Manhattan Youth Court, cases involving juveniles age 16 or older were handled in the adult criminal court (p. 27)."
"4","The Manhattan Youth Court, piloted by a progressive and forward‐thinking family court judge began operation in 1992 (p. 27). This court is one piece of a very large puzzle that is facing legal communities throughout the United States. Part one of that puzzle challenges the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems to positively intervene in the lives of these adult‐juvenile offenders. Part Two seeks ways to intervene that emphasize accountability without destroying the opportunities that could allow such youths to mature into responsible and successful adults. The Manhattan Youth Court is one answer to those challenges, an approach that holds youths accountable for their behavior while still affording an opportunity for such youths to mature into responsible members of society."
"5","Barrett's ethnographic narrative captures the drama that occurs daily in courtrooms across the county. Parents sitting on wooden benches and waiting endlessly for hearings that rarely start on time, countless delays in legal processing, and the unlimited stress and frustration experienced by court staff as a result of dealing with older adolescents, many of whom were broken long before they arrived in Youth Court."
"6","The author explains how current laws have actually redefined adolescence and adulthood through criminal prosecution of juveniles as adult offenders (p. 152). Readers will gain a sense of the history and initial purpose of the juvenile court, an understanding of the impact of accountability‐based public policies, the tools used to facilitate accountability, such as legislative and judicial waivers, and the research that, to date, has found that these policies have not necessarily reduced recidivism or deterred criminal conduct."
"7","In the end, Courting Kids is not just about youth and a specialized court in New York; it is about all youth, everywhere.         "
