"1","The preclearance requirement, the strongest weapon in the Voting Rights Act (VRA), was rendered useless by Shelby County v. Holder in 2013. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that Section 4, which provides the formula for deciding which states are covered by Section 5, was no longer constitutional. This book explains how the Voting Rights Act became vulnerable to attack and explores possibilities for restoring the preclearance regime or other new voting rights legislation.         "
"2","As in their earlier book, The Triumph of Voting Rights in the South (2016), authors Charles S. Bullock III and Ronald Keith Gaddie, this time joined by Justin J. Wert, argue that the Voting Rights Act has been extremely successful. Using primarily U.S. Census Bureau data from 2012, they show the progress made by covered states since 1965—increased voter registration and turnout among African Americans and steady increases in the numbers of black elected officials in covered states, especially in those that have been covered the longest.         "
"3","Is the picture rosy because Barack Obama was on the ballot in 2012? The authors compare 2004 and 2008 turnout; although Obama clearly drew black voters to the polls, the gap between black and white voters had already narrowed considerably by 2004. However, it is disturbing that the large states of Florida and Texas had racial gaps of 12.7 and 6.8 percentage points, respectively, in 2004."
"4","Bullock, Gaddie, and Wert trace the efforts to weaken the Voting Rights Act, from the 2006 renewal debate to the Shelby County decision. They report the unsurprising finding that Republicans in covered districts were more likely than other legislators to support amending the act to reduce federal oversight of their districts. Covered jurisdictions—mostly southern states—argued they were being punished for the sins of previous generations, and that the act, originally enacted for five years, had outlasted its justification. The authors pay particular attention to the 20‐year campaign against the Voting Rights Act by Edward Blum, who sought out the plaintiffs for both the NAMUDNO and Shelby cases.         "
"5","A major argument of the book is that it was a strategic error for supporters of the Voting Rights Act to resist amending the coverage formula; an updated formula, they believe, would not have been struck down by the Supreme Court. The authors propose that VRA supporters suffered from “probability neglect”—fearing a danger without reference to its likelihood. However, we never hear the advocates’ arguments against amending Section 4; nor do we hear whether they have post‐Shelby regrets.         "
"6","The final chapter reviews several possible replacements for the invalidated Section 4 coverage formula but also questions whether a replacement is workable or wise. The authors do not address at all the political possibilities—what Republican Congress would vote for a new coverage formula?"
"7","The Rise and Fall of the Voting Rights Act, in its very understated way, raises some other provocative questions—about whether racial voting patterns in the South today make separating racial and partisan motivations impossible, for example. Despite some important omissions, it succeeds in making us think about the path forward.         "
