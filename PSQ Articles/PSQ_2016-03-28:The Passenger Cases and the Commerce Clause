"1","This book examines the political and legal struggles provoked by efforts at various levels of government to manage the growing number of immigrants to the United States during the decades before the Civil War. It considers the background to, the struggle over, and the consequences of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Norris v. the City of Boston and Smith v. Turner, collectively known as the Passenger Cases (1849). The antebellum politics of immigration were contentious enough, giving rise to the anti‐immigrant and anti‐Catholic Know‐Nothing Party, but what Freyer shows is that looming behind these struggles was an even more contentious set of issues related to slavery. The power to regulate immigration, and questions about where that power resided, necessarily reflected on the power of government to control the institution of slavery.         "
"2","During the early years of the nineteenth century, American governments at the federal, state, and local levels sought to regulate and manage growing levels of immigration. This was particularly important in states such as New York and Massachusetts, which witnessed the highest levels of European immigration in these years. At the heart of these efforts were “alien taxes” levied on immigrants and on the captains and crews of ships carrying immigrants into port. These taxes helped support local welfare institutions, which some feared would be swamped by growing numbers of impoverished immigrants. Shipmasters would come to contest these laws, claiming that state and local governments had no right to regulate what was rightfully the responsibility of the federal government, an argument that ultimately was made before the Supreme Court in the Passenger Cases."
"3","Freyer demonstrates that a critical, although contested, precedent for the Passenger Cases was the “commerce‐person” distinction established by the Court's decision in City of New York v. Miln (1837). This distinction enabled the Court to allow state and local governments to exercise police powers over the movement of people while reserving for the federal government the regulation of commerce. While the laws at issue concerned white immigrants, Freyer makes it clear that the author of this decision, Virginian Philip P. Barbour, was concerned about ensuring the right of Southern states to regulate the movement of slaves and free blacks. On the heels of Nat Turner's slave rebellion, the rise of militant abolitionists, and the end of slavery in the British West Indies, Barbour and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney were eager to ensure that the federal government's commerce power did not interfere with state governments' efforts to defend slavery.         "
"4","As Freyer shows, however, the majority of the Court had never accepted the “commerce‐person” distinction. In the Passenger Cases, a narrow majority rejected the distinction and invalidated the alien tax laws, although the Court remained deeply divided. This division, and its implications for such explosive issues as the exclusion of free blacks from Southern states, the regulation the interstate slave trade by the federal government, and the extension of limited citizenship rights to Northern free blacks through “personal liberty laws,” would play a critical role in the growing sectional tensions that produced the Civil War."
"5","Freyer also traces the postbellum importance of the Passenger Cases, even though the cases' precedential significance declined in the wake of the Civil War and especially the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. He follows this story all the way up to the Supreme Court's recent decisions on Arizona's regulation of undocumented immigrants. Overall, Freyer provides a rich and complex picture of the legal and political context of the Passenger Cases that deepens our understanding of the decades preceding the Civil War."
