"1","As protesters swarmed the streets of Middle Eastern capitals in 2011, observers wondered whether Tiananmen Square would mirror Tahrir Square. Yet the streets of the Beijing have remained quiet. Why has Hosni Mubarak's Egyptian regime collapsed while the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has survived?"
"2","In this timely, important addition to the literature on authoritarian resilience, Jeremy Wallace argues that Beijing's skillful management of urbanization—especially in the four decades since China has pursued industrialization and market reforms—helps explain the regime's endurance. Large cities are dangerous for nondemocratic regimes: they bring many people together in close proximity to one another, increasing the potential for collective action and undermining officials’ attempts to understand and control the population. But cities are also engines of industrialization and economic growth—a crucial source of regime legitimacy. As a result, Wallace argues, regimes often choose to make a “Faustian bargain” (p. 7), pursuing urban‐biased policies that placate major city dwellers in the short term but increase the risk of instability in the long term by encouraging rural residents to migrate to major cities."
"3","Two chapters analyze cross‐national quantitative data to support these arguments, showing that urban‐biased policies lead to higher levels of urban concentration—a larger share of the urban population living in the country's largest cities—over time and that nondemocratic regimes with high levels of urban concentration do not last as long as other regimes. Wallace also shows a relationship between external shocks and urban‐biased policies, suggesting that regimes tend to embrace this deal with the devil in the face of acute threats to stability but shift away from urban bias once the specter of protest in major cities has passed."
"4","Although the book's overarching argument will engage a wide range of readers, students of modern China will especially enjoy the three chapters detailing the history of the CCP's obsession with maintaining stability by managing urban growth. As in the case of the disastrous Great Leap Forward, this preoccupation has often meant putting the needs of city dwellers, especially those in critical political centers such as Beijing and Shanghai, before the lives of millions of farmers dispersed across the vast countryside. Wallace's crucial insight is that the CCP's survival has hinged in part on the “loophole” (p. 73) it has found to the unintended consequences of urban bias: restricting population flows to key cities through its hukou (household registration) system, which denies rural migrants many of the rights and privileges granted to native city dwellers. Even as the regime has loosened migration restrictions to help supply coastal factories with cheap labor, it has sought to reduce the incentives for farmers to migrate to certain cities, particularly provincial capitals or more restive cities, by redistributing urban revenues to nearby rural communities and eliminating agricultural taxes nationally. These two population management policies help explain several other puzzles about China today, including why China has fewer slums than most developing nations and how local officials reconcile the competing goals of economic growth and social stability.         "
"5","With this painstakingly researched and carefully argued debut, Wallace has contributed considerably to our understanding of the relationship between human geography and domestic political stability in nondemocratic regimes. His account reminds us that the CCP's obsession with thwarting the potential for collective action extends far beyond the realm of social media and into its citizens’ physical lives. If other nondemocratic regimes view the China model as an alternative to Western liberal democracy, Wallace's argument suggests that these governments similarly may attempt to influence their citizens’ freedom of movement to promote economic growth and prolong regime survival."
