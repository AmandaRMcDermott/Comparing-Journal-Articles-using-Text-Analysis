"1","In this book, Christopher Devine and Kyle C. Kopko examine a timely question: do vice presidents help deliver their home state and tip the scales in presidential elections? At the time of the book's publication in early 2016, countless political reporters and pundits were discussing this very issue. It is a testament to the importance of Devine and Kopko's work that dozens of media outlets—Politico, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal—have featured The VP Advantage.         "
"2","What is most impressive about The VP Advantage is its breadth. Methodologically, Devine and Kopko's research blends historical analysis, case studies, media content analysis, and advanced statistical modeling. Substantively, the book leads the reader through a natural progression of questions and puzzles about vice presidential selection and home state effects. In the end, the book is a smooth and enjoyable (yet sophisticated) portrait of a vice president's political role. It is no doubt the definitive work on this issue.         "
"3","In the first part, Devine and Kopko trace the historical origins and evolution of the vice president home state advantage (HSA), identifying constitutional design and sectional divisions in the nineteenth century as key sources of this presumed effect. In the twentieth century, however, with vice presidents exercising a stronger institutional role and a decline in sectional divisions, questions were raised about the existence of the home state advantage. Yet, as Devine and Kopko show in Chapter 2, belief in the HSA is alive and well. In an impressive content analysis of news articles, they find that nearly half of all “veepstakes” stories discuss home state or regional effects as a key calculus in VP selection. Such views are not limited to media personalities, either. In Chapter 3, they show that vice presidential finalists tend to come disproportionately from battleground states."
"4","As a whole, the first half of the book documents just how ingrained the home state advantage is in our political psyche. But is the truism true? Devine and Kopko turn to this question in Chapters 4–7. Based on an impressive range of analyses, they give a clear answer: no! From 1884 to 2012, they estimate, a president's running mate netted a mere 0.5 percent bonus (one‐half of one percent) in the VP's home state (a statistically insignificant effect). Even the famous “Austin to Boston connection” created by the John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson ticket—often cited as the example of a VP HSA—was not decisive in delivering Texas or the South in 1960. However, not all vice presidents are created equal. Devine and Kopko do find a significant VP home state effect in small states and when the vice president had significant statewide experience.         "
"5","Given its breadth, The VP Advantage is the definitive work on this issue and should be required reading in graduate courses on campaigns, elections, primaries, and the presidency. But, like most important studies, it raises a few questions in the mind of the reader.         "
"6","One question is the extent to which this book advances our understanding of the VP home state advantage. Although the data and analyses have been extended, and a handful of new findings emerge (for example, the individual‐level results in Chapter 4 are particularly interesting), the main findings largely confirm what other authors (Christopher Devine and Kyle C. Kopko 2011, 2013 Robert L. Dudley and Ronald Rapoport 1989, and others) have found regarding the small to nonexistent HSA and the conditional effect of state size. Another question is whether recent advancements undermine Devine and Kopko's core conclusions. A paper published just a few months after Devine and Kopko's book, using an alternative measurement strategy based on synthetic controls, pegs the average vice president's home state advantage at a statistically significant 3 percent (Boris Heersink and Brenton D. Peterson 2016). What is notable about this work is its ability to address the counterfactual: what would happen if the presidential candidate selected a different running mate? In the end, this finding could reshape the conventional wisdom on the vice president's home state advantage. But, as with most issues, greater research is needed.         "
