"1","Electoral institutions are central to our understanding of democratic politics. A vast literature has asked whether direct democracy, voter registration laws, nonpartisan elections, and even ballot appearance influence voter participation. However, political scientists have tended to ignore the one institutional arrangement that is the most powerful predictor of turnout: the day an election is held."
"2","Sarah F. Anzia's Timing and Turnout offers the first comprehensive account of the causes and consequences of “off‐cycle” elections in the United States. It is worth emphasizing the prevalence of these elections: nearly 90 percent of states hold at least some municipal races apart from major national elections, and three‐quarters of states do so for school board elections (p. 16). Although scholars have long noted the relationship between off‐cycle elections and lower turnout, with some speculating that “stealth elections” favor certain groups, Anzia is the first to develop a general theory of election timing.         "
"3","Despite the fact that contemporary debates over consolidating elections are mired in technocratic arguments about costs and election administration, Anzia theorizes that election timing should be understood as an endogenous political institution that organized groups contest to enhance their electoral fortunes. Her theory is as persuasive as it is simple: election timing matters for the fate of organized interests whose supporters will turn out regardless of when an election is held. Thus, when voter turnout declines in off‐cycle elections, the influence of the organized swells because group members are typically more motivated to participate and mobilization packs more punch in low‐turnout contests. The fact that organized groups (parties, interest groups) can benefit from off‐cycle elections helps explain one of the book's most interesting findings: despite the introduction of scores of election consolidation bills during the 2000 s and overwhelming support from the mass public for reform, only a handful of states have moved local elections on cycle.         "
"4","To test her theory that off‐cycle elections are a boon for organized groups, Anzia first examines the case of teachers' unions. Because teachers' unions have strong occupational incentives to participate in school board elections, they should benefit from off‐cycle board elections that feature less competition from casual voters who only show up at the polls during presidential elections. Exploiting intrastate variation in the timing of board elections, Anzia finds that teachers' unions secure a nontrivial boost in pay simply by virtue of off‐cycle elections. While most of the author's empirical evidence focuses on school districts, Chapter 6 shows that the consequences of election timing are not limited to single‐purpose governments. Firefighters' unions in California also win higher salaries when municipal governments hold their city council elections off cycle."
"5","Two strengths of the book are its careful attention to causal identification and the fact that Anzia tests her theoretical framework in a variety of contexts across both time and space. For example, the author demolishes the conventional wisdom that off‐cycle elections are a mere outgrowth of Progressive Era reforms aimed at weakening party patronage. A trio of case studies examining off‐cycle elections in nineteenth‐century Philadelphia, New York City, and San Francisco show that the electoral calendar was routinely manipulated by state parties to grow their power in local government well before the Progressives arrived on the scene."
"6","In sum, Timing and Turnout should appeal to a broad mix of political scientists from parties and interest group scholars to those interested in local politics and public policy. As much as the book enhances our understanding of a heretofore ignored electoral institution, its greatest contribution lies in the fact that its policy relevant findings are sure to put more sunlight on policymakers to justify the trade‐offs of using off‐cycle elections.
