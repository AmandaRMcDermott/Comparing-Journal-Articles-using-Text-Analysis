"1","Rising income inequality has recently been the subject of a flurry of journalistic and political attention. It has also spurred a resurgence of scholarly attention to income inequality within political science with a multitude of books exploring the political effects of these economic trends, including Larry Bartels's Unequal Democracy, Martin Gilens's Affluence and Influence, Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson's Winner‐Take‐All Politics, and Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole, and Howard Rosenthal's Polarized America, to name a few. Income inequality's rising salience in the popular and scholarly spheres makes it a critical topic to cover in undergraduate courses. In this context, Stephen M. Caliendo's Inequality in America: Race, Poverty, and Fulfilling Democracy's Promise is a welcome addition to American politics classes.         "
"2","Caliendo's textbook covers an array of important topics within the broad field of American income inequality. He provides a thorough exploration of America's representational design and offers detailed definitions of income and wealth alongside trends in both variables. Moreover, his chapters deal with two critical demographic dimensions of income inequality—race and gender—outlining how these two characteristics are closely intertwined with questions of income and political inequality."
"3","In addition to providing foundational definitions, Caliendo's textbook offers an excellent introduction to the drivers of income inequality, with a particular focus on racial income inequality. He outlines how American housing and educational policy contributed to and reinforced contemporary patterns of income inequality."
"4","Finally, Caliendo explores the consequences of rising income inequality and policy solutions. A chapter on health provides concrete examples of how income inequality might shape the day‐to‐day lives of Americans. A chapter on the effect of criminal records on employment outcomes similarly offers a window into the implications of inequality for future mobility. Finally, a chapter on affirmative action investigates potential policy solutions that might help mitigate the trends discussed in prior sections of the textbook."
"5","As with any textbook (or, indeed, any book more generally), the author undoubtedly had to make tough trade‐offs about what aspects of the central problem under study—in this case, income inequality—to include. Nonetheless, there are several areas of the book where further details might be helpful. While the chapter on crime and employment does an excellent job of connecting these two important variables, a wealth of recent political science research on incarceration has expanded beyond focusing on economic consequences by exploring political and democratic consequences. For example, Arresting Citizenship by Amy Lerman and Vesla Weaver investigates the implications of the rise of the carceral state for political trust and participation. Similarly, Caliendo's chapter on policy solutions to income inequality focuses on one important and prominent possibility—affirmative action—but does not discuss another, perhaps equally salient, means of redressing income inequality—the tax code.         "
"6","These issues notwithstanding, Inequality in America provides a helpful outline of an important and relevant topic, in both the popular and the scholarly spheres. It will make a useful addition to introductory American politics classes and lecture courses focused on inequality in American politics.         "
