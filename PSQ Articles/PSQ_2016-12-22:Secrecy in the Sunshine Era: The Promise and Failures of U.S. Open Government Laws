"1","When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the landmark Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, he wrote of his “deep sense of pride that the United States is an open society in which the people's right to know is cherished and guarded.” Behind the scenes, Johnson sang a different tune. According to Bill Moyers, who served as his press secretary, “LBJ had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the signing ceremony. He hated the very idea of the Freedom of Information Act” (Moyers, “In the Kingdom of the Half‐Blind,” address for the 20th anniversary of the National Security Archive, Washington, DC, 9 December 2005)."
"2","And so began the first in a series of dysfunctional relationships between presidential administrations and modern open government laws. Those relationships are the subject of Jason Ross Arnold's compelling new book, Secrecy in the Sunshine Era: The Promise and Failures of U.S. Open Government Laws. Arnold, an assistant professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University, describes “the post‐1970s period” as “the sunshine era” (p. 3) in light of the host of federal “sunshine laws” that followed FOIA and passed “in quick succession in the 1970s” (p. 2). These laws held, and continue to hold, enormous promise for transparent and accountable government. But laws do not implement themselves. The tale of the sunshine era is thus as much about presidential administrations’ attitudes and actions toward the sunshine laws, and toward government transparency in general, as it is about the laws themselves.         "
"3","After offering some normative guidance to help distinguish between necessary and unnecessary secrecy (pp. 14–36), Ross assesses the transparency records of every sunshine‐era presidential administration, from Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush through the first few years of Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He demonstrates that each administration's record—both in terms of its compliance with sunshine laws and its use of secrecy tools such as the state secrets privilege and the classification system—is mixed, with some administrations clearly better or worse than others along some dimensions. The book's real payoff is not in this unsurprising takeaway but in the fascinating and copious detail with which it is drawn. With clarity and wit, Ross presents one example after another of techniques—ranging from the ham‐handed to the ingenious—through which administrations have obstructed sunshine laws or otherwise protected opacity. Ross also details the occasional triumph, including instances of administrations complying with statutory mandates or proactively undertaking transparency initiatives."
"4","The book's smart organization amplifies the impact of these details. It also enhances the reader's appreciation for each detail's place in the larger tale of the sunshine era. Rather than proceeding chronologically, the book breaks its discussion of the Reagan through George W. Bush administrations into issue areas. Several chapters are devoted to distinct issues—one chapter's topic, for instance, is the Federal Advisory Committee Act (pp. 97–133) and another's is “secret law” (pp. 134–164)—and each chapter explores and compares administration's records on that issue. The one exception is the Obama administration, which receives its own chapter toward the book's end (pp. 324–373). This is a sound choice in light of the still‐developing story that is the Obama administration. The Obama chapter also serves as an effective location for readers to review and reflect upon all of the issue areas raised in the book."
"5","Secrecy in the Sunshine Era is a terrific resource, one that documents the ambivalent relationships between sunshine era administrations and government transparency in exhaustive and compelling detail. Readers from across disciplinary and ideological spectrums will benefit from its contributions.         "
