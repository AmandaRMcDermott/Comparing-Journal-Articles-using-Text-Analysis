"1","Whether and how citizens organize their political thinking is a subject of vast scholarship in public opinion. In this debate, Paul Goren defends the voter, positing that three policy principles are “central heuristics in the belief systems” of American citizens (p. 3). The general principles are limited government, traditional morality, and defense/military. He argues that these policy principles provide a central framework within which citizens—both sophisticated and unsophisticated—evaluate presidential candidates. On Voter Competence argues that policy principles are distinct from ideology as an organizer of belief systems, and as important, or more important, than other models of vote choice (for example, partisan or retrospective vote choice). In distinguishing his work from that of others, he provides a theoretically rich treatment that is masterfully placed within much of the key public opinion literature from the last 50 years.         "
"2","Goren argues that his theory and evidence show that “policy principles lie in that sweet spot of mass belief systems; neither too abstract, such as liberal–conservative worldviews, nor too concrete, such as particular issues, to elude all but the most‐diligent citizens” (p. 10). His theory is intuitively appealing, and well‐supported with careful and extensive data analysis."
"3","To test his hypotheses, the bulk of the book uses the American National Election Study data (1988–2008), but he also uses original survey data in analyzing whether “basic human values” contribute to policy principles. He commissioned two surveys from Knowledge Networks and participated in one from YouGov/Polimetrix. The book provides some great footnotes about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two different Internet survey sampling protocols (p. 170). Goren does have a number of interesting methodological notes (for example, non‐attitude discussion, pp. 90–91)."
"4","I have a couple of quibbles with On Voter Competence. In particular, I find it surprising that Goren does not include race/identity policy as one of the central policy principles. Goren is correct that politicians do not openly encourage segregation, but some citizens do “endorse negative stereotypes about the work ethic of blacks and Hispanics” and use those stereotypes to “oppose means‐tested welfare programs” (p. 171; from his description of race as a control variable). Goren responds to this general criticism early on and in his concluding chapter: “race matters, but not, in my judgment, to the extent that battles over limited government, social change, and military power do” (p. 238). I argue that the policy cleavages he studies derive directly from race and views about target populations. Perhaps issues that are fundamentally about race are framed in non‐racial language?         "
"5","Also, he argues that the policy principles he advances are “deeply rooted in basic human values” and are different from core political values; the core political values argument is convincing (p. 167). However, I question whether his empirical analyses are consistent with the basic values theory. Goren provides the visual heuristic that psychologists (Shalom H. Schwartz, in particular, p. 163) use to understand basic human values: a circumplex, which outlines the relationships among values. The circumplex simplifies a variety of life values into four major groups, all of which “oppose each other to form a bipolar value dimension” (p. 164). Yet, neither his theoretical predictions nor his models indicate to me “bi‐polarity” in the relationship between the basic values and policy principles."
"6","Despite my quibbles, I find the arguments and evidence convincing—that there is policy principle voting among voters of all sophistication levels. Undoubtedly, public opinion scholars for years to come will debate and test the implications of what Goren offers."
