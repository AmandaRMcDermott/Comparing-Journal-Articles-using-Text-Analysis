"1","A search for the title phrases United States, U.S., or American Constitution on the books portion of the Amazon.com website (in July 2012) yielded more than 4,500 hits. Even allowing for duplicate editions, that's a daunting number. And it is dwarfed by Amazon's claim to 72,000 titles containing the phrase “U.S. Supreme Court.” Why should we want yet another book on either subject?"
"2","Walter M. Frank, retired chief of commercial litigation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, provides a good answer in this unusual and useful book, especially for students first studying the Constitution and the Court. It is neither a treatise on doctrine (though it introduces several constitutional themes), nor an institutional or biographical history of the Court (though it points to several historical moments). It is, rather, an engaging and readable study of how and why the Court does what it does, and with what intellectual and other resources, when it interprets the constitutional text. Nor is the story told solely in the justices' words. Frank has read widely, and he cogently but lightly responds to claims and counterclaims by presenting the findings of many scholars."
"3","About a third of the book highlights major constitutional topics: ratification, the Bill of Rights, other amendments, including a more extensive discussion of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court's sources of power, judicial review, the nature of constitutional litigation, national power, federalism, and separation of powers. Frank tells these and other stories by selecting an important case or two to demonstrate the types of questions that arise and the responses the Court has offered to the issues that confront it. So, for example, City of Boerne v. Flores (1997) illustrates the ways by which the Court and Congress talk to each other; Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut (2005) contains lessons about judicial restraint. Most of these highlights are quite brief, but Frank consistently weaves biographical tidbits of current and former justices to help explain the clashes and decisions and why the Court cannot be a computer chugging through to a preordained answer. He concludes with lengthier discussions of six current controversies: public displays of the Ten Commandments; affirmative action in public schools; campaign finance reform (including Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2011); abortion; legislative reapportionment; and, through DeShaney v. Winnebago County (1988), the government's duty to protect its citizens from each other. These discussions, like the earlier case studies, are not offered simply to provide the reader with the state of the law, but to show how the Court received the issues and the problems with which it had to wrestle in coming to terms with the contending parties. (Two appendices briefly describe 108 significant cases decided by a 5–4 vote.)         "
"4","Beyond the constitutional cases, Frank considers the ways cases move through the courts, the tools judges have to resolve issues, and why and how the Constitution so rarely provides clear guidance. Perhaps the most useful part of the book is a chapter that takes the reader through nine contrasting judicial perspectives on interpretation. A whole course could be taught around them."
"5","The book is remarkably free of factual errors. The few that crept in are minor (Lincoln did not use the term “suicide pact” [111]; the Court's clerks do not come straight from school but from other clerkships [135]). If there is any downside to this book, it is only that it is, as its title proclaims, a “primer,” and it will leave the curious reader hungering for more detail at greater depth. Just what an introduction should do."
