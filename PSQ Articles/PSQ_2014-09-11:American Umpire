"1","Studies of American foreign policy wrestle with identifying grand themes that illustrate patterns in choices and policymaking, while also recognizing differences that may be unique to an event or result from specific circumstances that often are not replicated. Cast very broadly, the contrast reveals an underlying difference in conceptual approach by political scientists versus historians. As Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman writes, historians “emphasize contingency, complexity, and the unanticipated … Few principles apply all the time” (p. 5). Her monumental work, American Umpire, does both: It argues persuasively that history shows the United States acting as an “umpire” rather than an “empire” in world affairs, and then applies this concept to American foreign policy from the eighteenth century to the present.         "
"2","By “umpire,” Hoffman means that the United States limits foreign intervention to specific goals. The United States stays out of international conflicts until action is needed to require other states to comply with rules that are widely recognized as having “broad legitimacy” (p. 17). Since the late eighteenth century, the United States and other nation‐states seeking democratic capitalism have gradually moved toward embracing three goals: “access to opportunity, arbitration of disputes, and transparency in government” (p. 6). Hoffman maintains that nation‐states pursued these goals for pragmatic reasons, not ideological ones, and that people around the world consciously aimed to make these changes in their lives.         "
"3","The path to democratic capitalism ended the previous world order of empires. Hoffman identifies several definitions of empire, none of which explains U.S. foreign relations comprehensively. An empire typically controls multiple ethnic groups, either directly or from afar. While the United States did control countries abroad after the Spanish‐American War of 1898, it shifted away from this role after World War II. During the Cold War, “empire” referred to several areas of international dominance, from trade to territory to military intervention. Hoffman argues that U.S. foreign policy from the Cold War to the present does not fit any of these definitions. Although the United States has intervened abroad on several occasions, in each case, afterward, “the United States retreated to its position as a single nation‐state, with no on‐going administrative power outside its territory” (p. 17)."
"4","Hoffman presents an original thesis for reinterpreting American foreign policy and develops it with a comprehensive study of major international transitions in U.S. history. Her book convincingly makes the argument that principles of access, arbitration, and transparency are more accurately viewed as global goals than Western ones, and that they created a new world order favored by many nations, not just the United States. And the umpire role is complicated; the United States is expected to lead international action when conflicts between states cannot be resolved peacefully, but doing so is costly, in dollars and lives. Consistency in applying foreign policy principles in practice also is difficult to achieve, especially when interests conflict (for example, having alliances with states that violate human rights, to maintain stability in the region)."
"5","The challenge with overarching concepts, as Hoffman notes, is that they are difficult to demonstrate definitively throughout every example, and the “umpire” metaphor is no exception. For example, Hoffman says that during the Cold War, the United States “occasionally acted like a bully. But bullying … was a symptom of weakness” (p. 295). Some U.S. political elites believed that the United States should have acted more aggressively, whether by liberating Eastern European nations from communism or by continuing the war in Vietnam. The United States may have acted more as an “umpire” than an “empire,” but was this role unavoidable, or might different political leaders have moved the country, and the world, in a different direction? Some discussion of these possibilities would inform the conclusion, but this does not detract from the significant contribution that this thoroughly researched and engaging narrative makes to understanding the broad arc of American foreign policy."
