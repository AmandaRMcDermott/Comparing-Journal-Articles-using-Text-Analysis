"1","Although all 27 amendments to the U.S. Constitution were first approved by Congress and then ratified by the states, Article V of the Constitution also allows for “a convention for proposing amendments.” The convention mechanism has never been used, but frustration with the difficulty of getting amendments through Congress has pushed constitutional reformers to seriously consider this mode of amendment. That there is no precedent for an Article V convention, however, raises questions about the constitutionality and practicality of using conventions to effect limited constitutional change. In Conventional Wisdom, John R. Vile sets out to address these questions, and the result is a valuable work of scholarship of interest to constitutional scholars and political practitioners alike.         "
"2","Vile confronts the two biggest objections to using Article V conventions to amend the Constitution. First, many argue that Article V does not permit Congress or the states to limit the amendments proposed in an Article V convention, which suggests that the convention mechanism is appropriate only for considering wholesale changes to the Constitution. But Vile adduces evidence showing that many Framers, most notably, Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist, No. 85, understood Article V as allowing for limited conventions. Vile also explains how it came to be “conventional wisdom” that the convention mechanism was intended for systemic constitutional revision rather than for proposing a single amendment or narrow set of amendments. With a sweeping review of early constitutional commentary and the history of constitutional amendments and conventions in the United States, Vile argues persuasively that this view is in part attributable to the fact that the amendments making up the Bill of Rights, which were approved by Congress and ratified by the states shortly after the Constitution's ratification, set a precedent that quickly, if unintentionally, made congressional approval and state ratification the default amendment mechanism and, in turn, biased subsequent views on the purpose of Article V conventions.         "
"3","The strength of Vile's book consists in its efforts to address the second objection to Article V conventions, namely, that there exist no practical guidelines for organizing a limited convention. This leaves open many questions about the logistics of limiting the convention's scope, choosing a location, selecting delegates, and defining rules of procedure, among other things. Vile sensibly argues that although no specific Article V convention precedent exists, history nonetheless offers much guidance in addressing these questions. He carefully outlines the practical issues surrounding Article V conventions, combs U.S. political and legal history for solutions, and, in the final chapter, synthesizes the historical data into a practicable blueprint for limited Article V conventions. The breadth of Vile's historical survey is impressive, and Vile uses it to good effect, distilling from it important insights on how to limit an Article V convention and when it makes sense to use the convention device to propose amendments."
"4","Those looking for a sustained argument in favor of Article V conventions as a valuable approach to constitutional change today may find Conventional Wisdom disappointing. Such an argument would involve stronger normative and empirical defenses of the convention mechanism than Vile provides here, and it would require Vile to engage more thoroughly with research in contemporary constitutional theory and comparative constitutionalism. But this book is intended more as a handbook than a work of persuasion. Vile is not an advocate but rather a scholar committed to clarifying the mechanics of Article V. Yet even those who expected something more polemical will find value in the book, for the breadth, if not always the depth, of Vile's historical analysis makes it an essential reference for anyone interested in Article V conventions or amendment processes more generally.
