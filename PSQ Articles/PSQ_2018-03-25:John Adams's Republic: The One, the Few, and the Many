"1","In his Thoughts on Government, John Adams remarked that “poets read history to collect flowers, not fruits—they attend to fanciful images, not the effects of social institutions” (pp. 175–176). Richard Alan Ryerson, the editor in chief of the Massachusetts Historical Society's Adams Papers project from 1983 to 2001 and the former academic director and historian of the David Library of the American Revolution, is no poet; rather, he is a gifted historian who has carefully read and closely analyzed all of the second president's extensive public writings, letters, and private papers to produce a magisterial account of Adams's political thought and its development over six decades. There is nothing flowery about Ryerson's work; it is a dense, extraordinarily well‐researched book that, nevertheless, is clearly written and capable of bearing great fruit for the attentive reader. And, it very much attends to the effects of the social institutions that mattered most for Adams—aristocracy, in particular.         "
"2","Ryerson begins John Adams's Republic by describing that republic. It was a republic, as Ryerson's subtitle makes clear, in which sovereignty was to be divided among three “elements”: the “one,” consisting of a strong executive with an absolute veto over the acts of the legislature and nearly total control of his appointment powers so as to be able to hold the aristocracy at bay; the “few,” consisting of an aristocracy (whether natural or hereditary) that was “ubiquitous, found in every society and under every form of government across the globe,” that was “unavoidable and inevitable,” and that was “more threatening to a republic than any other form of government” (p. 17); and “the many,” the element that Ryerson considers “more difficult to characterize” (p. 17) than the others, for it was not the whole people, as most Americans during the Revolutionary era understood it, but rather a “more restrictive” subset that excluded “both the poor and the wealthy” (p. 18).         "
"3","For Adams, the real problem for a republic was the aristocracy. (By contrast, for James Madison, the problem was, as he described it in Federalist No. 10, “the people” [p. 20].) As Ryerson explains, Adam's “ideal republic was unambiguously designed to protect the people from the aristocracy” (p. 20). Ryerson spends the remainder of his remarkable book providing an explication and analysis of Adams's private and public writings highlighting Adams's fear of aristocracy and the need for a powerful executive to counter it, and by so doing, contradicting the erroneous contention, held by both many of his contemporaries and most subsequent historians that Adams was in favor of aristocracy.         "
"4","After his masterful introduction, Ryerson provides documentary evidence of the development and evolution of Adams's understanding of what a republic requires. He begins in the 1760s with his analysis of his “Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law”; continues with his consideration of Adams's reply to the Massachusetts House of Representatives to Governor Thomas Hutchinson in 1783; includes his extensive discussion of Adams's “Novanglus” essays written during 1774–1775; explains in detail Adams's short but significant pamphlet, Thoughts on Government, his draft of the 1790 Massachusetts Constitution, his three‐volume Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America (1787–1788), and his “Discourses of Davila” (1805); and addresses throughout Adams's many private letters and reflections, all to show the deepening of Adams's political thought on these matters.         "
"5","Ryerson is intent on showing that Adam's political thought has contemporary relevance. He alludes to the growing aristocratic influence of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs (p. 430). Adams thought aristocrats could be confined to the upper chambers of state legislatures and to the U.S. Senate. Ryerson's compelling intellectual biography of John Adams leaves us asking whether his republican remedy for the problem of aristocracy that he believed adequate in the eighteenth century remains adequate in the twentieth‐first century."
