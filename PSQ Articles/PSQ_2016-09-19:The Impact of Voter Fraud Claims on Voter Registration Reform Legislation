"1","IN RECENT YEARS, CONCERNS ABOUT VOTER FRAUD have grown louder, leading to calls for legislation to require voter identification and citizenship documentation. Such legislation has a cost, as experience shows it reduces the turnout of eligible voters. Is there a sudden epidemic of fraud? No. The available evidence shows that voter fraud is rare in the United States. This recent storm of concern about fraud is best understood as a partisan strategy to constrict the electorate."
"2","This is not a new phenomenon: it dates back at least as far as the Progressive Era imposition of personal registration to combat alleged fraud. Time and again, concerns about the danger of fraud have been raised to defeat legislation designed to expand access to the vote. This article will demonstrate how the pattern of using claims of fraud to constrict electoral participation played out in three late twentieth‐century efforts to pass federal legislation to make voter registration easier."
"3","While these three voter registration reform efforts were under way, little research was available on election fraud, but since the 2000 presidential election, scholars have done much to show how rare voter fraud is in the United States. Studies by Justin Levitt and by David Callahan and Lorraine Minnite have demonstrated that most allegations of fraud were not substantiated.1 Levitt, writing for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, pursued an array of allegations of voter fraud, finding that most allegations were the product of clerical errors, bad list matching, or inaccurate assumptions.2 Minnite's The Myth of Voter Fraud carefully defined voter fraud, as opposed to other forms of election fraud or corruption, and used databases of legal cases to determine the extent of fraud. In 1996, the Federal Integrated Database reported four charges of voter fraud; even at the height of the George W. Bush administration's full‐court press to prosecute voter fraud in 2005, only 60 cases were brought.3 Minnite also carefully unpacked several reported incidents of voter fraud—including allegations by the short‐lived American Center for Voting Rights—and found that many turned out to be minor mischief, voter error, or simply unsubstantiated.4 Spencer Overton, in his book Stealing Democracy, also examined allegations of voter fraud and largely found them baseless.5"
"4","Of course, this is not to say that U.S. elections are beyond taint; there is a long history of corruption and impropriety around elections, as Tracy Campbell has recounted.6 But much of the corruption and fraud that has occurred is not strictly speaking voter fraud, or fraud committed by voters, and even less has anything to do with the registration process. Of the 12 types of election fraud identified by the U.S. Department of Justice, only five are related to the registration process.7 One need not be registered to vote to intimidate voters, for example. Several types of fraud require access to the election process and records and can only be done by election officials or with their cooperation.         "
"5","The fraud that does occur will not be reduced by the proposed remedies; voter ID laws can only curtail voter impersonation, of which there are almost no reported cases, as Levitt and Overton have shown.8 Levitt's exhaustive effort to pursue every allegation of voter impersonation between 2000 and 2014 identified only 31 credible incidents. Voter ID laws do, however, reduce turnout, as they erect additional obstacles to the vote.9 If the dangers of fraud are minimal, why restrict access to the electorate in an effort to fight fraud? Or is the restriction of the electorate not an unfortunate byproduct of these policies but a central goal?         "
"6","The answer has a lot to do with electoral competition. Just as parties compete by mobilizing the voters they expect will support them, they compete by demobilizing those unlikely to support them. Both parties, over time, have used voter suppression tactics to limit the vote of those they expect will vote for their opponents. J. Morgan Kousser demonstrated in 1974 the ways in which the Southern disfranchisement after Reconstruction was about both race and electoral competition;10 others have demonstrated the ways that both Democrats and Republicans have used various vote suppression tactics to limit the vote of their opponents.11 The same logic applies to efforts to pass or block legislation that would facilitate registration and voting.         "
"7","Over the period in question, during the debates about voter registration reform legislation, Democrats generally supported making it easier to register to vote, and Republicans generally opposed it. There is a clear political calculus involved here: the groups that are less likely to be registered—low‐income people, people of color, and young adults—are more likely to be Democrats. So Democrats usually believe they will benefit from an expansion of the electorate, and Republicans usually expect they will not. Clearly, this is a generalization—there are people in both parties committed to a robust electorate whatever the political consequences, and particular political circumstances may change the political calculus of particular Democrats and Republicans. Southern Democrats, for example, resisted the national party's push for postcard legislation in the early 1970s to limit the impact of the Voting Rights Act on their own political futures. A Democrat may believe that his or her rival's supporters will be mobilized by an expansion of the electorate, or a Republican may see opportunity in broader registration (as Newt Gingrich did, briefly, in the 1980s). Of course, both parties usually avoid defending their position by claiming that they will benefit politically, but this political calculus underlies arguments about fraud."
"8","Several scholars have recognized the ways that the construction and use of election rules and procedures to limit voting access, and the role that fears of fraud have played in creating those rules and procedures, is a long‐standing phenomenon. Walter Dean Burnham drew our attention to the way a sharp drop in party competition explained the significant decline in voter participation around the beginning of the twentieth century, and he later identified changes in voter registration laws as “a highly significant intervening variable” in that process.12 Those changes in voter registration laws—and concurrent changes in the laws governing political parties—were justified by allegations of massive voter fraud but likely “eliminate[ed] many honest votes on the part of marginally involved citizens.”13 Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward argued that the voter registration system must be viewed as a political construction that shaped the electorate, demobilizing voters and maintaining that shrunken electorate once political competition returned—that “only by attending to the interaction between the changing patterns of party competition and the rules governing party organization and voter participation can the decline in voter turnout be satisfactorily explained.”14 Piven, Minnite, and Groarke argued that parties compete at least as much by demobilization of voters as by mobilization and demonstrated several ways in which electoral institutions and rules were used to shape the electorate.15"
"9","This article will examine Senator Gale McGee's campaign for national postcard registration in the early 1970s, President Jimmy Carter's effort to enact Election Day registration, and the campaign for comprehensive voter registration reform that resulted in the passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993. In each of the cases, exaggerated claims of fraud were presented—with little or no evidence—and used to derail legislative efforts to make it easier to register to vote. The limited evidence available showed no danger of increased fraud. Yet in the first two cases examined, concerns about fraud derailed voter registration reform; in the third, such concerns nearly defeated the legislation, then reshaped it in ways that limited its effectiveness. Implementation of the NVRA continues to be less than robust in many states, and there have been several legislative efforts to limit its reach. This article will argue that the opposition these legislative efforts faced is best understood as a partisan strategy to limit the electorate."
"10","In the early 1970s, Senator Gale McGee, a Wyoming Democrat, led a campaign to enact a national postcard registration law. Despite the fact that a sizable minority of states had experience with mail registration, and existing research showed no increase in fraud, McGee's proposal was defeated."
"11","Opposition to McGee's bill came from Republicans and from Southern Democrats. As Table 1 shows, on the nine floor votes on postcard registration between 1971 and 1976 in either house, more than 75 percent of Democrats supported the bill, while Republican support ranged from 9 percent to 29 percent. In 1972, only 21 percent of Southern Democrats supported postcard registration; Southern Democrat George Allen (D‐AL) joined Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Bob Dole and other Republicans in leading the charge against McGee's bill.         "
"12","Southern Democrats, like Republicans, feared that postcard registration would facilitate the registration of voters who would not support them. White Southern Democrats voted into office by a largely white electorate feared competition from black Democratic candidates if black participation increased."
"13","The danger of fraud was one of the key arguments raised against the bill. Senator Allen facetiously nicknamed it the “Tombstone Registration Act,” claiming that it would “facilitate the registration of persons not qualified to vote and who may not even exist.”16 Senator Hubert H. Humphrey suggested that the bill's opponents were focused on the wrong problem: “The greatest fraud in the electoral process is the impediment, the obstacles that are placed in the way of a man casting his ballot,” he said.17"
"14","Opponents raised other concerns: the cost of postcard registration and the danger of federal intrusion into election administration. Some also argued that nonvoters were simply uninterested in politics. But the debate, in committee hearings, in the media, and on the congressional floor, was dominated by fears of fraud."
"15","Early on, there was little evidence to resolve the fraud argument. Although mail registration was allowed by law in almost half the states, it was primarily reserved for special categories of citizens in most of those states. Only five states allowed all citizens to register by mail: Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Seventeen additional states allowed citizens in specific situations (for example, those who were ill, away, or in the military) to register by mail. Nevertheless, only two studies examined the effectiveness and integrity of mail registration."
"16","A Ford Foundation study of Maryland and Minnesota, which began using mail registration before the 1974 election, found that the cost was low, registration increased, and there was only a single case of fraud. The turnout of postcard registrants was within 1.5 percentage points of previous registrants.18 A report by Richard Smolka on the experience of Maryland and New Jersey was also favorable, although it cautioned that no systematic attempt had been made to identify fraud in either state.19 Despite the low incidence of fraud, the specter of fraud would be raised against registration bills again and again.         "
"17","Privately, many believed that the concern about fraud was a cover for concerns about the bill's partisan impact. As Vice President Walter Mondale's chief of staff said, “Their public reason was fear of abuse and fraud. Their real reason was political.”20 An exception to the general Republican opposition demonstrates this: Senator Bill Brock (R‐TN), who headed the Committee to Reelect the President's youth campaign, cosponsored McGee's bill in 1973. Of him, The Almanac of American Politics wrote, “Brock's experiences in 1972 led him to buck most other Senate Republicans and to back the 1973 measure to allow the postcard registration of voters. He was convinced—and offered survey data as evidence to support his belief—that a large percentage of those a little too apathetic to register otherwise would, if they voted, form part of Richard Nixon's New Majority.”21 Brock used an August 1971 Gallup poll to demonstrate that there might be a partisan advantage for Republicans in easing voter registration. New voters voted for Edmund Muskie over Nixon, but if 100 percent of potential new voters had voted, 39 percent would have supported Nixon and 38 percent Muskie. As the roll call votes in Table 1 show, Brock persuaded few Republicans to join him.         "
"18","The partisanship became most vocal during the 1976 presidential election, when Democrat Jimmy Carter of Georgia challenged incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford. Democrats made one last push to enact postcard registration before the election. The 1976 Democratic platform advocated the “passage of legislation providing for registration by mail in federal elections to erase existing barriers to voter participation,”22 while the Republican platform opposed “federal post card registration” because of the “possibilities of fraud . . . inherent in registration by mail.”23 Democratic Party surveys showed that 70 percent of the unregistered would vote Democratic;24 the Republican‐leaning newspaper the Washington Star attributed the sudden “big rush” to pass postcard registration to a call from Democratic presidential nominee Carter to Democratic House Speaker Carl Albert. Albert's strenuous efforts got the bill through the House, but the Senate never brought it to the floor.         "
"19","Coming in the midst of the presidential election, the vote was highly partisan. Ninety‐eight percent of Northern Democrats supported the House bill, 60 percent of Southern Democrats, and 9 percent of Republicans. Republicans clearly felt that postcard registration would advantage the Democrats—and Northern Democrats did, too. Their opposition and support, respectively, for the bill, demonstrated as much."
"20","During his presidential campaign, Carter promised to work for universal voter registration and, once in office, he assigned Vice President Mondale to the task. Richard Moe, Mondale's chief of staff, suggested that they propose an alternative to postcard registration—Election Day registration (EDR). Postcard registration had engendered a lot of opposition, and Moe argued that “even in those states where postcard registration exists, it alone is not sufficient to significantly increase voter participation.”25 Election Day registration had been successfully used in Mondale's home state, Minnesota, since 1973. Turnout, as a percentage of the voting‐age population, increased from 68.4 percent to 71.7 percent between 1972 and 1976, and 22.9 percent of those Minnesotans voting in November 1976 registered on Election Day.26 That year, turnout in Minnesota was the highest in the nation. To reduce the potential congestion of new voters at the polls on Election Day, the Carter administration included mail registration in the bill.         "
"21","Mondale initially organized support from significant Republicans, but it was not long before the GOP again united in charging that EDR would lead to fraud. Bill Brock, then chairman of the RNC, and House minority leader John J. Rhodes appeared with Carter at the press conference announcing the bill. But not long after, the RNC passed a resolution stating that Election Day registration would “endanger the integrity of the franchise and open American elections to serious threat of fraud” and that increased federal regulation would discourage participation.27 Rhodes also withdrew his support.         "
"22","Republicans made fraud the major issue, with Representative Bill Frenzel (R‐MN) and Senator Mark Hatfield (R‐OR) leading the opposition. Even the reliably liberal Washington Post editorialized against EDR, echoing concerns about fraud. As a sign of how thoroughly fraud dominated the debate, the White House issued a memo entirely dedicated to responding to the argument that the bill would lead to fraud:            "
"23","Limited experience with EDR made the fraud argument hard to counter. By 1976, Election Day registration was only used in four states—Maine and Minnesota instituted EDR in 1973 and Oregon and Wisconsin followed suit in 1975. (North Dakota did not require registration at all.) Maine and Oregon, however, required the voter to register at a central location before going to the polls; only Minnesota and Wisconsin allowed voters to register at the polls.29 Smolka studied the experience of Minnesota and Wisconsin and found that turnout increased more than three points in each state between 1972 and 1976 and that there were few complaints of fraud.         "
"24","Because Election Day registration requires voters to show identification, whereas mail registration does not, it seemed to produce less opportunity for fraud. But election officials expressed concern about being overwhelmed by an unpredictable number of registrants on Election Day. At an April hearing, the Republican state's attorney in Cook County and the Democratic chair of the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners testified that the legislation would undo all they had done to reduce vote fraud in Chicago.30 The consequences for fraud and delayed election returns were hard to predict given the country's slim experience with EDR.         "
"25","Deputy Attorney General Peter Flaherty testified in support of the bill. But just before he did so, the Washington Post reported that Craig Donsanto, who led the election fraud division of the Justice Department, had written an internal memo arguing that EDR would create “a tremendous potential for fraud.”31 At first, Flaherty refused to release Donsanto's memo, but he later relented; the incident seriously undercut Flaherty's credibility and weakened the bill.         "
"26","The bill's chief sponsor, Representative Frank Thompson (D‐NJ), was impatient with fraud allegations. “It's a ridiculous argument to say that this bill will increase fraud,” he stated. “Those opposed to the extra administrative procedures usually hang their opposition on fraud. But in the past, almost all election fraud has been on the part of election officials and not individual voters. Also, the requirements and penalties of the bill are so stringent that there will be much less fraud than ever before.”32"
"27","Electoral competition was a large, although usually unspoken, motivation for supporters and opponents alike. It was widely reported that “[i]n all four states which presently use some form of election‐day registration, Democrats have gained seats in the legislature.”33 Moe said, “The Republicans clearly didn't like it. They concluded that more people voting wouldn't help them.”34 The only vote taken on the bill, a House Administration Committee vote, was strictly on party lines. But a whip count in June 1977 revealed that at least 54 Democrats were unlikely to vote for the bill. The Election Day registration bill was declared dead.         "
"28","When there was still a hope of passing the bill, Carter had spoken at a United Auto Workers convention and blamed the Republicans for opposing the bill: “There are some powerful special interests, including the Republican Party, who are trying to kill the electoral reform bill because they don't want working people to register and vote.”35 But some years later, he shifted the blame to incumbents of either party:            "
"29","The key word was “incumbency.” Incumbent members of Congress don't want to see additional, unpredictable voters registered. I'm speaking in generalities and there were obviously some exceptions. But I tell you what I say is true. The more senior and more influential members of the Congress—those who are the chairmen of major committees—have a very safe district. To have a 25 or 30 percent increase of unpredictable new voters is something that they don't particularly relish.36"
"30","The five states that used Election Day registration produced higher turnout with no increased risk of fraud. Nevertheless, the biggest argument raised against the bill was fraud. If more states had used EDR, or if more research had been available on its impact, it might have been easier to counter the argument that EDR would increase fraud. But given the opposition rooted in electoral competition—the Republican expectation that Democrats would benefit electorally and the expectation of incumbents in both parties that Election Day registration could only make the size and shape of the electorate less predictable—it seems unlikely that EDR would have succeeded anyway."
"31","Even when voter registration reform legislation passed, claims of fraud shaped the law. What eventually became the National Voter Registration Act, also known as the Motor Voter Law, had its origins in an effort by a coalition of voting rights activists to overcome the obstacles they had experienced in registering people for the 1984 election. Human SERVE (Human Service Employees Registration and Voter Education Fund) convened meetings of the groups that had done significant registration in 1984 to begin building momentum for national legislative reform. Early participants included the NAACP, League of Women Voters, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Project Vote!, Public Citizen, Midwest Voter Registration and Education Project, Churches Committee for Voter Registration/Education, Center for the Study of Responsive Law, People For the American Way, ACORN, AFL‐CIO Committee on Public Education, Advocacy Institute, Citizen Action, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, and Operation Big Vote.37 Human SERVE, a small nonprofit organization that was dedicated to encouraging registration in social service agencies that serve the poor, brought to the newly formed coalition a focus on agency‐based registration.         "
"32","Based on their experiences, and what had already been shown to work in the states, the coalition designed a bill with several provisions. It required states to offer Election Day registration and mail registration, as Carter's bill had. It also required states to offer voter registration at government agencies so that people could register, or update their registration, in the normal course of doing business with another government agency. It prohibited states from purging voters simply for not voting, as 37 states then did; as Jesse Jackson said, “No other rights guaranteed to citizens are bound to the constant exercise of that right.”38"
"33","The states’ experience with these voter registration methods had grown with the years. By 1986, 23 states used mail registration. While no additional states had adopted EDR since the failure of Carter's bill, it remained successful in those states. Registration in government agencies was the method with which the states had the least experience. In 1971, when McGee began his campaign, no state required government agencies other than election agencies to offer registration. In 1975, Michigan began offering registration at motor vehicle agencies, and by 1985, nine states offered registration to motor vehicle agency clients. In the three states in which motor vehicle agencies integrated voter registration into each regular contact with their clients, voter registration climbed; in the other states, agencies simply made mail‐in forms available, a passive strategy that led to far fewer registrations.39"
"34","The focus on registration in government agencies grew out of the work of Project Vote! and Human SERVE. Beginning in 1982, Project Vote! sent registration volunteers to welfare offices, surplus food distribution lines, and other locations where the low‐income people they hoped to register were gathered. Building on that idea, Piven and Cloward launched Human SERVE in 1983 with the goal of encouraging public and private social service agencies themselves to offer voter registration to their clients. Human SERVE even got six Democratic governors to sign executive orders requiring some or all state agencies to offer voter registration, but the executive orders were challenged by the Reagan administration on the grounds that federally funded state employees would be engaged in partisan activities in violation of the Hatch Act.40 In New York, the state Republican Party took the governor's agency‐based registration program to court. The political wrangling between Democrats and Republicans, federal officials and state officials, led to state agencies in those six states doing very little of the registration promised in the executive orders. Nevertheless, numerous public and private human service agencies engaged in registration before the 1984 election.         "
"35","Aware of the fraud claims raised against every other attempt to liberalize voting procedures, the coalition included penalties for fraudulent registration or interference with another person's voting rights. It also required more stringent proof of identity for same‐day registration and segregated the votes of same‐day registrants so that their eligibility could be verified. This, they hoped, would allow advocates of the bill to “lead with the assertion that the sponsors of the Universal Voter Registration Act are acting to reduce election fraud by the enforcement sections of the bill.”41"
"36","The advocates decided to confront head‐on election administrators’ wariness of federal legislation. They prepared lists of election officials who would be willing to testify in support of the legislation, and they attended meetings of the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) and the International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials and Treasurers and worked to win their support for voter registration reform. Although NASS had previously opposed national voter registration legislation, it passed resolutions of support in 1989, 1992, and 1993."
"37","The advocates also sought Republican cosponsors but immediately ran into concerns about fraud. As Minnesota used EDR, Senator David Durenberger seemed the most likely cosponsor, but he refused, saying that “Minnesota had experienced fraud” and that he was “up for election.” A Human SERVE staffer thought Republican attempts to rescind same‐day registration in Minnesota may have influenced Durenberger, although it is unclear what fraud Minnesota had experienced. The only mention of Minnesota in Campbell's history of election fraud took place in the 1850s.42 Senator Bob Packwood (R‐OR) seemed like another possibility, but he declined, citing home state concerns; thanks to a bizarre effort by a religious commune to pad the voting rolls, Oregon voters repealed same‐day registration in 1986, although the incident was not related to same‐day registration.43"
"38","In the Senate, Republicans Mitch McConnell (R‐KY) and Ted Stevens (R‐AL) led the fight against the bill, arguing that it would increase fraud, a charge they never substantiated. Stevens wanted to remove mail registration, which he asserted was the most fraud‐prone method of voter registration.44 Tamara Somerville, an aide to McConnell, viewed the fight in starkly partisan terms—perhaps because McConnell was in “the [re‐election] fight of his life” back home and Senator Wendell Ford (D‐KY), sponsor of the bill, was supporting his opponent. Somerville saw the bill as part of a larger Democratic plan to protect Democratic incumbents and believed that McConnell's major concern was fraud, which was widespread in Kentucky: “I've got a pile of clips, they're still busting people down there for vote fraud.”45 Most cases of election fraud in Kentucky, however, involved vote buying and absentee ballot fraud,46 not fraudulent registration.         "
"39","Other arguments were made as well. Some members of Congress and election officials saw the legislation as a federal intrusion into the states’ authority to administer elections; some argued that the proposed procedures would cost too much. Senator McConnell said that those who complained that voter registration procedures prevented them from voting were making “an excuse, and a pretty poor one at that.” He reported that in El Salvador, “we saw citizens walk for miles along dusty roads to get to the polls, and brave gunfire and death threats to cast their ballots. They were not making any excuses.”47 But he did so after an extensive statement about the dangers posed by fraud.         "
"40","When the House Administration Committee held hearings in 1988, fraud was a chief complaint, but no empirical reports of the extent of fraud, as it related to any elements of the bill—EDR, mail registration, agency‐based registration—were presented. One report demonstrated that liberalizing voter registration in any of a variety of ways would improve turnout, with Election Day registration having the greatest impact.48 Although the report also promised to assess the risk of fraud, its only empirical research consisted of “contact[ing] the Department of Justice and the Secretaries of State and Attorneys General of the various states to ascertain which had comparatively high and low levels of claims of and prosecutions for fraud.”49 Based on those conversations, it showed that states in which an election official reported a higher incidence of fraud were more likely to have restrictive voter registration laws, but because it was not based on actual data about fraud, it did not eliminate the possibility that officials who supported restrictive laws claimed a higher incidence of fraud.         "
"41","Many state and local election officials from both parties testified, and several mentioned the possibility of fraud in their comments, almost always in general terms. Some noted that there was no problem with fraud in the states which currently permitted same‐day registration; others pointed out that those states were few in number and perhaps unrepresentative of the rest. David Leahy, the supervisor of elections for Metropolitan Dade County, Florida, said, “Same day registration . . . is, in my opinion, an expensive process which impacts on the orderly conduct of elections at the polling place and appears to have only a minimal effect on voter participation. It also carries with it a perceived, if not real, potential for fraud.”50 Randall Erben, the assistant secretary of state for Texas, said voter fraud was “a persistent problem” in his state, mentioning allegations about Lyndon B. Johnson to more recent indictments for transport of Mexican nationals across the border to vote by affidavit.51"
"42","Key among the state election officials testifying was Ralph Munro, the Republican secretary of state from chairman Al Swift's home state of Washington. Munro congratulated the lead Republican on the committee, Bill Thomas of California, and the lead Democrat, Swift, for their work on legislation to guarantee access to the polls for disabled people. He openly countered the “the Feds ought to keep their hands out of this” argument and poked fun at the two parties for always assuming that voter registration proposals would help the other party. He spoke supportively of the broad goals of the bill and particularly of agency‐based registration, especially registration through motor vehicle bureaus. The one issue he disagreed with, he said, was Election Day registration, raising logistical concerns about it.52"
"43","Swift, the Democratic chair of the House Administration Committee, was willing to champion a bill, but only if it did not include EDR. Opposition to same‐day registration, he told the advocates, was strong, widespread, and, he felt, not without reason. Election Day registration could overwhelm election administrators on the day of an election, with unknown consequences for fraud and delayed election returns.53 Karl Sandstrom, who worked for Swift, said Swift believed that “it was often the more affluent segments of the electorate that took advantage of it” and therefore would not achieve the goals of the voter reform coalition. Also, he suggested that concerns about fraud could be an obstacle:            "
"44","We also knew we were going to have some problems with the public integrity section of the Justice Department who would probably be at best neutral and may have been actively opposed to same day registration. You're taking a system that came from kind of reform, good government states, the Minnesotas, the Wisconsins and saying we can do the same thing in Louisiana and Chicago, which had very different historical traditions.54"
"45","Swift made another significant change to the bill—privileging registration in motor vehicle agencies, instead of the broader requirement that agencies “that serve the public directly” offer voter registration. Thus the bill acquired its nickname, “Motor Voter.” While motor vehicle agencies reach 85 percent to 90 percent of the adult population over a four‐year cycle, reform advocates were concerned that the very groups least likely to be registered—the poor, people of color, and the disabled—were those least likely to be reached by motor vehicle agencies."
"46","Bill Thomas, the committee's minority Republican leader, promised to support the bill—and to get the support of minority whip Newt Gingrich—if Swift would include a requirement that states periodically purge names from their lists. For members of Congress who expressed concern about fraud—overwhelmingly Republican, but also including some Democrats, such as Martin Frost of Texas—keeping the voter rolls clean of voters who had moved or died was one way to reduce the opportunity for fraud. Swift was aware that purges had long been used in a discriminatory fashion and challenged Thomas to write a fair purge. When Thomas wrote one that passed muster with Swift's own staff and the Democratic National Committee, Swift became an ardent supporter of it."
"47","Gingrich eagerly worked to win Republican votes for the bill, motivated by a belief that his party could take electoral advantage. Polls taken during the Reagan years showed that young voters and the unregistered were leaning Republican. David Broder, a political columnist for the Washington Post, suggested that “younger Republicans, impatient with their party's permanent minority status, are ready to take their chances in a bigger electoral ballpark.”55"
"48","In February, the bill passed the House with 61 Republican votes, 36 percent of the total. The bill drew 91 percent of the Democratic vote, as the difference between Northern and Southern Democrats had lessened over time. By March, however, Gingrich had retracted his support, telling reporters, “I had not even thought about the states’ rights implications.”56 This vote, and the other floor votes that would occur, are recorded in Table 2.         "
"49","Winning bipartisan support for the bill, however promising, caused deep divisions in the advocates’ coalition. As Sonia Jarvis diplomatically phrased it, “some people felt important issues were being lost in the rush to get some kind of bill. . . The division in the coalition comes on whether we move on what's on paper, or push for more amendments. Unfortunately, it was a racial split.”57"
"50","The addition of a purging requirement seriously undermined unity around a reform bill. Getting rid of the nonvoting purge was a shared goal—but the advocates were split on whether a fair alternative purge was possible. Republicans insisted on purging to prevent fraud, and Congressman Swift and Senator Ford, lead sponsors of the bill in their respective chambers, felt they could not pass the bill without a few Republican votes."
"51","Almost every state allowed some kind of purge (although some purged only sporadically), and almost three‐quarters used a nonvoting purge,58 which H.R. 2190 would no longer allow. But the bill, as Thomas had written it, would require states to do a mail purge at least every two years. Because mail purges had been used selectively to disenfranchise minority voters, civil rights groups were very suspicious of them. As Edward Hailes of the NAACP explained it,            "
"52","Who could be against cleaning our lists? We do not want the dead and those who have moved away to be on the list. . . . All we want is to make sure that the list is not cleaned in an arbitrary way or a discriminatory way. We talked about the North Carolina experience, where certain neighborhoods were targeted for list cleaning efforts, and you send a mailing to a certain zip code where only people of color live. If they don't return the postcard within a certain amount of time, they're cleaned off the list.59"
"53","Even if there were no discriminatory intent to the purge, civil rights advocates were concerned that poor mail delivery in low‐income and minority communities would cause those groups to be erroneously struck from the rolls. Thus, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the NAACP, and the Citizenship Education Fund were strongly opposed to including any purge in the bill. The League of Women Voters, Human SERVE, American Civil Liberties Union, and People For the American Way saw the mail purge as a necessary compromise to get a bill passed; they wanted to focus on designing the least damaging purge and made a list of specific provisions that would protect access to the franchise.60"
"54","The coalition broke down on similar lines around the elimination of EDR and the focus on motor vehicle agency registration. Several of the civil rights groups remained very committed to EDR, while Human SERVE and the League of Women Voters were willing to jettison it if they could get a reform law passed. While motor vehicle agencies reached a very large swath of the population, the civil rights groups were concerned that the bill could exacerbate the racial disparities of registration because car ownership was more prevalent among whites than blacks. The groups still actively participating in the coalition strategized about which agencies would best reach those underrepresented at departments of motor vehicles and how to ensure that registration would be effective at those agencies."
"55","The conflict reached its height as the bill appeared headed for passage in 1990. For many in the civil rights community, institutionalizing potentially discriminatory purges constituted too high a price to pay for a bill they were not sure would increase black registration. When it had passed the House and was headed for the Senate, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund released a sharply worded memo opposing the bill. Senate action on the bill stalled; many senators were wary of supporting a bill on which civil rights organizations were divided."
"56","Seeing the chances of winning reform slipping away, the advocates convened a summit, at which they agreed on what amendments would be necessary for the coalition to support the bill: provisions that would prevent selective purging; a savings clause, ensuring that nothing in the bill would undermine the Voting Rights Act; agency registration in other agencies besides motor vehicle agencies, particularly agencies serving the poor and disabled; and a provision allowing an individual or organization to sue for violations of the law.61 Having agreed anew on their priorities, the coalition was ready for a final push.         "
"57","Their significant compromises did not eliminate the fraud charges leveled at the bill. When the bill passed the House and Senate in the midst of the 1992 presidential campaign, it was vetoed by President George H.W. Bush, who said the bill “imposes an unnecessary and costly federal regime on the states and … is, in addition, an open invitation to fraud and corruption.”62 Independent presidential candidate Ross Perot saw it differently: “The only reason to veto this bill is to try to keep people away from the polls this fall.”63"
"58","Human SERVE and Rock the Vote won a commitment from Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton to make the Motor Voter Law part of his first 100 days agenda, and so his victory fast‐tracked the Motor Voter bill. The battle was engaged one last time. Congressman Bill Thomas and Senator Bob Dole led the opposition, focusing once again on charges of increased fraud, increased costs to the states, and on the expected partisan results of registration in welfare and disability offices. In reporting on the debate, the Washington Post reported these contrasting positions:            "
"59","Rep. William Thomas (R‐CA) predicted the measure would help dead, moved or imaginary voters cast ballots. “Every one of those votes cast dilutes an honest vote,” he said. “A number of illegal aliens will wind up with a driver's license and on the voting rolls.”"
"60","But Rep. Al Swift (D‐Wash.), the bill's chief sponsor, said 28 states with similar registration programs have not reported a rise in voter fraud. “This is a classic example of using states as a laboratory . . . Most Americans today can register by post card,” he said. “The fraud issue that is being raised here today is the biggest fraud in this debate.”64"
"61","Human SERVE disseminated data showing that every Motor Voter state had higher registration and turnout rates in the 1992 election than in 1988 and that turnout and registration were higher in Motor Voter states than in states that did not have Motor Voter laws. These data countered Royce Crocker's Congressional Research Service report, which had argued that Motor Voter programs did not increase impact.65 But neither Human SERVE nor Crocker had data on fraud.         "
"62","The Senate‐passed version of the bill included several amendments that voter reform advocates considered damaging to the bill—eliminating registration at disability, unemployment, and public assistance agencies; allowing states to require documentary proof of citizenship, effectively nullifying mail registration; and requiring voters who have moved to vote at a central location. Senator Durenberger claimed the Republican amendments would prevent fraud,66 but the motive was clearly partisan; as Thomas had said during the House debate, “All of us are interested in extending the right to vote to all. But at unemployment and welfare offices only? … If you want to pick a party affiliation of these people, take a guess. You won't pick ours.”67 Ultimately, the conference committee agreed to exclude unemployment agencies from the list of mandatory agencies and to require that states designate additional agencies of their choice.         "
"63","Representative Thomas, the ranking Republican on the House Administration Committee, was the first speaker in opposition to the bill during the final House debate on passage of the National Voter Registration Act in 1993. Throughout the six years that versions of the bill had been debated in the House, he had championed the addition of list maintenance requirements to combat fraud. In his opening remarks of the final debate, he raised other concerns: that the bill's provisions were mandatory on the states, that the agencies required to participate were chosen to favor Democrats, and that the federal government would not cover the states’ costs.68 Overall, however, fraud was the predominant concern, with cost running second; over two days of debate, the word “fraud” appeared in statements opposing the bill 31 times, and the word “cost” appeared 24 times.69"
"64","The fraud argument played a bigger role in shaping the bill than any other argument. Election Day registration was dropped from the bill and list maintenance requirements were added, both in response to arguments made about the potential for fraud. These changes did little to bring bipartisan support to the bill, as the lopsided votes in Table 2 show, but they split the advocates in a way that nearly doomed the bill. In May 1993, the House and Senate both passed the conference report on the bill, and President Clinton signed it into law.         "
"65","Passage of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 was a victory, but it was not the reform originally imagined by advocates. It did not include Election Day registration, although two states adopted EDR to avoid complying with the law. The advocates succeeded in making registration mandatory at public assistance and disabilities agencies. But unemployment offices were eliminated, and public assistance and disability agencies were not required to seamlessly integrate voter registration into their application process, as motor vehicle agencies were. Thus, implementation has been far worse in those agencies."
"66","Implementation was also impeded by resistance to the NVRA. The Republican governors of California and Virginia challenged the constitutionality of the act in federal court. Republican governors of four other states—Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Michigan—refused to implement the NVRA, claiming states’ rights. Several voting rights organizations that had fought for the NVRA, and then the Department of Justice, sued all six states. Ultimately, the federal courts rejected the states’ challenge to the law."
"67","Mississippi, also led by a Republican governor, failed to pass implementing legislation and chose to implement the NVRA only for federal elections. Mississippians registering at a motor vehicle agency or a welfare agency were registered for federal elections only—and while those registering at a motor vehicle agency were often handed a copy of the state registration form, those at welfare agencies were not. Even after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Mississippi to respect the NVRA, Governor Kirk Fordice vetoed implementing legislation, and a second lawsuit was necessary to force the state into compliance in 1998. While the national government eventually prevailed, and the states were required to obey the law, the lawsuits did delay implementation in those states.70"
"68","Bills have repeatedly been introduced to limit the reach of the NVRA. From the 104th Congress to the 108th, bills to repeal the NVRA were introduced. And in every Congress from 1993 to the present, bills have been introduced to modify the law in ways that would limit registration—to cite some examples, by eliminating mail registration, permitting states to purge registrants for failure to vote, or requiring documentary proof of citizenship.71"
"69","Perhaps the biggest disappointment with the NVRA has been purging. The goal of the reform coalition had been to eliminate the nonvoting purge, to make it easier for the individual voter to stay on the rolls. While advocates were able to include a number of provisions designed to protect against discriminatory and/or careless removal of eligible voters from the rolls, the NVRA does require, for the first time, every state to regularly engage in “a general program” to purge ineligible voters. As a consequence, 112 million names have been purged since 1996. On average, 7.6 percent of all names registered have been removed in each election cycle between 1995 and 2012 (see Table 3).         "
"70","The millions purged have not ended the allegations of fraud caused by deadwood. Despite the carefully negotiated compromise between the desire to remove ineligible voters and the desire to ensure that eligible voters were not mistakenly removed, the list maintenance rules established by the NVRA have been criticized for causing fraud. This criticism largely focused on the requirement that names identified as possibly ineligible not be removed for two general elections, to give the voter a chance to prove their eligibility. Congressman Bob Stump (R‐AZ), in introducing his bill to repeal the NVRA in 1999, said,            "
"71","Motor Voter has been a nightmare for many state election officials. Some have stated that Motor Voter has caused them to lose control over potential voter fraud. It ties their hands in removing ‘dead wood’ from their rolls by requiring them to keep registrants who fail to vote or who are unresponsive to voter registration correspondence to be maintained on voter rolls for years.72"
"72","Despite the “nightmare,” millions of names were indeed being removed from the rolls. Nevertheless, during George W. Bush's second term, the Justice Department sued several states for not removing enough voters from the rolls and threatened at least 10 more states with legal action.73 After Barack Obama's election, the Justice Department's litigation focus shifted again to getting people on the rolls, much to the chagrin of conservatives. When the Department of Justice sued Louisiana in 2011 for violating Section 7 of the NVRA by failing to adequately offer registration in social service and disability offices, Senator David Vitter (R‐LA) and numerous conservative bloggers complained that the Justice Department was not equally enforcing Section 8 (the list maintenance section).74"
"73","Although voter fraud is rare in the United States, concerns about fraud derailed Senator McGee's effort to enact a national postcard registration program and President Carter's effort to require Election Day registration. In the mid‐1980s campaign to pass comprehensive voter registration reform, fraud allegations reshaped the bill in ways that almost destroyed the coalition advocating for it and ultimately limited the effectiveness of the NVRA."
"74","Little evidence of fraud was presented during the debate during any of the three campaigns. When state experience with the proposed methods of registration was presented, as in the Smolka studies, no increase in fraud was demonstrated. Concerns about fraud were not supported by any information about the incidence of fraud or how it would be increased by the proposed registration methods."
"75","Evidence that legislators were motivated by electoral competition is much easier to find. In the floor votes on postcard registration, Northern Democrats, who expected to benefit from expanded voter registration, were largely supportive. Republicans, who expected that Democrats would benefit, largely opposed postcard registration—the highest level of Republican support on any of the roll call votes was 29.3 percent. Southern Democrats appeared more concerned about the risk of adding more voters in their home districts than the benefits of winning the White House and gave little support to postcard registration."
"76","In the floor votes on the National Voter Registration Act, Democrats overwhelmingly supported the bill, with more than 90 percent supporting it, and Republicans did not. The difference between Southern and Northern Democrats had declined over time, as the South became less solidly Democratic, and Southern Democratic support was nearly as high as that of the Northern Democrats."
"77","Some of the Republican support for registration reform legislation reinforces the argument that electoral competitiveness was the motivating factor. Senator Brock's support in 1973, and Congressman Gingrich's support in 1990 were both predicated on the expectation that, conventional wisdom aside, Republicans could benefit from an expanded electorate. Both of them, however, withdrew their support at the behest of other Republicans.         "
"78","The National Voter Registration Act eventually became law, with a starkly partisan vote. Six Republicans voted for cloture in the Senate, and their support was crucial; the bill would have fallen short of the required 60 votes without them. In the House, only 20 of the 178 Republican members voted for the conference report on the bill. Representative Thomas, who had first offered Swift his support if the bill included a purging component, voted against final passage, after offering a motion to recommit the bill to add an amendment that would suspend the bill's implementation in a state until the chief election official certified that sufficient protections existed to prevent the registration of noncitizens.75 Implementation of the law by the states remains uneven 20 years after its enactment, and unsubstantiated charges that the law creates fraud continue.         "
"79","The use of fraud to challenge election laws that would facilitate registration and voting continues, despite research by Levitt, Minnite, and others showing the low incidence of voter fraud. Fraud was a major issue in the debate over the Help America Vote Act, leading Congress to include its voter identification provisions and shaping its provisions on statewide voter lists. Voter fraud was a major argument behind the unsuccessful efforts to end Election Day registration in Maine and Montana in recent years and the successful effort to do so in North Carolina."
"80","Despite the evidence that voter impersonation is almost nonexistent, voter ID bills are introduced in state after state. If the factual evidence has had any impact at all, it has been to shift the argument from the danger of fraud to the danger that voters will lose confidence in the integrity of the system. In the Crawford v. Marion County decision, the U.S. Supreme Court weighed not only Indiana's interest in preventing fraud (although none could be found to have occurred) but also its interest in “protecting public confidence in elections … because such confidence encourages citizen participation in the democratic process.”76 Thus far, no evidence has been found that those who believe fraud is prevalent are less likely to vote or that turnout is higher where voter identification is stricter.77"
