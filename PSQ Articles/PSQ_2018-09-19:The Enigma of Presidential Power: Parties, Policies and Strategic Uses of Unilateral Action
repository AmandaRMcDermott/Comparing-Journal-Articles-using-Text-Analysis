"1","How powerful are presidents in exercising their unilateral authorities? For the past several decades, both academic researchers and political observers have noted the importance of executive directives such as executive orders to a president's policy agenda and have sought to understand the underlying processes that define these presidential decisions. Yet one puzzle remains, especially in relation to executive unilateral authority: why are there “instances where the chief executive can brandish unilateral action as a weapon,” and yet “there are other times where the President comes across as extremely sensitive to the preferences of those in the majority in Congress the legislative parties to which they belong” (p. 178). Along with another recently published book on the unilateral presidency, Michelle Belco and Brandon Rottinghaus's The Dual Executive: Unilateral Orders in a Separated System, Fang‐Yi Chiou and Lawrence S. Rothenberg's attempt to address what they called the “enigma of presidential power” represents some of the latest thinking on the nature of presidential power generally and the determinants of unilateral actions specifically.         "
"2","Most impressively, Chiou and Rothenberg combine formal theoretical modeling with rigorous empirical methods to tackle a particular thorny question that has eluded presidency scholars for so long. After assessing the current body of knowledge on presidential power—especially its weaknesses—in Chapter 1, Chiou and Rothenberg proceed in Chapter 2 to develop three competing formal models, each with substantially different implications for how unilateral actions work: the unilateralism model, the chamber‐compliance model, and the partisan‐compliance model. In Chapter 3, the authors use an innovative approach to measure the significance of each executive orders from 1947 to 2003. Aside from their concluding chapter, the remaining chapters consist of the authors methodically testing each systematic component/implications of their models, including testing which of the three models best characterizes the issuing of significant executive orders, differences across policy areas, and whether unilateral power is different in foreign versus domestic policies (that is, the two‐presidency thesis).         "
"3","The bottom line is that presidents are neither omnipotent tyrants who usurp power nor weak executives who are frequently frustrated in an increasingly gridlocked political system. As Chiou and Rothenberg show, in exercising their unilateral powers, presidents regularly and strategically account for potential opposition in Congress, especially that led by majority‐party interests. Moreover, these executive‐legislative interactions frequently involve bargaining. “Simply put, claims of the imperial presidency are misguided and incorrect, and need to be replaced by a more nuanced appreciation of how the institutions of government and politics interact” (p. 179)."
"4","As with any excellent book, Chiou and Rothenberg's assessment of presidential power invokes additional questions. One question in particular comes to mind: what role do the courts play? Though the authors hint at the possibility of the courts constraining unilateral actions, they are largely dismissive of the courts imposing much constraints on unilateral powers. Of course, challenges to executive power generally, and unilateral actions specifically, are rare in the courts, and presidents typically win in such encounters. Still, the lack of a rigorous assessment of the courts and unilateral powers is but one example of how much work remains in this field."
"5","In summary, while I am not completely convinced that the “enigma of presidential power” has been fully addressed, this is undoubtedly an impressive work that has considerably advanced our knowledge of the processes of unilateral decision‐making. For anyone who is interested in better understanding presidential power and the unilateral presidency, this is a must‐read."
