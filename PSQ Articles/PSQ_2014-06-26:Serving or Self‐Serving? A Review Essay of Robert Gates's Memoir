"1","WHEN RAYMOND MOLEY PUBLISHED AFTER SEVEN YEARS IN 1939, commentators questioned whether it was appropriate for a close presidential adviser to recount his story while the administration was still in office. This may be a bad practice, but one we are now accustomed to. These memoirs are welcomed not only by scholars and the interested public, but also by opponents of the administration, because while they will be discounted if they are favorable, if critical, they are likely to carry significant weight. So Democrats saw former Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill's story as clear‐sighted and doing his democratic duty of informing the public that George W. Bush and his colleagues were preoccupied by Iraq even before the attacks of 11 September 2001 at the expense of dealing with many other pressing problems.1 The partisan tables are turned with the publication of Robert Gates's Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War.2 Although not entirely uncritical of Bush or unadmiring of Barack Obama, it does cast a harsher light on the latter's administration, if not upon Obama personally. But so much has been written about both administrations, and especially the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that take up most of Gates's account, that there are few substantive surprises. It is hardly news that Bush often made belligerent statements that interfered with diplomacy, that there was a great deal of friction between the Obama White House and the State and Defense Departments, or that the one thing that unified the departments and the President's staff was that they found Congress partisan, meddlesome, and infuriating.         "
"2","Nevertheless, Duty is revealing, although largely inadvertently so. For a man of experience and sophistication, Gates is remarkably unselfconscious about the impression he is likely to create. (One wonders where his editor was.) Like most former officials, he presumably wants us to believe that he took office out of a sense of duty, which impelled him to stay on despite the truly heavy burdens. And I have no doubt that the burdens were indeed enormous, ones that would crush most of us. But wouldn't it have been a better idea to let this impression sink in through the narrative rather than by the book's title? The cover photo does not help either, showing him as stern and resolved, but also with some twinkle in his eyes. He appears to want to assure us that he was the grown‐up in the room. The central question for any memoir is how much of it is posturing, and Gates does not get off to a good start.         "
"3","He may gain some credibility, however, by the very extent to which he appears to be oblivious of the impressions that his words are likely to produce. The poster child for this is now familiar, but it needs to be reproduced. After a typically difficult series of meetings about how to prepare for a possible armed clash with Iran in which Gates had urged a speedy decision and Obama said that options should be explored but he was not ready to reach a conclusion, Gates reports the following:            "
"4","I was put off by the way the president closed the meeting. To his very closest advisors, he said, “For the record, and for those of you writing your memoirs, I am not making any decisions about Israel or Iraq. [Joe Biden], you will be my witness.” I was offended by his suspicion that any of us would write about such sensitive matters (p. 393)."
"5","It is a mystery how a sentient being could write the last sentence. The first one was bad enough."
"6","The other already‐famous story in the book is that when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Obama that she supported a surge of troops in Afghanistan, she added that “her opposition to the surge in Iraq had been political because she was facing him in the Iowa primary,” and Obama “conceded vaguely that his opposition had been political as well.” Compounding what some might consider a personal betrayal, Gates comments: “To hear the two of them making these admissions, and in front of me, was as surprising as it was dismaying” (p. 376). The obvious irony is that he was right to think that they should not have trusted him, but the surprise is a bit odd. Perhaps the dismay is as well, because he does not seem upset when Bush focused on politics, for example in being infuriated with Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for truthfully telling the press that the administration had told him to concentrate on the needs in Iraq before contemplating additional forces for Afghanistan (pp. 216–217)."
"7","While Gates does admit to a series of errors, some of them quite significant, if he were more self‐aware, he would have paired his charge that Vice President Joe Biden was wrong on most of the issues of the day with an acknowledgment that his own career at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was marked not only by charges that he was a bully who tried to bring intelligence judgments into line with administration policy, but by being terribly wrong about the most important question he faced, when he argued that Mikhail Gorbachev was not seeking fundamental reforms of the Soviet Union and did not want to end the Cold War."
"8","The same blindness afflicts his treatment of a range of issues. One is the source of the congressional opposition to extending the term of Peter Pace as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs under Bush (pp. 64–66). While pettiness and grudges may indeed have played a role, I would have thought that Gates would have been perceptive enough to realize and honest enough to say that the widespread opinion was that Pace had been content to tell Bush and Gates's predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, what they wanted to hear rather than giving honest and unbiased military judgment. Gates could have made a real contribution by explaining why he believed those views to be incorrect, but ignoring them implies that he thinks that his readers know nothing of this history or can be easily fooled."
"9","In his treatment of the debate over the size, pace, and mission of deployments in Afghanistan that caused so much friction between him and the White House, he at least acknowledges some of the considerations on the other side. The issues here are multiple, complex, and important. The problem is not so much that Gates's account is one‐sided (although it is) as that he has missed the opportunity to use the perspective that one would hope would come from reflecting on his years grappling with the questions to consider them in depth. Instead, he goes through the endless meetings and squabbles in enough detail to weary the reader without providing analysis as deep as that which characterized the contemporary arguments, let alone going deeper still. Readers of the book will pick up some interesting inside‐the‐beltway stories, but will not be wiser about why it was so difficult to arrive at a coherent counterinsurgency strategy."
"10","Gates gestures toward one of the obstacles, but is too kind to make the point bluntly: although during the campaign, Obama called Afghanistan the “necessary war,” it is unlikely that he thought much about it. For political reasons—and perhaps for the national interest as well—he knew he had to do more and better than Bush had done, but he also wanted as little investment of soldiers and money as possible. Gates is right that the President's ambivalence was at the heart of the ragged way in which policy was made, and was perhaps responsible for its substantive shortcomings as well. But he fails to acknowledge that the implied contrast with his experience with the Bush administration is somewhat unfair. He joined the latter after it had been running for six years, giving ample time for the major players to understand each other and how the government worked. By contrast, no modern administration has been able to function smoothly in the first year, and Obama's was unusually stressed not only by foreign policy challenges, but even more by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, something that had to take most of the President's attention, energy, and political capital."
"11","The fundamental foreign policy issue facing the incoming administration was what goals it should seek in Afghanistan, and linked to this, what the appropriate means were. Gates and most of the military believed that while full‐scale nation building was beyond reach, the Iraq model of population‐centric counterinsurgency (COIN) was still called for, and this required a significant surge of American and allied forces. The opposing argument, espoused by Vice President Biden and many members of the White House staff, was that because COIN held out so little prospect of success and was so expensive in terms of manpower and money, the United States should concentrate on counterterrorism, perhaps combined with building up the Afghan forces. I do not think that we can say who was right even now, and indeed we may never be able to give a definitive answer. Gates's commitment to his views and loyalty to his generals are understandable and perhaps commendable, but his failure to understand the opposing views is not. Why did the participants divide as they did? Were there sources of information that should have been tapped that were not? What were the key questions Obama should have asked his advisers, and on what judgments and considerations should his decision have turned? We do not get much enlightenment from Gates. Instead, he is content to imply that those on the other side were strongly moved by domestic politics. This surely was a part of it, but not all."
"12","He is similarly one‐sided in his treatment of several associated issues, most importantly the sources of the divide between the Defense Department (often joined by Secretary of State Clinton) and the White House about the how the options were to be considered. For the latter, the main problem was that many in the military, including Generals Mike Mullen, David Petraeus, and Stanley McChrystal, tried to box in the President by leaking their requests to the press. For the President to then deny the large number of troops being requested would have been to open himself up to vigorous attacks by the Republicans. Gates's defense is weak on one point but strong on another. While acknowledging the leaks and the parallel public statements by military leaders, he downplays how politically damaging they were and how even a White House that was not prone to perceive conspiracies (if there ever was one) would have felt aggrieved and come to distrust the military. He is on stronger ground, however, in pointing out that the White House and National Security Council staff, many of whom had never served in the military, failed to understand the logistical constraints that reduced the speed with which men and material could be sent to or withdrawn from Afghanistan. For many civilians, especially at the beginning of an administration, it seems that everything should flow swiftly. In fact, logistical requirements cannot be readily circumvented. Although the dispute was not just a failure of communication and understanding, this did play a role. And the main person whose job it was to bridge this gap was the Secretary of Defense."
"13","As Gates explains, while relations between the White House and the military left much to be desired in the initial consideration of additional troops for Afghanistan, the real distrust and bitterness came when General McChrystal, newly appointed as commander in Afghanistan, reviewed the situation upon arrival and declared that he needed 40,000 reinforcements, taking the White House by surprise. Gates claims that he and the Pentagon were also surprised, and that after the decisions of February and March 2009, they “thought we were finished adding forces in Afghanistan” (p. 571; also see pp. 352–353). Here, as in many places, a more‐considered judgment will have to await the opening of the archives. But rarely do military commanders think they have sufficient forces, as Gates acknowledges two pages after declaring his surprise (p. 573), and the publicly available accounts of the situation in Afghanistan in mid‐2009 did not give confidence that the increment of troops scheduled in the original decision would reverse the trends. So if he was surprised, he should not have been."
"14","By virtue of his experience and position, Gates was uniquely positioned to lay out the alternatives and options and to mediate between the contending factions, not in the sense of brokering a compromise agreement, but by explaining to each group the others' values and reasoning and laying the groundwork for a more‐productive discussion. Granted that the difficulties of coming to a conclusion and the problems the United States faced on the ground limited the ability to come up with effective policy, and the desire for a new administration to stake out its own position, combined with the normal jockeying for power that always characterizes the government, inhibited constructive deliberation. Nevertheless, Gates was unwilling or unable to explain the White House's views to the military, or the military's understanding to the White House. Furthermore, although the latter clearly wanted options for a more‐limited deployment, one that focused more on counterterrorism than on COIN, Gates did not provide them. He then failed to carry out his duty, and it is not surprising that the President, Vice President, and many of their aides felt that they were being “gamed” and did not trust the military either in Washington or in the field (p. 557). While Gates is surely correct that some of the blame lay with the White House staff and the President, who were more committed to seeing that the war did not drag out endlessly than to securing as favorable an outcome as possible, he seems unaware of his own role in generating or at least not reducing the mistrust."
"15","One key issue throughout the period, and one that remains central, is the relationship between the Taliban and al Qaeda. Of course, neither group is entirely united and there undoubtedly are multiple relationships. But for all the discussion in the book and elsewhere about the fight with the Taliban, it is important to remember that the United States went into Afghanistan not to overthrow an obnoxious regime, or to democratize and modernize the country, but because it had provided a home for the terrorist group that struck the United States. Nation building and counterinsurgency may have been necessary, but they were instrumental to counterterrorism. For an observer from Mars, the attempt to degrade if not defeat the Taliban at great cost might seem a case of pursuing the means while losing sight of the ends. The reply, of course, is that if the Taliban were to return to power in parts of the country, let alone as much of it as it controlled before 11 September 2001, al Qaeda would reestablish its bases. This is a question on which reasonable people can disagree, but it is obvious that al Qaeda is well established in several other areas and that the Taliban, if it gains greater territory and legitimacy, may not want to put it all at risk by hosting terrorists who are trying to attack the United States. If Gates's account is correct, it is disappointing that the policy reviews paid so little attention to this, and that Gates himself did not take the opportunity to provide deeper analysis either at the time or in retrospect (pp. 373–374)."
"16","Gates also provides little insight into another central and intractable question—how to measure progress (pp. 486, 492, 498–499, 561–563). Difficult even in conventional wars, in which the battlefront can be tracked, in insurgencies, measures are extraordinarily difficult.3 Gates notes that the soldiers on the ground were more optimistic than intelligence analysts at home, and it is not surprising that he sides with the former. Since those who were skeptical about COIN and sought greater limits on the American effort believed that progress was limited at best, these assessments were central to policymaking. Definitive judgments remained beyond reach, and probably will remain so forever. Indeed, in struggles like this, we may be misled by the concept of progress, with its implication that trends will continue in their current direction in the absence of outside forces. Some work on civil wars stresses the local political and micro‐level impulses involved, and the play and counter‐play of multiple actors means that forces and tactics that prevailed at one point of time or in one area may not presage wider success.4"
"17","It is not surprising that Gates cannot get to the bottom of the issue, but it is disappointing that he does not seem to realize that there was good reason to be skeptical about the optimistic reports from the field. Those who believe in the policy and are implementing it are likely to be biased toward not only reporting but sincerely believe that it is succeeding, and first‐hand impressions, although powerful, may be misleading. It is particularly hard to tell when insurgents have merely moved on and are regrouping rather than having been extremely badly damaged, and it is even harder to tell whether a local success can be consolidated in a way that will prevent the insurgents from coming back. This is not to say that the pessimists were right or that Gates should have endorsed their analyses, but it is not too much to ask of a Secretary of Defense that he examine his subordinates' views more critically and understand the legitimate grounds on which skeptics might disagree. “‘The more time you spend in Afghanistan,’ I told the president, ‘the closer to the front you get, the more optimistic people are”’ (p. 563). Gates's statement is surely correct, but is again remarkably unselfconscious in not realizing that this was hardly unimpeachable evidence."
"18","Being in charge of implementing the policy and, as he frequently reminds us, of sending young men and women into harm's way, Gates is understandably troubled by the administration's inability to settle on a strategy and not re‐examine it before it has had a reasonable chance to succeed. He reports that “Clinton and I were furious” over a White House paper that “attempted to re‐litigate the president's decisions of a year earlier” (p. 500). There is more than a little to this, but what Gates fails to come to grips with is the agonizing and unanswerable question of how to balance the need to sustain a policy with the requirement to question it, the need to finally come up with answers versus the need to keep questions open for consideration, and the need to prevent subordinates from undercutting policy and the simultaneous requirement to get people to provide honest doubt and to avoid a false consensus. When he took over Bush's Pentagon, he realized that “the president, his senior civilian advisors, and the senior military leaders had not recognized that most of the assumptions that underpinned early military planning had proven wrong [in Iraq], and no necessary adjustments had been made” (p. 115). But because he supported the Afghan policy developed at the beginning of the Obama administration, he ignored the legitimate fears of the White House that the government was similarly yielding to the pull of inertia. Thus Gates rails against the White House's continued support of Karl Eikenberry as ambassador to Afghanistan despite his bitter feuds with Hamid Karzai and his continuing back‐channel communications to White House skeptics. I think Gates makes a good case that Eikenberry should have been relieved much earlier, but again, he fails to see the need for the government as a whole and the President in particular to cultivate diverse sources of information and advice and not to be locked into a failing policy."
"19","At times, Gates realizes that the entire discussion within the government was somewhat removed from reality. An important but understated paragraph is worth quoting at some length:            "
"20","Obama's decision to dramatically increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan in late 2009 was … based on a number of assumptions agreed upon by his top advisors: that the Pakistanis could be induced to change their hedging strategy, Karzai could be coached to become a more effective president, Afghan corruption could be reduced, and the Afghan central government's reputation among the people and its capabilities could be improved. The challenges to achieving those goals were fully debated leading up to the president's major troop escalation in the fall of 2009. Still, I think there was a good deal of wishful thinking in the Obama administration that we might see some improvements with enough dialogue (with Pakistan) and civilian assistance to the Afghan government and people. When real improvements in those nonmilitary areas failed to materialize, too many—especially in the White House and the [National Security Council Staff]—concluded the president's entire strategy, including the military component, was a failure and were eager to reverse course."
"21","Two points leap out. First, these assumptions represented more than “a good deal” of wishful thinking; there was little reason to expect them to be borne out. Neither Gates in his book nor, as far as I know, the contemporary participants in the discussion could point to reasons for these expectations, evidence from the region that indicated their soundness, or historical cases that would lead one to optimism.5 Second, to say that although these assumptions were incorrect, the military policy was succeeding displays the sort of blinkered views one should not find in a Secretary of Defense. The military policy was a means to an end, and even if it was carried out with great skill and dedication, as I believe it was, it could only lead to the desired goals in conjunction with other factors like greater support for the Afghan government and a willingness of Pakistan to moderate its support for the Taliban. A successful military strategy might be able to help bring these other forces into play, but could not substitute for them. Gates says that “if our troops, combined with larger and more capable Afghan forces, could provide security for much of the population, then the other improvements could follow over time” (p. 570). They could, but this would hardly be automatic.         "
"22","The second point of unreality is that the debate was waged on a fairly narrow battlefield and the participants were not quite as divided as they believed at the time. As Gates now realizes, the polarization that occurred was neither necessary nor helpful. The distance between the military's proposal and the Vice President's one in the initial deliberations in 2009 were not that great in terms of the number of troops to be deployed. “On reflection, I believe that all of us at the senior‐most level did not serve the president well in this process…. Contending teams presented alternatives to the president that were considerably more black and white than warranted. A more collegial process, one that tried to identify points of agreement rather than sharpen differences, would have had a more harmonious conclusion and done less damage to the relationship between the military and the Commander‐in‐Chief” (pp. 384–385). The argument that there is blame here and that it should be shared is quite plausible, but given Gates's pivotal position, he deserves a good deal of it."
"23","Perhaps more important than the bad will that was revealed and generated is the less‐known fact that the alternatives presented were not well attuned to the situation: Biden's “number was far above what was required for counterterrorism, and mine was far too small for a fully resourced counterinsurgency strategy” (p. 384). Although students of policymaking will not be stunned, a mismatch between what was needed to carry out a strategy and what its proponents brought forth, given the importance of these decisions, Gates's statement is deeply disturbing, and while the reader is gratified to see him bring up a fundamental issue, he or she must also be disappointed to see it dropped. Presumably, Biden and his allies knew that, given Obama's campaign pledges and the potential charge that he would be the president who “lost Afghanistan,” a true counterterrorism‐only policy was simply too radical to gain traction, and Gates and the generals knew that even if they could find the troops needed for a fully resourced COIN strategy, the President would not only reject the plan, but think that his military advisers had lost their minds. So one can sympathize with what each side did. But Gates seems unaware that by holding out the likelihood of successful COIN with a smaller force than could do the job, he and the generals were replicating the “dereliction of duty” trap into which their predecessors had fallen in Vietnam.6"
"24","The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan provided numerous examples of a recurring tension in democratic governance and civil–military relations centering on how honest the military leaders should be with Congress and the public. While generals should give the Secretary of Defense and the President their fully candid views, the prescriptions we should apply once policy has been set are not clear. They should not undercut the President's policy, but neither should they lie to Congress. During the Cold War, members of Congress who supported higher defense budgets often put generals on the spot by asking for their professional judgments on whether the funds were sufficient for the national defense, and skillful leaders learned to walk the tightrope. Gates had seen this dilemma in his previous service, but was not at the center of it. Here, he simply glosses over the subject. While he notes the occasions on which Bush and Obama were enraged by the military speaking out of turn (as they considered it), and he often tried to mediate, he does not talk about the hard choices and genuine dilemmas that he and his generals faced. I doubt if there are any final answers here, but it is a shame that Gates did not take the opportunity to discuss how much and what kind of candor we can reasonably expect from the military and what the latter should do in these difficult situations."
"25","Sometimes military leaders, like their civilian counterparts, square their loyalty to the administration with their desire to save their reputations and influence policy by leaking their views to the press. Leaks are both the bane of every administration and a way to lubricate the wheels of government, and even Obama's unprecedented pursuit of offenders has not staunched the flow. As Gates notes, however (for example, pp. 69, 177), many deliberations that might have produced leaks in fact did not do so. This was true not only in cases in which a leak would have thwarted a goal that all participants sought, such as killing Osama bin Laden, but also cases where leaks would have furthered the interests of some of the participants. Whether it is simply luck that determines whether secrecy holds or not is an interesting and unexplored question. But Gates shows that if leaks are not universal, the fear of them is. This influences both the way discussions are conducted and their outcomes. Gates reports that the President saw good foreign policy reasons for not noisily expelling the illegal Russian “sleeper” agents in 2010, but believed that if he did not, the decision would leak, with the result that he would be severely criticized by the Republicans and the ratification of the New Start arms control treaty would be put in jeopardy (pp. 410–411). In other cases, the fear of leaks affects not the outcome but the number of people who can be consulted. Obama gave Gates and the military leaders only one day's notice that his 2010 State of the Union address would include an appeal to end “don't ask, don't tell,” because he feared that had he done so earlier, it would have leaked (p. 433), and the need for secrecy in the bin Laden raid meant that Obama could not tap expertise about how the adverse Pakistani reaction might be mitigated."
"26","Here and elsewhere, Gates shows a good understanding of how bureaucracies work. The first thing he did on taking office as Secretary of Defense was to go to Iraq, and while even a novice might have realized that this was appropriate, only a more‐experienced leader would see that he had to take with him both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his undersecretary for policy in order “to signal to civilians and military alike in the Pentagon that the chairman was going to be a close partner in my leadership of the department, and that the military needed to recognize that my civilian senior staff would play a critical role as well” (p. 85). Similarly, in order to underline the contrast with Rumsfeld, who had met with the Joint Chief of Staffs in his office, Gates went to their meeting place, known as the Tank (p. 87). More substantively, he realized that only by going outside the normal bureaucratic channels and setting up special structures that were directed from the top could he handle urgent problems such as the increasing threat from improvised explosive devices and the need to accelerate the procurement of vehicles that were better armored against them (pp. 119–126, 445–448). At other times, the entire bureaucratic structure had to be short‐circuited (pp. 450–451). These measures were necessary and effective, but the obvious drawback was that they left the dysfunctional structures in place."
"27","Gates also realizes that as powerful as bureaucracies are, individuals matter. Of course he has to feel that his own efforts yielded something, and while I think they did, he might have noted that his path was smoothed by having a predecessor who was almost universally viewed as both grabbing for power and being unable to use it to direct policy. But he does realize that what is important is not only the characteristics of the individuals, but the match between them and what the position calls for. He argues, briefly but convincingly, that the very strengths that led Richard Holbrooke to succeed in the Balkans in the 1990s were inappropriate to his role in the Obama administration. Not only was he picked by Clinton, not Obama, but “his ‘in your face’ approach seemed unlikely to work in countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the leaders, culture, and political conditions were not susceptible to the Holbrooke style” (p. 296). Although the reasoning here is a bit circular, the conclusion probably is correct. Gates notes a similarly mismatched person and position when he appointed General David McKiernan to head the forces in Afghanistan. A very able soldier, McKiernan had been successful in conventional warfare but lacked an understanding of counterinsurgency (p. 217). He also makes the related point that “the qualities important for military leadership and success in war are not the same as those required in peacetime” (p. 577), a problem for which there may be no solution."
"28","Briefly but perceptively, Gates notes the enormous challenge of high office that is difficult to comprehend from the outside.            "
"29","The challenge for historians and journalists—and memoirists—is how to convey the crushing effect of dealing daily with multiple problems, pivoting on a dime every few minutes from one issue to another, having to quickly absorb reporting from many sources on each problem, and then making decisions, always with too little time and too much ambiguous information. Ideally, I suppose there should be a way to structure our national security apparatus so that day‐to‐day matters can be delegated to lower levels of responsibility while the President and his senior advisers focus on the big picture and thoughtfully make grand strategy. But that's not how it works in the real world of politics and policy (pp. 412–413)."
"30","When I asked Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, what the greatest challenge of his job was, he similarly told me that it was having to change the focus of his attention every 15 minutes, if not 15 seconds. The number of meetings (the subject of Gates's frequent complaints), the need to deal with multiple crises simultaneously, the difficulty in getting the relevant information, the growing fatigue, the necessity of dealing with self‐important and ill‐informed members of Congress (as well as others), and what must be the knowledge that the decisions being made may be misguided take their toll. As Henry Kissinger put it, “Historians rarely do justice to the psychological stress on a policy‐maker….What no document can reveal is the accumulated impact of accident, intangibles, fears, and hesitations.” Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, agrees: “Worn down is…how I would describe it. It's hard to express what it's like.”7"
"31","Throughout, Gates details his admiration for and devotion to the troops in the field and the time he spent with the wounded and maimed, difficult as this was. It would take a more‐cynical reviewer than the present one to doubt the genuineness of these feelings, or the irony that they added to the burdens of office that understandably wore him down at the end, just as Blair decribes."
"32","In his penultimate pages, Gates stresses the unpredictability of war, both how it will unfold and when political leaders will see it as necessary, and from this argues both that cutting the military too deeply is a mistake and that American presidents, with the exception of Eisenhower, “have too often been too quick to reach for a gun” (p. 590). He would not agree with those who argue that the best way to restrain this temptation would be to see that the necessary military forces are not available, however,8 and surely would note the twin dangers that the forces would be needed or that the president would order them into action anyway. Recent events in Ukraine remind us that future events are almost certain to surprise us no matter how much expertise we can bring to bear.9 Perhaps a better understanding of the past can offer some solace, if not guidance, which is why we turn to memoirs.         "
"33","Writing critical reviews like this, with the pressure only of other deadlines, may not be the best vantage point by which to judge how Gates and others behaved in office. But it may be an appropriate setting to judge his memoirs, and to be disappointed that he missed the opportunity to reflect on duties he failed to carry out as well as those he did and to engage with so many of the important issues that he did not have the time to think about while in office."
