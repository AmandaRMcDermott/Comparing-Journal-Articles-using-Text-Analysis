"1","In September 1935, Lloyd Gaines, a 24‐year‐old African American resident of St. Louis, Missouri, applied for admission to the University of Missouri Law School. Although Gaines had been valedictorian at his high school and an honors graduate at Lincoln University, his application to the state's flagship legal program was denied because he was black. In fact, Missouri offered no graduate or professional training to any of its black citizens. Instead, the state relied on a 1921 statute that provided a handful of scholarships to African Americans who were willing to pursue advanced degrees in adjacent states. Gaines found this arrangement to be racially discriminatory, and he joined with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to challenge Missouri in court. In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Gaines's favor, holding that Missouri had a constitutional duty under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause to provide black graduate and professional students with educational programs that were substantially equivalent to those offered to white students. Although the Missouri court system delayed implementation of this decision, and Lloyd Gaines disappeared before final arrangements could be made, his case remains significant because it helped pave the way for Brown v. Board of Education and greater racial equity.         "
"2","In their book, Lloyd Gaines and the Fight to End Segregation, James W. Endersby and William T. Horner provide a comprehensive account of the origins, development, and outcome of the Gaines case. The authors are at their best when discussing the NAACP, its legal strategies, and its cases. In this effort, they draw on the scholarship of Mark Tushnet and Genna Rae McNeil to show how attorney Charles Hamilton Houston shaped the campaign to end Jim Crow. Houston's strategy—informed in part by the research of Nathan Ross Margold—called for an indirect, stair‐step approach that would push for equity within the segregated system before attempting to achieve racial desegregation. Although Houston's strategy sparked debate within the black community, Endersby and Horner show how local lawyers Sidney Redmond and Henry Espy helped the NAACP's lead attorney carry out his plan in the Gaines case. Redmond proved to be particularly important, researching topics, interviewing witnesses, filing paperwork, and making arguments.         "
"3","On the other side of the courtroom, Kansas City attorney William Hogsett defended the University of Missouri. Endersby and Horner present a fair and well‐rounded account of Hogsett and show through extensive quotations from local, state, and national press coverage that his hostility to the NAACP and racial desegregation was common among whites nationwide. In fact, Missouri and other states thwarted implementation of the Gaines decision by using every tool at their disposal. In Missouri, this meant redefining the out‐of‐state scholarship program for black students as a “voluntary” measure while also hastily organizing Lincoln University Law School in a last‐ditch effort to meet the requirements of the Gaines ruling.         "
"4","The most fascinating part of Endersby and Horner's book comes in the discussion of Lincoln University's new law school and the person chosen to lead it: William E. Taylor. A one‐time colleague of Houston's at Howard Law School, Taylor succeeded Houston as dean there in 1934, only to become dean of Lincoln new law school in 1939. “Houston did not have a positive view of William Taylor,” the authors write, and that is putting it mildly. The two men truly disliked one another and had different visions of what Lincoln's law school might accomplish. Although the discussion here leaves room for additional work, it also raises interesting parallels to intraracial debates raised in Sarah Caroline Thuesen's Greater Than Equal: African American Struggles for Schools and Citizenship in North Carolina, 1919–1965 and Gary Lavergne's Before Brown: Heman Marion Sweatt, Thurgood Marshall, and the Long Road to Justice. In any case, Endersby and Horner have written what is sure to be the standard account of the Gaines case for many years to come.         "
