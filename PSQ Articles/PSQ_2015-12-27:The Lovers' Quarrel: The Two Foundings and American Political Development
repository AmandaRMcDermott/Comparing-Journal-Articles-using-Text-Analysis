"1","Elvin T. Lim contends that the American “Founding” was not a monolithic event. Rather, the United States has experienced two distinct founding moments, and American political development can (and should) be understood through these two irreconcilable foundational moments. Accordingly, the First Founding, consisting of the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation, emphasized the principle of independent state sovereignty; the Second Founding, embodied in the Constitution, aimed at a more perfect union by subordinating the principle of the First Founding. As such, Anti‐Federalism (the First Founding) and Federalism (the Second Founding) are two competing foundational concepts in the reoccurring debates—the “Lovers' Quarrel”—over the expansion and contraction of federal authority. This is to say that the United States twice constructed a national identity around two distinct understandings of union."
"2","Using foundational concepts as an analytic tool is not a new approach to understanding political development. For example, Lim recognizes that theories of liberalism and republicanism “have taken turns as the dominant tradition in American political thought” (p. 13). However, these theories were appropriated from European thought, and, where he perhaps makes his most important contribution, Lim contends that the “Lovers' Quarrel” between the Anti‐Federalist and Federalist traditions are distinctly American. In this way, Lim is able to provide an account of what is actually “American” in American political thought and American political development, as the “United States is the only federal country in the world to have democratically enacted two and only two constitutions, each specifying a different kind of union” (p. 23). As a result, through the Lovers' Quarrel, Lim convincingly combines the study of ideas with institutional development.         "
"3","To substantiate the connection between ideas and institutions, Lim focuses the majority of the book on familiar historical episodes albeit reinterpreted as reoccurring iterations of his Lover's Quarrel thesis. Hence, Thomas Jefferson and the Revolution of 1800, Andrew Jackson and the rise of the Democratic Party, Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War, the Progressive Era, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, and the Reagan Revolution are all examples of ways in which the competing principles of Anti‐Federalism and Federalism are utilized and reconstituted to understanding the shifting nature of national authority. Subsequently, Lim includes an epilogue with the Tea Party and President Barack Obama cast as the current iteration of the Lovers' Quarrel."
"4","At the heart of Lim's argument is the cyclical nature of his Lovers' Quarrel thesis. As time marches forward, the competing founding principles of the Federalists and Anti‐Federalists authoritatively reemerge, oftentimes reconfigured, to structure and settle debate, thereby creating durable shifts in federal authority. However, one cannot feel as though time has institutionally made the Lovers' Quarrel less pertinent if not settled. Lim acknowledges that the ideas of the competing foundings may be more vibrant than actual changes to institutions, particularly after the New Deal. Indeed, “The Reagan Revolution's durable entrenchment in federal authority was more muted than was the New Deal's expansion.” Yet on the level of ideas, Lim believes Reagan was “spectacularly successful” in reconstituting the principles of the First Founding (p. 178)."
"5","Despite success in appropriating foundational ideas, within the modern context, ideas and institutions may not be as connected as before and “we may therefore be reaching a plateau in terms of state‐building and plebiscitary politics” (p. 206). There is, then, a need to revisit the fundamental commitments of Federalism (state‐building) and Anti‐Federalism (plebiscitary politics). In this way, perhaps Lim's argument is really about the need to reinvigorate the ideas of the Lovers' Quarrel and rediscover the principles of the First and Second Founding in order to facilitate further political development.
