"1","The Greater Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan‐Khartoum, and South Sudan) has been the site of intense domestic and regional conflict over the past 50 years or so. Most recently, what were domestic upheavals have spilled over borders and become regionalized. This, in turn, has led to a major regional security dilemma for Africa, which, up until recently, was thought of as having avoided such challenges."
"2","What are the root causes of current sociopolitical conflicts in the Greater Horn of Africa, and how are such conflicts to be ameliorated? These are the questions that Kidane Mengisteab attempts to address in The Horn of Africa. The author suggests that there is no one theory or analytical framework that would be most appropriate for his analysis. He instead proceeds to organize his discussion in terms of the factors that seem to be most common across the region. Most pronounced are the underlying factors of the “weight of history,” the nation‐building strategies of past regimes, the structure of postcolonial politics, bad governance, identity politics, and environmental degradation. Each of these structural factors can be found in all of the countries of the Horn region; however, in order to understand the factors that provide the dynamics of political instability on a regional scale, one must consider precipitating factors that emerge not so much from interstate disputes but instead from domestic disputes that become transnationalized. Notable examples are the Eritrea‐Ethiopia war in the late 1990s, the collapse of the state of Somalia in the 1990s and the subsequent emergence of the opposition forces of the Islamic Courts Union and al Shabaab, and the activities of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and South Sudan.         "
"3","The picture that is painted in this book in terms of grappling with the challenges presented by domestic social disputes as well as by the spillover of such disputes is one that focuses on the tendency for the countries of the region to engage in unilateral actions that have implications for neighboring states. For example, the hunt for the Lord's Resistance Army by Uganda has spilled over into South Sudan, the Central Africa Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; al Shabaab has further destabilized not only what is left of the Republic of Somalia but also neighboring Kenya."
"4","Mengisteab suggests that the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) was initially conceived as a regional security alliance for dealing primarily with strategic security challenges of a regional nature. However, no attention is given to the actual origins of IGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) in the mid‐1980s. This was an attempt to deal collectively with issues relating to drought, famine, and environmental degradation. Eventually IGADD morphed into IGAD, which has come to be seen as a collective effort to deal with regional strategic security dilemmas. In reality, there has never been any serious effort to make this happen. Part of the reason, as is correctly noted in this volume, has to do with the unwillingness of the states of the Horn to surrender the necessary aspects of their sovereignty that would be dictated by the creation of a true regional security alliance. What comes through in this analysis is the dire need for the countries of the Greater Horn to construct a comprehensive, well‐funded, well‐managed, efficient, and effective regional security system."
"5","Any book that attempts to comprehend the politics of the Horn of Africa would be, as does this one, an ambitious undertaking. Students of the region will find much food for thought in its pages and stimulation for penetrating analyses of many of the issues raised in the book."
