"1","Patrick Egan's book both revives and gives added substance to an old idea (first offered by John Petrocik), that parties have reputations as the guardians of particular policy areas. The twist is that these reputations have effects that you probably did not guess."
"2","If the book did nothing but provide an improved definition of issue ownership, it would have been a worthy effort. Egan defines the term in this way: “Issue ownership describes the long‐term positive associations between political parties and particular consensus issues in the public's mind—associations create and reinforced by the parties' commitments to prioritizing these issues with government spending and lawmaking” (p. 156). Since Petrocik's work on this issue, the term has, frankly, been deployed to mean any number of things. Egan offers us a clear definition that should guide future work."
"3","Chapters 1–5 develop Egan's clear‐eyed account of how the priorities of each party—and, according to Egan, not the performance of the party's chosen policies—drive the policy action of parties once they come into power. His claim (see Chapters 4 and 5 in particular) is that Americans are essentially unable to assign blame or credit to the party's choices because policy takes such a long time (sometimes decades) to unfold. Although this section of the book could have used more attention to the distinction between ends and means, particularly as citizens may think about these things, the claim that citizens “assign issue ownership to the party that cares more about the issue” (p. 119) is difficult to dispute.         "
"4","But the more important contribution is in the rest of the title's subheading and found in Chapter 6. Egan describes a theory of partisan desires that leads political parties to systematically overestimate the popularity of the policies that they “own.” The result is that they pursue policies “that are more extreme than the public wants” (p. 173)."
"5","His spatial model is a bit complicated to describe in this space (but you should read the book to discover it anyway), but it lays out a convincing case for how party actors will choose extremism on “owned” issues. The parties will be less representative of the public on the issues that truly matter to them, although perhaps more moderate when they do not own an issue."
"6","This account in Chapter 6 has the distinction of offering a legitimately novel interpretation of Washington dysfunction—that party elites, caught up in their own enthusiasm, favor extreme policies, at least on the issues that they own. This is likely to be the most controversial point in the book, and it deserves serious attention and future discussion. The empirical case appears to be quite strong—complicated though it can be inside of multilevel models. I did find myself wishing for a bit more specificity about the linkages between masses and elites, but I was fairly convinced that parties are likely to be unresponsive on the issues that motivate them the most. Scholars will want to judge the models and data choices on their own, but Egan makes this relatively easy with very clear appendices."
"7","Egan ends up arguing that issue ownership is not necessarily good or even neutral. It may actually be bad for democracy. This is why I suspect this book may not get the reception it deserves. Egan is telling partisans that their very enthusiasm for the basic principles of their party program will likely lead them to ignore public opinion in favor extreme alternatives. This is not likely to be a message that very many people want to hear. Partisans (of any stripe) do not want to entertain the notion that their preferences are out of the mainstream. However unpopular this message may be in some quarters, it is one that political scientists should give serious consideration.         "
