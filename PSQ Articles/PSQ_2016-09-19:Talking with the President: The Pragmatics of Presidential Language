"1","Many scholars have carefully parsed the words that emerge from presidents’ mouths, but few have provided a detailed investigation of, say, the significance of Ronald Reagan's preference for contractions or the weighty implications of Barack Obama deeming Iraq a “dumb” war rather than a “stupid” one. These examples are just a small piece of John Wilson's project in Talking with the President: The Pragmatics of Presidential Language to apply pragmatics, or “the analysis and description of meaning construction in social contexts of interaction” (p. 3), to the presidential language of John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. The book is noteworthy not only for this innovative approach to the study of presidential rhetoric but also for the ways Wilson skillfully integrates findings from linguistics, political science, the law, literary studies, psychology, and philosophy (among other fields) to provide a rich and interdisciplinary account of why individual presidents speak the way they do and the reactions that such talk provokes in those who hear it. The text is highly readable, at times interlacing presidents’ words with examples of how we make similar language choices in our everyday lives to clarify or obscure meaning (or, in US Weekly parlance, “Presidents—They're Just Like Us!”) while still elucidating what is distinctive and deeply consequential about presidential talk.         "
"2","Wilson selects “one or two interesting pragmatic phenomena” to highlight for each of the aforementioned presidents, who, in turn, were chosen for being “particularly associated with the overall use of a pragmatic topic” (p. 5). Some readers may wish for a somewhat more systematic explanation of case selection and discussion of why certain excerpts from presidential statements are emphasized over others to illustrate these trends. For instance, in using Obama's 2008 “A More Perfect Union” speech to trace conceptual clash and resolution, Wilson draws our attention to Obama's application of the American Dream to his personal heritage, but one wonders what insights a pragmatic lens might have procured if focused on the speech's more complex themes of love, anger, reconciliation, and resentment within Obama's own family and social circle to tell the story of race in America. In a similar vein, Reagan's “welfare queen” story is briefly relayed to demonstrate how politicians exploit our intuitive reactions to speeches based on preexisting stereotypes, in this case about poverty, yet there is no mention of why and how inferences might also be drawn about racial stereotypes, widely cited as a key component of the “meaning” behind the tale."
"3","This all just speaks to the import of Wilson's endeavor and the ways his analysis might be pushed further and even more extensively employed to fruitful ends. Wilson's pragmatic line of inquiry is at its best in this text when applied, perhaps unsurprisingly, to Clinton, that master of manipulating language who famously asked us to reconsider what the meaning of “is” is. The book's chapter on Clinton deftly guides us through the president's intricate verbal defenses in both legal and public settings during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and offers a fresh and absorbing take on what pragmatics has to tell us about Clinton's carefully chosen words, the role of ambiguity and redefinition in language, and what makes presidential talk convincing (or not) to those hearing it. In sum, Talking with the President is a compelling and inventive work that is enjoyable to read and represents a refreshing addition to the study of presidential communication.         "
