"1","In this beautifully crafted critique of globalism, American foreign policy, and much current thinking about the impact of modern military technology on security, Patrick Porter offers a compelling reassessment of the idea that the world is “shrinking,” especially when it comes to the use of force in international politics. In Porter's view, contemporary strategists erroneously extrapolate from the peacetime world to the battlefield, confusing the “permissive” environment of civilian activities to the “contested” environment of conflict. Admittedly, the information revolution has given us the ability to transcend distance when it comes to virtually all forms of communication. Nevertheless, this newfound freedom only exists when systems are functioning and are not subjected to political or physical interference. Terminate just one connection in the multifaceted process known as international airline travel, and the plane will never leave the terminal."
"2","At the heart of Porter's analysis is a Clausewitzian view of conflict. Peacetime transportation and communications are largely a linear affair governed by efficiency, accessibility, and ease of operations. In wartime, however, results are determined by the interactions of opposing forces, which can produce decidedly different outcomes. This is why oceans, for instance, can be depicted as both highways and barriers. In peacetime, they are the most efficient way to transport goods over long distances, whereas in wartime, they can be transformed into barriers that can be penetrated only at enormous cost and effort. Given this dialectical perspective, it might be too early to tell whether modern military technologies—precision guidance, robotics, cyberwar, global surveillance—will serve to shrink distance or actually create significant barriers to projecting military power. Porter makes the case that a tightly connected globalized world—in which political, military, and cyber threats easily transcend space and time—is unlikely to exist when states use similar technologies to erect relatively inexpensive defenses."
"3","The ultimate purpose behind Porter's critique of the “shrinking world” idea is to highlight flaws in U.S. foreign policy, especially what he sees as the urge to achieve absolute security. The “shrinking world” perspective, according to Porter, fuels American insecurity and creates the justification to intervene in distant lands to eliminate threats that are increasingly perceived to be within easy striking distance of the homeland. This is indeed the lesson of September 11: in a globalized world, the chaos found in failed states travels easily to the heartland. For Porter, however, the ceaseless crusade created by this perception of propinquity is especially tragic because it is unnecessary. Well‐placed defenses, better police and security procedures, and some policy and political savvy could go a long way toward helping make the “tyranny of distance” a harsh reality again."
"4","The Global Village Myth thus addresses two issues that animate contemporary debates about grand strategy. In a narrow military sense, it suggests that it is too early to tell whether we are heading toward a world in which the offensive holds sway over the defense in war. In a broader geopolitical sense, its suggests not only that the idea that the world is shrinking in space and time might be mistaken but also that this “global village perspective” is propelling the United States to become more militarily assertive. Porter has crafted an important work that offers insight into a strategic setting that will only grow more complex as the information revolution plays out in the decades ahead.         "
