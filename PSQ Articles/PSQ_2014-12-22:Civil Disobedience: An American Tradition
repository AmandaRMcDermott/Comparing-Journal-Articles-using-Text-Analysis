"1","Lewis Perry offers this intriguing history of civil disobedience in the United States. In it, he argues that a distinct and robust American tradition of civil disobedience has had a repeated and significant influence in forcing our institutions to rectify “the systematic inequality of power.” His sweep is wide. He does not simply examine the great social movements that are familiar to students of civil disobedience—the movements against slavery and conscription and for the rights of women and workers—but he also introduces the reader to the unfamiliar—disobedience deployed in the movement against Indian removal and in defense of religious freedom in colonial America. He not only expands our understanding of Henry David Thoreau, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King, Jr., but also acquaints us for the first time with Angelina Grimké and Albert Gallatin Riddle."
"2","His reach is long. Perry's knowledge of the literature is detailed, surprising the reader with a treasure trove of sources most scholars have never considered. Indeed, his work appears to reflect a lifetime of research."
"3","His analysis is deep. In chronicling American civil disobedience from pre‐independence times to the current day, Perry demonstrates the relationships between and among movements. His treatment of worker rights is illustrative; he shows how industrial sit‐in strikes would later influence religious leaders and civil rights reformers. While thoroughly showing how the disobedience tradition thus built upon itself from movement to movement, Perry also recognizes the insertion of profound new influences into the tradition. He credits, for example, Richard Gregg's The Power of Non‐Violence and Krishnala Shridharani's War without Violence with helping to bring Gandhi's approach to America and creating an American “Gandhian moment”—the Montgomery bus boycott.         "
"4","All of this is done with the historian's appreciation for complexity. There are no simplicities here. Immediately after he hails the Gandhian moment as extraordinary, he qualifies it as not unprecedented. And even as he salutes the commitment to public order that America's disobedients have traditionally exhibited, he wonders whether recent disobedients are abandoning respect for the law."
"5","The book's limitations, frustrating as they might be to the general reader, enable its strength. Perry is not especially concerned about definitions and distinctions. He does not set out to defend a master definition of civil disobedience. Nor does he devote significant energy to wrestling with the sometimes difficult distinctions between and among civil disobedience, nonviolence, revolution, and lawful protest."
"6","He is not especially concerned about delineating and dissecting justifications for civil disobedience. While clearly acknowledging their existence, he does not systematically describe and explore the many grounds—moral, religious, political, and more—on which civil disobedients have stood."
"7","And he is not especially concerned about explanations of how civil disobedience creates change. He does not directly take up the roles that self‐suffering and the massive withdrawal of consent play in effective civil disobedience, nor does he explain the role that civil disobedience might have in a larger campaign for change."
"8","Perry might have addressed these concerns had he been a legal scholar, a philosopher, or a political scientist. He is, rather, a historian, and the fact is that avoiding this agenda provides him the freedom necessary to unite—and make sense of—disparate historical strands. His book, pulling together and analyzing centuries of American resistance in one place, is a signal achievement. Civil Disobedience: An American Tradition can rightfully lay claim to being the leading authoritative work on the rich history of American civil disobedience.         "
