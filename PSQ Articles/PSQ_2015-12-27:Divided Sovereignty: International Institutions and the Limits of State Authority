"1","Carmen Pavel argues in this excellent study that states are not by themselves sufficient to guarantee protection of basic human rights. In this sense, the state is, as she puts it, an incomplete institutional form. Therefore, it is appropriate to adopt a political system in which sovereignty is divided between states and international institutions, such as the International Criminal Court, whose purpose is to avoid states' abusing their power by depriving their citizens of those rights. She conceives such a division of sovereignty as “an insurance scheme against the possibility that states may fail to fulfill their duties” to protect rights (p. 27). Such a division of sovereignty increases the probability that individuals will have their rights respected."
"2","In addition to this substantive argument, Pavel makes an important methodological argument. Theorizing about justice is too often stuck at the abstract level. The work of theorists should embrace what Pavel calls institutional thinking, which includes the understanding of empirical social science on the effectiveness of institutions in human governance. Such an understanding is important not merely for the implementation of abstract moral ideals but for their formulation as well. Our theories must be sensitive to institutional facts. This leads her in a pragmatic direction. In the end, she abjures grand theories, such as schemes of global democracy, and argues in favor of a system of incremental and minimalist institutional pluralism at the international level."
"3","The concept of divided sovereignty is problematic both conceptually and practically. The chief conceptual problem, dating back to Thomas Hobbes, is the claim that sovereignty cannot be divided because social order cannot exist without an unchallenged source of authority. As the existence of government with divided powers and of federated political systems clearly shows, however, this claim is false. But the practical problem is whether divided sovereignty can work when the division is between states (as primary agents) and international organizations (as secondary agents). This is where institutional thinking is called for and where Pavel's work makes a strong contribution."
"4","What justifies international organizations sharing sovereignty with states? It is, in part, their functional ability to help ensure that individuals in states will have their rights respected. Part of the justification is that the rights in question correspond to jus cogens norms, a set of norms recognized in international law as preemptory. (The justification, in Pavel's view, is emergent as well as functional, in the sense that it can arise from our historical situation in a way that is morally acceptable.)         "
"5","Many theories of global justice recognize that states are practical obstacles to the achievement of justice through international institutions, but Pavel understands states as normative obstacles as well, in the sense that they represent moral constraints on the justified scope of international institutions. The reason is that states are “the expression of groups of people's collective rights of self‐determination” (p. 96). As such, they carry moral weight that must be balanced against that represented by the international efforts for rights protections. She offers an analogy between families and states, in that both stand as moral bulwarks against casual outside interference. This is why interference with the state to protect rights, as in the case of humanitarian intervention, is justified only when the violation of those rights is extreme. This is the most underdeveloped part of Pavel's argument. She does not make clear what “collective rights of self‐determination” are or how they compare with and are to be balanced against the individual rights she is concerned to protect, or indeed how they constitute a normative obstacle, as distinct from a practical obstacle."
