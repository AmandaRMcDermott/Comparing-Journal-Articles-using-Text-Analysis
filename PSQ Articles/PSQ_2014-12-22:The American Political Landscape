"1","Byron Shafer and Richard Spady rely on cutting‐edge data analyses and graphical presentations to provide a detailed accounting of how social characteristics have shaped core political values, which, in turn, has structured the presidential vote across the 1984–2008 elections. The study stands apart for the sheer richness and depth of its analyses of a specific data source—namely, the 1987 through 2009 Pew Values Surveys—to gain insight into the shifting contours of the American electorate. An application of item response theory to consistent sets of questions enables Shafer and Spady to produce indicators of two unobservable attitudinal dimensions: economics and culture. These two emergent values constructs then allow them to array survey respondents in terms of percentile position. Subsequently, Shafer and Spady compute a probability distribution on each dimension based on the individual‐level data. As the authors describe, these distributions may then be “cumulated, for a particular (social) group or for the nation as a whole to yield a political landscape” (p. 3). Ultimately, their approach enables them to focus on the distribution of economic values and of cultural values among partisan voters, taking into account citizens' underlying densities in the population.         "
"2","The study highlights four demographic cleavages: social class, race and ethnicity, religion, and gender and parenthood. Shafer and Spady examine not only the ceteris paribus relationships between individual social characteristics and the political values, but also social group values. In addition, they examine the relationship between the values indicators, both individually and jointly, and the presidential vote, as well as the actual density clustering of voters on the ideological landscape. The authors highlight that the latter should be of particular interest to campaign strategists.         "
"3","The overarching finding of The American Political Landscape is the increasing importance of cultural values to the presidential vote across these decades among both the national electorate and almost all of the various social groups that comprise this electorate. Economics remain important, but are now matched by culture. Furthermore, both Republican voters and Democratic voters have become ideologically consistent, in conservative and liberal directions, respectively, on the two values dimensions. Shafer and Spady also find that, as a social group, Hispanics are economically liberal, but culturally conservative—with each political party thus having something that attracts, as well as repels, this increasingly important segment. Interpreting voting probability contour plots overlaid on voter density maps, the authors also provide novel evidence for why the ideological middle may be frequently bereft of candidates; not many plausible supporters of partisan candidates actually reside in the middle.         "
"4","The major strength of The American Political Landscape is its unprecedented, self‐described thick description. However, many of its core substantive findings have been previously documented. Inexplicably never mentioned, the still‐vibrant debate on the question of a culture war (for example, Morris Fiorina, Culture War?) has already highlighted the increasing importance of a cultural dimension across the past two decades of presidential voting, as well as the partisan sort that has produced the more‐ideologically consistent parties in the electorate. Also uncited, numerous examinations in political science provide precursors to this treatment's social group considerations (for example, the analyses of Axelrod and Stanley and Niemi, among others). Finally, although documentation of temporal shifts in the electorate—for example, the especially marked cultural shift to the right among Republican voters—is informative, a theoretically motivated assessment of the processes that (may) produce these shifts would be welcome. Do elites lead the way or respond to the masses? What is the role of conflict extension, and so forth? The American Political Landscape does not tackle these questions.         "
