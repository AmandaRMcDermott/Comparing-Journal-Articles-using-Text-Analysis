"1","PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IS PURSUING a foreign policy that includes engaging adversaries and enemies. The United States has reached out to Iran, pushed the “reset” button in its relations with Russia, and tried to nudge China toward greater cooperation. President Obama has also engaged North Korea and Cuba, and even Burma and Syria before the uprising. In his 2010 National Security Strategy of the United States of America, the President calls for expanding U.S. engagement with “other key centers of influence—including China, India and Russia, as well as increasingly influential nations such as Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia.”1"
"2","In 1940, with the publication of Guilty Men, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's engagement policy was depicted as naïve and engaging in wishful thinking.2 In 1976, candidate Ronald Reagan argued that President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's engagement policy of détente made the United States “number two in a world where it is dangerous if not fatal, to be second best.” Criticism of President Obama's foreign policy is similar. According to Robert Kagan, the Obama administration's new strategy entails “accommodating the world's rising powers.”3 For other scholars and policymakers, President Obama's foreign policy is a realistic whittling down of global aspirations to a core set of goals reflecting an assessment of available resources (also known as selective engagement), the shifting global balance of power (including soft and perhaps even hard balancing against the United States), a redefinition of American power, and a more‐limited view of the war on terrorism.4"
"3","Britain's 1930s double policy (rearmament and diplomacy) and America's 1970s détente grand strategy also called for engaging the enemy in order to reduce the number of foreign threats to an affordable level, conserve financial strength, and restore the balance between financial capabilities and global commitments.5 Scholars and policymakers tend to focus on the political concessions and inducements that London and, to a lesser extent Washington, extended. My focus in this article is to highlight the commercial and financial concessions that were also an important component of engagement, though not always the central part. Britain extended credits, loans, trade concessions, market guarantees, and export earnings in sterling to Germany and Japan. The United States proposed or extended capital and technology, export−import bank financing, most‐favored nation (MFN) tariff treatment, and long‐term credit to the Soviet Union. The United States granted China MFN trading status, foreign investment, and export−import bank financing.         "
"4","Scholars and policymakers have depicted British and American trade concessions and commercial inducements to their adversaries as part of a general appeasement policy.6 I contend that despite the aggregate material power and threat, British and American leaders identified moderate political and societal leaders in Germany, the Soviet Union, China, and Japan. Specifically, one intent of British and American concession and inducement policies was to strengthen reformers or moderates in the political leadership or wings of power who were engaged in leadership struggles with hard‐liners, and concomitantly, to increase the size of their domestic win‐set and to expand their base of support. By strengthening their power and position, London and Washington sought to assist in realigning the foreign policies of these adversaries away from massive rearmament, extreme autarky, and war preparation—or at least to slow them down and to buy time for moderately paced rearmament.7"
"5","There are four lessons that the Obama administration can learn from previous British and American policies of engagement. First, as Britain's concessions to Germany demonstrate, there is the danger of believing that moderates in the wings of power and their domestic supporters can curb the extreme policies of the hard‐liners. Second, as British concessions to Japan demonstrate, competing foreign policies in the initiating state can work at cross purposes and thereby weaken rather than strengthen foreign moderates or push the moderates into the hard‐liners' camp. Third, as American concessions to the Soviet Union highlight, there is the danger of domestic obstructionists blocking or undermining the intent of concessions. Finally, as American concessions to China demonstrate, a strategy of concessions and inducements is most likely to succeed if the boost is decisive in reshuffling the domestic balance of political power and if the political institutions in the target state grant access to moderates. The import of these lessons is that although a foreign state's aggregate power might pose a threat, the presence of reform‐minded or moderate elements who are in positions of leadership or in the wings of power and who are engaged in internal power struggles with hard‐line elements can override this net assessment. Thus, trade concessions and commercial inducements to boost their power and position, rather than punishment or firm‐balancing, might be the appropriate policy for altering an adversary's domestic and foreign policy."
"6","I have selected these four case studies because despite being from two separate though similar grand strategies and being from the twentieth century, they remain relevant to America in the twenty‐first century. First, the United States shares similarities with the position of the initiating countries of Britain in the 1930s and America in the 1970s. The most important is that like these cases, the United States faces multiple challengers in different locales that according to the National Security Strategy threaten to “sap our strength by overextending our power.”8 Moreover, like the British and American cases, the United States is constructing a grand strategy to “renew [its] leadership” by bringing its capabilities and global commitments into balance, which includes lowering the cost of leadership through engagement policies.9 Second, the targets of the United States share similarities to those that Britain in the 1930s and America in the 1970s faced. These include a mix of potential and great powers that are bent on changing the regional/international order through military and other means; they are primarily authoritarian and closed regimes, and there is the perception of ongoing domestic balance‐of‐power struggles between moderates and hard‐liners whose outcome has not yet been determined. Third, these cases highlight previous attempts to use trade concessions to moderate the foreign policy of an adversary that have either been tripped up and failed or have succeeded.         "
"7","Other states have extended trade concessions. What is distinct about the above four cases, though not necessarily unique, is that they entail trade concessions to an adversary for the purpose of manipulating the domestic balance of power. The United States has extended concessions to allies. After World War II, the creation of a common tariff union, with the support of the United States in the form of the Marshall Plan (which required European countries to drop their tariffs on each other to qualify for U.S. aid) allowed the European states to lower their internal barriers to trade while at the same time holding their external tariff rates against the United States in place. In 1996, two years after the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, the United States established qualified industrial zones that allowed manufactured Israeli–Jordanian goods to enter the United States duty and quota free. The United States also extended economic and military aid to Marshall Tito's Yugoslavia to help keep his government in power against a more hard‐line Soviet regime. Moreover, adversaries have engaged in trade, such as the German–Soviet commercial agreement (1939, 1940), but the intent was to acquire primary or finished goods that were in scarce supply. Finally, great powers have faced similar circumstances as the United States currently faces and Britain and America faced, and have selected not to extend trade concessions to adversaries. For instance, in the 1630s, Spain confronted a rising Holland, France, and England that challenged its leadership in different parts of its empire, although Madrid chose a grand strategy of punishment everywhere.10"
"8","The first part of this article outlines a model of the state. In opening up the black box of the state, I distinguish the foreign policy executive (FPE) from other government leaders. Next, within the state, I distinguish between two broad and log‐rolled societal coalitions: internationalists and nationalists. Finally, I examine four cases (Anglo‐German, Anglo‐Japanese, American‐Soviet, and American‐Chinese) of trade concessions and inducements, and discuss the lessons for the Obama administration."
"9","Diverse authors highlight the ability of one state to use trade concessions and inducements to alter the incentive structure in another state to change its foreign policy; unilateral changes in the hegemon's commercial policies can trigger changes in states abroad.11 For Rawi Abdelal and Jonathan Kirshner, the foreign economic policy of a great power can affect another state's domestic political competition.12 In asymmetrical relationships, the more powerful state makes economic sacrifices to alter the domestic political interests in other societies in order to enhance internal support for international agreements. This is possible because different domestic actors in the target state have competing positions of what is in their nation's best interest. The outcome, according to Abdelal and Kirshner, is that the smaller state's policies will “converge towards that of the larger” power.13"
"10","For Scott James and David Lake, an economic hegemon can use its market power, and specifically changes in its own domestic or foreign trade policy, to indirectly influence the trade practices of other states. First, by unilaterally lowering tariffs on its own products, factors, or sectors, the hegemon can alter the societal incentives abroad. Second, these opportunities will lead to a shift in the domestic balance of political power among inward and outward firms, sectors, and factors, and thereby favor the other country's free trade bloc. Finally, the newly empowered actors will mobilize to lobby the government for trade liberalization at home and abroad. For the hegemon, this is an “invisible hand” strategy. According to James and Lake “Once set in motion… the process is automatic and hidden from view by the veil of market forces.”14"
"11","A number of authors emphasize the use of trade concessions and inducements to target specific groups with the intent of boosting their power and position in order to reorient an adversary's domestic and foreign policy. According to William Long and Scott Kastner, the targets are internationalist economic interests who gain from international trade.15 For Lars Skalnes, states in need of allies and supporters will offer favorable discriminatory foreign economic policies to the target country. The intent is that the foreign beneficiaries will have a vested stake in closer military and economic relations with the initiating country.16 Similarly, for Paul Papayoanou, economic interdependence generates domestic economic interests that affect a leader's capacity to mobilize resources.17 The more extensive the commercial and financial ties between states, the easier it is for political leaders to mobilize domestic support for an ally, and the more credible the counterbalancing alliance in the view of potential challengers.         "
"12","I contend that a great power can pursue a deliberate “Trojan horse” policy to transform rising or geo‐strategic states into followers and supporters rather than challengers. Specifically, a great power can use economic statecraft both at home and abroad, and in particular trade agreements and concessions, to enable a favorable foreign policy coalition in other states. The initiating state can also disable a domestic or foreign policy coalition by driving a wedge between state leaders and societal elites."
"13","In opening up the black box of the state, I separate the FPE from other government leaders.18 The FPE comprises the head of the government and the ministers and officials responsible for making foreign and security policy. The FPE occupies critical positions in an administration and is the “authoritative foreign policymaker.”19 In addition to the president or prime minister, the FPE includes elected politicians, bureaucratic chiefs, and tenured officials. These individuals, as Thomas Christensen notes, “are more likely than average citizens to be concerned with the long‐term security of the nation.”20 They also possess private information and a monopoly on intelligence about foreign countries. In focusing on the FPE, I do not distinguish between political systems, though there is no doubt that they offer different political access, even in the case of similar ones such as presidential and parliamentary systems.21"
"14","Within the state, I distinguish between two broad and log‐rolled societal coalitions: internationalists and nationalists. Unlike the FPE, which is tasked with maximizing the state's national security, economic elites are primarily concerned about maximizing their firm's, factor's, or sector's income and relative wealth. The internationalist coalition is defined as the internationally competitive sectors plus their outward‐oriented supporters. These supporters have overseas investments or interests, benefit from international economic exposure, or have strong international ties. Supporters favor a grand strategy that entails heightened involvement in the international system, and they prosper from greater economic, political, and military engagement in the international system.22 Supporters require coordinating and collaborating with other governments and business cohorts on matters of international commerce, finance, and security policy. Constituents include fiscal conservatives, export‐oriented industries, large banking and financial services, liquid asset holders, skilled labor, and finance‐oriented government bureaucracies.23"
"15","The nationalist coalition is defined as the non‐internationally competitive sectors and domestic‐oriented supporters.24 They have few foreign assets, sales, and links, or competition with foreign imports. Nationalists will contest calls for greater international engagement because it undermines their constituents' domestic power and position. Nationalists oppose the costs and risks of internationalism, and favor limiting foreign involvement by restricting military spending to defense of the homeland, curbing foreign aid, and rejecting overseas commitments and foreign entanglements.25 Supporters include parochial and confessionalist groups, inefficient industry and agriculture, import‐substituting manufacturing, labor‐intensive industry, public sector managers and workers, and state‐owned enterprises.            "
"16","I argue that one of a great power's intents in granting trade concession and inducements or taking a hard line toward another state is to enable a favorable foreign policy coalition abroad or disable an unfavorable coalition. Concessions and inducements or a hard‐line stance can strengthen the hand of moderates/internationalists (or hard‐liners/nationalists) at the helm of the government who are engaged in power struggles with hard‐liners/nationalists (or moderates/internationalists) for leadership, and increase the size of the moderates/internationalists' or the hard‐liners/nationalists' domestic base of support or domestic win‐set. The latter is important in order to assist the leadership in implementing their desired foreign and domestic policy agenda.26"
"17","A second intent of trade concessions is conflict reduction. For both Washington and London, this means reducing fears of foreign encirclement and more generally taming the security dilemma. From this perspective, commercial and financial concessions serve the goal of signaling benign intentions rather than as a means of strengthening foreign moderates. The two goals are not incompatible, but my focus is on the latter."
"18","Some of the commercial strategies that a great power can use to boost the power and improve the position of internationalists abroad include: increasing trade, economic growth abroad, and export opportunities; helping to make previously non‐internationally competitive sectors in the target state more internationally competitive; benefiting domestic sectors that use foreign inputs intensively, thereby making them more efficient in the home market (and abroad, too); weakening domestic firms that produce the input and firms that compete with users of the imported input; and uniting both the nationalist and the internationalist sectors in favor of a foreign policy of market‐sharing schemes in third markets and managed international trade over the alternative of foreign expansion and a closed autarchic system. A hard‐line policy can have the opposite impact and can empower the nationalists abroad."
"19","There are three dangers from trade concessions that can elicit worse rather than better behavior from a foreign adversary. First, if the initiating state adopts an accommodative foreign policy with the intent of enhancing the more‐moderate elements in the target power, foreign state leaders might interpret a softer stance as a sign of weakness and concessions. Second, even if the great power can strengthen moderate elements, they might not have access to state leaders or be able to influence the policies of state leaders. Worse, the moderates might be viewed with suspicion and persecuted as fifth‐column agents."
"20","Third, engaging the foreign state in trade agreements and concessions with the intent of enhancing moderate societal elements will concomitantly strengthen the economic and military power of a challenger. In the 1930s, some observers in Britain argued that Berlin was using concessions such as the Anglo‐German payments agreement to purchase raw materials for rearmament. Others countered that despite this risk, trade concessions strengthened the “Peace Party.” In the United States, similar objections against this kind of engagement and the danger of strengthening the other's military were made during the Cold War. One solution for Britain to minimize the risk was to abandon trade concessions once it appeared that the hard‐liners had won control and to switch to a policy of punishment.27 For instance, in 1937, British overtures to Japan ceased once fighting on the mainland intensified.28 On January 1937, the first possible day allowed by the expiration of the Washington naval treaty, Britain laid down five new battleships.            "
"21","There are at least four lessons that the Obama administration can learn from Britain's double policy and America's détente grand strategy (see Table 1). As part of their grand strategy, Britain and the United States extended trade concessions and inducements to boost the power and the position of political and economic moderates in Germany and Japan, and China and the Soviet Union.         "
"22","The first lesson for the Obama administration is the danger of believing that moderates in the wings of power and their domestic supporters are stronger than they are and that they can curb the extreme policies of the hard‐liners. By the mid‐1930s, London had identified Germany, Japan, and Italy as threats (Britain also faced challenges in its empire including Egypt, Iraq, and India, and civil war in Palestine, and was succumbing to foreign industrial competition at home and in the empire). Britain's double policy called for military rearmament, reducing the number of foreign threats, and conserving financial strength.29 Even though Germany posed the greater aggregate threat, Britain extended greater trade concessions to Berlin than to Tokyo (the reverse is true for the United States in the 1970s, which extended greater concessions to a less‐threatening China).         "
"23","One of the German “moderates” that London targeted was Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank (German Central Bank, 1933–39) and Minister of Economics (1934–37).30 Schacht insisted that concessions bolstered moderates within the inner‐German power struggle. Schacht favored rearmament (to curtail unemployment and reassert Germany's position), sound finance, increased exports (to alleviate the severe shortage of foreign currency), and the return of German colonies.31 Schacht opposed the hard‐liners' program of self‐sufficiency and massive rearmament. Other identified moderates were found in the Foreign Office, the Reichsbank, the Army, and traditional‐minded trading economic circles that pushed for an Anglo‐German entente and peaceful revision of the Versailles Treaty. These included Helmut Wohltat, a senior official of the German economics ministry; Hermann Göring, the commissioner of the four‐year plan; Field Marshal von Blomberg; Dr. Frick; Minister of the Interior, Baron Konstantin von Neurath; the former Foreign Minister, Walther Funk, Schacht's successor; and Ernst von Weizsacker, under‐secretary in the Foreign Office.32"
"24","Among British leaders, Montagu Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, encouraged British financial penetration of Germany in order to ensure that “an Anglo‐German connection had been created” (other supporters included Sir Frederick Leith‐Ross, the chief economic adviser to the government; Gladwyn Jebb, Foreign Office; and Frank Ashton‐Gwatkin, head of the economic section of the Foreign Office).33 The intent was to promote the intensification of commercial interactions in order to tip the domestic balance of political power in favor of German moderate circles. Concomitantly, a second goal was to boost the power and position of German internationalists in the banking and light industry sectors, and in some cases even heavy industry. British leaders believed that a larger internationalist win‐set could assist Schacht and other moderate government officials who were pushing to realign German foreign policy away from autarky, massive rearmament, and external adventure.            "
"25","British supporters of concessions asserted that England's protectionism, and, more specifically, the Ottawa Agreement (1931) and imperial preferences (1931–32), had helped to push the German industrial and commercial classes into the hard‐line camp. They pointed to Britain's abandonment of the gold standard (1931), adoption of imperial preferences, tariffs, quotas against Japanese exports, loan and credit embargoes against Germany, and trade sanctions against Italy.34 For the same reason, they opposed any discussion of economic sanctions against Germany.35"
"26","To assist Schacht in reorienting German foreign policy, Governor Norman sought to increase the size of the moderates' domestic coalition. The targets were German central bankers and industry, who viewed Hitler's and the hard‐liners' fiscal measures and economic policy with concern. Of course, concomitantly, London extended political concessions to Berlin."
"27","Within German banking, there were many indications of opposition to the Nazi Party's extreme financial and industrial policies, and massive military rearmament program.36 With Norman's support, until 1939, British banks maintained a high proportion of their credits to Germany.37 Norman argued that these agreements contributed to a close working relationship between the banking representatives of each country.38"
"28","Following the Great Crash of 1929, the 1931 Anglo‐German Standstill Agreement froze existing credits (short‐term credits issued to German banks, industry, and commerce by British banks) while interest payments continued on existing loans. The Standstill Agreement formed the basis for bilateral economic and financial relations. The 1934 Anglo‐German Payments Agreement saved the Anglo‐German Standstill Agreement. In this agreement the German Reichsbank committed itself to earmarking 55 percent of German export earnings from trade with Britain to the purchase of British commodities monthly (with 10 percent to go to servicing the debts).39 German sterling receipts not used to service debts or to finance imports from Britain could be spent on commodities produced within the Commonwealth and Empire, an exchange that would in turn stimulate demand for British exports. This agreement required that Norman extend a new line of credit of £750,000 to Germany. Both the Bank of England and the Treasury viewed this agreement as a means to “strengthen the peace party” and to keep at least a portion of German industry within the realm of the international economy.40 Some observers in Britain's manufacturing countered that Berlin was using the Anglo‐German Payments Agreement to compete with British exports and to procure raw materials that would be used for rearmament.41"
"29","In 1938, following the Anschluss, British and German officials again negotiated a revised Payments Agreement. Berlin agreed to assume responsibility for the Austrian debts and to spend up to 60 percent of the foreign exchange generated by trade with Britain on British products, in return for the provision of additional credits. British officials again argued that the revised agreement “strengthened the peace party” and thereby helped “reasonable people in Germany to exert their influence.”42"
"30","A second aspect of Britain's commercial policy was the deliberate strengthening of German export‐oriented industry and the courting of heavy industry. Despite controls on capital, London granted an increasing volume of export credits to British firms engaged in commerce with Germany.43"
"31","Within German industrial circles, there were many signs of opposition to the Nazi Party's financial and industrial policies and military rearmament. Owners of heavy industry resisted state control and ownership, domestic production, and autarky.44 As late as 1939, they favored a freer capital market, fewer trade restrictions, and greater internationalization of the European steel industry (within the context of the 1935 International Steel Cartel). German export‐oriented companies were even less sympathetic to the Nazi's unorthodox fiscal and monetary policies.45 Light industry, which had lower fixed costs and more‐stable profits than heavy industry, was dependent on consumer buying power. Protection of heavy industry meant that light industry and finished exporters paid higher prices for imports, including machinery and fuels, while the lowered buying power of the masses and trade preference given to the import of products to be used for rearmament eroded their markets. Higher levels of rearmament also threatened financial stability, weakened the private capital market, and meant heavy taxes. Finally, export subsidies helped the inefficient producer at the expense of the efficient, whereas state controls over distribution meant a restriction on raw material supply for those firms in export and consumption goods.46"
"32","London believed that German heavy industry would prefer a settled share of third markets over autarky, large‐scale war preparation, and controls (on imports, distribution of raw materials, wages, and employment).47 More broadly, British officials in the Foreign Office, Treasury Office, the Board of Trade, and the Department of Overseas Trade believed that trade agreements would strengthen internationalists who favored Germany's return to the global trading system.48 The Federation of British Industries (FBI) initiated discussions with its German counterpart, the Reichsgruppe Industrie, regarding management of international trade through cartel and market sharing agreements between British and German industries, especially where manufacturers from the two countries were competing in third countries.49 The goal was an industrial détente. International economic planning across national boundaries had the intent of protecting market shares and prices, while diluting Nazi commercial practices of bilateral trade deals and subsidies for exports (these trade deals harmed British exports, especially on the Continent and in Latin America). Specifically, Berlin would see the advantages from trading outside a closed autarkic trading order.50"
"33","Until 1938, the perception in London was that the German leadership in the foreign policy arena was not monolithic; turbulent inner‐power struggles occurred between the moderates and the extremists.51 Since the extremists were not in complete control of the regime, it was argued that Britain should “do all in its power to encourage the moderates.”52 Moreover, within German industrial circles, there were numerous signs of opposition to the Nazi Party's financial, industrial, and rearmament programs.            "
"34","For London, trade concessions were an important tool, though less central than political concessions. In 1936, Schacht and other moderates in the Foreign Ministry and General Staff lobbied against Hitler's aim of western expansion. Their concern was that it risked turning Britain into an enemy. In 1937, Schacht and business, banking, and industrial supporters lobbied for a 50 percent reduction in the amount of raw materials allocated to arms manufacturing and “Ersatz” or substitute materials for self sufficiency. This would allow Germany to increase the supplies for the production of exports for cash.53 In 1938, during the Sudeten crisis, moderates and internationalists pressed to avoid armed conflict with the West. They called for resolving the Sudetenland problem by a peaceful revision of the frontiers—in accordance with British policy that accepted German supremacy in central and southeastern European trade and payments. Following the Anschluss, German moderates pushed party hard‐liners to reverse their opposition that Germany honor outstanding Austrian debts.            "
"35","British foreign policy toward Germany included the (mis)perception that the moderates could restrain and rein in the hard‐liners. This policy was not necessarily misguided, because British leaders believed that the moderates had a chance and might have been sensible until the hard‐liners consolidated their position. After 1937 or 1938, the hard‐liners in the Nazi leadership had mostly circumvented the moderates and undermined their domestic base.54 As Ronald Smelser notes, “We know that conservative strength was not what it seemed at the time.”55 In 1937, Schacht was forced to resign as minister of economics and general plenipotentiary (and was dismissed as President of the Reichsbank in 1939). In 1938, in the fight for control over the Army, key conservatives, including Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, Minister of War, Commander in Chief Colonel General Werner von Fritsch, seven Army generals, and six Air Force generals, were purged over their opposition to economic policies, religious matters, and the conduct of foreign policy. Conservatives in the Foreign Office were also removed from office. Thus, through purges of moderate forces, hard‐liners captured control over key parts of the government, including the Ministry of Economics in 1937, the Army in 1938, and the Reichsbank in 1939. Again, as Smelser argues, “by 1936, the conservatives had their backs to the wall through personnel attrition, fierce competition from a variety of Nazis, and Hitler's increasing use of foreign policy agencies other than the traditional apparatus.”56 The government also overcame steel opposition by establishing the mostly state‐owned Reichswerke‐Hermann Göering, which was given priority in allocation of raw materials.57"
"36","The second lesson is that competing foreign policies can work at cross purposes and thereby weaken rather than strengthen foreign moderates and internationalists or push them into the hard‐liners' camp. During the 1930s, the Treasury Group included Neville Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Warren Fisher, the Permanent Undersecretary, and Sir Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England. Their intent in extending concessions to Japan was two‐fold: to use trade concessions to bolster the “better elements” in Tokyo and thereby strengthen the reformers,58 and to use improved Anglo‐Japanese relations in order to “free limited British resources to focus on the unstable situation in Europe.”59 The problem was that Britain pursued a contradictory policy that sought to strengthen government moderates but harmed their domestic internationalist supporters.         "
"37","As in Germany, power struggles ensued in Japan between moderates and hard‐liners. Factions of Army hard‐liners clashed over whether the Soviet Union posed an immediate threat and over strategic preparedness; a split in the Navy reflected the “fleet group,” who favored a big navy and opposed disarmament and the “treaty group,” who supported tonnage limitations; and clashes occurred between the military and civilians. By 1937, and perhaps as early as 1935, British leaders perceived a slight shift in the domestic balance of political power, including the replacement of four ultranationalist military members of the Supreme War Council with a single conservative member. Kibata Yoichi notes that “from early 1936 some British diplomats began to hold the view that the power of the Japanese military was being curbed and the military was becoming more moderate.”60"
"38","In 1937, the moderate but short‐lived pro‐British Hayashi cabinet pushed by Foreign Minister Naotake Sato called for a foreign policy of interdependence and international cooperation. While perhaps overstated, his nomination was seen in British foreign policy circles as an example of the “growing preponderance of ‘moderate’ elements in the Japanese ruling elite.”61 Again, according to Yoichi, “when the Hirota cabinet resigned… some British observers stated that moderate elements among the Japanese capitalists had at last begun to rein in the military.”62 Specifically, Sato rejected detaching the northern provinces in China and, alternatively, favored a unified China under the Nationalists.63 More broadly, in a statement to the lower house of the Diet, Sato said that the “crises [with China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States] were of Japan's own making.”64 The Hayashi cabinet fell at the end of May 1937, and the subsequent government reversed Sato's policies and supported military action in Manchuria, rearmament, and an exclusive Japanese co‐prosperity sphere.65"
"39","One aspect of London's trade concessions was a weak attempt to court Japan's export‐oriented industry. In 1930, 1932, and 1934, Lancashire's cotton industries proposed dividing the world cotton textile market with Japan, with the goal of reducing the latter's exports.66 Osaka's cotton industry countered that only crown colonies could be included in the discussions.67 Failing to reach a cotton cartel agreement, Lancashire, in conjunction with the Manchester chamber of commerce, abandoned the policy of free trade. In 1934, Lancashire, the chamber, and the newly formed Cotton Trade League, legislated the colonial quotas, which imposed an import quota system, especially on Japanese textiles and cotton in the home, Indian, and colonial markets (such as Britain's East and West African colonies). Other British tariffs and duties directed at Japan's exports included those on combs, hot‐water bottles, knives, needles, and umbrellas.            "
"40","A second aspect of trade concessions, included in both the Barnby Mission (or the FBI Mission of 1934) and the Leith‐Ross Mission (1935–1936) to Japan, involved discussing trade demarcation and market‐sharing schemes.68 Again, in 1937, the FBI invited the Japan Economic Federation to a conference on comprehensive cartels, including a managed price system. However, no market‐sharing agreements were reached. One additional goal of the Barnby Mission was to establish relations with Japanese industrial and commercial organizations and joint committees of the Japan Economic Federation.            "
"41","Britain's trade discrimination worked at cross‐purposes with the attempt to court Japan's export‐oriented industry. Specifically, it undermined Japan's limited range of export commodities and harmed Japan's internationalists. This contradictory policy elicited worse behavior from Japan. While London's intent was to entice Japan's government officials to adopt a more‐moderate foreign policy, this incoherent policy unified Japan's internationalists and nationalists in favor of an exclusive trading bloc, and thereby promoted belligerence and intransigence. Thus, the import was that London did little to help foster the moderates' domestic win‐set, which was too small to support Japan's struggling leaders in realigning Tokyo's foreign policy."
"42","Some British leaders warned of the danger of this contradictory policy. Frank Ashton‐Gwatkin, Neville Chamberlain, Sir Warren Fisher, and Sir John Simon (the Foreign Secretary), countered that removing these quotas and easing Japanese trade with the empire would boost exporters, including those in Osaka. According to Kibata Yoichi, such steps would have “encourage[d] those Japanese in economic circles who were thought to occupy a crucial position among the ‘moderate’ elements.”69 In 1936, Sir Frederick Leith‐Ross also called for concessions in textiles as a means to reorient Japanese foreign policy.            "
"43","British internationalists and nationalists contributed to this confusion. Although in 1931 Britain abandoned the gold standard and in 1932 adopted imperial preferences, the concept of “gentlemanly capitalism,” including freer trade, competition, and limited state intervention, persisted. For British internationalists, some forms of trade concessions were seen as threatening, since it meant the “establishment of a ‘new economic order’ in which price‐fixing and the control of production and competition would replace the market as the main regulatory mechanism of economic life.”70 Internationalists warned that state intervention in managing the economy was turning Britain into “a different kind of nation.”71 British nationalists, including former free traders, perceived themselves as facing a crisis, too. They opposed trade concessions because they would strengthen Japanese (and German) industry, which competed with industry at home and in the empire.            "
"44","The third lesson for the Obama administration is the danger that domestic obstructionists in the initiating state can block trade concessions. By 1972, Washington had abandoned its containment strategy toward the Soviet Union, though it continued to view Moscow's aggregate economic power and military capability, and especially its looming nuclear strategic parity, as a threat. One stated goal of engaging Moscow was to use economic linkage to manage an ascending Soviet Union.72"
"45","A second goal, reflecting my argument, was to strengthen government moderates and their supporters in the military, industry (consumer production and mineral extraction), and the bureaucracy.73 According to Peter Peterson, Secretary of Commerce, an integral part of détente was to liberalize trade controls in an effort to build in both countries “a vested economic interest in the maintenance of a harmonious and enduring relationship.”74 Diplomatic successes, such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty I, the Anti‐Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Basic Principles Agreement, the Prevention of Nuclear War Agreement, and the U.S.–Soviet Trade Agreement, would strengthen moderates in their leadership struggle. Concomitantly, access to U.S. technology and capital goods, MFN status, credits, loans, and agricultural products would boost Russia's stagnating economy and broaden the moderates' domestic win‐set, both necessary to realign Soviet foreign policy away from extreme autarky, competition, and proxy warfare.         "
"46","As the decade of the 1970s progressed, Soviet–American relations were affected by growing domestic obstructionists in both countries.75 Domestic opponents were boosted by obstacles to expanded trade with the West and deeper arms control, and these setbacks further strengthened the proponents of self‐sufficiency and the expansion of military power.         "
"47","Leonid I. Brezhnev initiated Soviet détente toward Europe and the United States during the period in which he was struggling to gain dominance within the Politburo (1969–1973).76 Soviet domestic politics under Brezhnev was characterized by competition between inward‐oriented conservatives and outward‐oriented modernizers.77 Conservatives emphasized political orthodoxy, defense, and heavy industry over consumer goods, the benefits of military power in the international arena (thereby favoring the expansion of military power rather than arms limitation agreements), and the advantage of a central and command economy. They were distrustful of the West and favored the Stalinist‐era policy of economic autarky and limited economic cooperation with the West. Conservatives feared the economic and social consequences of abandoning the traditional autarkic economic practices and policies; since autarky had long been Soviet policy and practice, its institutional interest would be threatened by any drastic change.            "
"48","Party, economic, and military moderates emphasized the importance of expanding trade and linking domestic development to involvement in the global economy, limiting strategic weapons, and the globalization of scientific technology. Moreover, they highlighted the importance of economic power as a rival to military power alone. Third, they identified “forces” in the West with whom the Soviets could cooperate. Finally, it is possible that government moderates sought better relations in order to gain technical and economic assistance that would enable the Soviet Union to later resume its competition with the United States on better terms."
"49","There were four summit meetings between Moscow and Washington from 1972 to 1974. The 1972 and 1973 summit agreements helped to strengthen Brezhnev and his colleagues.78 In 1973, as Brezhnev further consolidated his power, he publicly repudiated the Soviet economic policy of autarky, and pushed for maximizing trade between the East and West.            "
"50","In 1972, President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his national security adviser, agreed to an unprecedented trade agreement with the Soviet Union. The 1972 Trade Agreement, an essential part of détente, extended to the Soviet Union MFN status and export–import bank credits. The Nixon administration's intent was to provide a major incentive for the Soviets to cooperate in other issue areas, such as arms control and managing regional conflicts."
"51","Nixon and Kissinger (and later President Gerald Ford) were unable to deliver the promised economic détente. First, the President was weakened by Watergate. Second, in 1974, the Jackson‐Vanik (Senate) and Stevenson‐Church (House) amendment to the 1974 Trade Act denied normal trade relations to the Soviet Union. The amendment made MFN status conditional on greater freedom for Soviet Jews to emigrate and put a ceiling of $300 million on total new export‐import bank credits for the Soviet Union."
"52","The import is that the failure of economic détente translated into reservations about political and military détente with the West, putting Brezhnev on the defensive and thereby derailing détente as a grand strategy. Within the Soviet leadership and political establishment, there were concerns about the economic danger from dependence on foreign trade and the ideological danger from increased interaction with the West. For these internal reasons, after 1974, Brezhnev was pushed to adopt a harsher stance as proponents of autarky and strategic parity became more prominent again.79"
"53","A final lesson is that trade concessions and inducements are most likely to succeed if the boost is decisive in reshuffling power and if the moderates have access to the political institutions in the target state. As early as 1969, and by 1972, the Nixon administration had switched from containment to a détente grand strategy toward China. While political concessions had significant influence on China, U.S. policy of trade concessions assisted in strengthening moderate Chinese leaders who were engaged in an internal power struggle within the leadership (Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and other reformers). Concomitantly, concessions increased the size of the domestic win‐set of the moderates, who favored opening China to the international economy, foreign trade, and foreign technology flows.80 Alternatively, Washington rejected calls to renew economic and military containment for fear of undermining Beijing's moderates and internationalists or pushing them into the hard‐line camp. According to Robert Sutter, a number of important questions at this time included, “Should the unstable political situation in Beijing cause the U.S. to slow down or speed up its effort to establish formal diplomatic relations with China? Would it show support for the current moderate leaders? Would it enhance their efforts to consolidate power and offset potential rivals for power?”81"
"54","Chairman Mao Zedong and Prime Minister Zhou Enlai led the rapprochement with the United States. Moderates and radical hard‐liners clashed on a number of key issues, including whether the United States posed a threat (in addition to the Soviet Union), the proper path to economic development and development strategies, and whether China should move beyond the Cultural Revolution and engage the international system or continue its policy of self‐reliance and self‐sufficiency.82 The hard‐liners included Lin Biao (Minister of Defense and Mao's designated successor), Jiang Qing (Mao's wife), Chen Boda, and allies in the Army known as the Gang of Four (Generals Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, and Qiu Huizo), among other military and civilian supporters.83"
"55","In addition to Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, one of the reformers whom Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger identified was Deng Xiaoping. Deng was rehabilitated in the early 1970s after being purged during the Cultural Revolution. Deng was a champion of opening China to the international economy, decentralization, and strategic alignment with the United States.84 As a consequence, Deng was the target of radical opposition because his economic and military policies would undermine the radical politicians and challenge the core assumptions of the Cultural Revolution.            "
"56","For Deng, in addition to some in the military, his domestic win‐set included key sectors such as light industry, textiles, consumers, agriculture, and electronics (as well as the coastal provinces and provincial leaders).85 Export industries (foodstuffs, petroleum, coal, and minerals) were to be boosted in order to pay for increased imports. Money received from the sales would finance the import of equipment, technology, and management expertise, which, in turn, would be used to develop and expand light manufacturing and other export‐producing industries. Other beneficiaries would include economic planners, who were eager for imports of advanced technology and essential equipment. Finally, intellectuals gained from broadened international contacts and a strengthened educational system.86"
"57","Following several probes, in 1969 and 1970, American and Chinese leaders engaged in ambassadorial talks, reopening the long‐frozen Warsaw talks.87 In response to the positive and secret Sino‐American diplomatic talks, Nixon and Kissinger took a series of small steps to boost the power and position of political and economic moderates. The more‐important steps included moves to dismantle some of the American embargo and a unilateral concession on the issue of Taiwan that China sought. Kissinger informed Chinese leaders that the United States would not support independence for Taiwan or the Taiwan independence movement and that it was America's intention to reduce its military forces and facilities on the island as tensions declined.88 Other steps included the public Shanghai Communique (1972) issued at the close of Nixon's trip to China marking the resumption of commercial relations, boosting Beijing's international standing, and supporting the concept of “one China”; the opening of liaison offices in each other's countries to institutionalize the relationship; and promises to normalize relations following the 1972 elections. According to Raymond Garthoff, Nixon and Kissinger's intent was to manipulate the “intra‐Chinese struggle over foreign policy and domestic power.”89"
"58","To boost the size of Zhou and Deng's supporters in the military, Kissinger proposed the establishment of intelligence ties between the United States and China. China was also permitted to buy military technology for the first time from Europe (circumventing the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls or COCOM). Other diplomatic steps to strengthen the moderates' win‐set included a reduction in the number of troops stationed in Taiwan to less than 1,000 and the withdrawal of the last of America's combat aircraft."
"59","Between 1974 and 1977, Sino‐American relations were dominated by other domestic and international issues. In 1977, Deng reemerged again from being purged, gaining responsibility for China's foreign policymaking and to a lesser degree economic policymaking. To help Deng further consolidate his power, the administration of Jimmy Carter pushed for complete normalization of relations. Giving Deng and his supporters an additional boost, during his visit to China, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser, made clear that the United States was willing to compromise on the three key conditions for normalization that Beijing had established in 1975: an end to official relations with Taiwan; abrogation of the mutual defense treaty of 1954; and removal of the remaining American troops.90"
"60","Deng used this new American policy as a weapon in his internal struggle for power and his emergence as China's new pre‐eminent leader in the Politburo. Brzezinski also discussed the sale of military equipment to China (both American and European). As Garthoff notes, “This shift undoubtedly contributed to Deng's ability to persuade his colleagues in the Chinese leadership to turn to the West.”91 Additional non‐military and non‐intelligence technological cooperation was considered, including technology that could not be sold to the Soviet Union.92"
"61","As the case of China demonstrates, a strategy of concessions and inducements is most likely to succeed under several conditions: first, if the boost given by the foreign state reshuffles power within the FPE; second, if the moderate and hard‐line coalitions are nearly balanced; and third, if the political institutions in the target state grant moderates and internationalists access. This outcome is most likely to occur in states with a tentative but emerging moderate bloc of political leaders that are committed to internationalization and who have a strong base of domestic support."
"62","Classical realists such as Thucydides, Niccolo Machiavelli, Hans Morgenthau, and Henry Kissinger emphasize the role of leaders and leadership.93 In A World Restored, Kissinger differentiates between statesmen, conquerors, prophets, and revolutionary leaders, and their effect on international order.94 In this article, I also focus on the composition of the political leadership of a rival state. Though a foreign state's aggregate power might pose a threat, I contend that the presence of reform‐minded or moderate elements who are in positions of leadership or in the wings of power and who are engaged in internal power struggles with hard‐line elements can override this net assessment. Otherwise, the granting state will fear that trade concessions will strengthen the war‐fighting capacity of an adversary.         "
"63","A grand strategy for the Obama administration to engage foreign adversaries must recognize two elements. First, international relations theorists and policymakers often focus on the ability of government A to influence government B's foreign policy. This first face of security is a top‐down approach that entails direct government‐to‐government attempts to create security. This includes strengthening the hand of moderates at the helm of the government who are engaged in power struggles with hard‐liners for leadership. Second, as discussed in this article, the second face of security is a bottom‐up approach and entails indirect attempts to create security by facilitating the formation of a favorable foreign policy coalition in other states or disabling an unfavorable coalition. Specifically, concessions and inducements (both economic and political) or a hard‐line stance can increase the size of the moderates' domestic win‐set or domestic base of support. This is important in order to assist the leadership in implementing their desired domestic and foreign policy agenda.         "
"64","The lessons discussed in this article are important. Although they are drawn from separate though similar grand strategies and different periods in global politics, they highlight why attempts to use trade concessions to moderate the foreign policy of an enemy have either stumbled and failed or have succeeded. Specifically, they highlight the importance for policy‐and decision makers to examine a foreign policy of engagement or punishment from both the first and second faces of security to ensure that they work in conjunction. If the foreign policy is at cross‐purposes across these two faces of security, attempts to elicit better behavior from the other side can backfire and elicit worse behavior. As British concessions to Japan demonstrate, competing aspects of the initiating state's foreign policy toward the target state can weaken rather than strengthen foreign moderates and internationalists. Specifically, for the Obama administration, pressure on China to revalue its currency could undermine the power and position of the internationalist bloc, push them into the nationalists' camp, or mute the internationalists' outreach through self‐censorship and the fear of retribution. Moreover, as in the case of Iran, policy leaders should be aware that threats or policies of punishment might allow hard‐line nationalists to seize on these threats as an opportunity to weaken and stifle the reformers."
"65","Second, as Britain's concessions to Germany demonstrate, there is the danger of believing that moderates in the wings of power and their domestic supporters can restrain the hard‐liners. The Obama administration will find that hard‐liners in Iran, especially the Revolutionary Guard, are significantly stronger than the moderate elements and their supporters."
"66","Third, as American concessions to the Soviet Union highlight, there is the constant danger that domestic obstructionist politics can block trade concessions. President Obama will require the support of Congress to scale back existing economic sanctions and of the Senate to ratify any changes to treaties. Moreover, as Charles Kupchan notes, it is possible that the Jackson–Vanik amendment, which is still on the books, could once again re‐emerge to trip up the President's plans of engaging the enemy.95"
"67","Finally, as American concessions to China demonstrate, a strategy of concessions and inducements is most likely to succeed if the boost reshuffles the balance of domestic political power and if the moderates have access to political institutions in the target state. This is most likely to occur in states with a maturing moderate bloc of political leaders that are committed to internationalization and have a strong domestic base of support. As Paul Papayoanou and Scott Kastner note, “If the leadership [of the foreign state] is highly autonomous and sees internationalization as crucial to fulfill its economic or political goals, or if the most politically prominent societal groups have internationalist economic interests, nondemocratic leaders will be influenced in a strong, positive way.”96"
