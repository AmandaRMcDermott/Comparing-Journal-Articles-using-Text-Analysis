"1","The growing concern surrounding irregular migration into Europe and North America raises questions about the cultural, economic, and political capacity of these regions to absorb ever‐increasing numbers of migrants from the Global South. Moreover, it underscores the fundamental challenges of peacefully integrating migrants. Often forgotten, however, is that the majority of migrants move within the Global South—often inside the borders of their own countries. Therefore, questions around the capacity of host countries to successfully integrate migrants remain, first and foremost, of concern to countries beyond the shores of Europe and North America.         "
"2","Claire L. Adida offers a much‐welcomed and groundbreaking analysis of the migration–conflict nexus in one of the world's most mobile regions. In so doing, Adida casts her analytical lens on West Africa to explore the mechanisms that give rise to exclusionary politics and migrant insecurity in urban contexts. This analysis integrates findings from intensive fieldwork in three of the region's capital cities (Accra, Cotonou, and Niamey). Drawing on extensive interviews, survey data, and statistical analysis, Adida advances a compelling and counterintuitive argument: cultural similarities between hosts and migrants often serve to fuel tensions between these groups rather than create conditions for peaceful integration."
"3","Despite the controversial basis of this claim, Adida forcefully explains how immigrant integration can be undermined by migrant community leaders who instrumentally protect their interests to the detriment of individual migrants who may prefer to adopt a strategy of assimilation. These mechanisms are illustrated using powerful quotes from a range of interviewees as well as insights from a sophisticated survey design that provides a fine‐grained cross‐national picture of the scope of migrant integration."
"4","Adida's conclusions offer a novel and nuanced theoretical framework that challenges the dominant binary of culturalist versus economic arguments for explaining immigrant integration and exclusion. Instead, she shows that in privileging one variable over another, we fail to understand the complex dynamics underlying integration processes."
"5","Thorough as the book is, there are a few elements that could have been further developed. First, the discussion of policy implications is somewhat limited. Instead of providing basic recommendations for improving prospects for migrant integration, the conclusion simply reiterates the core arguments and offers some future directions for research. An expanded policy discussion might have piqued the interest of scholars working on similar research in Western industrialized contexts."
"6","Second, while most of the literature on migrant integration in Africa focuses on the rural, agrarian conflict dynamics around land, Adida shifts the analysis to consider integration and insecurity in urban environments. To be sure, this provides an original and much‐needed analysis of an increasingly urbanized continent. However, it is not clear whether Adida's arguments travel beyond the urban setting to explain similar processes of exclusion and insecurity in rural contexts where host–migrant relations are embedded in the politics around land. A brief consideration of the linkages between these environments could have helped clarify the scope of the argument."
"7","Finally, the micro‐level analysis that underlies the core research question is somewhat disconnected from the macro‐level exploration of migrant expulsions. Do the mechanisms that give rise to exclusionary processes at the micro level also inform decisions to expel large numbers of migrants at the macro (that is, national) level? A brief discussion of the connections between these themes might have helped better structure the flow of the book and bridge two otherwise excellent analyses."
"8","These minor critiques aside, Immigrant Exclusion and Insecurity in Africa raises the bar on scholarship on migrant integration in Africa (and elsewhere). For that reason, it will be of great interest to a wide range of scholars in political science, African studies, and beyond.         "
