"1","Justin Grimmer, Sean J. Westwood, and Solomon Messing have produced a noteworthy essay that grapples with the broad question of democratic accountability. Their testing ground is the U.S. House of Representatives. Through an analysis of member press releases and a series of experiments, the authors make the case that members are adept at taking credit, and obtaining credit, for government spending that occurs in their districts. I suggest that one of the primary contributions of the work is that the authors uncover members of Congress deceiving their constituents, causing them to believe they are doing more to help the district than they actually are. Interestingly, the authors also find that the deception drives members to accomplish the tasks they speciously led constituents to believe they deserve credit for. The deception circuitously leads to more spending for the district."
"2","The book's subtitle suggests that the work seeks to explain “legislator communication,” “representation,” and “democratic accountability.” In effect, these are the dependent variables, or the phenomena of interest, the work attempts to illuminate. I hold that the work is most successful at explaining the first consideration: the way members communicate with their constituents. With the other two concerns, there is less in the way of systematic analysis. For instance, the authors' analyses explain something about the nature of representation, but we are not taught what competent representation would or should look like or whether the credit‐claiming activities of members accomplish this. With a concept like democratic accountability, it seems all the more important to elaborate, up front, a definition of the phenomenon. The authors never tell us what accountability is or what evidence would suggest it is taking place. I was left wondering: are members from safe districts who are more inclined to take positions on issues being more “accountable”? Or are the credit‐claiming members from marginal districts, bent on a delegate style of representation, the ones being responsible?"
"3","To be certain, there is a concerted effort throughout the book to tie the accumulated evidence to notions of representation and accountability—but these efforts seem to be more inductive than deductive. Without explicit definitions of the dependent variables, the analysis of “representation” and “accountability” seems stochastic. It may be a personal bias, but I wish the authors would have led their work with normative arguments about what competent representation and democratic accountability look like. In effect, provide the reader one, or perhaps many, operationalizations of these important concepts. The task, then, would be to find evidence in the press releases and experiments to determine whether quality representation and accountability are taking place. As it stands, the text provides us with a very good understanding of the nature of political communication and a fuller appreciation of how a legislator's communication style has implications for quality governance, but without an explicit discussion of what the implications are."
"4","There is much to like about The Impression of Influence, not the least of which are the many anecdotes about how members systematically communicate with their constituents based on their electoral vulnerabilities. Moreover, after reading the book, I have a much fuller appreciation that member–constituent communication can lead to greater public awareness and political sophistication—a point that I have, to date, failed to emphasize when teaching courses on Congress. Moreover, when attending rallies and/or fund‐raising events sponsored by members of Congress, I have always noted credit‐claiming behavior and never thought to pay attention to why some members did more of this than others. The Impression of Influence addresses this issue head on and convincingly notes that the answer is district partisan homogeneity conditioned by deficits, party, and electoral scheming.         "
