"1","Ralph Young tells the story of America through the voice of its dissenters. Young argues that dissent is a salient feature of the American mind‐set. From early seventeenth‐century Puritanism to the Occupy movement and the Tea Party, those who question the establishment and oppose its zeitgeist have always had their share in the making of American history."
"2","One of the great merits of Young's book is his nuanced perspective on events and people that are often reduced to clichés in our collective memory. We tend to think of dissenters as villains or heroes, but the color palette of reality is richer, and history is too complex to allow ourselves to stuff our minds with stereotypes about the past. In telling the story of Puritan dissenters, for example, Young tackles the stereotype of Puritans as “upright spoilsports” (p. 18)."
"3","Young's expertise—for more than a decade, he taught a course on the topic at Temple University, and he previously authored a compilation of primary documents covering 400 years of American dissent—shows on each page. Each of the 23 chapters of his book is informative and a pleasure to read, although conceptually, some things remain vague. What exactly is dissent? And why is it an American idea?         "
"4","Dissent is, basically, “going against the grain” (p. 3), and the first step of dissent is disagreement. The next step is voicing that disagreement. That makes dissenters of most of us. Dissent must be more than disagreement and expressing one's dissatisfaction with a certain state of affairs, but what the essential trademark of dissent is remains unclear."
"5","In conceptualizing different forms of dissent, too, certain clarifications are lacking. Young defines religious dissent as “the insistence that everyone be allowed to worship according to the dictates of conscience” (p. 3). Religious dissent is thus the advocacy of religious tolerance. That is problematic for two reasons. First, Young acknowledges that dissent comes from all sides of the political and ideological spectrum, so why could certain forms of religious fundamentalism and the defense of the idea that specific religious practices should be enforced and others prohibited not be forms of religious dissent? Being opposed to religious freedom can be a form of dissent, especially when religious freedom is a sacrosanct principle in society. Second, Young states that Puritans were religious dissenters, even though they did not come “for the noble case of ‘religious freedom’” (p. 19). This contradicts the claim that religious dissent is precisely the advocacy of religious freedom."
"6","Young acknowledges that dissent is not a uniquely American ideal but that it is an essential part of what it means to be American nonetheless. It could reasonably be argued that dissent plays a central role in American history, owing to the fact that free speech and religious freedom are deeply anchored as natural rights in the lives and minds of Americans. Where freedom of speech and thought reign, people can voice their views more easily and dissenting voices can be heard more loudly."
"7","However, it could also be argued that dissent is essential to societies where freedom of speech and thought are lacking. The story of countries with a long history of oppression and occupation—Poland, for example—is also very much the story of dissenting voices. In Russian history, too, dissenting voices play a crucial role, and many book volumes would be needed to tell the story of these voices. But is it historically and conceptually justified to describe dissent as the characteristic of one specific nation?"
"8","Dissent seems an intrinsic feature of the zoon politikon, owing to the fact that human beings need to live together and that some form of governance is required to make that possible. Wherever there is governance, there is dissatisfaction with governance. Wherever people live together, there is dissatisfaction with the way that happens. This makes dissent a universal rather than an American phenomenon.         "
