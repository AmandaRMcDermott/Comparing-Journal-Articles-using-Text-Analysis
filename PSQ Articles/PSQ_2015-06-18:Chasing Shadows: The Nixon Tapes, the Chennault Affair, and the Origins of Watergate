"1","With hundreds of books on Watergate, it might seem as though there is nothing left to learn about the scandal. Ken Hughes's new book proves otherwise. Hughes, who has been painstakingly transcribing the Nixon tapes for many years as a researcher at the Miller Center's Presidential Recordings Program, makes extensive use of the tapes to argue that the origins of Watergate can be found in Richard Nixon's illegal efforts to sabotage the Vietnam peace talks during his run for the presidency in 1968."
"2","Faced with the prospect that President Lyndon B. Johnson might get all the parties in Vietnam to agree to peace negotiations days before the election, and thus give a boost to Democratic challenger Hubert Humphrey, Nixon, working through agent provocateur Anna Chennault, convinced the South Vietnamese to back out of the talks by promising them a better deal as president. After winning the election, Nixon, who (wrongly) had come to believe that Johnson had evidence directly implicating him in the affair, created an illegal investigative unit within the White House, the Plumbers, and ordered it to burglarize the Brookings Institution, where he (again mistakenly) believed the evidence to be. While the Plumbers never burglarized Brookings, they were subsequently caught burglarizing the Democratic offices at the Watergate complex, the crime that led to Nixon's downfall."
"3","While the Chennault Affair and the conspiracy to burglarize Brookings are both well known to Watergate chroniclers, Hughes is the first scholar to connect the two incidents and claim that the former provides the rationale for the latter. The tapes clearly show Nixon repeatedly ordered the Brookings burglary. In one conversation, Nixon tells his chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, “Break into their files and get that stuff out. Let them scream” (p. 121). Why would he personally authorize such a risky and illegal operation? If Nixon believed the Brookings safe contained intelligence reports documenting his efforts to sabotage the peace negotiations—and Hughes makes a convincing case that he did—then his decision to order the burglary makes sense. If Nixon's role had been exposed, not only would it have destroyed his ability to negotiate an end to the Vietnam War, but also he would have been subject to criminal sanctions and even possible impeachment."
"4","By focusing on the role that the Chennault Affair played in Watergate, Hughes dispels the myth that Nixon's role in the cover‐up of the Watergate burglary was his undoing. Chasing Shadows reveals the true depth of Nixon's criminal behavior—it began even before he became president. The book also reveals other important truths about Nixon and Watergate. The many excerpts that Hughes provides of new Nixon tapes confirm much of what we already know about Nixon—his paranoia, his anti‐Semitism, and his misanthropy are on full display. But the tape excerpts also demonstrate something else, and here the title of the book is apropos. They expose the sheer incompetence of Nixon and his aides. Time and time again, their failure to evaluate information carefully and rationally led to snap judgments and half‐baked schemes that left them constantly “chasing shadows.” In the end, the picture that Hughes paints of the Nixon White House reminds me of a memorable line that Hal Holbrook's “Deep Throat” delivers in the film All the President's Men: “The truth is these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.”         "
