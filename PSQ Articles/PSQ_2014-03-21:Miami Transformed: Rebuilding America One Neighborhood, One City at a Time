"1","“Mayors throughout America are the government of first resort,” argues former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, but “they have also become the government of last resort” (p. 201). Miami Transformed recounts how Diaz confronted challenges in one of America's most‐diverse cities at a moment of major transformation (2001–2009). His tone is conversational and the analysis often simplistic. But faced with global challenges and federal dysfunction, his unalloyed confidence in cities and mayoral capacity is worth considering.         "
"2","Miami Transformed is at once autobiography, political memoir, and manifesto. Written for a general audience, it feels like campaign material (Diaz has explored running for statewide office). It traces a classic immigrant tale of his family's exile from Cuba in 1961 and growing up in Miami's Little Havana. But while his parents and their generation “were focused on change in Cuba,” for Diaz “many in my generation focused on change in Miami” (p. 31). Diaz's early activities centered on key issues of the time: diversity and legislative redistricting, the growing role of exit polling (which he introduced to the future Univision), and fund‐raising and the “ground game.” His primary career is as a lawyer, and one chapter describes his role representing the U.S. relatives of Elián González. With such experience and exposure, he successfully ran for Mayor of Miami in 2000.         "
"3","While he laments that “all aspiring politicians should be careful what they wish for” and the bureaucratic mantra “No, it can't be done” (p. 86), Diaz is cheerily confident describing his strategic agenda to improve economic opportunity, education, public safety, public and private investment, sustainability, and cultural life in Miami. In short chapters he recounts the decline or stagnation he confronted, the collaborations and coalitions he built, and policy successes. Diaz served as President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, so his strategies share the thinking and tools of contemporaries (though without reflecting on their limitations): enhancing access to existing social services, but shifting their provision from downtown; exerting municipal control over schools and testing; policing “quality of life” offenses; public‐private investment in infrastructure and downtown revitalization; sustainability and New Urbanism; and promoting the arts as development strategy. Concluding with a reflection on the failures of the federal government (and particularly Congress), Diaz calls on leaders to “invest in the promise (the U.S.) has always offered” (p. 205)."
"4","We live in a moment of urban optimism, and Diaz's tale of transformation—his own from Cuban exile to Mayor, and Miami's from “murder capital” to world city—is timely. Urban resurgence in Miami and elsewhere is indeed remarkable and a credit to charismatic leadership. But it is hard to separate leadership from larger trends. And not all trends are quite so positive or contradiction‐free. The book's writing and analysis will lack sophistication for many scholars, urban policymakers, and informed readers, straining its credibility as political/policy primer. But perhaps that is not the point. Subtitled “Rebuilding America One Neighborhood, One City at a Time,” the book sports endorsements from Michael Bloomberg, Richard Daley, and Richard Florida. It is a political manifesto by and for a new class of urban leaders, whose sights are set beyond city limits. It reveals the ambitions of America's mayors, particularly in the vacuum left by dysfunction in U.S. capitals. Whatever its limitations, this book provides a window into the future of both cities and American politics. A nation led by mayors? Perhaps we could do worse."
