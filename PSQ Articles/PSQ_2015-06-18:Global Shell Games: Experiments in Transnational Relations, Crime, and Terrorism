"1","Scholars and policymakers often describe the illicit global economy and efforts to control it as the search for needles in haystacks or drops in an ocean, with successes bedeviled by balloon and Whac‐A‐Mole effects. The authors of Global Shell Games introduce and unpack a new metaphor and, through an innovative global field experiment, demonstrate the importance of nonstate actors in implementing—and, more importantly, failing to implement—the compliance obligations agreed to by states.         "
"2","The book focuses on the “corporate service providers” that “establish, sell and maintain” shell companies (p. 38). Regulatory efforts at transparency lie at the heart of international efforts against money laundering, terrorist financing, and corruption. However, focusing on the state as the “locus of compliance” with “international financial transparency standards” misses the central role of service providers (pp. 2–3). The authors reach out to service providers to assess the “availability of anonymous shell corporations globally” and, in turn, the extent to which state parties to international control efforts have been able to effectively “encourage compliance” with international standards (pp. xiii, 7). Despite such standards, the book reveals that there is no shortage of service providers who are willing and eager to assist in the creation of nontransparent shell companies."
"3","The authors' findings are based on 7,456 e‐mail requests for assistance made to “3,771 firms in 181 countries” (p. 7). The book's exercise in “experimental transnational relations” mixes “placebo” inquiries with randomized “treatments,” including altering the identity of the requestor, adding “markers” that suggest ties with terrorism or corruption, treatments that point to international laws and normative standards, potential penalties, and offers of “premiums” for evasion (pp. 88–89, 97, 109). These treatments are derived from prominent international relations (IR) theories, real‐world examples, and the “simple intuitions” of the project team (p. 145). The experiment enables the authors to test contending IR theories as to “when and why actors comply with international rules” and bridge the divide between IR scholars, policymakers, and practitioners (p. 5)."
"4","Yet aspects of the experiment and interpretations of the corporate service provider responses and nonresponses merit further discussion. For example, the authors struggle with the overall low response rate to their e‐mail inquiries, shifting back and forth across and within the substantive chapters between rejecting and partially accepting nonresponse as a form of “soft compliance” (p. 61). As patterns of nonresponse change with the use of treatments, again the authors are inconsistent in interpreting the results. The ways in which service providers might be interpreting the wording of the treatments also merits further discussion. For example, among the project's critical findings is the limited impact of reference to Financial Action Task Force standards compared to e‐mails that note those of the Association of Certified Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS), leading the authors to point to the relative power of private standards on compliance. But with the project's follow‐up surveys revealing little familiarity with either organization, the results may simply be an artifact of the inclusion of the words “money laundering” in the ACAMS e‐mail and the failure to use the full name of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering."
"5","These points aside, Global Shell Games is an impressive undertaking that provides new insights into international financial transparency and the challenges of compliance. The authors call renewed attention to the importance of nonstate actors and demonstrate the potential for randomized field experiments in revealing the insights and limitations of prominent IR theories.
