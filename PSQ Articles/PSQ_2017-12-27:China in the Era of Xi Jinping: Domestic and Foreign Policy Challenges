"1","As Xi Jinping completes his first five‐year term as China's top political leader, now seems an appropriate juncture to attempt an interim assessment of his tenure as chairman of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's Liberation Army, and president of the People's Republic of China (PRC). China in the Era of Xi Jinping provides a timely assessment of China's most controversial paramount leader of the twenty‐first century.         "
"2","How strong and how effective a leader is Xi? Unlike his two immediate predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, each of whom appeared largely content with continuity and incremental change in the party‐army‐state, Xi appears intent on vigorously shaking up what contributors Zheng Yongnian and Weng Cuifen label the “three‐in‐one system” (pp. 38–39). Xi has launched a dizzying array of policy initiatives, including reorganizations of bureaucratic structures, which, if fully implemented, could significantly alter the way China formulates and implements foreign and domestic policies. Xi has made consolidating his personal power a top priority, just as Jiang and Hu did. But, unlike those predecessors, Xi has emphasized the concentration of political authority in his person over the “collective leadership” model that has characterized Chinese elite politics since the 1980s. Thus, it is unclear whether China has truly entered the “post‐strongman era,” as Zheng and Weng assert (p. 37)."
"3","While some, including some contributors to this volume, have labeled Xi as a reformer, his efforts to date seem best described as restructuring. Rather than thoroughly reforming or merely refining China's political, military, or economic systems, Xi has actively engaged in revamping those institutions in ways that he believes will both strengthen his own power and bolster the robustness and resiliency of the party‐army‐state regime. Consequently, although Xi “accepts the necessity of economic reforms,” according to Barry Naughton, “he is much more personally engaged with . . . making China a great power and himself a great leader” (pp. 86–87). Of particular note—and discussed by multiple contributors—is Xi's decision in 2013 to establish a National Security Commission. Reportedly modeled after the National Security Council in the United States, the entity is intended to improve coordination between different bureaucratic actors and to concentrate power in Xi's hands. One key difference from the U.S. case is the distinctly domestic security orientation of the Chinese body, underscoring what Jo Inge Bekkevold and Robert Ross discern as an “increasingly inward‐looking trend” among PRC leaders who perceive “the outside world as threatening” (p. 270).         "
"4","To this end, Xi and his close‐knit circle of trusted advisers and subordinates appear to be playing proactive “defense” at home and vigorous “offense” abroad. Domestically, they are “cleaning house”—to include targeting official corruption and, in the process, breaking up rival factions. Around China's immediate periphery, they are actively engaged in strengthening China's territorial claims, especially in the maritime realm, and particularly in the South China Sea. This includes efforts, noted by Linda Jakobson, to improve bureaucratic coordination by consolidating maritime law enforcement agencies. Further afield, PRC leaders are launching new initiatives or doubling down on existing efforts: one of the most high profile is the Belt and Road initiative, which is mentioned only in passing in this volume. Although it is officially a new program, it is best viewed as a rebranding of ongoing efforts to expand existing overseas infrastructure projects and construct new ones."
"5","Whether Xi is the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping, it seems beyond dispute that he is China's most ambitious paramount leader in two decades. This edited volume serves as an excellent introduction to the first five years of Xi's leadership tenure and a useful primer for the next five years."
