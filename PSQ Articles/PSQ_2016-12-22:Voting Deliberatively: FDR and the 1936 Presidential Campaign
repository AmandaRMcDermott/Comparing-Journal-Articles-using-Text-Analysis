"1","Students of public opinion are familiar with the story of the 1936 election. It was the moment when the opinion poll, using sampling designs based in scientific principles, forever supplanted other methods of gauging public sentiment. The truth and mythology emerging from 1936, however, including the rise of George Gallup, Elmo Roper, and others, have often eclipsed the significance of the election itself."
"2","In Voting Deliberatively, Mary E. Stuckey brings important perspective to the first reelection campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt and persuasively argues for 1936 as the point at which the nation transitioned from the electoral politics born of Martin Van Buren's genius to the modern campaigns of today. With the benefit of hindsight, Stuckey makes a credible case for 1936 as the beginning of the move from personal, local, party‐based politics to aggregate, national, candidate‐centric politics. Stuckey illustrates this transition through discussion of four characteristics of Roosevelt's campaign and, in several instances, the personalities central to the transition. These characteristics are the emergence of scientific polling to gauge public opinion, the growth of candidate‐centered politics, reliance on group‐based coalitions outside of partisan organizations, and cementing the president as the lens through which citizens view government.         "
"3","The causal story that emerges is one common to studies of the modern presidency; the transition occurred largely because of Roosevelt and his need to hold together a wide variety of actual and potential supporters. The innovations that Stuckey describes generally began independent of Roosevelt, in scientific polling, for example. It was Roosevelt and his advisers, however, who harnessed these innovations and combined them into a campaign that would secure for its candidate 46 states and more than 60 percent of the popular vote. Explaining why the transition occurred in 1936, however, is less central to the narrative than illustrating how Roosevelt's campaign embodied the old and new politics and how innovations of the campaign combine to support the centrality of the candidate in presidential elections and the development of an impersonal mass public."
"4","Candidate‐centered politics was not new to the presidency in 1936; nor were group‐based political appeals. Roosevelt, however, advanced both far beyond any previous campaign. Facing challenges from the right and the left during his first term, Roosevelt's campaign needed to be less reliant on existing political institutions and exerted much effort in developing extrapartisan organizations, such as the Good Neighbor League, with the purpose of “reconciling various interests that otherwise might have been understood as endangering national unity” (p. 63). The campaign's emphasis on appeals to groups was no less extensive. Stuckey gives particular attention to women, African Americans, and organized labor. These developments dovetailed with the increasing use of quantitative measures of public opinion, which aggregated disparate attitudes into a few, mutually exclusive categories. All three activities combined to strengthen Roosevelt's promotion of a single public with the president as its champion."
"5","Beyond the interesting story of the campaign itself, this is an important book for understanding the evolution of modern presidential politics. One cannot help, for example, thinking of the super PACs that are so prevalent in current presidential politics as Stuckey describes the loyalty of extrapartisan organizations to Roosevelt. Stuckey concludes with a caution against tying Roosevelt's campaign to those of today, noting that comparisons between 1936 and now are limited because of the very different contexts facing presidential candidates. Roosevelt's first reelection stood at the nexus of two worlds, whereas today's campaigns firmly exist in one. Despite this caution, the lessons one can draw from 1936 are relevant to today's campaigns because the world in which they exist is a world of Roosevelt's creation."
