"1","When Solicitor General Donald Verrilli rose in the spring of 2012 to defend Barack Obama's health care law, he spluttered, hemmed, and hawed his way to becoming a rather ignominious YouTube sensation. That experience contrasted markedly with the image of the Solicitor General (SG) as an effective lawyer for the federal government, whose arguments carry great weight with the justices on the bench."
"2","As it turned out, Verrilli won on most big issues when the Supreme Court upheld the major provisions of Obama's health care law. Perhaps the SG has influence, even on an off day. Important questions lurk in this episode. Do solicitors general really influence the Court? If so, why? How can we reconcile such a belief with the widespread view that justices are independent and primarily political actors? Ryan Black and Ryan Owens devote their book, The Solicitor General and the United States Supreme Court: Executive Branch Influence and Judicial Decisions, to employing the tools of modern political science to assess the existence and extent of independent SG influence on the Court. Their book will become essential reading for those interested in the Solicitor General.         "
"3","Black and Owens find, even after going to considerable lengths to rule out alternative explanations, that the SG does indeed influence the Court. They provide evidence that the SG influences what cases the Court hears, who wins them, and how the justices explain their decisions. One of the central challenges facing scholars of the Solicitor General is that the SG's excellent winning record before the Court is not sufficient to establish influence. Black and Owens can be quite clever in their efforts to get at the true influence of the SG. When assessing how much the SG influences cert decisions, Black and Owens focus on cases in which the SG is essentially forced to file a brief by the Supreme Court; this rules out the possibility that the SG strategically cherry‐picks cases to present to the Court."
"4","When assessing whether the SG influences the outcome of cases, Black and Owens use the statistical technique known as “matching” to compare cases in which the SG argued to similar cases in which the SG did not argue. Their goal is to identify what would have happened, had the SG not argued. Matching has become popular recently but is no panacea. Just like OLS or probit analysis, the approach will produce estimates if there is an unmeasured variable that affects the case and is correlated with SG behavior. It could be, for example, that the SG takes the legally correct position and justices, if they care about the law, will also take the legally correct decision. This could look like influence, but may actually be something else."
"5","Later chapters undertake the useful exercise of investigating the influence of the SG on Supreme Court decisions, specifically assessing whether language from SG briefs is more likely to appear in Court opinions. One unfortunate pattern is that only one empirical specification is reported for each chapter. Anyone who works with data knows that any given specification requires numerous coding decisions and that some of these decisions are judgment calls. Results can change substantially when different decisions are made in other cases. We as readers need to have more of a sense of how robust the findings are. This is especially true when the results hinge on interactions of two or more variables, as often occurs in this book."
