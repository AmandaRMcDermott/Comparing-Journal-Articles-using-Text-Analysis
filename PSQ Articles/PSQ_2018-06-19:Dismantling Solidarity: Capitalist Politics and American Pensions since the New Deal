"1","The security of old‐age and retirement income has come nearly full circle since the days before the passage of the Social Security Act, closely mirroring the arc of the labor movement in the United States. As Michael A. McCarthy shows, however, the simple push and pull of class interests is not enough to explain the timing of policy changes to or the overall evolution of the U.S. pension system. McCarthy provides an in‐depth historical analysis of the private pension system since World War II, demonstrating that pension policy was necessitated by periodic crises of capitalism throughout the twentieth century but that the specific shape that pensions eventually took was a result of the balance of partisan, electoral, and class interests."
"2","McCarthy focuses his analysis on three key moments in the development of private pension provision: their initial appearance and the decision to subject them to collective bargaining, the large‐scale financialization of pension assets, and the move away from defined benefit and toward defined contribution plans. McCarthy finds that each instance of change has been accompanied by an existential threat to American capitalism, provoked by the breakdown of relations between labor and business. In the first case, the end of World War II slowed economic growth, glutted the labor supply, and brought unemployment and idleness to a well‐organized and militant labor force. The investment of retirement funds in corporate and typically antilabor financial assets was similarly predicated on the fear of growth‐inhibiting labor hostilities during the postwar period, an unexpected consequence of the Taft‐Hartley Act. The shift to defined contribution plans, on the other hand, was an indirect result of the response to the stagflation crisis of the 1970s and the increase in economic competition from abroad in the wake of a globalizing economy."
"3","As McCarthy rightly points out, the connection between developments of the welfare state and state management of economic crises has been drawn before. McCarthy's contribution, apart from skillfully tracing the history of the private pension system—an important facet of the welfare state not often acknowledged because of its provision by industry rather than by government—is his explanation for and analysis of the contingency of retirement income. While state intervention in labor hostilities was the catalyst for change to the pension system, McCarthy documents how the strength of the labor movement vis‐à‐vis business shaped the specific form of such state‐led crisis management that, in turn, molded the pension system as we know it. It was only in the first instance, when labor won the right to negotiate pension benefits, that the state intervened on behalf of labor rather than industry. This, McCarthy claims, was due to the distinct and marked strength of the labor movement during this period and Harry S. Truman's need for working‐class electoral support. McCarthy explicitly assumes that if the balance of power had been different, the state could have ruled in favor of industry rather than labor while still saving capitalism from itself. As with all work of historical analysis, the counterfactual is unobservable. But McCarthy makes a strong case for his claim by contrasting this first period of policy change with the latter two periods that were instead characterized by a weakened labor movement and a parallel retrenchment of the pension system."
"4","Dismantling Solidarity is an excellent account of the history of private pensions, but it is also a window into the future. The next destabilizing economic moment may be just around the corner—will the government's management of it result in new gains or additional losses for labor? The labor movement in this country is at a true nadir; if McCarthy is to be believed, the next crisis of capitalism will only decimate it—and the fortunes of its members—further.         "
