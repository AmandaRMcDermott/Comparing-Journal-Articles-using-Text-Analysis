"1","PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH'S UNSUCCESSFUL 1992 reelection campaign prompted extensive scrutiny of his single‐term presidency for shortcomings that may have contributed to the loss. From the failure to keep his “no new taxes” pledge to perceived insufficient attention to domestic, particularly economic, concerns, the Bush presidency seemed likely to be viewed historically as one of modest success—in essence, a footnote to the legacy of Bush's transformational predecessor, Ronald Reagan."
"2","More than two decades later, after the far more controversial presidency of George W. Bush (the 43rd U.S. presidency) and the failed presidential campaign of Jeb Bush, the first Bush presidency (the 41st U.S. presidency) is regarded more favorably by scholars and the American public. A 2014 Gallup poll found that 63 percent of Americans viewed Bush 41 favorably, second only to Bill Clinton, at 64 percent, among living presidents.1 A survey from the same year of political scientists studying the American presidency identified Bush 41 as one of the most underrated presidents, along with Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower.2 Jon Meacham's new biography of the 41st presidency, Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush 3, bolsters this reevaluation, with a comprehensive study of George H.W. Bush's extensive political career, which included service in Congress, the United Nations, the Republican National Committee, the Foreign Service as envoy to China, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the White House for eight years as vice president before the presidency. In each of those positions, Bush's quiet leadership and diplomacy set the foundation for major policies enacted by more visible presidents.         "
"3","As suggested by the book's title, Bush's career of leadership and public service in many respects fulfilled deeply held family expectations. The second of five children, Bush came from the economic elite, with both maternal and paternal family financial prosperity dating back to his grandparents. With their financial success came a belief in contributing to the community. As Meacham describes the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century, when Bush's paternal grandfather built his fortune through railroads, “the pursuit of wealth was thus imbued with a sense of purpose” (p. 8). Growing up in New England, Bush followed the traditional path of his family's social circle, excelling in both academics and athletics and attending boarding school as a teenager. His college plans changed, however, following the bombing of Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Just as his father had served as a field artillery officer in World War I, Bush decided to join the American fight in World War II, entering the U.S. Navy to become a pilot. He suffered injury when his plane was hit in the Pacific but soon returned to duty, earning numerous awards for his military service.4"
"4","Having met and married his wife, Barbara, during World War II, Bush matriculated at Yale University in the fall of 1945, 21 years old and determined to do well—and to do so quickly. His view was typical of his cohort; as Meacham writes, “Accustomed to a world in which any moment could be your last, Bush's generation played hard, worked hard—and looked resolutely ahead” (p. 72). Bush was further motivated by what Meacham describes as “the Bush code demand[ing] both success and service” (p. 73). Bush graduated in 1948 with a Phi Beta Kappa key, a degree in economics, a successful college baseball career, and a toddler son who would one day follow him to the White House. Determined to make his own way in life—as Meacham says, “it was customary for Bushes to pay their own way once out of school” (p. 76)—Bush and his family moved to Texas so that he could pursue a business career in the oil fields there."
"5","Over the next two decades, Bush built his own financial fortune, raised a family of five (he and Barbara suffered a devastating loss with the death of their three‐year‐old daughter Robin from leukemia), and entered national politics. His professional career continued to reflect family expectations, as his father, Prescott Bush, served as U.S. senator from Connecticut for a decade. After running unsuccessfully for the Senate from Texas in 1964, Bush won election to the U.S. House of Representatives two years later and served there for two terms. He was a candidate for the vice presidential spot on Richard M. Nixon's Republican presidential ticket in 1968, but Nixon ultimately selected Spiro Agnew. After a second unsuccessful attempt to win election to the Senate in 1970, Bush remained active in national politics through appointments, first as U.S. permanent representative (popularly known as ambassador) to the United Nations and then as chairman of the Republican National Committee. Both positions required skillful diplomacy, and over the next four years, Bush steadily increased his professional network nationally and internationally."
"6","With Nixon's resignation in 1974 and Gerald R. Ford's ascension to the presidency came an opening for the vice presidency (subject to confirmation by both chambers of Congress, per the Twenty‐Fifth Amendment). Bush conveyed his interest to Ford, but the new president selected Nelson Rockefeller. Ford instead invited Bush to be envoy to China, and Bush held the position for just over a year, further expanding his international connections. As Meacham writes, “China was an honors class in diplomacy and politics for Bush” (p. 180). In 1975, as part of a restructuring of his national security team, Ford asked Bush to return to Washington to become director of the CIA. In the face of congressional concerns about the nominee possibly leaving the agency, which was facing significant legislative and public scrutiny at the time for Cold War covert operations, to become Ford's vice presidential nominee in 1976, Ford promised he would not put Bush on the ticket. Bush won confirmation as CIA director and served for a year, but after Jimmy Carter's election, he stepped down and returned to Houston."
"7","Bush stayed in the private sector for the next three years, taking an executive banking position, traveling around the globe to meet with business and political leaders, and delivering speeches. His interest in seeking the presidency in 1980 was clear, and in May 1979, he declared his candidacy. In his announcement speech, he identified himself as a “lifelong Republican” (p. 216), making an implicit contrast with his likely opponent Ronald Reagan, a former New Deal Democrat who had voted four times for Franklin D. Roosevelt for president. But Bush's moderate policy views and diplomatic expertise did not have the broad appeal of Reagan's hardline defense stance, particularly with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran."
"8","Although Bush won the Iowa caucus and other nominating contests, Reagan had more delegates, and Bush withdrew from the race before the party convention. Given their conflicts on the campaign trail (particularly Bush's description of Reagan's economic plan as “voodoo economics,” p. 242), Reagan initially did not want to offer the vice presidential spot to Bush. But in a dramatic turn of events at the convention, which Meacham skillfully recounts, Reagan decided to invite Bush to join the ticket, and Bush accepted. Again demonstrating the qualities of duty and loyalty that had been instilled in him from childhood, Bush campaigned tirelessly in support of Reagan's platform despite earlier disagreements."
"9","After the election victory, Bush skillfully assumed the responsibilities of vice president as set by the Reagan White House. He represented the United States at international meetings, ceremonies, and funerals for heads of state, further developing his political and diplomatic networks. Bush firmly believed that the vice president should follow the president's initiative and avoid any public disagreements. Meacham aptly describes Bush's view of his role in the Reagan White House as one in which “the number two man should be seen but not heard, save for private moments with the president” (p. 264). This perspective complemented well Reagan's view of what his vice president should do: “The two men developed a working relationship that, while not even remotely one between equals, was one in which the principal came to trust the subordinate and the subordinate came to respect the principal” (pp. 263–264)."
"10","After eight years of loyal service, Bush waged his own victorious presidential campaign, winning 40 states and just over 53 percent of the popular vote. While the Bush campaign had stressed continuity with Reagan's programs and policies, the change in leadership was clear. As Meacham writes, “George H.W. Bush was no Ronald Reagan. He was a different kind of man, a different kind of leader—quiet, not dramatic, steady, not spectacular” (p. 348). The description of the president fit his administration as well."
"11","The four years of the George H.W. Bush presidency were notable for diplomatic and military success in foreign policy, achievements in domestic policy, and the breaking of a campaign pledge not to raise taxes that would overshadow Bush's unsuccessful reelection campaign.5 The ending of the Cold War began in the 1980s with policies of political and economic reform initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and four historic U.S.–Soviet summit meetings in Reagan's second term; but the post–World War II conflict came to closure during the Bush 41 presidency. While some criticized Bush for not recognizing the seismic changes around the world, particularly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, with more eloquence, Meacham writes that Bush's personality favored calmness and pragmatism even in the face of historic events:            "
"12","He kept his options open and resisted alienating rhetoric or sweeping declarations. He led by checking here and balancing there, understanding that a world in convulsion was inherently unstable, and everything in him was about bringing stability, or a semblance of stability, to the unruliness of reality. (p. 382)"
"13","Bush achieved post–Cold War international cooperation in response to Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. After the United States and the Soviet Union jointly condemned the invasion, Bush announced that “a new world order” was in place.6 Building upon his multiple decades of international leadership and diplomacy, Bush built a global coalition to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait, securing a United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing military action and then congressional support just days before the Persian Gulf War began. After a quick, decisive military victory, Bush's popularity soared, with a Gallup public approval rating of 89 percent, the highest ever recorded to that point (and surpassed only by President George W. Bush after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks).7"
"14","In the fall of 1990, though, while focusing on international diplomacy, Bush also had agreed, reluctantly, to raise income taxes as part of a deficit‐reduction budget agreement with Congress. This decision, combined with an economic recession in the spring of 1991, weakened public support for Bush by 1992. In a three‐person presidential race (with the independent candidacy of businessman Ross Perot), Bush won 37 percent of the popular vote and lost by more than 200 electoral college votes to Democrat Bill Clinton. Characteristically, Bush felt personal responsibility for the loss, telling Meacham, “My problem was the feeling of letting people down, letting the people around you down. . . . I felt very strongly about that. I still do” (p. 522)."
"15","With an extensive postpresidential career that now spans more than two decades, Bush has enjoyed more popular acclaim since leaving the White House than he did in 1992. After his presidency, Bush focused on corporate and charity work as well as family time in Texas and Maine. While he did not remain active politically, the gubernatorial successes of two sons, followed by George W. Bush's White House victory in 2000, brought great joy. The Bush 43 administration took great care to highlight differences from the Bush 41 presidency—as Meacham writes, for example, “The father had sometimes seemed without convictions; the son would be a man with a clear creed” (p. 565)."
"16","The elder Bush did give advice privately to his son when asked, but, as he had done throughout his political career, he avoided direct public disagreement. His former national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, published an essay in the Wall Street Journal in the summer of 2002 urging President Bush not to wage war against Iraq, which was widely viewed as a critique from the former president. But Bush 41 told Meacham, “That's too conspiratorial. . . . We don't work that way” (p. 570).         "
"17","Bush 41 undertook international missions at his son's request, such as working with former President Bill Clinton to assist with relief and recovery after the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, but otherwise he maintained low public visibility. The publication of Meacham's book renewed scholarly and popular debate about disagreements between the two Bush presidents, as it says that Bush 41 thought that Vice President Dick Cheney “should have held himself in greater check” (p. 589) during his son's presidency, with particular reference to national security policy. Bush 43, though, told Meacham that he disagreed with that view and that Cheney did not overstep his role: “I made the decisions. This was my philosophy” (p. 590). The philosophical differences between the two presidents and the consequences for policymaking undoubtedly will continue to be debated."
"18","Meacham's thoroughly researched and elegantly written volume presents the most definitive assessment of the 41st president to date. The book is especially informative because it draws on the diaries of President and Mrs. Bush as well as extensive interviews with both of them and with the 43rd president. In addition, the book mines the scholarly literature on the Bush presidency, memoirs by administration officials, and the archival record to date."
"19","The analysis raises a few questions for future research. Did Bush ever rebel against the family and professional expectations of him throughout his life? His work ethic clearly is grounded in duty, service, and avoidance of public disputes, but how did he address conflicts in internal debates? As president, Bush was widely praised for creating a collegial national security team, but did collegiality favor incremental over bold decision making? More generally, given the positive assessments of Bush's presidency in recent years, how will George H.W. Bush be evaluated historically in American politics? Meacham's book will be an essential foundation for such analyses, and it will engage scholars and informed readers of presidential studies alike."
