"1","THE CURRENT PERIOD of increasingly homogeneous, programmatic, national, and relatively evenly balanced and polarized parties poses unique challenges for politicians in the United States. Both major political parties need to obtain the support of middle‐of‐the road “median voters” who do not have deep party loyalties and whose electoral choices may determine the electoral outcome. Both parties also depend heavily on energizing a set of base constituencies for generating political contributions, acting as “foot soldiers” in retail politics, and producing a disproportionate turnout on Election Day. But these core constituencies are frequently far from the preferences of median voters on a number of policy dimensions, and parties also depend on not alienating those who are close to median voter positions if they are to enjoy electoral success. Moreover, to improve their future electoral prospects, political party leaders need to find ways to add to their political base new “target” constituencies that are currently divided in their political loyalties, attached to the opposition party, or politically inactive or who may not think of themselves as political constituencies with common views and interests at all. Party leaders also need to find ways to detach core constituencies from the opposition parties by converting, splitting, or demobilizing those constituencies. Making their political calculus even more complicated, most political leaders also have policy preferences that they care about deeply about, which may or may not coincide with the diverse preferences of their party's political base, potential target constituencies, and median voters.         "
"2","Politicians can pursue three fundamental strategies to win and stay in office and to achieve their policy objectives. First, they can engage in what David Mayhew calls credit claiming for things that they have done for particular groups—for example, bringing federal contracts that provide jobs to local constituencies or supporting more generous Medicare benefits that help seniors.1 In addition to retrospective credit claiming, politicians can also prospectively emphasize their closeness to groups of voters on issues currently being debated, perhaps seeking to take a leadership role in moving those issues up on policy agendas. Mayhew labels this position taking, but it can considered an extension of credit claiming because it, too, emphasizes positional proximity to voters—usually a subset of voters for whom an issue is most salient. Credit claiming is most attractive when public opinion is homogeneous or an issue is salient only to a relatively small group with fairly homogeneous positions.         "
"3","A second strategy that politicians can pursue is blame avoiding—that is to say, minimizing their responsibility for unpopular actions taken and denying or obscuring their positional distance from any group or from the electorate as a whole. They may use a variety of strategies to do this, such as obscuring their own positions, passing the buck for decision‐making to other policymakers (for example, nonpartisan regulatory commissions), or “circling the wagons” to reach a consensus among a supermajority of politicians on a position so that blame is broadly diffused.2 This strategy is most attractive when public views on an issue (prospective) or public evaluation of past actions or outcomes (retrospective) are heterogeneous and intensely felt.         "
"4","A third strategy that politicians can use is to engage in blame generating or negative messaging about the past, present, or projected future actions, as well as the positions, character, and other attributes, of political opponents. The positional focus of this strategy is less on the politician's own actions, positions, or attributes (which may go unmentioned) than on those of the opponents, and it is most attractive when an opponent's position is or can be framed as broadly unpopular either with the public as a whole or with most of the public that is likely to view it as politically salient.         "
"5","Negative messages clearly are a basic component of political life. Politicians and groups blame one another for economic downturns and declines in student achievement. President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans blamed each other for failing to reach a deal on budget sequestration. Candidate Donald Trump criticized the Obama administration for being soft on immigration, negotiating bad trade deals, and failing to defeat ISIS; as president, he has used Twitter to criticize (among others) a judge who issued opinions contrary to his executive order on immigration, the dictator of North Korea, members of his own cabinet, and the mainstream media (“Fake News”). Congressional oversight committees blast the agencies they oversee for errors of omission and commission. Interest groups criticize politicians for failing to support their political agenda on issues such as abortion, gun control, or the environment. Candidates and parties running for political office and independent (or quasi‐independent) interest groups also criticize the issue positions and character of their opponents for their potential effect on future policy outcomes.3 Republicans claimed that “Obamacare” would lead to death panels to cut off funding for the elderly and critically ill.4 Contenders for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination bestowed on their opponents labels such as “liar,” “con artist,” and “no‐show senator,” along with allegations of hostility toward women and hints of anatomical deficiencies.         "
"6","Political scientists have analyzed several aspects of blame generating in political life. A substantial literature in American politics has been developed on topics such as the causes and consequences of negative campaigning or “attack politics” and its consequences for voter turnout and mistrust of government,5 the decline of comity in Congress and record‐low levels of public approval of Congress,6 and politicization of judicial appointments.7 The literature suggests a fundamental puzzle about how common negative messaging should be in politics, however. On the one hand, the literature on prospect theory and framing effects suggests that because individuals are more sensitive to losses than to gains and susceptible to framing effects, blame generating should be ubiquitous.8 On the other hand, a substantial literature has developed in political science over the past 25 years on how rational, reelection‐seeking politicians anticipate blame in their environment, seek to avoid that blame and its harmful political fallout, and manage the effects of that blame when it cannot be avoided.9 If politicians indeed have strong incentives to avoid blame through prospective and post hoc management techniques, and they are reasonably effective at positioning themselves in a way that places them close to median voter positions, it might be expected that negative messaging would be limited to personal failings of candidates and parties, such as sex scandals and influence peddling that they thought they could conceal but became public; rare, hard‐to‐anticipate events such as Hurricane Katrina; and policy issues for which issue salience and the positions of median voters shift in ways that cannot be predicted—or at least were not predicted—by politicians, such as taking a strong line against terrorism prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks.         "
"7","Clearly, blame generating is closer to ubiquitous than rare. Why is this so? This article makes three arguments about the incidence and causes of blame generating. First, engaging in or refraining from blame generating is the result of boundedly rational calculations made by politicians with limited information and resources and (in many cases) several alternatives. The first section of the article defines blame generating and argues that it is rooted in individuals’ greater sensitivity to losses than to gains and then outlines a general calculus of the micro‐foundations of decisions on blame generating.         "
"8","The second argument is that the prevalence of blame generating is influenced by factors in the macro‐environment that affect expected payoffs to its perpetrators and alternatives available to them. The second section of the article argues that a series of changes in the American macro‐political environment, such as permanent austerity in budgets, increases in primaries, polarization of party elites, changes in the media environment, and increased frequency of divided government, facilitated negative messaging in recent years."
"9","The third argument is that politicians and other political actors such as interest groups engage in blame generating not just in election campaigns and partisan politics but also in the policy process, from agenda setting through enactment (or nonenactment) and implementation of policies. Moreover, political actors engage in blame generating not just for electoral objectives but for policy ends as well, and blame generating (and the threat thereof) can affect policy outcomes not just indirectly through electoral outcomes but also directly through policy choices made, avoided, and altered."
"10","Given the limitations of space, the objective of this article is primarily to generate concepts and hypotheses rather to systematically test hypotheses. To provide an illustration the applicability of the argument, the third section of the article applies this analysis to the policy dynamics around the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. This case was chosen both because it is considered one of the most important and controversial social policy innovations of recent years and because it illustrates, in a single example, the roots and operation of the general phenomenon of blame generating across three stages of the policymaking process: agenda setting, policy adoption, and implementation. While the ACA had an unusually high profile and high stakes, other examples given in each section show that it follows a common logic in the current macro‐political environment. The concluding section briefly examines the implications of pervasive negative messaging on politics and policymaking in the era of Donald Trump."
"11","Blame generating is defined here as the deliberate development and communication of negative information about some group, individual, or policy (the “target”) developed by a “perpetrator” and delivered by a “messenger” to some group (the “audience”) for the purpose of political and/or policy gain by a “beneficiary.” Negative messages generally contain the following elements:            "
"12","As the first point suggests, negative messages need not refer solely to actions or inactions already undertaken by the target. They may also refer to policy positions that the target holds (or is alleged to hold) that are out of step with the core audience's policy preferences or to character flaws (for example, corruption, poor judgment, bad morals) that are likely to have negative consequences in the future if he/she/it is not stopped. Indeed, claims by political parties and candidates that their opponents are out of step with their constituents or are “extreme” in their views are especially common electoral appeals because they shift attention away from specific content toward representativeness or judgments, on which there is likely to be less of a division among voters. The 2004 ads run by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth are a classic of this genre, charging that John Kerry was “untrustworthy, dishonorable, and unfit to be commander in chief.”10"
"13","The gain anticipated from negative messaging is an increased probability that the target (for example, a legislator deciding how to vote on legislation, a president deciding whether to introduce or to veto legislation), the audience (for example, individuals deciding which candidate to vote for), or both will undertake actions or forgo actions in ways that are consistent with the perceived interests of the beneficiary. Negative messages are likely to be especially powerful motivators as a result of what Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky refer to as loss aversion: individuals are more sensitive to past or potential losses than to equivalent gains. In addition, individuals tend to have a negativity bias—that is, they pay more attention to negative than to positive information.11 Thus, they are likely to be particularly receptive to negative messages.         "
"14","Some comments on these elements of the definition—perpetrator, messenger, message, target, audience, and beneficiary—are in order here. First, it should be recognized that negative messages are social constructs. Rarely are they a simple recital of facts; they are also a selection and interpretation of facts. As Deborah Stone notes, political actors “do not simply accept causal models,” they create images by composing “stories that describe harms and difficulties, [and] attribute them to actions of other individuals or organizations.”12 The ability to create images that are intelligible to, resonate with, and resist alternative interpretations by the audience is an important element of effective blame generating.         "
"15","Second, as the Swift Boat Veterans example illustrates, while the perpetrator, the messenger, and the beneficiary of a negative message are often the same entity (for example, when a candidate for office criticizes the record of his opponent), in many other cases they are not. Presidential candidates may want to avoid a reputation as a mudslinger and, in the case of primaries, avoid alienating party rivals whose support may be needed later. On the other hand, unless the messenger is directly colluding with the perpetrator, relying on other parties to convey negative information and/or interpretations about the target risks a loss of control over the content of the message."
"16","Third, reporting on a target's failings by a noninterested party (for example, a network news broadcast) is excluded from our definition of negative messaging unless it was made possible by information provided by the perpetrator or the perpetrator (or some chosen messenger) publicly repeated that message or put a further negative “spin” on it. Donald Trump's repeated use of the phrase “a lot of people are saying” to repeat and give attention to unproven (and, in some cases, clearly false) claims, such as the idea that President Obama was not born in the United States, is a clear illustration of the latter strategy.13 Media coverage of negative messages can greatly amplify their visibility and impact: examples include the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth's anti‐Kerry advertisements in 2004, the Health Insurance Association of America's “Harry and Louise” ads attacking the Bill Clinton administration's health care proposal, and Donald Trump's claims about “Lying Ted” Cruz and “Crooked Hillary” Clinton. In each of these cases, relatively modest media buys (or, in Trump's case, free Twitter messages) were greatly boosted by news media repetition.14 Indeed Twitter messages have the multiple advantages of being free and succinct and lacking gatekeepers, and therefore more likely to be picked up by mainstream media.15 Repetition by others who are not obvious beneficiaries of the message adds both to the visibility and the credibility of the message.         "
"17","Fourth, neither lobbying nor threatening the target directly (for example, telling a potential target that the potential perpetrator will withhold needed resources or release harmful information) is blame generating, because there is no third‐party audience whose reaction to the information is expected to influence outcomes. The lines between blame generating and other activities are not always clear, however. When farmers, senior citizens, or anti‐abortion activists march on Washington, for example, they usually combine lobbying with direct threats to withhold political support. But there is almost always a negative‐messaging function as well: marchers are attempting to use the media to convince a nationwide audience that officeholders are not fulfilling their responsibility if they do not meet the demands of the marchers."
"18","Fifth, although electoral/political considerations related to gaining and holding office are almost always a major consideration in politicians’ decisions on whether and how to engage in and how to respond to negative‐messaging activities, politicians and other perpetrators of negative messaging frequently have objectives other than political/electoral ones.16 In particular, they are likely to have policy objectives that they want to at least satisfice, if not maximize. These objectives may come from ideology, personal values, life experiences, or other factors besides the balance of constituency preferences. Politicians may be willing to use scarce political resources and take electoral risks to achieve those objectives. While politicians recognize the necessity of making trade‐offs, they do not like to do so. Thus, they are drawn to policy options that make them better off on several objectives and worse off on none. A policy proposal that allows politicians to generate negative messages against political opponents but makes them worse off with respect to several of their policy priorities (for example, by making it less likely that they will be able to move policy away from a policy status quo that they deem unacceptable) is unlikely to be greeted by politicians with great enthusiasm. If, however, policymakers develop or encounter a policy option that comes closer to their policy preferences and offers blame‐generating opportunities while incurring little risk of blame or splitting their party coalition, they are likely to embrace it, try to move it up on the agenda of issues being debated, and try to move it forward to adoption.         "
"19","Sixth, most negative‐messaging situations can be thought of as multi‐audience games in the sense that different audiences may have very different reactions to those attacks, and the issuer of those attacks may depend on those audiences to varying degrees and for different resources (for example, votes, campaign contributions, active or passive coalitional support) to meet different objectives.17 While a negative message may have a “core audience” at whom it is aimed, those who are considering launching such attacks must also calculate the effects that those attacks would have on multiple audiences. A negative message that might gain or solidify support from a core audience may be dropped or reframed if it is likely to cause a second audience to withhold support or increase opposition.         "
"20","Finally, blame generating can be seen as part of an iterative game. Politics and policymaking are not one‐round, one‐time affairs; they involve repeated interactions among mutually dependent actors. Engaging in blame generating may make it less likely that the target will be willing to engage in various forms of cooperation with the perpetrator in the future. It may also make it more likely that the perpetrator will become a target, and it may alienate messengers and the audience as well.         "
"21","As the foregoing discussion suggests, politicians and other actors must weigh several factors in deciding whether to generate negative messages against other politicians. These factors include the likely benefits of such an initiative, the potential costs, and whether there are alternatives that can achieve the potential blame generating perpetrator's objectives at lower cost.18"
"22","Calculation of costs and benefits by the perpetrator is the most obvious factor in determining whether negative messaging occurs: negative messaging will presumably occur only when a perpetrator perceives that the benefits from such activity outweigh the costs."
"23","The benefits for a potential perpetrator of generating negative messages may be of several types. The most obvious reason to generate blame is to induce defections among members of the audience who would otherwise support the target of the negative messages. In addition, perpetrators may seek to mobilize previous nonparticipants. In the 2016 presidential election, for example, Donald Trump built an overwhelming electoral margin among white voters without college degrees by building on that group's resentment against globalization, political and economic elites, illegal immigrants, and Muslims, among others, as sources of downward mobility and insecurity, and linking those forces to his Democratic opponent.19"
"24","Perpetrators may also generate negative messages to solidify and mobilize their political base and reinforce existing cleavages. The objective here is more defensive, and the target is often more vague. The major objective is usually to reinforce among members of the audience who already support them the ideas that those constituents are a distinct group whose interests are constantly under attack by outside forces and that the perpetrator or intended beneficiary of the negative message is the only one who can protect the constituents from harm. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump successfully used blame generating against Hillary Clinton as a core strategy to gain overwhelming support among white evangelicals who might otherwise have been suspicious of him.20 In preparing for the 2018 midterm election, Republican groups sought to use arguments that a Democratic majority Congress could lead to an impeachment “coup” against President Trump to mobilize support and contributions.21"
"25","Third, politicians may generate negative messages in order to scapegoat—that is, to avoid blame themselves. Once again, the primary audience for such appeals is the perpetrator's own political base of likely or potential supporters. However, the primary goal of scapegoating is to weaken negative images of oneself that might otherwise arise (perhaps as a result of negative‐ messaging efforts by political opponents) and thus to lower the probability of defection by those supporters, rather than to induce a negative image of opponents. President Obama blamed the George W. Bush administration for economic and budgetary woes. President Trump blamed the failure of his effort to repeal the ACA on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and three maverick Republican senators.22 Members of Congress often run for reelection in Congress by running against Congress—that is, decrying the institution's shortcomings while separating themselves from those shortcomings.            "
"26","Fourth—and of particular interest to this article—politicians and interest groups may generate negative messages in order to change the policy positions of other actors and ultimately change policy outcomes. In this case, the perpetrator hopes to change the behavior of the target of blame rather than the target's supporters by intimidating the target into shifting their “zone of acceptable outcomes” to make it more consistent with those of the perpetrator.23 Targets are threatened with the possible alienation of their supporters if they do not change their behavior, but they have an opportunity to redeem themselves. For example, George W. Bush in 2005 attempted both to sell his proposal for individual investment accounts within Social Security to the public and to generate defections among congressional Democrats by generating negative messages against Democrats for failing to face up to the program's looming deficits; Democrats responded (more successfully) with charges that Bush's plan created new risks and did not restore the program's solvency in an effort to get congressional Republicans to defect from Bush's position.24 As will be discussed in more detail later in this article, blame generating can produce policy benefits at multiple stages in the policy process: by keeping particular issues or options off the agenda (or getting them on) during agenda formulation and formulation of policy alternatives, by helping to defeat or modify specific alternatives during policy adoption, and by altering the course of policy implementation. Of course, a single negative‐messaging episode may reap several kinds of benefits, electoral as well as policy, and long term as well as short term.            "
"27","Although negative messaging offers some important potential rewards for politicians and interest groups, it may also be costly, and these costs may prompt potential perpetrators to forgo negative‐messaging opportunities."
"28","The most obvious risk associated with negative‐messaging appeals is that they may provoke a negative reaction among the third‐party audience even if targets do not counterattack. This can be labeled an alienation risk. In particular, perpetrators of negative messages who are trying to induce a change in voting behavior have to be concerned that their actions may offend more voters than they attract—either on the issue substance or because of dislike of negativity. 25 The logic of the alienation effect also explains why negative electoral campaigns often focus on concerns other than substantive issue positions—for example, corruption, nonattendance in the legislature, personal peccadilloes, evasion of taxes, or (in the case of Hillary Clinton) misuse of an email server that could endanger national security. Because no one is for these things, the audience is unlikely to be alienated on the substance. Even this is no sure thing, however, especially when there is a big divide between the preferences of a politician's core constituency and the broader public: in the 1998 midterm congressional election, for example, “congressional Republicans found themselves in a serious political bind. Their core constituency of social conservatives demanded impeachment [of Bill Clinton] and would be unforgiving of anything less, while the broader public was overwhelmingly opposed to removing the president.”26 Voters’ high evaluations of Clinton's performance of his official duties, along with widespread willingness to overlook his private behavior and its cover‐up and a backlash against an impeachment inquiry that was widely seen as partisan, probably cost Republicans votes and seats in the election.27"
"29","Another major danger for a perpetrator is that negative messaging may prompt the targets of negative messages to withhold resources or cooperation needed by the perpetrator or the intended beneficiary, either now or in the future. This retribution risk and its consequences can be seen in several political and policymaking arenas. Presidents sometimes temper their criticism of congressional leaders because they know that they depend on those leaders for enactment of their legislative agenda. Similarly, interest groups may be reluctant to attack incumbents who hold positions of power—if they fail to defeat them, the officeholder may exact retribution later on some issue of concern to the interest groups. Thus, politicians are most likely to generate negative messages against targets when they do not have a continuing resource dependence on the target or need to have their cooperation in order to achieve their own goals, or when the target controlling the resources is unlikely to be able to succeed in gaining retribution.            "
"30","Finally, politicians may also forgo negative‐messaging opportunities if they fear that exercising them will limit their own room to maneuver in the future or preclude attainment of other valued goals. If a challenger blames an incumbent for raising taxes, for example, it will be difficult for the challenger to support tax increases if they win the election without appearing to be a liar, a hypocrite, or a flip‐flopper—all of which are charges that are likely to be made by future political opponents and may resonate with the public. President Trump's occasional expressions of willingness to compromise on immigration and a border wall with Mexico has infuriated some of his supporters on the populist right.28 More generally, harsh rhetoric on Chinese exports, North Korea, Iran and past trade deals may raise expectations among the Trump administration's supporters that the administration is reluctant to deflate with a policy compromise.            "
"31","Perpetrators may also undertake high‐risk negative‐messaging activities when they perceive no viable alternatives for achieving their objectives, consistent with the idea in prospect theory that individuals are less cautious when they are in the domain of losses. Desperation is a common source of counterproductive negative messaging by electoral challengers. A classic case of negative messaging that seems to have resulted from desperation is Walter Mondale's pledge in accepting the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination: “Let's tell the truth. . . . Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.”29 Mondale was gambling that Americans would accept higher taxes and that they were willing to believe that President Ronald Reagan was lying about his own intentions with respect to taxes. He was wrong on both counts, and his attempt to generate a negative message against Reagan instead gave the president perfect blame‐generating ammunition against Mondale.            "
"32","Both the prevalence and the content of blame‐generating messages are likely to be heavily influenced by the specific macro‐political environment in which politicians are operating. Six developments in the American political and social environment that affected messaging strategies by politicians in recent decades help to explain the current level, content, targeting, and effect of blame generating in the policymaking process."
"33","The strategic options that politicians have depend very much on the resources that are available to them. Credit‐claiming strategies, in particular, depend on being able to make credible claims that the claimer will be able to do things that benefit the attentive public. But slower improvements in productivity and overall economic growth over the past four decades have produced what Paul Pierson has called the “politics of permanent austerity,” making it more difficult to find slack resources to provide more generous health care or other benefits sought by the public.30 In addition, population aging and the maturation of many welfare state program commitments have resulted in higher pension and health care costs, putting enormous pressure on existing budgetary commitments and further reducing room to undertake new policy initiatives while diffusing costs broadly. Retrenchment initiatives resulting from these strong pressures for cutbacks offer a negative‐messaging target for opponents of those cuts. Perhaps more important, the combination of tight resources, budget rules, and Republican resistance to most new spending initiatives have made blame generating a relatively more attractive strategic choice for politicians as credit claiming for providing new or expanded benefits has become a less plausible strategy.            "
"34","Recent political science research almost uniformly points to a polarization of political elites and activists in the United States along partisan lines, although evidence that there has been a similar increase in polarization among the mass electorate is more mixed.31 The polarization of political elites has a number of implications for strategic choices in politics and policymaking. With increasingly homogeneous and polarized congressional party caucuses and a decline in the number of electorally competitive districts in Congress, the costs of framing an issue in moralistic, exclusionary terms that are intended to highlight and extend negative perceptions of the opposing party go down. Moreover, individual Republican politicians in particular now have more limited room to maneuver toward local median voter positions in order to avoid blame, for at least two related reasons. First, they may be subject to primary challenges from the Tea Party or other conservative elements within the party if they do not consistently follow conservative positions. Second, and related, they are increasingly subject to pressures to adhere to pledges to avoid new taxes, defend heterosexual marriage, and (for presidential candidates) appoint anti‐abortion judges—pledges they may feel that they need to sign in order to prevail in the Republican primary. Moreover, signing a pledge makes it a more credible commitment by “raising the potential reputation or characterological cost of reneging”32—that is, it increases the risk of becoming the target of credible blame‐generating messages.            "
"35","A number of changes in both traditional and new media in recent years have facilitated blame generating in policy and politics and have the potential to increase its impact. Proliferation of news sources, including those with a strong ideological and partisan flavor, increases the risk that Americans will be exposed primarily to information that fits their existing ideological beliefs (including a heavy dose of negative messages about political opponents), further hardening those beliefs. Researchers remain divided on the strength of these effects and whether they are confined to a relatively small population of political activists.33"
"36","Layered on top of these changes in traditional media composition and usage are new social media and messaging technologies, in which “[c]ontent can be relayed among users with no significant third party filtering, fact‐checking, or editorial judgment.”34 President Trump's preferred means of communication, Twitter “privileges discourse that is simple, impulsive, and uncivil.”35 Research suggests that individuals are more likely to believe false stories that align with their ideological predispositions.36 The 2016 election also shows that the negative messaging capacity of social media is also very vulnerable to manipulation, including manipulation by the Russian government.37"
"37","Several changes in campaign finance law and practice in recent years have also contributed to an increase in negative messaging in both electoral politics and postelectoral policymaking. Politicians are by no means the only perpetrators of negative messaging. Interest groups, corporations, unions, and other societal actors may also generate negative messages against specific politicians or policy proposals. For these actors, specific policy objectives are likely to be the major drivers of their strategic choices rather than victories in the broader electorate. Supreme Court decisions on campaign finance have broadened the number of players engaged in political and policy messaging (notably, super PACs) and their ability to do so anonymously, lessening potential repercussions. Given all of these trends, it should not be surprising that the 2012 presidential election cycle saw an increase not only in total television advertising but also in the percentage of ads that were negative in tone—with those by nonparty groups the most likely to be purely negative. Trends in congressional races have been broadly similar.38"
"38","When partisan control of one or more chambers of the legislature is different from the party of the president, institutional incentives to protect the prerogatives of Congress and partisan electoral incentives to criticize the performance of the other party coincide.39 Recent research finds that divided party control increases congressional investigation of the executive and that investigations decrease presidential popularity, increasing incentives to do it.40 (This incentive may be muted if the nonpresidential party has its fingerprints on the policy in question, unless the party can find a way to distance itself from the policy, as in Democratic claims that they were misled into authorizing the invasion of Iraq).            "
"39","In terms of the legislative process, the effect of divided government on blame generating is likely to depend on the degree of polarization and the strength of budget constraints. Political power in the federal government of the United States has multiple procedural hoops to be passed through before legislation is enacted. And on the Senate floor, even majority support is not enough to ensure passage if a determined minority is willing to hold a bill hostage with the threat of a filibuster. In a period of weak partisan divisions and weak budget constraints, there may be incentives to cooperate with the opposition and share in credit‐claiming opportunities for legislative initiatives. But increased party cohesion, little shared policy space, and weak credit‐claiming opportunities mean that there are few incentives for cross‐party coalitions in policymaking, which, in turn, reduces the costs of unrestrained attacks on members of the other party in Congress or the executive."
"40","A substantial literature addresses the role of negative messages by opinion leaders and the media in promoting mistrust of government and political institutions.41 What is less recognized, however, is that the causal arrow may also go the other way. Mistrust of government provides fertile ground for negative messages to be viewed as credible, and therefore more effective. Moreover, once many Republican politicians came to believe that mistrust of government fit their ideological ends of reducing the size of government, the costs to them of engaging in negative messaging about government institutions were reduced.42"
"41","Blame‐generating activities in politics and policymaking can be divided into a number of “arenas” that can be analytically distinguished but overlap empirically in their constellations of actors, cycles, objectives, and risks. What has been called the permanent campaign43 has a relatively long‐term, primarily electoral objective: building and maintaining a party brand that will bring about and solidify a long‐term alignment of voting blocs behind a specific party and “convert” specific voting blocs to party loyalty. While it is constant and ongoing, activity generally peaks during electoral cycles, when the public is most likely to be attentive. The major perpetrators of blame generating are party leaders and ideological interest groups; the targets are opposing political parties and candidates; and the (multiple) audiences are the party base, swing voters, and voting blocs who may be added to the party base. Blame‐generating messages typically center on policy positions and past policy records of opposing parties, arguing that the targeted party is unfit or has preferences different from the electorate/audience. The most important risk associated with blame generating in this arena is that attacks may alienate one or more groups of voters who respond to alternative issue framing from opposing parties or interest groups.         "
"42","A second critical arena for blame generating is electoral campaigns. Candidates, party leaders, and their surrogates (for example, super PACs) are the primary perpetrators of blame‐generating messages during election campaigns, and likely or probable voters in upcoming elections are the primary audience. The objective in this arena is also primarily electoral but shorter term—winning a specific election or primary contest by changing voters’ preference ordering of parties or candidates and/or increasing participation rates among specific electorate “audiences.” Opposing parties and candidates are targeted as unfit for office or having policy preferences that differ from important segments of the electorate based on party positions and past policy records. Here, too, blame generating poses important risks. In the short term, the perpetrator may be perceived as a “mudslinger,” and the message may mobilize contributions and turnout among opponents more than it does among allies of the perpetrator. A multistage electoral process (for example, primaries and general elections in the United States) featuring electorates with distinctive preferences may also lead to blame‐generating attacks (on more centrist opponents, for example) in primary contests that alienate voters in the general election. Similarly, in the medium to long term, candidates whose career advancement causes them to face different electorates with distinctive preferences as they move to larger districts (for example, from House contests to statewide contests) may find that attacks that served them well with one electorate may not with another.         "
"43","A third blame‐generating arena in American politics concerns executive and judicial appointments.44 Party leaders and interest groups are generally the most important perpetrators of attacks, with their attacks focusing on charges that the targeted nominee (or in some cases, rumored potential nominee) is unfit for office or has preferences different from the audience. Here the primary objectives generally relate to policy, by changing the preferences of the “audience” of officials nominating and confirming appointees, particularly those policymakers who have not made firm commitments to accept or reject a specific nominee. Increasingly, however, electoral objectives play an important role in nomination battles, with perpetrators seeking to mobilize and energize their core electoral constituencies by pointing out the policy stakes of a particular vacancy—such as the Supreme Court vacancy opened up by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The primary risks associated with the politicization of the appointment process are that retribution will lead to the blockage of appointments favored by the perpetrator or their allies at a later point in time, and/or that it will lead to a countermobilization of campaign contributions and turnout among opponents.         "
"44","Each of these arenas is an important venue for conflict—and blame generating—in contemporary American politics. Each has spawned a substantial literature on the origins and impact of negative messaging within that arena. The focus in this article, however, is on three policy arenas—agenda setting, policy adoption, and policy implementation—in which the dynamics of blame generating, and their linkages to the more overtly electoral arenas, have been less systematically explored. In each arena, I will focus primarily on the federal level in the United States, drawing examples primarily from the politics surrounding the ACA.         "
"45","The policy agenda‐setting process concerns which issues and policy alternatives are actively debated in a society among politically informed elites, media, etc. (the discussion agenda); the narrower set of issues and alternatives under active debate within government, but with no commitment to come to a decision (the formal agenda); and the even smaller number of issues and alternatives for which a specific institution is actively considering the issue for a definitive policy decision (the decision agenda). The key potential perpetrators are likely to be interest groups and public officeholders, although candidates for office—and especially candidates for president (or party leaders in parliamentary systems)—also play central roles.45 As with party brand building, the time horizons in agenda setting are often medium to long term, but policy objectives rather than electoral ones are usually the central concern of key players. The actions of these players center on raising or lowering (or excluding entirely) the place of an issue on the discussion and formal agendas and expanding or shrinking the range of policy alternatives considered to be legitimate options for adoption in the future.            "
"46","Blame generating can be a key element of agenda‐setting efforts. In particular, opponents of a specific policy option are likely to focus their criticisms on inconsistency of options they wish to block with broadly held societal values as well as the imposition of concentrated losses on identifiable groups. Opponents of the status quo highlight grievances associated with the status quo and criticize the failure of those in power to address them. After 1948, for example, conservative Republicans used the threat of domestic and foreign communism to promote the need for both electoral change and policy change, notably getting a rollback of domestic policies enacted by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman onto the agenda.46 Intense blame generating by Democrats and advocates for the elderly twice led President George W. Bush to remove Social Security reform from his legislative agenda. The widely publicized role that the National Rifle Association (NRA) has played in defeating several legislators in the U.S. Congress has increased the reluctance of other legislators to take on the NRA, providing a long‐term deterrent effect in the policy process that for many years kept policy proposals opposed by the NRA from even making it to the formal legislative agenda. Blaming weak gun laws (and Republican inaction) for mass shootings has been a key element of recent Democratic efforts to spur congressional and state action, especially after the 2018 Parkland, Florida school shooting sparked a new wave of protests in which shooting victims played a prominent role.            "
"47","In the case of health care during the Obama administration—and previous health reform initiatives—opponents of liberal reform options (for example, a single‐payer system or “public option”) sought to portray those alternatives as contrary to American values of self‐reliance, market competition, and minimal regulation and provision of services. They also drew on widespread mistrust of politicians and of the capacity of government to expand health care access efficiently. Even more important, a majority of Americans do have health care that they are at least content with, provided through a patchwork of employer‐provided health plans, Medicare and Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Program, and other mechanisms—and they are very concerned about an erosion or loss of what they have. Thus, as Paul Starr notes, “[p]ublic support for reform could wither if the opponents could again convince people with good insurance that change would come at their expense.”47 In such a political environment, putting a comprehensive health care reform on the discussion agenda poses a major risk of prompting blame‐generating attacks, and reform has tended to make it to the agenda intermittently, after memories of past failures (notably the 1993–1994 Clinton health care debacle) have faded.            "
"48","The multiphase nature of presidential contests in the United States played a major role in getting health reform back on the agenda in 2008. Given the predominantly liberal makeup of the electorate in the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination contest, any candidate hoping to have a chance to win the nomination needed a credible proposal to expand health care coverage, even though this was likely to leave them open to Republican attacks in the general election. But none of the major candidates endorsed a single‐payer approach favored by the most liberal wing of the party. Hillary Clinton and John Edwards came out early with plans that expanded coverage substantially with individual mandates and insurance exchanges and a public insurance option. Obama, playing catch‐up, initially endorsed exchanges but a universal mandate only for children. He criticized Clinton for proposing an individual mandate that would require individuals to buy insurance that they could not afford, and he was, in turn, criticized for leaving a much larger coverage gap than that of his rivals for the nomination.48"
"49","In the general election campaign, campaign ads for both candidates concentrated more on attacking their opponents’ plans than on laying out their own. John McCain charged that Obama's health plan “costs taxpayers hundreds of billions. It limits patient choice and rations patient care. . . . [e]xpensive employer mandates will rob 50 million employees of their health care coverage. Bureaucrats will decide what health procedure you can get and when you get it . . . With Barack Obama and congressional liberals, big government health care is on the way.” The Obama campaign, meanwhile, charged that McCain's proposals constituted a “new tax on health benefits . . . a multi‐billion dollar tax hike . . . the largest middle class tax hike in history.”49"
"50","This agenda‐setting process dominated by intraparty and cross‐party blame generating had important political and policy consequences. First, it meant that the newly elected President Obama would have difficulties in backing away from a health care initiative, although he could (and did) insulate himself in part from the risk of failure to enact one by delegating the development of detailed initiatives to congressional committees. Second, it meant that the range of options considered would be truncated to those that were “mainstream” and that substantial effort would be devoted by Republicans to characterize alternatives giving government a larger role (notably the so‐called public option) as out of the mainstream; those options were unlikely to survive the legislative process."
"51","Blame generating in debates over policy adoption generally concerns concrete policy alternatives that are already on government's “action agenda” and up for serious consideration by political institutions that have the authority to accept or reject them. The primary targets of such attacks are thus more specific than in agenda setting: policymakers who are not firmly committed to a specific policy position or who can be persuaded to change positions. The perpetrators of those attacks are likely to be interest groups and other stakeholders who have a concentrated interest in one or another alternative (especially the status quo) as well as politicians who object because a proposal threatens their political or policy interests. The objective of negative messages at this stage is also generally more specific and more short term: perpetrators seek to change the behavior (and perhaps the preferences) of targeted officeholders by enlarging or shrinking those policymakers’ “zone of acceptable outcomes” and changing their actions in a direction preferred by the perpetrator of the attack because targets fear the electoral consequences of failing to do so. The exact form of the shift in behavior will differ across political systems: in weak party systems such as the United States, opposition parties and interests may hope to sway electorally vulnerable legislators to vote against the positions of their party leaders and defeat policy initiatives they favor, although increasing party polarization in the United States means that there are fewer centrist legislators in each party who may be induced to defect; blame generating by party leaders may be more effective at keeping their wavering copartisans from defecting than inducing defections. In systems with stronger party discipline, blame generators can only hope to induce defections of an entire party group (in coalition governments) or get the governing party or parties to shift their position."
"52","Blame generating during the adoption phase of policymaking can be seen repeatedly in the United States. In 1995 and 1996, Republicans charged that President Clinton was being fiscally irresponsible and blamed him for two government shutdowns after his veto of a Republican‐ passed budget reconciliation bill. Clinton focused his response on the most unpopular elements of those bills, notably, cuts in Medicaid funding for the elderly (Clinton charged in a weekly radio address, “I don't think it should be a precondition that if a husband has to go into a nursing home, his wife has to go into the poorhouse”50) and the popular school lunch program. In response to Clinton's charges that the new Republican Congress was extremist and had produced little output, Republicans abandoned the most controversial social policy cuts and sent him a separate welfare reform bill, which he signed. In 2016, congressional Republicans sought to block Planned Parenthood from receiving funding under legislation to address the spread of the Zika virus and blamed Senate Democrats for blocking legislation. Senate Democrats, under intense pressure from pro‐choice groups not to set a precedent for defunding Planned Parenthood, refused to budge and returned fire, claiming that it was Republicans who were blocking Zika funding by refusing to pass a “clean” bill.51"
"53","Similar patterns of blame generating can be seen in debates over adoption of the ACA. Republican investment in a blame‐generating message on health care as their core policy and political strategy against the Obama administration could be undercut if Republican legislators sought (and especially if they achieved) compromise across party lines; thus, efforts by some Republican senators to explore compromise were effectively quashed by party leaders. Opponents of broader coverage in general and the individual mandate and public option in particular sought to play into public fears that their own situation would become worse by lowering their quality of care, forcing them to buy coverage they did not want, or even subjecting them to “death panels.”52 In particular, ACA opponents very effectively portrayed the ACA's mechanism of reducing Medicare reimbursements and cutting funding for Medicare Advantage plans as stealing from Medicare in a way that would harm the elderly.53 As Paul Starr argues, the Obama administration's decision to settle for a “minimally invasive” health reform allowed it to reach deals with hospitals and pharmaceutical companies so that “they didn't launch an all‐out campaign to defeat it,” but that did not prevent “a bitter and prolonged fight with the ideological and partisan opposition”54 that was surmounted only by use of a temporary supermajority in the Senate and creative use of reconciliation procedures. In the House vote on final passage of the ACA, Republicans used a blame‐generating argument that restrictions in the bill against using government funding for abortions were not strict enough, combined with threats of retribution from pro‐life groups, try to split off enough pro‐life Democrats to defeat the bill.55 While 34 Democrats did defect and Republicans were unanimous in opposition, the bill passed narrowly, by a vote of 219 to 212.            "
"54","During the implementation phase of new or long‐standing policies, both electoral and policy concerns are central to the blame‐generating calculus, as opposing party leaders seek to highlight any losses imposed and highlight visible policy failures. Opportunities for blame generating are likely to peak during and immediately after highly visible policy failure “focusing events.” Opposition party leaders and interest groups who feel disadvantaged by the policy status quo are likely to be the dominant perpetrators, seeking to frame policy failures as the responsibility of current officeholder (especially in the executive) targets. Given the tendency of voters’ attention to wane over time (what Downs calls the issue attention cycle), short‐ and medium‐term calculations about how to take advantage of those opportunities to gain electoral advantage are likely to be dominant. In some cases, perpetrators may also seek to change policy in the short to medium term. Where blame generating finds resonance with the electorate or targeted policymakers have incomplete control over the implementation process, policy may shift policy toward the preferences of blame generators."
"55","Criticism of administration policies by opposition parties is, of course, very common in the United States, from Democrats’ criticism of the George W. Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina to Republicans’ criticism of the Obama administration's prosecution of interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both cases, these critiques of implementation were part of larger narratives—Bush as uncaring, Obama as weak—that opposition parties sought to convey to voters for electoral gain. Though less common, shifts in policy during implementation do occur as well. President Obama reversed his decision to allow oil drilling off the southeast Atlantic coast. The Obama administration's inability to make good on its pledge to close the Guantánamo Bay detention center was due in part to Republican criticisms that transferring detainees to the mainland or abroad would threaten Americans’ security."
"56","These policy dynamics can also be seen in the political struggles that followed passage of the ACA. Even after taking control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 election, congressional Republicans lacked control of the presidency and (until 2015) the Senate. Therefore, they had few attractive alternatives to negative messaging to achieve their political and policy objectives. Conservative opponents of the ACA sought to generate blame against the Obama administration in ways that played to the fears of their political base, emphasized valence claims (for example, unconstitutional actions and administration dishonesty or incompetence) rather than divisive ones, and did not tie Republicans to specific (and potentially costly or divisive) solutions."
"57","Republicans had several advantages in pursuing these strategies, which they sought to consolidate and amplify through their actions and blame‐generating rhetoric. First, while many individual provisions of the ACA are very popular, slightly more of the public opposed the ACA than supported it through the 2016 election, and this pattern was fairly steady over time. Partisan divides were quite strong.56 This public opinion environment reflects the fact the ACA is extremely complex (a Kaiser Family Foundation implementation tracking survey identified 90 separate provisions coming into effect over an eight‐year period57) and that benefits provided by the ACA are divided across many programs and constituencies in the many‐layered American health care system. Moreover, the perceived political need to make the ACA appear to be self‐financing in the long term meant that while the ACA's architects sought to front‐load visible benefits and back‐load costs (for example, the “Cadillac tax” on high‐cost health plans), some visible losses were imposed the relatively short term.58 Future cuts in Medicare reimbursements, heavily publicized by Republicans in an effort to appeal to seniors, posed a particularly tempting blame‐generating target for Republicans. Republican critiques of the ACA also focused heavily on claims that it was costing jobs and causing health insurance premiums to increase as well as on the potential effects of the (repeatedly delayed) employer mandate.            "
"58","Given Republicans’ weak initial bargaining leverage to get a legislative repeal of the ACA, it is not surprising that their initial efforts focused on the courts, with 26 Republican state attorneys general challenging the constitutionality of the ACA—a charge that not only offered the potential to overturn some or all of its provisions but also highlighted Republican claims that it was illegitimate."
"59","The most dramatic legislative effort by congressional Republicans to overcome their structural disadvantage in repealing the ACA came in the fall of 2013, when they refused to pass a continuing resolution that included funding for the ACA, shutting down nonessential services of the federal government. It was a political game that had almost no chance of achieving its policy objectives, because it would have required both a dozen Senate Democrats and the president to back down on the administration's signal achievement. It involved multiple levels of actual and threatened blame generating: conservative Republicans led by Senator Ted Cruz and allied conservative advocacy groups coerced their reluctant copartisans in the House and Senate to go along with the shutdown threat by branding them as soft on Obama (and thus open to primary challenges from the right). Leaders of the shutdown effort also generated blame against the president for refusing to negotiate or compromise, while the president blamed Republicans for shutting down the federal government. Polls before and after the shutdown suggest that a majority of the public blamed Republicans, and Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders concluded that prolonging the shutdown could cost the party dearly in the 2014 election (the political damage in fact appears to have been short‐lived). The shutdown dramatically elevated Senator Cruz's profile among the most conservative wing of the Republican Party. It also demonstrates the retribution risk, however, as Cruz's intransigence further alienated him from his fellow Republican legislators (Boehner in 2016 famously referred to Cruz as “Lucifer in the flesh”—and worse), making it less likely that Republican elites would coalesce around Cruz as the “last man standing” alternative to Donald Trump as the 2016 Republican presidential nominee.            "
"60","A second high‐profile opportunity for Republicans to generate blame against the Obama health care initiative came with the launch of the federal health care exchange website in 2013. The launch was a fiasco, with thousands of people forced to wait a long time to get on the website, having it crash in the middle of their registration efforts, or not being able to get on at all. Republicans also argued that the president had lied—another valence claim—in his preenactment claims that “if Americans like their doctor, they will keep their doctor. And if you like your insurance plan, you will keep it. No one will be able to take that away from you.” When insurance companies started issuing large numbers of policy cancellations in late 2013, House Speaker Boehner framed the issue in terms of the untrustworthiness of the Obama administration: “Promise after promise from this administration has turned out to be not true . . . So when it comes to this health care law, the White House doesn't have much credibility. Now, let's be clear. The only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this law once and for all. There is no way to fix this.”59 Repeated House votes in the House to repeal the ACA—70 by early 2016—were used to keep the issue visible and signal the Republican base that they were not abandoning them, despite their lack of success in getting rid of the ACA.60 But only in 2016 were Republicans able to get a bill to the president repealing the ACA, which he vetoed.            "
"61","Blame generating also played a substantial role in battles over the ACA at the state level. One set of battles concerned whether states should establish state exchanges for purchasing insurance or leave that to the federal government. These battles went through several stages and pitted Republicans’ ideological preference for limiting Washington's power by running their own exchanges against the desire of the most conservative Republicans to show intransigent opposition to the ACA by refusing all state cooperation with it. The latter position became dominant after the November 2010 midterm election, when Tea Party–endorsed Republicans made major gains in both the House of Representatives and state legislatures, and those legislators, supported by conservative organizations such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, pushed a policy of intransigent opposition. In a striking show of intraparty blame generating intended to support a unified Republican message of blame generating against the ACA and the Obama administration, “Republicans implementing any part of the ACA have been branded as traitors . . . Republican incumbents consequently had reason to fear that health reform apostasy on exchanges could hurt their electoral prospects.”61"
"62","The second major set of state battles concerned Medicaid expansion under the ACA. These battles once again frequently pitted pragmatic Republican governors’ concerns over budget balancing (costs of the expansion would be borne 100 percent by the federal government in the initial years, falling to 90 percent in later years), service expansion to vulnerable populations, and pressure from hospital lobbyists seeking to increased revenues and decrease uncompensated care against pressure from conservative Republicans and conservative pressure groups such as Americans for Prosperity.62 Campaigns to pressure Republican state legislators were mounted in a number of states and, as Theda Skocpol and her colleagues have shown, substantially reduced the probability of state Medicaid expansion in states with Republican governors. When Republican governors did succeed in winning Medicaid expansion, it was often by using procedural mechanisms such as executive orders and federal Medicaid waivers to avoid legislative obstruction or diffuse blame.63"
"63","After the Republican electoral victory in 2016, congressional Republicans struggled with how to “repeal and replace or repair” the ACA without making millions of voters, including many of their supporters, worse off.64 House Republicans narrowly (217 to 213) passed an ACA repeal‐and‐replace bill in May 2017—a bill that President Trump initially praised but later characterized as “mean.” Action moved then to the Senate, where Republicans enjoyed only a two‐vote majority, giving individual senators substantial bargaining leverage to press their conflicting demands. Moreover, opinion polls showed that public support for the ACA finally outnumbered opposition by mid‐2017, while most provisions of Republican repeal‐and‐replace proposals were deeply unpopular.65 It is thus not surprising that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opted for a closed‐door bill development process without public hearings to facilitate negotiations with his colleagues and to lessen opportunities for negative messages generated by opponents of the legislation to build before a roll‐call vote. Republican senators faced intense pressure not to defect—with threats of electoral retribution or policy retaliation if they did so—from President Trump, Republican party leaders and conservative advocacy groups.66 Critics of Republican proposals, on the other hand, cited estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that various Republican proposals under consideration could cause more than 20 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage within a decade, highlighting in particular impacts on rural health care and Americans in nursing homes.67 After several false starts, the Senate bill ultimately failed to win passage when three Republican senators least vulnerable to blame‐generating focused on the conservative Republican voting base defected to vote against the bill. Overall, the final result of nearly party‐line voting reflect high levels of intra‐party ideological cohesion facilitated by intra‐party blame‐generating. But the three Senate Republican defectors also suggest limitations to intra‐party cohesion induced by blame and threats of blame: John McCain of Arizona, recently diagnosed with brain cancer, was nearing the end of a long career and was a self‐styled maverick; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska had recently won reelection, and had already survived losing the 2010 Alaska Republican senatorial primary to win reelection as a write‐in68; Susan Collins of Maine had won reelection in 2014 with 68 percent of the vote and no primary challenger.            "
"64","With ACA repeal temporarily abandoned, conflict over the ACA at the federal level returned to provisions that were most unpopular, notably phase‐out of the individual mandate as part of the December 2017 tax legislation. President Trump also unilaterally ended payments to insurance companies intended to make insurance more affordable to individuals purchasing health insurance on state exchanges. The payment cutoff was widely expected to further destabilize those insurance markets and increase insurance costs for low‐income purchasers of insurance. Again blame was employed to legitimize his actions: President Trump criticized the payments as both illegal and unjustified payoffs to wealthy insurers."
"65","This article has attempted to sketch out a broad framework for analyzing the role played by blame generating in political life, with applications primarily to American politics and policymaking. It links a micro‐foundational analysis of negative messaging with a set of macro‐political environmental parameters that shape strategic calculations. When there are changes in specific environmental parameters that make negative messaging more or less costly or risky, decisions on whether and how to send negative messages, and the incidence, content, targeting, and impact of blame generating, are likely to shift as well."
"66","Such a change on multiple dimensions appears to have occurred in American national politics in recent years. In the old equilibrium, politicians in the electoral arena focused on trying to claim credit and avoid blame in primarily localized contests, taking advantage of their substantial leeway to adjust their positions close to those of median voters in their districts. This equilibrium has been largely supplanted by a new dynamic of nationalized campaigns with limited opportunities to gain voter support by claiming credit for handing out distributive benefits as a result of austerity pressures and legislative stalemate, multiple perpetrators who have limited incentives to refrain from generating blame, high mistrust of government that makes negative messaging more plausible, and (for congressional Republicans in particular) very limited room to deviate from party positions, enforced by the threat or reality of blame‐generating primary challenges."
"67","Given that most of the changes in the macro‐political environment that have driven negative‐messaging levels in American politics in recent years do not appear to be cyclical, there is little reason to hope that American politics will undergo a shift toward less negativity in the near or medium term. Indeed, the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016 both reflects and reinforces these trends. The president's use of unfiltered Twitter attacks to criticize perceived opponents and his characterization of alternative sources of information as “fake news” may lead to a further exacerbation of blame generating, mistrust, and polarization in American political life. Some of his attacks stretch the definition of “bounded rationality” in strategic calculation: even many of the president's most ardent supporters believe that his Twitter tirades do not always serve his political and policy interests. Moreover, administrative chaos in the White House and President Trump's often unclear and changing policy positions and “erratic bargaining tactics”69 in both foreign and domestic policy may increase the prospects of policy failures, and hence increase the need for scapegoats.         "
"68","Politicians’ fixation on generating blame against opponents and their policy positions, and their capacity to do so, has policy consequences as well as political and institutional consequences. It truncates the policy options considered by governments. Overall, blame‐dominated politics in the United States has contributed to widespread policy stalemate, as politicians portray compromise as a betrayal of principle and seem incapable of working across party lines. But it can also increase the cohesion of fragile legislative coalitions by intimidating potential dissenters to go along, as in the case of the 2017 Republican tax legislation and near‐repeal of the ACA. During policy implementation, electoral incentives to generate blame increase the impetus to seek to repeal or undermine implementation of initiatives enacted by opposing parties. None of these effects seems likely to soften in the toxic political atmosphere of the Trump era.*"
