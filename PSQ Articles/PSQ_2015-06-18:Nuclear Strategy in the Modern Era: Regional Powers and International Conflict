"1","Predictions of rampant nuclear proliferation around the world have not come true, and the international security literature has discovered many reasons for the persistence of the global nonproliferation norm. Nevertheless, there are now eight or perhaps nine states that could commit another Hiroshima‐scale massacre in the blink of an eye. In Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era, Vipin Narang moves beyond proliferation to the causes and consequences of regional powers' nuclear postures. This book fills a gaping hole in the existing literature.         "
"2","Narang postulates three generic nuclear postures that a regional power may adopt. First, the “catalytic” posture stops just short of overt declaration of nuclear weapons acquisition, aiming instead to use that possibility as a diplomatic card to force superpower intervention at a moment of supreme national emergency. Second, the “assured retaliation” posture develops a credible second‐strike capability and an equally credible commitment not to launch a first strike. Third, the “asymmetric retaliation” posture develops a credible threat to use nuclear weapons first in order to nullify an opponent's conventional military advantage."
"3","To explain states' choice of posture, Narang adopts a “neoclassical realist” approach that he dubs “posture optimization theory.” Narang's predictions of states' nuclear postures are based on a decision tree that asks four questions in sequence. The first two questions are at the level of the “structure,” and the second two questions are at the level of the “unit.” First question: is there a reliable third‐party (superpower) patron? If so, then Narang predicts a catalytic posture. Second question: is the state facing a conventionally superior, “proximate” (that is, neighboring) offensive threat? If so, then Narang predicts an asymmetric escalation posture. Third question: does the state have “assertive” (that is, civilian‐dominant) civil‐military arrangements? If so, then Narang predicts an assured retaliation posture. Fourth and final question: does the state face significant internal resource constraints? If so, then Narang predicts assured retaliation; if not, he predicts asymmetric escalation."
"4","Having developed his theory, Narang proceeds to test it on six country cases: Pakistan, India, China, France, Israel, and South Africa. Drawing mainly on the existing English‐language, secondary‐source literature on these cases, Narang claims that his theory predicts all of their posture choices correctly except for Israel's move toward assured retaliation since 1991. Narang further contends that his theory performs far better than the hypotheses that can be derived from structural realism, technological determinism, and the strategic culture approach."
"5","The final section of the book tests the deterrent effects of the different nuclear postures. In these two chapters, which are based on his previously published journal articles, Narang uses quantitative and qualitative analysis to make the case that nuclear posture matters a great deal for deterrence outcomes. In particular, Narang commends the asymmetric escalation posture as “deterrence optimal” (p. 297). Narang views asymmetric escalation as the only posture that has consistently proved sufficient to deter conventional attack. At the same time, he admits that his findings are based on a very small sample of only two states, France since 1961 and Pakistan since 1998. Therefore, past performance should not be taken as a reliable guide to future results. He also recognizes that the “deterrence optimal” asymmetric escalation posture increases the risk of nuclear accidents or unauthorized use. He does not resolve this dilemma."
"6","Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era performs an essential service in opening up a whole new area of nuclear behavior to sustained social scientific investigation. It is a very strong start in the right direction. Unfortunately, the book's theoretical and empirical arguments also contain serious flaws that will need to be rectified by subsequent research on this topic.         "
"7","First and most importantly, Narang wrongly restricts his universe of cases to states that have chosen to maintain an “independent” nuclear arsenal. Therefore, he explicitly eliminates the United Kingdom from consideration because of its “tight integration with U.S. nuclear forces since 1958” (p. 3 n. 3), and he devotes zero attention to South Africa's decision to give up its arsenal in 1991 or to the three post‐Soviet states that gave up the bombs they inherited. The problem is that these were nuclear posture decisions, too. By truncating his dependent variable in this way, Narang hugely biases his empirical findings. Narang's blindness to decisions to stand down from nuclear “independence” reflects international relations realism's unjustified and normatively biased “proliferation fatalism,” which Benoît Pelopidas has perceptively analyzed."
"8","Second, Narang's realist instinct to “prioritize and privilege a state's security environment, as defined by the material external threats and opportunities” (p. 31) is refuted by the evidence that he presents. The very first question on Narang's decision tree is whether the regional power has an available third‐party patron, and he provides ex ante indicators for coding this supposedly structural variable. But then Narang informs us that South Africa's expectation that the United States would fly to its aid if it tested a nuclear bomb, which led it to adopt the catalytic posture, was nothing short of “delusional” (p. 34). He therefore hastens to admit that “unit‐level” factors can greatly affect states' choices to remain at a catalytic posture or to move toward something more robust—but he does not offer any clue as to what second‐ or first‐image variables might be at play here. The book should have taken the issue of misperception seriously instead of treating it as a mere nuisance."
"9","Third, the theory is not just simplistic but, ironically, also fails the test of parsimony. In his case studies, Narang admirably pirouettes his way down the decision tree's four questions. But he could have generated the exact same predictions if he had simply focused on two of his four questions: the perceived availability of a third‐party patron and the state's choice of a delegative or assertive approach to civil‐military relations. This streamlined model notably does away with Narang's second “realist” variable, which has the additional benefit of clearing up a major coding error that he makes in one of his country cases. Narang argues that France during the Cold War chose asymmetric retaliation because, according to him, it was facing a conventionally superior, proximate offensive threat, where “proximate” is defined as “shar[ing] an easily passable land border” (p. 44). Yet France did not share a border with the Soviet bloc; in fact, it was behind West Germany and the more than 200,000 American troops that were stationed there. So Narang's attempt to explain France's nuclear posture choice as “realist” violates his own coding criteria. But France did arguably have delegative civil‐military relations, and that variable correctly predicts France's consistent asymmetric escalation posture."
"10","These criticisms aside, Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era establishes Narang as a significant scholar of nuclear and international security affairs. Narang demonstrates absolute mastery of his subject matter. Not only does he have a solid grasp of both nuclear technology and nuclear strategy, he is also able to communicate the essential points with clarity and precision. Narang also expertly deploys a range of social science methods, both quantitative and qualitative. In sum, Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era is an important book on an important subject, and many scholars and think tankers will surely find the book highly stimulating. I certainly did.         "
