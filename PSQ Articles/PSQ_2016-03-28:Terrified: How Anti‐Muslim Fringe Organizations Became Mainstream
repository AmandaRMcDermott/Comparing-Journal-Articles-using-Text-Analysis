"1","The study of anti‐Muslim sentiment in the United States is a burgeoning enterprise, with scholars increasingly devoting attention to the strategies that anti‐Muslim individuals and organizations employ to generate anxiety and hostility toward Muslims. The most notable studies to date include the Center for American Progress's Fear, Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America and Nathan Lean's The Islamophobia Industry: How the Right Manufactures Fear of Muslims.         "
"2","Christopher Bail's new book, Terrified: How Anti‐Muslim Fringe Organizations Became Mainstream, is similar to these other studies in terms of the people and organizations it analyzes. Where it differs is its focus on the complex cultural and psychological forces that enabled anti‐Muslim organizations to transition from the fringe to the mainstream in the decade after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.         "
"3","Bail wrestles with the overarching question of how civil society organizations shape shared understandings of important political or social issues. In the case of Islam in post–September 11 America, did anti‐Muslim organizations acquire influence over shared understandings of Islam by tapping into existing misgivings or anxieties? Or did these organizations first find their way into the mainstream and from that position of power produce negative understandings of Islam that redefined conventional wisdom?"
"4","Analyzing 120 civil society organizations and relying on sophisticated research methodologies, Bail disputes the idea that anti‐Muslim organizations succeed because they resonate with preexisting sentiments. He argues that these organizations “drift” into the mainstream as a result of complicated cultural, structural, and social‐psychological factors. Once in the mainstream, they reshape the cultural environment in a manner that reinforces their message and maintains their influence."
"5","Just prior to the September 11 attacks, anti‐Muslim organizations were on the periphery of public discourse about Islam. By contrast, many Muslim American civil society organizations were fruitful in generating positive images of Islam. The September 11 attacks represented a major crisis in the cultural landscape, providing anti‐Muslim organizations with the opportunity to influence the discourse on Islam in a more significant way. This influence did not emerge overnight, and early in the George W. Bush administration, Muslim American organizations still held considerable political influence."
"6","As journalists gravitated toward the intense, negative displays of emotion produced by fringe anti‐Muslim organizations, the cultural landscape began to shift as these organizations received considerable media attention. This attention, in turn, prompted mainstream Muslim American organizations to devote more attention to refuting the narratives put forth by the fringe organizations, a tactic that inadvertently helped increase the public profile of anti‐Muslim organizations and legitimize their presence in the public debate over Islam. With such visibility, anti‐Muslim organizations were able to routinize their hostile narratives of Islam and connect with powerful organizations that provided financial resources and political clout."
"7","By the end of the second Bush administration, anti‐Muslim organizations wielded considerable influence, advising the U.S. State Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and presidential candidates about Islam and the dangers it posed to the nation. Muslim American organizations, once influential players in the political and policy processes, were now marginalized politically and struggling to fend off suspicions, generated by anti‐Muslim organizations, that they were terrorist sympathizers."
"8","Bail's book is a convincing account of how anti‐Muslim organizations garnered so much power and influence over shared understandings of Islam in post–September 11 America. It is also a wake‐up call to the broader public on the heavy casualties that arise from the media's affinity for sensationalist and dramatic rhetoric in lieu of rational, informed analysis. Terrified is a major contribution to the scholarship on the public influence of anti‐Muslim organizations and the role of the media in empowering them.         "
