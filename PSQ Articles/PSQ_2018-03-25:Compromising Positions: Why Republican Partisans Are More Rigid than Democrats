"2","“I am a man of fixed and unbending principle, and one of my principles is flexibility.”"
"3","—Everett Dirksen"
"4","IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A SENATE LEADER today happily admitting that he or she is, of all things, a compromiser. In his ineffable way, the garrulous Everett Dirksen was proud to say that weaving together legislative compromises was his job. Dirksen served as the Republican minority leader during the 1960s and was frequently photographed negotiating face to face with presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, something he was surely proud of, as it was tangible evidence of his influence.1 In answering the question, “What happened to the dealmakers?” historian Julian Zelizer writes that Senator Dirksen could compromise because he had a “love of legislating” in “an era when talented men were more than happy to devote their lives to the tasks of governance and believed that passing legislation was an exciting task.”2"
"5","While we live in a different era than Dirksen, Congress must still legislate, and some deals must be struck to keep the country running. Polarized as we are, aggregate public opinion strongly favors a Congress full of compromisers over one characterized by politicians who rigidly stick by principle.3 Indeed, the preference for compromise has actually increased in recent years. The lack of cooperation surely contributes to a perception of Congress as a dysfunctional body, beset by partisanship, incivility, and a lack of productivity. Yet members of Congress, and Republicans in particular, are more averse to compromise than ever.4 Dirksen's approach to government is now perceived to be not only bygone but also a guarantee of minority status.         "
"6","What is the path forward for Congress? Clearly, members of both parties in Congress must negotiate with each other while navigating the preferences of the voters back home. Today's legislators operate in an environment in which their behavior and votes are much more transparent, much more traceable. It is not that leaders from the past such as Dirksen or Lyndon Johnson did not have to worry about public opinion. It was the legendary Tip O'Neill, after all, who said that “all politics is local.” Rather, today's media environment, with its immediacy and reach, places a giant mirror over Washington, and every member of Congress knows that his or her actions are visible to those back home who follow politics closely. And while the general public may want compromise, the slice of voters who participate in party primaries may prefer otherwise. Dealmaking in Congress seems to be increasingly dependent upon getting the base on board, particularly for Republicans, who are ever more tightly linked to their primary voters in ways that have profound implications in Congress.5"
"7","Charting a path forward to encourage the acceptance of compromise among rank‐and‐file voters is challenging. In this article, we explore how this acceptance might be accomplished by testing two alternative approaches. First we examine whether bipartisan legislation can generate public support for compromise as a result of “gains from trade.” As in economics, gains from trade give both sides a reward for entering into a bargain. Each side walks away with a change that not only improves its standing with constituents but also, at least in theory, makes the whole system work better. In this view, negotiation and compromise generate deals that let all dealmakers—and their followers—walk away declaring victory."
"8","Yet with avid partisans, it may not be the gains from trade that sell a deal. A second perspective is that in today's polarized atmosphere, the most intense preference of the ideologues who constitute the base may be to avoid harm in a compromise situation. This perspective would be informed by a well‐documented phenomenon of loss aversion, the weighing of loss over gain when confronted with the possibility of both. Loss would be particularly resonant if the advantages of a compromise are diffuse while the losses are tangible and easily identifiable. If so, approaches to dealmaking may be less motivated and more constrained by “win‐win” than by “no loss.”"
"9","In the pages that follow, we test both of these perspectives. Using a set of commissioned surveys, we systematically examine the utility of classic negotiation and compromise theory (win‐win) as well as a contrasting approach, prospect theory (loss weighs more heavily than gain), as we compare the responses of rank‐and‐file partisans to hypothetical compromise. Our findings demonstrate that there is something inherent in a conservative perspective that helps explain why rank‐and‐file Republicans are less approving of compromise than Democrats. We contend that this imbalance is a phenomenon worth understanding. It matters to the functioning of our political process and to the tenor of our civil society. Do we want our government to produce policies that have the ability to generate broader support from a larger swath of people? Should our political system be able to better address the big problems that we face as a nation? Would it be better to have more trust in our government and its representatives? Can we escape the rancor and coarseness that so defines our present‐day political culture and that has seeped into our everyday lives? It is not just Republicans who are responsible for the failures to get to resolution on the issues of the day, but the problem does lean rightward, and our task is to explore why this is the case."
"10","Public opinion surveys show, over and over, that in the mass public, there seems to be less tolerance of compromise among conservatives and Republicans than among liberals and Democrats, and we see this in a variety of contexts. A recent Al Jazeera America poll, for instance, reveals an asymmetry in how rank‐and‐file Republicans and Democrats view the legislative process. In this survey, Republicans are much less likely than Democrats to accept compromise on principle. When asked, “What causes more problems in the federal government: elected officials who are not willing to stand up for their principles or elected officials who are not willing to compromise?,” Republican respondents are—by a huge margin—more likely than Democrats to attribute government's problems to a failure in principle (49 percent versus 20 percent) and less likely to attribute problems to a failure to reach compromise (40 percent versus 71 percent). When the pollsters follow up with more specific questions about whether one's congressional caucus should compromise on various issues—education, defense, energy, the national debt, immigration, and taxes—majorities of partisans are willing to accept compromise. But on five of six issues, compromise is acceptable to Democrats more than Republicans, and on some issues—such as immigration—that difference is pronounced (71 percent versus 56 percent).6"
"11","The Al Jazeera poll is typical of most probes into attitudes about political compromise. Other polls taken in the past few years show the same thing, even as the question wordings vary and even though they emphasize different dimensions of compromise. A 2012 Pew poll, for instance, frames compromise as a means “to get the job done.” Democrats are again far more willing to accept compromise on these terms than Republicans (though two‐thirds of Republicans do agree to compromise when the question is asked this way). Table 1 offers examples of a couple of other survey questions. The results are consistent. In the mass public, almost any way questions on compromise are framed, Democrats are more accepting of political compromise than Republicans.         "
"12","We begin our empirical work by further documenting the difference that partisan identity makes in a citizen's willingness to compromise. In doing so, we move beyond questions that measure a preference for legislators who work for compromise as opposed to those who stand for principle. Instead, we test whether the difference we observe in what Democrats and Republicans like in their representatives extends to whether they themselves would be inclined to compromise if put into a hypothetical legislative situation. Upon showing that Republicans are, in fact, personally less disposed to compromise, we turn away from win‐win to an alternative framing, using questions that turn the logic of loss and gain around."
"13","Our initial approach is grounded in what might be called “negotiation and compromise theory,” developed in a rich literature encompassing both normative and prescriptive perspectives. It is normative in the sense that the willingness to compromise is considered to be a necessary foundation in our democratic system. The prescriptive qualities of this theory derive from behavioral research that points toward correlates of negotiations that yield solutions—win‐win solutions. This work is largely built on the assumption of face‐to‐face negotiations, and among political scientists, it focuses on compromise among legislators from different political parties and ideological predispositions. Since our own research is on public opinion, it might not seem to relate well to this body of theory. After all, the public does not engage in negotiations with itself. However, the public is called upon to consider compromises worked out by policymakers. The public's response—or potential response—often constrains and liberates legislators, so it is not surprising that some of the literature focuses on how citizens perceive compromise. Gutmann and Thompson, for example, lament that America is turning away from a “compromising mindset,” which they define as “adapting one's principles and respecting one's opponents.” In contrast, an “uncompromising mindset” encompasses “attitudes and arguments that encourage standing on principle and mistrusting opponents.”7"
"14","For both rank‐and‐file citizens and legislators, how does negotiation and compromise theory suggest that individuals can be led away from ideological and partisan rigidity and toward compromise? The critical recommendation from the literature is to encourage negotiators away from the domain of principle and toward the domain of interests.8 Conventional thinking about dealmaking and compromise stresses turning negotiations into win‐win situations.9 The essential point of negotiation and compromise theory is that this is easier to do when interests are at stake rather than principles.         "
"15","Studies in political science and psychology support this notion. In a recent study on propensity to compromise, Timothy J. Ryan argues that individuals are least likely to bend when their moral principles are at stake, when “evaluative processes (orient them) away from maximizing gains and toward adherence to rules of conduct.”10 In his experiments, he finds that “moral conviction” surrounding an issue leads to resistance to compromise, even controlling for the extremity of an opinion on that issue or how important or relevant the issue is to the individual. When moral principles are brought to the fore, they are likely to tap into one's identity, ethics, beliefs, and notions of fairness. They are more likely to evoke emotion, particularly with regard to opposing points of view.11 And they have the potential to short‐circuit self‐interest, making appeals to compromise less resonant.12 In this context, it is not surprising that Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse find that many in the mass public have an aversion to aspects of the political process, and it is the practical vehicles of compromise—horse trading, logrolling, quid pro quos—that are particularly distasteful.13"
"16","We extend negotiation and compromise theory even beyond Ryan's compelling demonstrations of the influence of principled conviction on compromise. We observe that interests tend to be more easily quantified and are also more divisible than principles. They can be thought of in increments, and these increments should be easier to trade. Principles, on the other hand, tend to be all‐or‐nothing propositions, harder to give up in pieces and thus harder to bargain with or over. For this quite practical reason, compromise is harder to forge when the stakes are principled rather than interest based."
"17","So how might these observations drawn from the theories of negotiation and compromise and the empirics of studies of compromise help explain the partisan difference in willingness to compromise that we find so consistently in the public opinion polls and in political science? Part of the answer lay in how politics and compromise are characterized by opinion leaders. In the world of public opinion, the challenge of encouraging acceptance of compromise is steeper because of cultural and systemic incentives for politicians and media elites to frame compromise in terms of principles instead of interests. Berry and Sobieraj write about an “outrage industry” that has emerged in recent decades, one that promotes bombast and rigidity in the name of principle and does so in the pursuit of ratings, profits, and popularity.14 They argue that the underlying business model of cable news, talk radio, and ideological blogs is built around the incessant vilification of those on the other side of the ideological divide. Compelling content in this genre is grounded in name‐calling, character assassination, mockery, and extreme rhetoric. This is no fringe element of the media. Berry and Sobieraj estimate that the daily aggregate audience for these media is 47 million a day.15 On an ongoing basis, a highly engaged and politicized audience is watching, listening, and reading a steady stream of poisonous, angry criticism of those who hold different political views.         "
"18","While there are some examples of liberal outrage in the media, this is, notably, a phenomenon of the right. The outrage media has different appeal to conservatives and liberals. At the time of our study, Fox News typically attracted three times the number of prime time viewers as the liberal MSNBC. Talk radio, which is the largest segment of this industry, is even more lopsided in its ideological appeal. Not a single one of the top 15 talk radio hosts is a liberal. Rush Limbaugh alone draws 13 million listeners a week. Only among the largest ideological blogs is there some parity between conservative and liberal audiences. This differential in appeal is a manifestation of, and some measure of, a difference between conservatives and Republicans on the one hand, and liberals and Democrats on the other. In this vein, Grossmann and Hopkins demonstrate that the Republican and Democratic parties have evolved asymmetrically. Rank‐and‐file Republicans view politics from a much more partisan and ideological perspective, whereas Democrats accept that their party is an amalgamation of different interest groups, each with its own policy preferences. Like Berry and Sobieraj, they credit conservative ideological media as a major influence on the world view of their audience.16"
"19","Of course, the line of causality runs in two directions. Right‐wing media outlets are influential because their message resonates with listeners predisposed to their message. That said, many of these media figures are quite explicit about how to apply conservative principles to various issues. And this, in turn, influences how those in power behave and what they support. Those who are perceived as too accommodating risk being tagged as “Republicans in name only” (RINOs). Donald Trump's former White House aide Stephen Bannon, while editor of the widely followed Breitbart, told his staff shortly after Paul Ryan was made Speaker of the House that he wanted the news and opinion site to destroy Ryan, forcing him out within months.17 It is worth noting that there is nothing quite comparable for Democrats; a liberal orthodoxy is not nearly so monitored and enforced as it is on the Republican side. Simply put, opinion media on the conservative side discourages not only particular compromises but also a mind‐set necessary to accept compromise.         "
"20","A second explanation for the relative Republican resistance to compromise is that conservatives have a different set of personality characteristics, personal qualities, and psychological predispositions that lead them to adhere more to principle and to thus be more resistant to compromise. This argument has been around for a long time, going back to the work of Herbert McClosky and the authors of The Authoritarian Personality.18 McClosky, for instance, provides prodigious evidence that conservatives—just coming out of the McCarthy era—are psychologically distinctive. He argues that conservatives are, among other things, inflexible, uncomfortable with the “give‐and‐take of free inquiry and the open society,”19 and low in their faith in democracy—all things that would impede a compromising attitude. More contemporary social science has shown that a constellation of psychological predispositions differentiates conservatives from liberals and, for our purposes, in ways that would lead them to be less flexible about abandoning principles, whatever those principles might be. They are more fixated on purity and order, revere tradition, and tend to view the world in more black‐and‐white and in‐ and out‐group terms.20 As Graham, Haidt, and Nosek argue, conservatives have a “deontological reluctance to make trade‐offs.”21 Compromising one's principles to reach a solution requires an ability to transcend a pure position, tolerate messy solutions, sometimes break with the past, and capitulate on principle in a way that can benefit an out‐group.         "
"21","This constellation of values and psychological predispositions is also characteristic of highly religious people, and it is perhaps no accident that political conservatives and religious conservatives (particularly white religious conservatives) are overlapping sets. Either because religious practice leads to conservative values or because conservative values lead to religiosity—or both—conservatives tend to be more religious, and a particular kind of religious that is relevant to this argument. Religious conservatives are more attached to the primacy of text and long‐established rules and more likely to adhere to and take comfort in orthodoxy. It should not be surprising that they are more rigid in their politics as well."
"22","The fact that white, Christian conservatives have become a critical core constituency of the Republican Party—in a recent poll, 45 percent of Republican identifiers describe themselves as “born‐again” or evangelical Christians—is notable in this context.22 The moralistic streak—religious or otherwise—that runs through the Republican Party's base makes it more difficult for its representatives to operate in the realm of interests than in the realm of principle, and this has real implications for governance. Barry Goldwater, perhaps the most conservative presidential candidate of the modern era, recognized this when he colorfully suggested that conservatives should give Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell “a kick in the ass.” Said Goldwater, “Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know. I've tried to deal with them.”23"
"23","The second theoretical approach that informs our hypotheses is prospect theory, which was first offered and refined by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky but has been used productively by many social scientists in the years since.24 There are several key tenets to prospect theory, a couple of which seem relevant to us as scholars interested in compromise. The most important component of Kahneman and Tversky's theory is the concept of loss aversion, and this is the foundation of our argument that political compromise may be more informed by a “no loss” perspective than a “win‐win” one. In many contexts, people making decisions weigh loss more than gain as they look toward the future. Put another way, Kahneman and Tversky find that “people hate to lose even more than they love to win.”25 It is a powerful and well‐supported insight that upended economics so much that Kahneman, a psychologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics.         "
"24","As we think about the act of compromise, it seems, inevitably, to involve a complex calculus of loss and gain—not only one's own prospective loss and gain but also the loss and gain faced by one's negotiating partner. So it seems logical that this theory should apply as we attempt to understand how people come to accept compromise and why some types of people, more than others, should be inclined to compromise."
"25","Kahneman and Tversky argue that this predisposition to focus on loss is heightened in contexts of risk and uncertainty. A compromise is often negotiated in a context of uncertainty, and the possibility of a successful resolution to a negotiation is usually balanced by the risk of giving away too much. At its core, then, the act of compromise would seem to be best understood through the lens of prospect theory. It is thus quite remarkable to us that the literature on political compromise has not “discovered” prospect theory. As Mercer argues, the theory, which has been so influential in economics and psychology, just has not resonated in political science. Our own empirical review of the prospect theory literature supports Mercer's observation. Kahneman and Tversky's work on prospect theory has been cited more than 16,000 times, according to the Social Science Citation Index, but a review of these citations shows very little influence on scholarship about compromise in general and no influence at all on political compromise beyond studies of relations between states in crises, wars, and diplomacy.26 Mercer argues that the problem is that Kahneman and Tversky's experiments in the laboratory enable them to easily manipulate perceptions of loss and gain, but in the real world of politics, it is much harder to know how people perceive what is loss and what is gain.         "
"26","Perhaps so, but with political compromise, particularly in a starkly partisan context, we argue that gain and loss are relatively easy to assess, especially when pitting liberal and progressive values of change against the conservative impulse to protect the status quo. Later in this article, we test the idea that Republicans are less inclined to compromise because they are more likely than Democrats to calculate loss in the situations they face, and we design an iteration of our survey exercise to reverse the gain/loss calculus in the hypothetical compromise that our respondents must react to."
"27","Our expectations are informed by findings in political psychology that conservatives have a heightened sensitivity to loss. Hibbing, Smith, and Alford, synthesizing an extensive review of literature, “make the case that variations in physiological and psychological responses to a particular category of stimuli—those that are negative (or aversive)—correlate with political orientations.”27 This manifests itself in a number of ways relevant to our discussion. Conservatives, for instance, find threatening stimuli more distracting,28 are more likely to interpret ambiguous stimuli as threatening,29 are more likely to believe that the “world is a relatively harsh place,”30 and are less risk tolerant as a result. Hibbing, Smith, and Alford argue that the heightened sensitivity to threat would “[seem naturally to mesh with] political positions favoring defense spending, roadblocks to immigration, and harsh treatment of criminals.”31 This makes sense to us, and we speculate that altering the direction of threat so that it is less apparent to conservatives will have some bearing on the orientation to compromise. This would not change the attachment to principle we discuss earlier, but it might mitigate the consistent ideological (and thus partisan) differences we find in “compromiseability.”         "
"28","The questions like those displayed in Table 1 attempt to assess how people feel about compromise in the political process, which is a relevant and important question. We take a somewhat different tack here. We look at the proclivities of rank‐and‐file partisans toward compromise as if they were participants in the legislative process. We create survey exercises that “place” respondents into the role of legislator and then ask, in a variety of ways, whether they would themselves move toward a compromise and, if so, how much. The exercises we have designed thus allow us to see whether Republican partisans are more rigid than Democrats in another, more personal way. The answer to this question is worth knowing, but the great advantage of our approach is that we can start to answer questions that go beyond the simple observation of partisan difference. We can probe into why this partisan difference is evident in poll after poll.         "
"29","Our studies are based upon public opinion exercises that we conducted in August, September, and October 2014 in Pennsylvania. Placing our exercises on public opinion surveys gives them external validity that would be missing if we were to just use a convenience sample to test our ideas."
"30","Our project extends public opinion research in a critical way—indeed, in a way that more fully emulates research practice in the sciences. In this project, we employ iterative research practice. We place versions of our exercises on temporally proximate public opinion surveys conducted by the same pollster on the same population. Unlike standard practice, in which all the questions are placed on one large survey, we spread our exercises out. This requires us to make some uncontroversial assumptions. We assume that the structure of public opinion on the issues we are exploring will not change over the course of one month, which allows us to replicate exercises across surveys and merge the data to allow for larger subgroup analyses. Moreover, like our colleagues in the laboratory sciences, we can learn from our initial findings and use them to shape the next iteration of our “experiment.” As the reader will see, our first exercise appeared to mislead some respondents, and we were able to replicate our exercise with a revamped question structure that did not lead to confused or confusing answers by our respondents. Iterative research practice also allows us to toggle between induction and deduction and to derive new testable ideas from the results of previous tests. Our research questions are predicated upon deduction; we test our ideas and let the results fall as they will. But in our initial results are the seeds of new ideas, and we want to take advantage of these insights. This method allows for that.         "
"31","Our exercises were placed on public opinion surveys conducted in Pennsylvania by the polling center at Franklin & Marshall College. The Franklin & Marshall polls were conducted to gauge public opinion on a variety of contemporary issues and to measure the levels of and composition of support for candidates in a gubernatorial campaign that was unfolding over the summer and fall of 2014. An embattled incumbent faced a vigorous challenger in a competitive race that was the main political event in the state. By most measures, public opinion changes little across the three surveys conducted prior to the election. Franklin & Marshall fielded a representative sample of 500 to 700 respondents in each of its surveys. As one measure of its quality, the Franklin & Marshall survey offered what turned out to be a highly accurate picture of the governor's race. The September and October surveys pegged the Democratic candidate's support at 57 percent of voters who had made up their minds. That candidate ended up winning 55 percent of the vote."
"32","We chose to run our research in Pennsylvania, not because the gubernatorial race was particularly interesting but because it is a state that is relatively balanced politically. While Democrats have won recent presidential contests in the state (though, notably, not in 2016), the governor's office had alternated between the parties in recent decades, and the state legislature and congressional delegation have been dominated by Republicans. The state is not just home to major East Coast metropolitan areas but also a swath of rural and small‐town territory referred to by some as “Pennsyltucky.” We also value the heterogeneity of the population, the presence of substantial numbers of minorities in the population, the state's divided government, and the success of both parties in recent political history. It seems like a good place to test ideas about the differences between Republicans and Democrats and to extrapolate our findings beyond the state to the country as a whole."
"33","We start with a survey question designed to investigate individual proclivities toward compromise and to see whether we find the same partisan gap that we observe consistently in the polls discussed earlier. Our study looks at compromise on the issue of the minimum wage, an issue that brewed throughout 2014, in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Fully 14 states (and the District of Columbia) raised the minimum wage during 2014.32 While the minimum wage was discussed in Pennsylvania, there was no successful action on the issue. It was, however, an issue that was very much politically relevant at the time of our experiments. It is a particularly meaningful issue given our desire to measure just how much people are willing to move toward compromise.         "
"34","Our first study, conducted in the August 2014 survey, begins with a question intended to anchor the respondent at a position. We then see whether our follow‐up question can pull the respondent away from that position and toward the position of the other party (with Democrats presumed to favor a higher minimum wage and Republicans a lower wage level). Our initial question reads as follows:            "
"35","Democrats and Republicans in Washington are debating the minimum wage. The minimum wage is presently $7.25 an hour and Republicans in Congress would like to keep it there. President Obama has proposed that the minimum wage be set at $10.10. Ideally, where do you think the minimum wage should be set?"
"36","Once the respondent has established a position to this open‐ended question, we ask,            "
"37","Recalling that the range currently being debated is $7.25 to $10.10, if you were the [Democrat/Republican] responsible for negotiating the final minimum wage, where would you be willing to set the minimum wage?"
"38","The survey script automatically asks respondents who are registered with one of the parties to represent that party in the exercise. Respondents who report that they have not registered with one of the parties but who identify with one of the parties are also included.         "
"39","The results of this exercise conform to our expectations, as seen in Table 2. While 60 percent of our Republicans are unwilling to negotiate and move away from their original preference, 50 percent of Democrats strike this stance. On the other hand, Democrats are almost twice as likely as Republicans to seek win‐win, indicating a willingness to set the minimum wage lower or higher than their individual preference. Alas, one finding from this exercise is unexpected and led us to question the clarity of our question. A not‐insignificant number of people negotiated “in the wrong direction.” This included Democrats who aimed for a higher minimum wage “in negotiations” than their own individual preference and Republicans who aimed for a lower wage than their own preference. However, here, too, Republicans are more likely to negotiate away from compromise than Democrats.         "
"40","In addition to looking at how many of our partisans moved to compromise or “stayed put,” we calculated the average movement toward compromise in dollars and cents. If a Democrat set his or her own preference for the minimum wage at $10.10 and said that he or she would be willing to set it at $9.10 in the follow‐up question, we coded that respondent's movement as $1.00. Those who negotiated in the wrong direction were not given a negative number as we made these calculations but were simply considered to have stayed in place; we set their movement at zero, just like those who refused to compromise. In Table 2, we show the average movement (in dollars and cents) toward compromise, including and excluding those respondents who negotiated in the wrong direction (labeled “anti‐compromisers” in the table). The results illuminate the partisan difference we find in the simple relationship. Democrats are not only about twice as likely as Republicans to compromise, but also they are likely to compromise twice as far on the scale, with a t‐test confirming a statistically significant difference. We look only at those who compromise in the right direction. Democrats who compromise are likely to compromise further than Republican compromisers, though the relationship does not achieve statistical significance. Every way we cut it, our expectations are confirmed. Given past survey research, it is not that surprising that Republicans are less compromising, but this exercise offers a somewhat different finding, one that captures whether individuals themselves are willing to change their position, even a little.         "
"41","The finding is confirmatory, but the large number of respondents who negotiate in the wrong direction seems odd and hard to explain. These anti‐compromisers are potentially interesting, to be sure, and we do not completely disregard what they might represent, but we ran a second version of the exercise to eliminate this kind of response. The advantage of iterative research is that it allows us to have a “re‐do,” this time constraining respondents from moving in the wrong direction by offering response categories rather than allowing for an open response. In the September survey, we offer respondents the following questions:            "
"42","Democrats and Republicans in Washington are debating the minimum wage. The minimum wage is presently $7.25 an hour and Republicans in Congress would like to keep it there. President Obama has proposed that the minimum wage be set at $10.10. Ideally where to you think the minimum wage should be set? Should it be set at $7.25; $7.95; the midpoint $8.65; $9.35; or at $10.10?"
"43","Suppose that you were the [Democrat/Republican] responsible for negotiating the final minimum wage rate. Would you stay at [previous answer], or would you be willing to compromise at"
"44","[for Democrats] $9.35, the midpoint $8.65; $7.95; $7.25?"
"45","[for Republicans] $7.95; the midpoint $8.65; $9.35; $10.10?"
"46","Respondents who put themselves at one of the endpoints are offered all of these alternatives in the follow‐up question. If they start at one of the in‐between positions, they are only offered response categories that lay in between their own position and the endpoint position of the other side. Thus, if a Democrat places herself at $8.65, she is then asked whether she would compromise to $7.95 or $7.25. The advantage of giving respondents these response categories, rather than leaving the response open ended, is that it completely eliminates anti‐compromise, either purposeful or accidental, from the possible outcomes. It might seem odd to include complete capitulation as a “compromise alternative”—and not a single respondent takes it—but offering the whole span of alternatives allows the respondent to express how far to the other side he or she would be willing to go."
"47","Results from this cleaner iteration of the exercise are also found in Table 2 (italicized), and they are not all that much different from those in the first exercise, thus offering some additional confidence in the results. Here, as in the first case, Democrats are considerably more likely to move toward the Republican position on the minimum wage than Republicans are to move toward the Democratic position, and in about the same proportions as in the first iteration (55 percent of Democrats versus 38 percent of Republicans). In a measure that captures both how many people move toward compromise and how far they move, Democrats move 12 cents further to compromise, perhaps not a huge amount but a statistically significant one. Again we see that rank‐and‐file Republicans are notably less inclined to compromise than rank‐and‐file Democrats, at least on this particular issue of the minimum wage. We also find (not displayed in the table) that the stronger the sense of partisanship for Republicans, the more rigid the position, though even Republican leaners are much less likely to compromise than Democrats of any strength. Notably, this pattern does not appear for Democrats. “Strong Democrats” are no less likely to compromise than those Democrats who profess less affiliation with the party. This asymmetry offers further evidence that there is something meaningful about a Republican affiliation that matters. In the remainder of this article, we seek to explain what it is.         "
"48","Our effort to quantify the partisan difference in willingness to compromise on an issue such as the minimum wage has value in and of itself, but we use these survey exercises to extend our inquiry. We have devised several follow‐up analyses and exercises to explore the reasons why Republicans are less likely than Democrats to compromise on an issue (or, conversely, why Democrats are more likely to compromise than Republicans).         "
"49","We start with the possibility that there is something else associated with being a Republican or Democrat that contributes to the partisan difference. Perhaps it is not, as McClosky (and many others) have argued, that there are fundamental personality differences that lead people to choose a conservative or liberal outlook but rather other characteristics of Democrats and Republicans that account for the difference we observe. For example, there might be a gender difference in the proclivity toward compromise. We know that there is a long‐standing gender gap in partisanship, and perhaps that gender gap is simply creating a mirage in the first‐order relationship."
"50","To test this, we regress our measure of willingness to compromise (on the minimum wage) on partisanship as well as on a series of other independent variables to determine whether the relationship holds even when controlling for other characteristics that distinguish partisans. We add measures of race, gender, gun ownership, ideological strength, educational achievement, and rural/urban residence to the equation. If Republicans are more likely to be white, male, gun owners, less educated, and rural, and these characteristics matter to willingness to compromise, might they be accounting for the party difference we observe in the bivariate relationship? The ideology variable is coded so that strong liberals and strong conservatives are grouped together, as are weak liberals and conservatives, leaving moderates and people who refuse to think in ideological terms as the base category. If Republicans are more attached to ideological principles than Democrats, and strong ideologues are more rigid when facing the question of compromise, then that could explain some or all of the difference we observe."
"51","The independent variables are all coded so that those categories expected to be associated with greater resistance to compromise have higher values, with the exception of our three‐category education variable. To align with intuition, we have coded less educated respondents at 0 and the best‐educated respondents at 2. The regressand is set at 0 for respondents who do not compromise, 1 for those who compromise one category, and 2 who compromise two categories in the exercise (each category representing 70 cents on the minimum wage scale). As the ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficients in Table 3 show, some of these variables do have an independent impact on willingness to change. But only some of these coefficients reach statistical significance. Rather surprisingly, ideological strength appears to have little relationship to our dependent variable. In part, this is because moderates in our study are not much inclined to change their position. Compared with moderates, both weak and strong ideologues (left and right) are more likely to compromise, but the relationships are weak and do not approach statistical significance. Gun ownership, rural residence, and race (white versus nonwhite) are related in the expected direction, but, again, the coefficients do not reach significance. Better‐educated respondents are more likely to compromise than the less educated, and this relationship is significant, all else being equal. Likewise, gender does have a statistically significant independent relationship with willingness to compromise, as women more likely to compromise than similarly situated men. But—and here is the fundamental point—the inclusion of these controls in the equation does little to the relationship between partisanship and compromise. The difference we observe between partisans is either due to something else that we have not included in the equation, or it is connected to something in the perspective or principles that distinguishes partisans.         "
"52","Our second explanation for the partisan difference has to do with how partisans may differentially view compromise as an abandonment of principle; it is built upon the theories of negotiation and compromise discussed earlier. As we have noted, theorists argue that compromise is much more easily achieved in the domain of interests than in the domain of principles. Indeed, they observe that people seem willing to accede more when tangible, material things are at stake than when more abstract values and beliefs are the question. “By treating principles as interests,” write Gutmann and Thompson, “compromise seems to become easier, whereas treating interests as principles seems to make it harder.”33"
"53","What if we took this cue, rebranding compromise—indeed, forsaking the term altogether—and reframing a political process as an exchange? If not all that different in meaning, the two words do lead the mind in different directions. Consider the common usages of exchange. A shopper exchanges a piece of clothing at a department store for a different item. A traveler exchanges one currency for another. In each of these exchanges, there are two things at stake, one that is given up and another that is obtained. Exchange is thus a bimodal, transactional concept that involves interests. It is bimodal as each of the actors retain something distinctly theirs after the transaction is complete. The term compromise, however, at least in the context of politics, is a unimodal concept in that the two or more actors share the same outcome. In the context of reaching agreement on one issue, it has been poisoned as an abandonment of principle. And the word compromise has been particularly savaged by the conservative outrage media. Perhaps it is something about principles and interests that explains the partisan difference that we observe over and over.         "
"54","If we rework our exercise so that it captures responses to an exchange instead of a compromise, do we avoid the aversion to principle abandonment that Republicans seem to have in more quantity than Democrats? Does this even out the differences between partisans? We created another exercise to answer these questions, this one based upon attitudes toward immigration, a topic that evokes strong feelings and taps into principles that are deeply held by partisans. In this exercise, which works a little differently than the minimum wage exercise, we start by rooting the respondent at a principled position on immigration. Partisans receive two different but parallel questions. Democrats are asked the following:            "
"55","Democrats and Republicans in Washington are debating immigration reform. Do you believe that the federal government should be empowered to search for illegal immigrants and send them back to their country, or not?"
"56","The Republican version reads,            "
"57","Democrats and Republicans in Washington are debating immigration reform. Do you believe in a path for citizenship for children who come to this country illegally, or not?"
"58","Those who stick with the policy position associated with their party in this first question are then asked a follow‐up testing their willingness to give up this position “in exchange” for another policy. The two experimental paths are parallel, with Democrats asked this follow‐up:            "
"59","Suppose that you were the Democrat in Congress responsible for negotiating the resolution to the immigration problem. Would you be willing to empower the federal government to search for illegal immigrants and send them back to their country of origin [the position they have already rejected] in exchange for a path to citizenship for children who came to the country illegally?               "
"60","Republicans, on the other hand, are asked this version of the follow‐up:            "
"61","Suppose that you were the Republican in Congress responsible for negotiating the resolution to the immigration problem. Would you be willing to allow a path to citizenship for children who come to this country illegally [the position already rejected] in exchange for empowering the federal government to search for illegal immigrants and send them back to their country of origin?               "
"62","Responses to the original questions are not parallel. As shown in Table 4, while more than two‐thirds of Republicans reject a path to citizenship for immigrant children, fewer than one‐third of Democrats believe that the federal government should be constrained in rounding up and sending back illegal immigrants. The hostility of Pennsylvania Democrats to immigrants was somewhat unexpected here, though it presaged Trump's victory there in 2016. We followed up with those who took our expected position in the first question to try to pry them away from that position with the proposed exchange.         "
"63","The results are parallel to those in the minimum wage exercise. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to accept the “exchange” offered to them and much less likely to reject it. Republicans have more certainty in their initial response (81 percent of Democrats and 91 percent of Republicans have a response to the question), and they are much less in the mood to compromise, even if the compromise is characterized as an exchange. Our tenacious partisan difference appears to hold, as the two‐sided exchange elicits the same pattern of responses as in the exercise that activates a response to a unimodal compromise. Put another way, “win‐win” does not seem to win out as we attempt to explain a stubborn partisan difference."
"64","We make one final attempt to explain the partisan difference, and here the foundation of our hypothesis is prospect theory. We assert that prospect theory should apply to compromising situations, which inevitably involve individual assessments of loss and gain. The minimum wage scenario we presented to respondents offers an interesting and not atypical example. With Republicans defending the status quo and Democrats pushing for upward change in the wage, Republicans face the prospect of loss and Democrats the opportunity for gain in the survey exercise (and in reality). Applying Kahneman and Tversky's logic to such a situation, one would anticipate that Republicans should hold on to their position more tenaciously than Democrats. While this is not the logic of every public issue, it is the case for those issues—many issues—on which progressives challenge the status quo and conservatives seek to conserve it."
"65","If this is the case, and this explains the partisan difference in willingness to compromise, what if we replicate our first exercise but replace the minimum wage with an issue on which Republicans are pushing for change and Democrats are defending the established position? This is indeed what we have done, swapping out the minimum wage in the exercise for a proposal to cut the upper‐bracket federal income tax rate from 40 percent to 36 percent. This exercise mirrors the minimum wage exercise, both the iteration using open‐ended responses and the closed‐response iteration. The open‐ended question wording is as follows:            "
"66","Democrats and Republicans in Washington are debating the federal income tax rate for the wealthy. The top upper‐income tax rate is presently around 40 percent. The Democrats in Congress would like to keep it there. Republicans in Congress have proposed that the upper‐income tax rate be set at 36 percent. Ideally, where do you think the upper‐income tax rate should be set?"
"67","Once the respondent has established a position to this open ended question, we ask,            "
"68","Recalling that the range currently being debated is 36 to 40 percent, if you were the [Democrat/Republican] responsible for negotiating the income tax rate for the wealthy, where would you be willing to set that income tax rate?"
"69","The closed‐ended question wording for this exercise is also parallel to the minimum wage exercise, with the anchoring question offering five response categories (36, 37, 38, 39, 40) and the follow‐up allowing compromise to each intermediate tax rate between one's own preference and the rate preferred by the other side. Our expectation, derived from prospect theory, is that as the logic of the issue changes, so, too, should the partisan responses to that issue. The partisan difference we observe in the minimum wage exercise should reverse in this tax rate exercise, or at least disappear."
"70","This is in fact, the case. With income tax rates at stake, the difference between Democrats and Republicans in willingness to compromise essentially dissolves. In the open‐ended experiment, placed on the August survey, there is a modest difference between partisans with Republicans still less likely to compromise (see Table 5). But the difference we observe is miniscule and does not come near statistical significance. In the closed‐ended version of the experiment that offers response categories, conducted in September, we replicate the open‐ended findings almost exactly. Here, removing people who want to negotiate in the wrong direction from the analysis, Republicans are ever so slightly less likely to compromise than Democrats, but the difference is small and insignificant. The fact that the findings are not reversed, that the gain/loss logic of the situation does not lead Republicans to be more flexible than Democrats, providing a mirror image of the original findings, indicates that there is still something else about a Republican point of view that is more intransigent. It also may be that the tax rate reduction we stipulated in our exercise may not have been dramatic enough to evoke the full effect. Our 4 percentage point reduction is not that far from the one proposed by Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign (39.6 percent to 33 percent for the highest earners), but if we were to repeat this exercise, we would offer a more dramatic difference to better test our hypothesis. Nonetheless, given that this is really the first set of findings that defies the pattern that we see in our survey and others, we conclude that Kahneman and Tversky's insight applies here. At least some of the partisan difference we observe over and over again is due to the fact that Republicans are more often concerned about change—and loss—than Democrats. Their intransigence, their lower tolerance for compromise, is a natural response to the prospect of loss. The fact that Republicans are more likely to face loss than gain is what often differentiates partisans on scores of issues that are central to contemporary politics. It may be something more, a defensive stance, an aversion to societal change, that leads Republicans to resist compromise in a general way.         "
"71","The recent gridlock and hyperpartisanship in Congress have been broadly decried and endlessly analyzed. Attention often focuses on rebellious Republicans such as Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul, ideologues who have stymied the entire Congress with filibusters and other tactics designed to bring the legislative process to a standstill. Despite the criticism that has been heaped upon them, our research indicates that what these legislators are doing is in line with what many of their constituents want. The Republican base is made up of voters who are more likely to eschew compromise than the core voters of the other side. Through all our tests, there is never majority support for compromise by Republicans."
"72","We offer an explanation as to why this is the case. Republicans and conservatives are often defending or conserving the status quo, trying not to lose, just as progressives are pushing for change, and these orientations account for at least some of the differences that we and others observe over and over again. Given this difference in the mass public, it is little surprise that Republicans in Congress are less likely to seek or find middle ground. What critics see as intransigence, their supporters regard as responsiveness. We recognize that this orientation could change with a very assertive Republican administration pushing change and Democrats defending the progressive gains of the Obama years. The next several years will certainly provide a real‐world test of an important piece of our argument."
"73","Is there a path forward in which a more general spirit of compromise in public opinion may be nurtured? Conceivably. Most research studying ways to reduce partisanship, closed‐mindedness, and incivility has focused on small group experiments. Approaches such as group discussions, polling of those who have read distributed material, or online deliberation hold out promise, but proponents have not yet been able to scale up experiments so that they may be incorporated in large campaigns.34"
"74","The literature on compromise in the Congress has focused, of course, on negotiations among legislators. The ways scholars suggest that negotiators can “get to yes” overlooks how public opinion can deincentivize such procedures. As opposed to Congress, the public cannot, of course, negotiate with itself. It has no procedural pathways that increase the chances aggregate opinion will lead leaders to follow followers. The research reported here suggests that the most central axiom of negotiation theory—to turn disputes into win‐win situations—is difficult to apply when it comes to public opinion. Exchanges designed to get partisans to look past what they regard as the unsavoriness of compromise are not effective at winning more hearts, Democratic or Republican."
"75","What our research does show, by applying prospect theory for the first time to an understanding of political compromise, is that the best strategy for reaching compromise may be to avoid negotiated outcomes that generate a sense of loss by one or more parties. Perhaps it is possible to frame issues so that inveterate opponents to compromise see a tableau that is not centered on trading with the enemy but instead leads them to believe that they are protecting what is good and right. Given the greater intransigence by Republican identifiers, designing policy proposals so that they offer a way of working to protect the status quo could be key. This is no small challenge, of course, as bringing about change is a primary motivation for legislators, and it is difficult to camouflage change under the guise of protecting the status quo. Still, there may be cases, such as extending the George W. Bush tax cuts but incorporating reforms in such legislation or enacting anti‐racial‐profiling laws by highlighting long‐cherished libertarian and race‐blind principles.         "
"76","In the near term, there are many obstacles to moving past the opposition to compromise. The outrage industry, with its large following among those politically engaged, is not going to start supporting compromises. The vilification of opponents is at the very foundation of the business model of how to attract audiences (and, thus, advertisers). Our structure of party primaries, invariably low in turnout, favors candidates who promote themselves as ideologues, vehemently committed to not bending principles or bowing to pragmatism. Finally, there is no penalty for voters to be inconsistent, saying they support compromise but then opposing compromises that are proposed in Washington over specific issues."
"77","We hope that future researchers will build on our findings to further understanding of prospect theory and legislative policymaking. The wide variety of significant legislation before Congress and state legislatures, each incorporating a wide range of policies, provide ample laboratories for such research. Perhaps scholars can identify ways that lead to more cooperation and conciliation in our acrimonious political system.*"
