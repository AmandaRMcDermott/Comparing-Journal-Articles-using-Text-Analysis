"1","Because the U.S. Constitution's text has proved so difficult to amend, its meaning has often changed through judicial interpretation. Generations of political scientists have understood constitutional development as shifts in U.S. Supreme Court doctrine. In the past two to three decades, however, scholars have begun to emphasize the role of presidents, parties, and political reformers in making constitutional meaning, and all of this constitutional meaning making outside the courts has been dubbed “popular constitutionalism.” Elizabeth Beaumont's engaging new book, The Civic Constitution: Civic Visions and Struggles in the Path toward Constitutional Democracy, is an important contribution to this literature.         "
"2","Beaumont focuses primarily on the creation of new constitutional texts, rather than interpretations, and calls our attention to the way that the members of the formal institutions that drafted these texts were responding to pressures from those outside. Beaumont's conception of “civic constitutionalism” involves ordinary people who advance a welter of constitutional arguments challenging and often reshaping the existing conceptions of fundamental law (p. 4). Beaumont convincingly demonstrates that popular constitutional arguments were not a mere backdrop to the real task of writing and amending the U.S. Constitution but that these arguments “helped to initiate and authorize major textual provisions that define the fundamental rights and membership of constitutional democracy” (p. 216). Although penned by members of formal institutions (the Philadelphia Convention and then the Congress), Beaumont argues that the Constitution of 1787 and several of its most significant amendments were responses to the popular arguments that she documents. Thus, these arguments were not merely backdrops to the activities of elite officeholders but served as fuel (p. 123) and “civic scaffolding” (p. 156) for their work. By shaping and reforming the broader constitutional culture, these popular arguments created the senses of (in) justice or possibility on which elite efforts depended."
"3","Through her emphasis on the Constitution's “civic founders,” Beaumont seeks to move constitutional scholarship beyond the idea that “the founders” were a small group of elite white men who gathered in Philadelphia in the eighteenth century. Instead, she insists that the Constitution has had multiple founders, and even multiple foundings, as Americans have shaped and reshaped the reigning conceptions of liberty, equality, and justice (pp. 218–219). The book is organized around this idea of multiple foundings. Part I describes the eighteenth‐century founding, focusing, in Chapter 2, on the popular ideas that drove the Declaration of Independence and the writing of state constitutions. Chapter 3 describes the antislavery activist, Shaysite, and antifederalist arguments that shaped the U.S. Constitution. The second part of the book is devoted to struggles to refound the Constitution. Chapter 4 examines the influence of abolitionists and antislavery constitutionalism on national reconstruction, and Chapter 5 describes the conceptual work of suffragists as they developed public notions of “gender justice constitutionalism.”"
"4","The Civic Constitution is not just an exploration of popular constitutional ideas and their impact but also a normative defense of their central place in American constitutional development. The idea of popular constitutionalism has sometimes conjured the fear of constitutional meaning made through unbridled majoritarianism or even mob rule. Yet Beaumont emphasizes the sophisticated and principled character of popular constitutional arguments. She also defines popular constitutionalism as necessarily nonviolent (p. 21) and argues that antisuffragists and the proponents of Jim Crow should not be considered civic founders, as they did not “initiate new texts or offer more robust ideals of free and equal citizenship” (p. 223). This definition of popular constitutionalism may prevent Beaumont from grappling with the idea that the contents of civic constitutionalism might be normatively unappealing.         "
"5","One thing that makes The Civic Constitution particularly exciting is the achievement of studying this extremely diffuse form of popular constitutionalism. While more elite discourse is relatively accessible, in the Congressional Record, for instance, or in presidential speeches, it can be far harder to locate the constitutional arguments of those outside formal institutions or pressure groups. Yet Beaumont does an impressive job, weaving together newspaper articles, political pamphlets, popular songs, sermons, and petitions to identify the contents of civic constitutionalism. The result makes for a convincing argument and an exciting read.         "
