"1","In today's divided political environment, even the most unengaged citizen is typically aware that Democrats and Republicans are on different sides of most issues. In their book Asymmetric Politics, Matt Grossman and David A. Hopkins show that the differences between the two parties run much deeper than just policy stances. Drawing on a wealth of evidence, the authors argue that polarization is not so much the result of the two parties moving away from the same ideological center point, but rather it is the product of the two parties responding to their distinct types of constituencies. According to the authors, the Democratic Party is a coalition of social groups with specific policy preferences, while the Republican Party is composed of individuals drawn to the conservative ideological movement. This fundamental asymmetry leads to vastly different approaches to “debating public issues, campaigning for votes, and pursuing policy change in government” (p. 14).         "
"2","Whereas many works focus on just one facet of partisanship, Grossman and Hopkins opt for a more holistic approach. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 illustrate asymmetries in mass public opinion, party organizations, and information networks, respectively. Chapters 5 and 6 go on to explore the how these asymmetries impact campaigning and policymaking. This broad scope requires the authors to forgo more rigorous statistical tests, and much of the data presented are not novel. However, the authors do an excellent job of synthesizing these prior findings and presenting them from their unique perspective. Moreover, the authors augment these descriptive statistics with illustrative examples, clearly connecting theory to the actual practice of politics. In total, Asymmetric Politics successfully paints a comprehensive and accessible portrait of contemporary party politics.         "
"3","Beyond recasting discussion of American political parties, Asymmetric Politics also holds critical implications for students of public opinion and mass behavior. The evidence in Chapter 2 shows that citizens do perceive asymmetries in the party reputations. But it also shows that regardless of party, their preferences are remarkably similar. That is, “the public mostly agrees with Republicans in philosophical terms but with Democrats in policy terms” (p. 67). With this in mind (and as the authors note), differences in party platforms and rhetoric should not be surprising, as each party should logically play to its relative advantage. Rather, the bigger questions seem to be about what pushes citizens to choose to prioritize philosophy or policy in the first place. Grossman and Hopkins imply that it may be identity or group politics at play, but their focus is more on the consequences of this divide, not the causes. Thus, while the authors conclude that “building a stronger democracy requires acknowledging—or, even better, resolving—the contradictions in our own collective political mind” (p. 332), it seems that an important first step would be gaining a better understanding of the origins of those contradictions. Wherever such a line of future inquiry leads, Asymmetric Politics should prove to be a valuable step forward.         "
