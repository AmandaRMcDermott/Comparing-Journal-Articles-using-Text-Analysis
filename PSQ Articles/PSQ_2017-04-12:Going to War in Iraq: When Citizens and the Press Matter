"1","In times of foreign crises, how does a largely inattentive public make sense of arguments from political leaders about the need for military action? What role does an active and critical press play in informing the public and helping citizens decide whether a country should go to war? A great deal of research in the post–September 11 era has criticized the media's performance during this time as more lapdog than watchdog of government. In an in‐depth analysis of American public opinion and media coverage during the lead‐up to the Iraq War, Stanley Feldman, Leonie Huddy, and George E. Marcus challenge the assertion that the press as a whole failed to provide various perspectives on whether the United States should go to war. Their analysis of news coverage in the fall of 2002 contests this conventional wisdom by demonstrating that voices critical of the war effort were present in the media and available for skeptical citizens, but these voices were much more likely to appear in newspapers rather than on television news. Even as early as fall 2002, citizens aware of this more critical news and motivated to deliberate on its meaning were more opposed to the war than their counterparts not exposed to newspapers."
"2","One contribution of this book is to bring the perspective of dual process models to theorize about which citizens, in this time period, would be able to rely on heuristics and which citizens would find the decision over war more difficult and therefore need to seek and scrutinize information more fully. For Republicans, a prowar Republican president and a united Republican party made the decision to support war easier than for Democrats, whose political leadership was more splintered on the issue and who therefore needed to seek additional information."
"3","To track Americans’ support for the Iraq war and their media consumption, Feldman, Huddy, and Marcus utilize an original national panel survey, the Threat and National Security Survey, a three‐wave study fielded from 2001 to 2003. The authors supplement the survey data with an in‐depth content analysis of television and newspaper coverage of two major justifications for war made by the George W. Bush administration: ties between Iraq and al Qaeda and Iraq's alleged attempts to procure aluminum tubes to use in nuclear weapons. While television coverage and elite newspaper coverage focused heavily on the perspective of the prowar presidential administration, the content analysis reveals that coverage of these claims from nonelite newspapers, such as those owned by Knight Ridder, was more skeptical. In part because of less access to official sources, these nonelite newspapers provided more information for uncertain citizens to use in forming their own opinions about whether the United States should topple Saddam Hussein. In this environment, more motivated Democrats (and independents) were able to find credible information questioning the need for war from these nonelite newspapers and, in turn, had lower levels of support prior to the onset of the war."
"4","While part of the news media abetted the Bush administration in selling the war in Iraq and convinced the American public to line up behind the war, Going to War also shows the power of the news to help citizens deliberate about policy and adopt policies in line with their own values.
