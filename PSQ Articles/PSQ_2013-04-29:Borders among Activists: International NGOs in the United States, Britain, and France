"1","This clearly organized, well‐researched book argues an interesting point. Contrary to the arguments of many scholars that international non‐governmental organizations (INGOs) are increasingly converging around more‐common norms and procedures, Sarah Stroup asserts that national differences matter. Both humanitarian organizations (development and relief‐oriented) and human rights organizations are rooted in different national characteristics. This despite the fact that their most‐important leaders are drawn from persons Sidney Tarrow called “rooted cosmopolitans” (Sidney Tarrow, The New Transnational Activism, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005). While INGOs based in the United States are characterized by “efficiency,” those headquartered in Great Britain are marked by “process,” while those in France manifest “protest” as a major value.         "
"2","From its title on, Borders among Activists provides a useful reconsideration of Margaret Keck and Kathryn Sikkink's widely cited Activists Beyond Borders (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1998). Drawing upon INGOs based in these countries, Stroup examines three humanitarian relief and three human rights in depth. They are supplemented by abbreviated analyses of nine “outposts” (branches of INGOs headquartered in other countries), and 11 “mini‐cases” (based in the three subject states). Her “sociological institutionalism” approach provides a refreshing perspective on generally well‐known organizations. The well‐known humanitarian INGOs include CARE‐USA, OXFAM‐GB, and MSF‐France; for human rights, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and FIDH (Fédération Internationale des ligues des Droits de l'Homme). Amnesty and Oxfam have spawned “outposts,” included with others in Borders among Activists. Stroup's conclusions based on these “outpost” and “primary cases” are then compared with other humanitarian/development or human rights INGOs based in the selected countries, such as World Vision, Human Rights First, Christian Aid, Article 19, Action contre la Faim, or Reporters sans frontières.         "
"3","This wide variety of cases leads to interesting comparisons. These are facilitated by Stroup's framework. Four variables shape her analysis: regulatory environments, political opportunities, material resources, and social networks. Contrasts among her selected countries highlight the importance for individual organizations. In the United States, for example, INGOs as private charitable enterprises have benefited from protection from the state for nearly 200 years. These are buttressed by significant tax deductions, but limited by significant political restrictions. America's fragmented political structure “creates incentives for charities to focus on incremental policy change achieved through personal interaction with policymakers” (p. 35)."
"4","What might the author have added, to make Borders among Activists even more appealing and/or comprehensive? First, she could have given attention to more‐explicitly “political” civil society groups. Although these entities are based within individual countries, they act globally, often in concert with government agencies. Examples include the major German Stiftungen (e.g., the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, linked to the Christian Democratic Union, or the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, affiliated with the Social Democratic Party). In the United States, the National Democratic Institute and the National Republican Institute occupy an ambiguous ground between overt projection of American democratic ideals and less‐controversial (at least in some quarters) electoral assistance. (Forthcoming work by Sarah Bush should be interesting in this area.) Secondly, a follow‐up volume might examine other donor countries with humanitarian organizations and/or human rights NGOs. Obvious examples include Canada (CIDA, the Canadian International Development Agency), Sweden (SIDA, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency), or Germany (Bread for the World, national branch). Japan ranks as the world's fourth‐largest donor of humanitarian aid, while Germany stands as the sixth (http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/country‐profiles, consulted 10 July 2012).         "
"5","On the whole, Stroup has made an interesting contribution whose framework scholars should incorporate into their own studies."
