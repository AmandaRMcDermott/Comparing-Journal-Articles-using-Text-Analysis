"1","What do we owe people in other countries? For instance, suppose that you work at the Treasury. Your policy proposals will affect not only the interests of U.S. citizens, but also those of people around the globe. To what extent should you consider the latter? In one view, there is a large asymmetry between the interests of U.S. citizens and others. As a matter of charity, we should do something for foreigners who live in severe poverty, but beyond that, the interests of U.S. citizens take strict priority. In another view, the interests of foreigners must be counted equally with the interests of domestic citizens."
"2","With a little simplification (and setting aside his technical terms), these are the perspectives that Mathias Risse is responding to. His project is to set out a middle way between them. Citizens have some special rights against their own states, he claims, but there are also obligations of justice to foreigners, which go beyond mere charity. This middle way has been popular in political philosophy for at least a few years. The hard problem is to fill in the details about what exactly we owe to foreigners beyond charity and why. A popular thought is that we owe them more because in a globalized world, we share complicated economic, legal, and cultural ties to people around the world. Joshua Cohen and Charles Sable, (“Extra Rempublicam Nulla Justitia?” Philosophy & Public Affairs 34 (March 2006): 147–175) for instance, have suggested that obligations are generated by the existence of cross‐border institutions, cooperation, and interdependence.         "
"3","Risse attempts to offer a new theory of these grounds, or bases, of our obligations to outsiders. He proposes several, including our sheer common humanity, the existence of shared international structures, and our common ownership of the Earth. According to the first claim, we have some obligations of justice to people everywhere simply because they are human and thus have certain distinctive needs, capacities, and so on. According to the second, cooperative arrangements, such as international trade, generate obligations to ensure that people receive an appropriate share of their benefits. These are both quite familiar suggestions, and Risse provides a very thorough discussion of the literature."
"4","The most‐distinctive part of Risse's approach is the third idea: that significant obligations are generated by the fact—he thinks it a fact—of our shared ownership of the Earth. Risse gives a particular spin on what this ownership amounts to: “Common Ownership.” Very briefly, he thinks it means that we each have a right to that portion of the Earth's natural resources that we need to satisfy our basic needs. Why think that we own the Earth collectively and, especially, that our ownership amounts to these particular rights? Risse's argument turns substantially on the claim that basic needs have great moral significance. This raises the question whether it is really useful to think in terms of shared ownership at all: why not just refer directly to the importance of basic needs and the obligations they generate? Risse goes on to use the shared ownership idea to give an interesting account of some practical issues, including moral questions about climate change and, perhaps most surprisingly, human rights."
"5","Later in the book, Risse turns to some related topics, including whether we should prefer a world without multiple nation‐states altogether and with accountability in international institutions. The book deploys a lot of technical jargon and involves ideas, such as shared ownership of the Earth, which may seem quite distant from some of the practical topics, such as labor rights. But it addresses questions of great importance and offers an original and challenging perspective on how to approach them."
