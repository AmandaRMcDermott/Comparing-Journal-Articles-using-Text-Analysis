"1","Genocide studies do not make for fun reading. Scott Straus's latest book might not violate this rule, but it bends it. This is an exciting, erudite, thought‐provoking, and highly readable book. It engages with the highest levels of scholarship on genocide and African politics while remaining largely accessible to general readers, and it offers a new comparative theory of genocide that is both illuminating and intuitively appealing."
"2","Straus's premises are simple. He focuses only on African countries so as to avoid the excessive variance in cases that typically makes inference difficult in genocide studies (so much is different between, say, the Armenian, Cambodian, and Rwandan genocides as to make it hard to pinpoint causal mechanisms). And he looks at both cases of genocide (Rwanda and Sudan's Darfur) and of nongenocidal violence (Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal's Casamance) to tease out the factors that lead to both escalation and restraint."
"3","Chapters 1–3 build up his theory, where both context and agency matter. Whether genocide occurs or not, Straus writes, depends on both the extent of the security threat faced by a regime and the ideological interpretation of this threat. In countries that have a “founding narrative” in which one group has privileged access to or ownership of the state and another group, seen as second‐class citizens, poses a grave danger to the regime, genocide of the latter is more likely. The insecurity of the regime is necessary but not sufficient. What matters, in fine, is the elite‐produced ideological framing of the conflict, which derives from each country's founding narrative. Narratives that stress the diversity of the nation and are not identity based act as a restraint to the development of genocidal will."
"4","Armed with his theory (the depth of which I do not do justice to), Straus goes on to show how the narrative of Arab‐Islamic ownership of Sudan favored the (quasi‐) genocidal treatment of the south and Darfur by the Khartoum regime (Chapter 8) and how the “social revolution” of the late 1950s to early 1960s redefined Rwanda as a state belonging to a majority Hutu under the historical yoke of an illegitimate Tutsi minority (Chapter 9, in which Straus, a top Rwanda expert, is at his best). In contrast, the dialogue‐infused and diversity‐based national identities developed by Félix Houphouët‐Boigny, Alpha Oumar Konaré, and Léopold Senghor in Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal, respectively, left their conflicts short of genocidal violence, even when counternarratives such as the anti‐Muslim and anti‐northerner ivoirité discourse of the 1990s shook their foundations to their core (Chapters 5–7).         "
"5","While the overall effect is enlightening, the book falls just short of compelling. It is not so much that it is a bit repetitive in parts or that Chapter 4, a quantitative treatment of mass categorical violence in Africa, fits oddly with the rest. Rather, it is the core argument about founding narratives that is both appealing and vexing. First, founding narratives are hard to falsify, and the selection Straus makes of them can seem ad hoc. In Mali, for example, why credit Konaré, who was president in the 1990s, but not Modibo Keïta, who held the office in the 1960s, had a more restrictive notion of Mali, and launched the first state assault against the Tuareg in 1963? Second, aside from a cursory consideration in the book's closing pages, Straus treats founding narratives as largely exogenous. Yet the decision to frame the nation in diversity or exclusionary terms likely derives in part from its precolonial and colonial history and from the structural raw material at the disposition of rulers. A more endogenous discussion of these narratives, without denying the agency of leaders, might provide a compelling follow‐up to this outstanding book."
