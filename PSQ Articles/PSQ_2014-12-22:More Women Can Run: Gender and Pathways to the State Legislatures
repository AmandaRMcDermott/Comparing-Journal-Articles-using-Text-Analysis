"1","Why are there so few women in legislative office in the United States? Recognizing that electoral politics in the United States is “far from gender‐neutral territory” (p. 61), Susan J. Carroll and Kira Sanbonmatsu engage this question by considering major changes in women's election to state legislative office, where women's representation continues to be low, and is declining in the new millennium, with women's legislative numbers driven primarily by the success of Democratic women. At the state legislative level, Republican women are being closed out of office, even where the Republican Party has been increasingly successful overall. Why are men so over‐represented in state legislatures? Why is women's representation declining? Why have Republican women been increasingly less successful in winning election to state legislative office than have their Democratic sisters?"
"2","Carroll and Sanbonmatsu bring an explicitly gendered approach to these questions, treating men's political experience and candidacy as factors for analysis, rather than as the universal path to legislative office, and consider “women on their own terms” (p. 11) to explore additional gendered pathways. More Women Can Run contributes to the research on women's candidacies by explicitly gendering the analysis, incorporating party as a major explanatory variable, and recasting the decision to run for office as contextually determined rather than an autonomous individual choice. Engaging the ambition scholarship, which emphasizes individual psychological factors that precede the decision to run for office, Carroll and Sanbonmatsu argue that “ambition and candidacy may arise simultaneously” (p. 44). They shift the focus to recruitment and political opportunity, testing a “relationally embedded decision” model of commitments to family and significant others in shaping the decision to run. The authors do not claim “that there is a ‘male’ or ‘female’ way of making the decision to seek office” but rather “advance an alternative view of candidacy that may more often characterize women's decision‐making process than men's” (p. 44).         "
"3","Carroll and Sanbonmatsu analyze the “distinctly partisan character to the recent lack of overall growth in numbers of women at the state legislative level” (p. 65). The decline in Republican women's presence in state legislatures has not been the result of Republican electoral defeat overall; to the contrary, male Republican candidates have fared well in the past decade in winning state legislative seats. This decline cannot be explained by changes in women's partisanship, a shrinking eligibility pool, gendered ideological differences within the Party, or even by the Republican regional strength in more‐conservative Southern states. The major difference lies in the parties' recruitment of female candidates. Recruitment was more likely to shape women's candidacy decisions than men's, recruitment by party leaders being crucial, with Republicans less likely to recruit women than are Democrats."
"4","Democratic women, however, are still under‐represented compared to their Democratic brethren. They are more likely than are their Republican sisters to be women of color (a third of all Democratic female state legislators, a record high), on the ideological left, and motivated by substantial public policy commitments. Disproportionately elected from majority‐minority districts, Democratic women of color face additional constraints. The number of majority‐minority districts is limited, and women of color are less likely to be recruited by Party elites, more likely to have been discouraged by them from running for office, and more likely to face challengers in primaries."
"5","More Women Can Run concludes with a sophisticated discussion of the impact of women's descriptive representation upon substantive policy representation and with serious challenges to common beliefs about women's candidacies and their chances for election. It is recommended as a text in courses on political parties and elections, state politics, women and politics, and women's and gender studies.         "
