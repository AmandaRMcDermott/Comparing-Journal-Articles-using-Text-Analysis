"1","Samuel Kernell once observed that a changed political environment encouraged presidents to eschew bargaining with Congress in favor of appealing directly to the American people to generate legislative support for their policy agendas. But instead of identifying a static and permanent form of presidential leadership, Kernell observed only one stage in the evolution of presidential communication strategies. In The Presidential Roadshow, Diane J. Heith extends the premise of Going Public, but analyzes significant changes to the public presidency that have occurred since the golden age of presidential television.         "
"2","Heith views increasingly partisan presidential campaigns and the fragmentation of news media as the stimuli behind changed communications tactics. Just as the former encourages candidates to campaign predominantly in battleground states, the latter, having reduced the payoff of delivering national addresses, incentivizes presidential travel to local communities. The president's communications strategy is then tied to his margin of victory in the electoral college, with large margins allowing presidents to appeal to single audiences using national rhetoric. Narrow victories force presidents to petition multiple audiences through more‐partisan and targeted rhetoric (chapter 1)."
"3","The book tests this argument on the presidencies of Bill Clinton (chapter 3), George W. Bush (chapter 4), and Barack Obama (chapter 5). Heith observes that with his narrow electoral victory in a fragmented media environment, Bush traveled more frequently in his first 3 years than either Clinton or Obama had. She also shows that fragmented media are more important than is margin of victory in explaining the audience of presidential speeches, inasmuch as both Bush (narrow victory) and Obama (large victory) targeted local, partisan audiences in a fragmented media environment. This contrasts with Clinton's national approach to leadership in a narrow media environment. Heith's textual analysis reveals a progression in presidential rhetoric, too, culminating in Barack Obama's divergence from the classic going public strategy, “which requires a president to speak during legislative activity on his agenda, fix his position, disparage Congress, and ask the public to pressure Congress” (p. 99). To be sure, the presidential roadshow has changed as the president's audience and the means to reach it have diversified."
"4","Beyond her detailed descriptive analysis, Heith explores whether the tendency for presidents to travel frequently translates into higher public and legislative support. Although going local does not improve the president's state‐wide approval ratings, visits appear to benefit the president in Congress, at least on a few select roll‐call votes (chapter 6). The appearance of a relationship is not to be misconstrued as causation, however. It is certainly possible, and even likely, that legislators voted with the president irrespective of his visits. For example, bipartisan support for No Child Left Behind probably resulted from a shared commitment to education reform, rather than the president's travels, especially in light of Bush's utter failure to generate a legislative victory through his sweeping social security reform tour."
"5","Despite this limitation, Heith offers a compelling explanation of presidential travel. What is more, she concludes her work with an important and possibly controversial prediction that the rise of new media technology will decrease future presidential travel (chapter 8). This observation contrasts with Brendan Doherty's research, which ties the rise of the president's permanent campaign to the inability of the campaign finance system to rein in spending and reduce the reelection incentive presidents have to travel frequently. Inasmuch as this is likely to generate debate not only among scholars, but also among graduate and undergraduate students for whom this book is accessible and engaging, we may eventually learn whether changes in media technology are indeed the driving force behind the strategic communications decisions of contemporary presidents."
