"1","If you are a novice to the area of money in politics, Capitalism v. Democracy: Money in Politics and the Free Market Constitution helps illuminate how the U.S. Supreme Court has arrived at a point that its money in politics decisions are roundly rejected by 70 percent to 90 percent of the American public.         "
"2","Timothy K. Kuhner argues that economics and politics in America need to be two separate spheres for fear that money in politics can wreck both endeavors: skewing politics to overvalue the wealthy and skewing economics to overvalue the politically connected. With these conclusions I could not agree more."
"3","As Kuhner observes, the Supreme Court in its campaign finance cases is oddly becoming one of the last bastions clinging to laissez‐faire economics at a historical moment when economists are backing away from the ideology. As Kuhner puts it, “It would be ironic if the ideology that Greenspan recently repudiated—a conceptual framework that assumes a perfect market and resists government efforts to ensure fair play—were discredited within economics but thriving within constitutional law” (p. 31)."
"4","Kuhner has assembled some gems of quotes to tell this tale. To answer the perennial question of what the Founding Fathers would think of the market taking over the democratic process, he has many choice quotes from Thomas Jefferson, including, “I wish never to see all offices transferred to Washington, where, further withdrawn from the eyes of the people, they may more secretly be bought and sold as a market” (p. 7). Or, to describe the role of money in politics in modern elections, Kuhner draws on Rahm Emanuel: “The first third of your campaign is money, money, money. The second third is money, money and press. And the last third is votes, press and money” (p. 210)."
"5","Yet much of the book appears to be Kuhner's labored attempt to smash the Supreme Court's decisional square pegs into various philosophical round holes (ranging from John Rawls to Ayn Rand) and then coming to the unsurprising conclusion that they do not fit."
"6","The arc of the legal story he tells is one that has been canvassed before in law reviews, campaign finance treatises, and amicus briefs. The basic story is that most of the contradictions in modern campaign finance law are traceable to Buckley v. Valeo's own inconsistencies and that the money in politics problem was made worse by giving corporations more political power in the Bellotti decision in 1978 and Citizens United in 2010. Campaign finance lawyers already know that the Supreme Court gave away most of the marbles when it came dangerously close to equating money with speech in Buckley, and it has been all downhill from there. If I were not a campaign finance lawyer, I might have enjoyed Capitalism v. Democracy more.         "
"7","The most interesting observation in Capitalism v. Democracy is that the Supreme Court has been bungling its economic analysis at the very time it has been empowering big money in elections. Here is where the piece covers the most original ground. But this book would have benefited from incorporating empirical economic observations from other scholars to bolster this argument. Whether it is the legal work of Lucian Bebchuk and Robert J. Jackson, Jr., the empirical work of John C. Coates IV or Rajesh K. Aggarwal, or even the practical insights of the legislator‐scholar Jamie Raskin, there are big bodies of work that would help make the case that are simply absent from this account. Tackling both capitalism and democracy in a single tome is ambitious, and others will surely build on Kuhner's keen observations.         "
