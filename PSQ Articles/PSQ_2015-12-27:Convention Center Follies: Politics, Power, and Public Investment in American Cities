"1","This book presents an important story about misguided local and state expenditures for new or expanded convention centers. It is a bigger story than the more widely known success of fabulously wealthy professional sports teams in persuading strapped local governments to build new stadiums. It is bigger because the number of U.S. local governments involved and the dollars spent dwarf what I would call the stadium scam. In the second half of the twentieth century, cities, counties, and states engaged in a race for bigger and better convention centers lest they lose out to competitors. In an arms race, there are no winners. But here there are winners, namely, some landlords and consultants."
"2","Here in a nutshell is the sad story laid out in this book: With the end of the Great Depression of the 1930s and then World War II, American cities sought to upgrade the built environment. Alarmed by massive shift to the suburbs and growing slums in or near central business districts, mayors acted to preserve and protect the center. In this, they were unfortunately aided and abetted by federal urban renewal dollars. Traditional local government infrastructure spending was funded by general obligation bonds (the issuer must pay from any revenue source). But the issuance of such bonds required voter approval, which became more difficult to win after Proposition 13 in California announced a war on local government taxes throughout the nation. Voters, more often than not, defeated proposals to build or expand convention centers. But the edifice complex of mayors and governors was not so easily defeated. Revenue bonds, where the income to pay interest and principal is earmarked, became widely used and did not require voter approval. Authorities, legally separate from municipal governments and having their own revenue streams, built and managed convention centers."
"3","Once voter approval was avoided, the frenzy to build and expand was on. The fervor of local politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens was whipped up by national consulting firms. Often the local newspaper chimed in favorably on the topic of building or expanding convention centers. Yet the evidence supporting convention center expansion was mostly cooked up by the consultants. No jaundiced eyes in local or state government were cast upon the glowing reports of economic benefits. The benefits expected to flow from expanded or new convention centers were local jobs, increased hotel occupancy, restaurant and retail sales, and, of course, local tax revenues from nonresidents—any mayor's favorite tax because those who pay it cannot vote."
"4","The consultants and their municipal clients were obviously fervent believers in Say's law: “supply creates its own demand,” or, in this case, “build it and they will come.” The author's sobering data says in many ways that supply greatly outstripped demand for conventions and trade shows. Peak attendance was back in 1998 and 1999. The Great Recession pushed attendance down. Yet the consultants continue to peddle their snake oil. Part of their strategy is stoking fear that the city will fall behind, overshadowed by rivals. Reading Sanders's book, I was reminded of The Music Man, in which a con man bilks a town by persuading residents that they must have a marching band.         "
"5","The one drawback of this book is the lack of any tables to summarize key variables over time, namely, attendees, convention space rented, convention space available, and average prices for renting space. Those are the main measures of national supply and demand for the convention center industry."
