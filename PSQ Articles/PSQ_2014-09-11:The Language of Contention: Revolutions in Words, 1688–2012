"1","In Marxism and the Philosophy of Language, Valentin Volosinov (1973) posits that the generic conventions of reporting others' speech vary over time and place, and that these variations, if tracked, can reveal a great deal about changes in the ordering of social hierarchies. Sidney Tarrow's The Language of Contention, following Volosinov and his better‐known collaborator and mentor, Mikhail Bakhtin, argues that language—and in particular, keywords of social protest—are also indices of social change. Tarrow explicitly argues that “the symbols, mentalities, and narratives that actors employ can track real‐world changes in contentious politics” and “as new words for contention diffuse across social and territorial boundaries to new actors, such words can tell us how meanings change as the same words are used by different actors” (p. 5). Thus, Tarrow takes on Volosinov and Bakhtin's historical and “dialogical” view of language, seeing it as situated, multivocal, and changing, pulled variously by “centripetal” and “centrifugal” forces of structured social interaction. Tarrow sees language as being variously stable and volatile, according to whether given words “symbolically resonate” with other words and meanings, and whether they are “strategically modular” in that they can travel across contexts and retain at least some of their strategic power for those who speak them.         "
"2","The book, by Tarrow's own account, was nearly a quarter‐century in the making, prompted in part by social and linguistic changes at the heart of social science inquiry about protest. Though he had initial reservations about the “cultural turn” and the focus on “meaning” in social movements among his often‐younger academic colleagues, Tarrow also began to reflect that over his entire 50‐year career, he had encountered troubling changes of meaning—sometimes seeming more objective, sometimes more subjective—at the heart of his own inquiries and had simply deferred dealing with them. His current effort to redress this is, by turns, insightful, intellectually capacious, cleverly synthetic, occasionally frustrating, and inspiring. It is, in other words, the result of an ongoing and generous dialogue, and worth the wait."
"3","The turn toward dialogic analysis is less a significant departure for Tarrow than a rearticulation of themes already nascent in the “dynamics of contention” or DOC program he presented with Doug McAdam and Charles Tilly more than a decade ago (McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly 2001; Tarrow and Tilly 2007). It is also consistent with Tilly's later work, which bears the stamp of Marc W. Steinberg's work (for example, 1999), which is, in turn, probably most responsible for bringing an awareness of Bakhtin to social movement scholars. At the same time, Tarrow's approach is more schematic than Bakhtin's. As will be familiar to readers of Tarrow and Tilly, the two‐by‐two table makes a strong appearance here; indeed, Tarrow builds most of the book around a particularly useful one."
"4","Tarrow wants to identify those words that endure in their usage and meanings, reflecting and recording “critical junctures” of contention and contributing to them, and yet change their meanings and move in time and place. Words like “working class,” “strike,” “boycott,” “birth control,” “male chauvinist,” “black,” “rights,” and “citizen” all present, with some variation, in the “high endurance” quadrant of a field structured by continuums of symbolic resonance and strategic modularity. Other words and terms fare less well, but this does not necessarily diminish their importance in specific times and places. As in the DOC program, Tarrow is interested in identifying interactive causal mechanisms that push words around the field during their “critical junctures,” which may last from days to decades."
"5","The frustrations come, when they do, mainly because any of the examples Tarrow uses in his book could merit their own books. Inevitably, the treatment of the keywords and the actions that support them can occasionally come off as thin, repetitive, or one‐sided. For example, amid an otherwise wonderfully rendered account of Margaret Sanger and the fortunes of the term “birth control” in his “Gender Words” chapter (pp. 119–121), Tarrow writes that the “term birth control did not fit with the new rights‐based discourse in the 1960s and 1970s” when even the graph he uses to bolster his point shows that the use of the term increased, albeit at a slower rate, with the term, “family planning,” which, he suggests, was compatible with rights‐based language. In neither case, however, does he suggest why one was compatible and the other not. These sorts of niggling problems recur throughout and are an effect of Tarrow's ambition to cover a great deal of territory. The approach Tarrow takes also rarely fully situates language at multiple levels of abstraction; we rarely get a sense of the dilemmas of language use in concrete situations, especially as the changes in meaning for which Tarrow accounts take place. And while Tarrow occasionally discusses the importance and strategic uses of ambiguity (for example, p. 80), he gives too little attention to the relationship between ambiguity and multivocality. I suspect that doing so would have allowed him to probe, as well, the potential trade‐offs between symbolic resonance and strategic modularity. Never is it clear that these dimensions are fully orthogonal.         "
"6","A final quibble is that Tarrow does not engage the scholarship on “measuring meaning” in the sociological literature. Some of this, such as in the work of Roberto Franzosi, John Mohr, and Ann Mische, among others, is theoretically compatible with his perspective. While it is true that we do “not have clear indicators that can measure” strategic modularity and symbolic resonance, “or their underlying mechanisms with any precision” (p. 18), drawing on these authors' application of network‐analytic techniques to join actors, words, and settings might have added to Tarrow's exposition of strategies for understanding the rise and fall of languages of contention."
"7","But these are relatively small objections to an impressive and ambitious project. Tarrow's book takes in an enormous range of words—about race, class, gender, emotion, revolution, nationalism, and citizenship—and presents a compelling perspective on how to understand their power in movement. Moreover, Tarrow's book presents us with a model of academic engagement suitable for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and his colleagues. He writes, “There is something wrong if a scholar reaches the beginning of his eighth decade and hasn't learned more from his students than they have learned from him” (p. xviii). There is something right when a scholar reaches that point and still goes back to problems that vexed him as a young graduate student. Undaunted, Tarrow sets the bar quite high for himself, since we continue to learn a great deal from him.         "
