"1","The authors of this new book bravely attempt to clear a path through the political thicket of legislative redistricting. Redistricting, an incredibly complicated and controversial process, is a topic of significant interest to both political scientists and legal scholars."
"2","The strongest chapters of this book document the extent of partisan gerrymandering in the United States and explain why gerrymandering biases political representation (largely in favor of the Republican Party). The book features state‐by‐state measurements of responsiveness and partisan bias. The authors’ analysis of partisan bias is particularly compelling in that it does not require one to assume uniform shifts in voting across districts."
"3","While recognizing the threat of partisan gerrymandering, the U.S. Supreme Court has largely sidestepped the issue. In 2004, the Court decided Vieth v. Jubelirer, in which the late Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for a four‐justice plurality, held that there “are no judicially discernable and manageable standards” for adjudicating these types of disputes. The legal standards applicable in these kinds of cases are so convoluted that the Vieth case produced no fewer than five separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority.         "
"4","McGann, Smith, Latner, and Keena maintain that there is a workable standard for judging partisan gerrymanders: the partisan symmetry test. First articulated by Andrew Gelman and Gary King, the partisan symmetry test examines whether both parties would win the same number of seats from the same percentages of votes. An unlimited number of district maps can pass the partisan symmetry test, varying in how responsive they are to electoral majorities, but the test requires that parties win 50 percent of seats when they win 50 percent of votes. In the 2012 election, there were four states that elected Republican‐majority delegations to Congress with less than 50 percent of the vote: Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. (All of these states voted for Donald Trump in 2016, however.) These are the clearest examples of partisan gerrymanders and help explain how Republicans won 53.8 percent of seats in the House while Democrats won 50.6 percent of the vote."
"5","While the book does a fine job of identifying and measuring partisan gerrymandering, it is not clear that these political science methods can help courts manage redistricting. To right a wrong, a court must be able to measure both the wrong and the remedy. If a negligent driver injures a pedestrian, a court cannot make the injury go away, but it can award a lump sum of money as compensation. The political concern that arises in partisan redistricting cases is not that the harm is immeasurable but rather that the remedy cannot be identified and effectively managed."
"6","Gerrymandering in America opens by pointing out the odd result of the 2012 congressional elections: the Republicans won a majority in the House despite receiving less than 50 percent of the votes. I would like to have seen the authors return to this example later in the book and to show how the partisan symmetry standard offers a manageable solution to the problem. How would Democrats litigate this injury, and what would the authors have a court do?         "
"7","One unresolved issue is when the injured party (that is, the Democrats) would challenge a biased map. Before the election, the harm is only hypothetical, and without actual injury, the party lacks standing. After an election, the harm may be more apparent, but how many seats is the electoral majority entitled to? As noted earlier, the partisan fairness principle can be used to justify anywhere from 50 percent to 100 percent of seats for the electoral majority. Moreover, the counterfactual harm of not winning as many seats with the victor's vote share is not an actual injury. Except in cases such as the 2012 congressional election results in Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, it would be like suing a negligent driver for the injuries you would have received if you had been crossing the street when he or she ran the red light. It is not clear when or how a court would use the partisan fairness standard to remedy partisan gerrymandering. But, as Justice Anthony Kennedy observed in his Vieth concurrence, “That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.”         "
