"1","In this book, Cindy I‐Fen Cheng describes how the public and the U.S. government after World War II saw people of Asian ancestry as what she calls “foreigners‐within.” This perception led to two seemingly contradictory outcomes for the Chinese Americans and Korean Americans at the center of Cheng's study. Successive Cold War presidential administrations understood the negative impact of American racial discrimination on the nation's foreign policy aims, so officials praised the integration of Asian Americans into U.S. society as a sign of the country's democratic character. At the same time, authorities targeted Chinese Americans and Korean Americans as potential security threats, in large part because their national origins supposedly linked them to Cold War enemies."
"2","Cheng traces this vacillation between inclusion and exclusion in five chapters that examine Chinese American encounters with residential discrimination in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area; Chinese American and Korean American “firsts,” such as Delbert Wong, the first Chinese American judge, and Sammy Lee, the first Korean American Olympic gold medalist; the investigation of Chinese Americans in a nationwide 1956 immigration probe; and the federal harassment of Korean American leftists David Hyun and Diamond Kimm in the 1950s and 1960s."
"3","In these chapters, Cheng offers a number of new insights into an understudied period. In her discussion of “firsts,” she presents the lives of her subjects with a rare warmth and complexity; she also persuasively shows that such people developed their own understandings of race, democracy, and Americanness distinct from media portrayals of them as symbols of American superiority and freedom. Juxtaposing celebrations of Asian Americans' loyalty with probes into their alleged subversion, Cheng astutely observes that these apparently conflicting ideas were in fact not so contradictory after all. Rather, she contends, “The legal suppression of dissent is vital to maintaining the belief that the American heritage is indeed rooted in the principles of freedom and equality” (p. 20)."
"4","Citizens of Asian America sometimes lacks nuance and attention to detail and is more useful as a cultural critique of the early Cold War period than as a history of Asian Americans at that time. Throughout the book, Cheng conflates the numerous and often‐contradictory actors, agencies, and interests that comprise the U.S. government into a single, unified “state” intent on exploiting and persecuting Asian Americans. She argues that Asian Americans played an active role in multiracial organizing for residential integration yet offers no real evidence for this. And her analysis is occasionally contradictory. Early on, she discusses how images of Chinese American nuclear families matched the nation's conservative gender roles; later, she argues of the same period that the “concept of ‘working women’ was becoming a measure of the preeminence of the American way of life” (p. 105).         "
"5","But such problems mostly reflect the ambition of a book that tries and often succeeds in illuminating the complexity of Asian American identities and images at a crucial moment in the past. Overall, Cheng's work is a solid contribution to an emerging and valuable body of literature about postwar Asian American life."
