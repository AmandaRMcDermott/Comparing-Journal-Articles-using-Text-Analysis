"1","Nicholas R. Seabrook has written an important study that will cause researchers to reconsider the partisan and competitiveness consequences of congressional redistricting. For decades, debate has raged over the extent to which a party controlling its state's line‐redrawing process can increase its share of seats. Equally contentious has been the question of whether redistricting has made for more or less electoral competition. The vital contribution of Drawing the Lines is to show that during the period from 1992 to 2010, partisan gerrymanders had their intended seat gain effect, but only marginally, while these plans increased electoral competition in comparison with bipartisan, commission, or judicial plans. Thus, Seabrook puts himself at odds with the conventional strain of writing on the topic, urging academics and journalists to move past their fixation on limiting partisan gerrymandering and instead push for competition‐enhancing reforms, regardless of whether a state legislature or a commission has redistricting authority.         "
"2","An exhaustive array of qualitative and quantitative data are marshaled to derive these conclusions. The statistical analysis is among the most comprehensive and sophisticated yet attempted in a redistricting study. Still, a nagging question remains as to whether the conclusions are more heavily dependent on the happenstance of strong Republican tides in the South in 1992 and nationally in 1994 and strong Democratic national tides in 2006 and 2008 than the book gives credit for. All these tides worked to undo the prevailing partisanship of the gerrymanders: Democratic in 1992 and Republican in 2002. Absent these offsetting partisan surges, gerrymandered districts might well have withstood the more modestly sized inter‐election swings usually characterizing the House vote (for example, those of the 1980s), allowing the gerrymandering party to realize most of its intended gains across the full decade and, as a result, impressing scholars with the efficacy rather than impotency of partisan manipulation of lines."
"3","On the competitiveness side of Seabrook's analysis, one of the measures used to quantify this concept—seat shifts from election to election—would have been reduced in magnitude without the coincidence of the strong partisan tides. It is further vexing that when marginality is tapped in terms of presidential vote margins within districts, partisan gerrymanders fail to significantly enhance competitiveness. Granted, the presidential vote bears no relationship to the number of newly appended constituents, who, because of their unfamiliarity with the incumbent, are less likely to give their electoral backing than continuing constituents. Still, the touchstone for line drawers’ expectations of how boundary changes will affect congressional outcomes mainly rests on the criterion of partisanship, for which the presidential vote is a powerful surrogate."
"4","Finally, readers undoubtedly will wonder whether boundary changes forged by the 2011–2012 round of redistricting, which are beyond the scope of this book, have introduced a new era of partisan gerrymander seat payoff. Journalistic commentary certainly has stressed the unprecedented potential for partisan intentions embodied in the Republican plans that heavily predominated to translate into Election Day reality, given the availability of data on more fine‐grained subsegments of the population, more sophisticated computer software, and greater partisan voting consistency by the electorate. This is forcefully suggested by the Democrats’ 2012 capture of only 46 percent of House seats despite a 1.4 percent national popular vote advantage, plus current estimates for 2018 that as much as an 8 percent advantage might be needed to gain a bare seat majority. So even if partisan gerrymandering had only modest effects across the previous two decades, a new paradigm may have come into existence, casting partisan gerrymandering in a much less benign light."
