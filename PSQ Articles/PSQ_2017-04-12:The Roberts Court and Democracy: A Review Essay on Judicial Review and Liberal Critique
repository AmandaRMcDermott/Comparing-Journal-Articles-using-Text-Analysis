"1","STEPHEN E. GOTTLIEB'S NEW BOOK IS PROVOCATIVE and informative as well as frustrating and maddening. There is a torrent of useful information in Unfit for Democracy about the nature of democracy, here and abroad; the spoiling of our political, economic, and legal systems; and the U.S. Supreme Court in general and the Roberts Court in particular.1 Gottlieb's targets are broad, and readers interested in a wide variety of political and legal issues will learn much about many different topics related to democracy and how to keep it. This review can only touch on the highlights of this rich book.         "
"2","The reason the book is at times frustrating and maddening is that at the core of every chapter, behind all the historical stories and geographic comparisons, is Gottlieb's ideology, which, as he puts it, “challenges every aspect of conservative legal thought, its history, its ethnocentrism, its method of interpreting the Constitution, its values, and its democratic bona fides” (p. 4). Just so. The book is of great use to liberals and progressives seeking strong arguments against conservatives and to conservatives who wish to better understand liberal positions. Those seeking to read balanced or nuanced arguments concerning some of the most difficult political and legal issues our country faces will have to turn elsewhere."
"3","The book is divided into three major parts, called “Traditions,” “Political Science,” and “At the Court.” The first part provides an interesting account of our history while trying to demonstrate that at the core of American politics is and should be a preference for democracy. As Gottlieb puts it, “the most basic definition of democracy is elective government. The question addressed in this study is what keeps elective government alive” (p. 4)."
"4","Gottlieb does not venture into the usual philosophical debate over whether we are a “republic” or a “democracy.” His project is both broader and narrower than that philosophical skirmish. He is interested in the differences between elected, representative governments and totalitarian dictatorships. Although Donald Trump is never mentioned (and the book was written before his ascent), the fear of America falling into the hands of someone like Trump runs throughout its pages, and in that sense, the book is eerily predictive."
"5","Gottlieb places much historical weight on the idea that the “founding generation understood that the most fundamental freedom was the right to vote, that democracy is impossible without political rights” (p. 8). For the Founders, “to be a free man was to have the right to self‐government‐not freedom from government, but freedom to participate in government” (p. 13). He is setting the table for his critique of the Roberts Court's decisions in Shelby County v. Holder and the gerrymandering cases, but his account does not devote much attention to the reality that the Founding Fathers gave the right to vote only to white males. His history would also be questioned by modern‐day libertarians who would argue, both as a historical matter and a democratic theory matter, that freedom from government was a core value at the founding and should be one today. Nevertheless, Gottlieb's historical arguments in Part I are strong, even if they are a bit manipulative and one‐sided.         "
"6","Much of the rest of Part I is devoted to comparative assessments of democracies abroad and how other courts and constitutions have handled difficult issues of democracy in the post–World War II era. Gottlieb takes the reader on a tour of Italy, Germany, India, Japan, Canada, South Africa, and the European Union. Those countries have had similar debates to ours on abortion, affirmative action, voting rights, and so on, and, as I am not a comparative law expert, I am not qualified to comment much on these sections. I can say with confidence that Gottlieb does a stellar job of setting forth the issues and stakes involved, but I am less sanguine over whether he provides enough information for the reader to make careful judgments about how these countries have dealt with these global questions. There can be no question, however, that there is something reassuring in knowing that we are not alone in our internal squabbles over these issues."
"7","Part II of the book is devoted to “Political Science” and the question that is at the heart of the book: “what makes elective government survive or fail?” (p. 111). In this section, Gottlieb downplays the importance of both federalism and separation of powers. As to the latter, Gottlieb argues that “[t]reating separated powers as independent tends to exceed historical understanding—Madison thought blended a better description of the powers than separated—and treating separated powers as independent conflicts with the purpose of distributing power so that executives are not dictators” (p. 123). As for federalism, in a “mature democracy, a clear division between federal and state powers may be precisely the problem, encouraging extremists and aggravating conflicts where candidates think they can benefit from stirring the hornets nests” (p. 125).         "
"8","More important to democracy than those structural concerns, Gottlieb argues, is a fair allocation of resources and universal suffrage. He argues that “too much wealth makes people powerful and fearful. Too much poverty makes people vulnerable … Either way democracy requires dispersion of resources… These suggest an economic dimension to constitutional law that has been consistently denied in most prior scholarship… Democracy is threatened by concentrations of power, economic or otherwise” (p. 139)."
"9","Gottlieb's thesis that wealth and private power allocation are more important to democracy's survival than structural protections such as federalism and separation of powers is certainly interesting. To this reader, however, the issues raised in this part of the book almost certainly implicate questions of degree, not kind. How much wealth allocation or misallocation threatens democracy, and how helpful are federalism and separation of powers to ensuring that governmental officials do not become tyrants? Gottlieb raises these issues fairly but does not suggest or critique detailed answers. Nevertheless, his fairly out‐of‐the box minimization of our long debates over federalism and separation of powers and his emphasis on economic fairness make for good reading and raise important issues that need to be addressed by all those interested in how democracies flourish."
"10","Although the book has the Roberts Court in its title, we do not get to the section on “Breakdown by Court Order” until page 189 out of 261. I wish Gottlieb had taken us there sooner. Once we arrive, Gottlieb surprisingly takes the reader on a vivid tour of a number of criminal justice decisions by the Roberts Court that should make the blood boil regardless of party affiliation or political ideology. Gottlieb persuasively recounts how the Roberts Court allowed intentional misconduct by prosecutors and political appointees at both the state and federal levels, resulting in great injustices and the wrongful incarceration of innocent citizens to go unpunished in cases such as Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, Connick v. Thompson, and Ashcroft v. Iqbal. His conclusion that the Roberts Court has allowed “prosecutors to hide evidence, lie, and let witnesses lie, and keep innocent people in prison” seems well supported, while the rise of Trump should make us not ignore Gottlieb's concern that “autocrats from Putin to Pinochet disregard due process as they consolidate power, illustrating the risks the Court imposes on America” (p. 194).         "
"11","My only critique of this part of the book is that it seemed an odd place to start a section on the Roberts Court given the author's repeated focus on the need for fairer allocations of economic resources and the protection of the franchise."
"12","After convincing the reader that the Roberts Court has perpetuated serious injustice in criminal procedure cases, Gottlieb turns to the right to vote and racial issues. As to the franchise, Gottlieb begins his full‐throttle attack with the charge that the Roberts Court, pre–Citizens United, “compiled a record limiting political rights that exceeds the chutzpah and damage of that infamous decision,” by not treating “the inclusion of the public in the mechanisms of democracy as crucial to defining democratic government” (p. 195). Gottlieb specifically targets Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, claiming that “there is nothing subtle about the treatment of democracy by [these justices]; they head it off at the pass and attack with guns blazing” (p. 195).         "
"13","Gottlieb's main targets in this section are the political gerrymandering cases in which the Court dismissed the plaintiffs’ challenges as nonjusticiable: Crawford v. Marion County (voter identification) and Shelby County v. Holder (voting rights under the Voting Rights Act). Although his critiques of Marion and Shelby County are persuasive, the discussion of gerrymandering is incomplete. What judicial standard should be used to evaluate partisan political gerrymandering claims is truly a difficult topic, and no coalition of four justices, liberal or otherwise, has ever coalesced to articulate a workable legal rule. Without Gottlieb himself identifying such a standard, his evaluation of those cases is unpersuasive.         "
"14","As to Citizens United, surprisingly Gottlieb punts. He says he prefers public funding of campaigns, citing political scientists who favor “floors, not ceilings” (p. 202). As to the decision itself, Gottlieb seems ambivalent, declaring that it “will be a while before we have a clear understanding of the impact of the [decision]” (p. 203). I agree that the issues surrounding Citizens United are complex and hard to understand, but a book devoted in significant measure to the study of suffrage and democracy should have spent more time on the issues surrounding the impact of money on candidates running for public office.         "
"15","When Gottlieb turns to race, the book shines brightly. His discussion of the history of segregated schools, starting with the Court's desegregation of graduate schools through Brown and all the way up to Parents Involved, is edifying and poignant. Unlike many who write about this topic, Gottlieb demolishes the absurdity of the de facto/de jure distinction, which assumes at its core that the government is not responsible for our still segregated public schools. In a stirring paragraph, Gottlieb writes,            "
"16","All members of the Supreme Court have agreed that the Constitution requires a remedy for official discrimination. So, de facto discrimination absolves government of responsibility… Unfortunately, documents reveal FHA officials refusing to insure loans to blacks seeking to buy suburban homes [and seeking to renovate homes in black communities]. At stake were federal guarantees of home mortgages made by lending banks. This FHA action virtually mandated the segregation of white and black communities as well as disinvestment and deterioration of black neighborhoods… For years those working in the communities involved thought the problems were the work of brokers, agents, homeowners, developers and bankers. Official federal involvement was slow to come to light. It has now been clearly documented. (pp. 206–207)"
"17","Gottlieb concedes that even if this misbehavior had been more widely known during the heyday of litigation over segregated schools in the 1970s, when the Burger Court mostly sent the issue of segregation back to school districts, the information would not have helped, as the defendants in those cases were the states. But he is smartly providing useful context for the Parents Involved decision, where Louisville and Seattle, on their own and without any judicial order, developed complex plans to desegregate their schools based on lotteries and parental choice. In both cases, the cities pointed out that the plans were “acceptable to most of the voting population” (p. 207). Nevertheless, despite the sordid history of race relations in both cities and throughout the country, the Roberts Court stepped in to stop these desegregation efforts despite the fact that both plans “had been adopted by local educational authorities, not imposed in a distant capital. And both had been designed to bring races together. Neither plan favored any race but merely brought them into contact in the time‐honored American tradition of the coeducational public school system” (pp. 207–208).         "
"18","Gottlieb documents other areas of law, such as antitrust, workers’ rights, and separation of church and state, in which the Roberts Court has, in his view, let democracy down (he does punt on gun rights in a manner similar to his avoidance of Citizens United). In his concluding chapters, Gottlieb intensifies his rhetoric with the charge that the Roberts Court's “rejection of many of the principles of the Bill of Rights, the Reconstruction Amendments, and the structural principles of the Constitution leaves democracy without the safeguards most Americans assume… Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito consistently treat protecting and promoting democracy as ‘not my job’” (pp. 236–237).         "
"19","These are serious charges, and I cannot help but think they could have been more persuasively made had the author presented more fully, and in some places even at all, the arguments the conservative justices have made to support their positions in what are some legitimately hard cases. Nevertheless, Gottlieb's book contains much of the ammunition one would need to attack both the Roberts Court specifically and conservativism generally. Moreover, his clear, crisp, and transparent writing style fuels his attacks, and it likely was not his intention to treat his enemies fairly. This book is an effective weapon for liberals to use in the battle between left and right, and on that level, it succeeds."
