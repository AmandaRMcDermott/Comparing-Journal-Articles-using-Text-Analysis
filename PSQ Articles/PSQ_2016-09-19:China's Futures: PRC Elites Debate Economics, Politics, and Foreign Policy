"1","Pontificating about the future of China has long been the subject of speculation around the world, with one of the most colorful remarks being attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte some 200 years ago. “China,” he reportedly observed, “is a sleeping giant. Let her sleep, for when she wakes she will shake the world.” Not surprisingly, the country's future is also a matter of intense interest in China itself. In China's Futures, author Daniel C. Lynch focuses on debates within contemporary China about the country's future. This volume is a useful complement to David M. Lampton's Following the Leader: Ruling China from Deng Xiaoping to Xi Jinping (reviewed in the Spring 2015 issue of this journal). While the latter book is primarily based on decades of interviews with senior Chinese leaders, China's Futures mines the selected writings of Chinese scholars, most of which were published between 2006 and 2013. Lynch emphasizes that he focuses on “only writings that appeared genuinely to contribute to the debates” (p. xiii). After one chapter discussing the perils of social science forecasting, subsequent chapters focus on five distinct areas of academic discourse: China's economic and demographic projections, China's political future, China's information technology trajectory, the Chinese debate about international relations, and discourse on the culture and its significance to China's future. Lynch's concluding chapter summarizes the findings of earlier the chapters and makes some final observations.         "
"2","The primary value of China's Futures is to provide a window into academic debates on a wide range of policy related issues. Lynch's careful, nuanced scholarship highlights that despite being a strict Leninist system, China's party‐state tolerates a remarkably energetic discourse on a wide range of issues among academics and analysts. Some of the publications examined are for internal circulation (neibu) only, but many of the writings are unclassified. Nevertheless, there are limits to what is permissible, and scholars have been sanctioned or dismissed for advocating ideas considered too controversial. All writers are aware of this and hence tend to practice some degree of self‐censorship. Despite this, discourse on all five topics is lively and free‐ranging.         "
"3","One of the most interesting findings that Lynch notes in his conclusion is the stark disconnect between the pessimism among many economists on the one hand and the “overconfidence” among many international relations scholars on the other (p. 244). The former tend to emphasize that fundamental economic reforms must be implemented if the country is to have a bright future; the latter tend to possess “an almost mystical belief in the inevitability of China's rise, coupled with the certainty of America's decline” (p. 248)."
"4","The volume is crammed full of nuggets that Sinologists will find fascinating and insights that non‐China specialists will find illuminating. But one question remains unanswered: the relevance of these debates to actual policymaking in China. Current People's Republic of China president and Chinese Community Party general secretary Xi Jinping reportedly does not show as much interest in the ideas and input of scholars and analysts as did his two immediate predecessors (Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin). It remains to be seen whether this state of affairs will change. Moreover, there are efforts afoot to revamp the landscape and configuration of research institutes in China; it is unclear how this will affect the policy impact of scholarly discourse."
