"1","Why is high‐level corruption rampant in Lebanon? Why has senior public office been routinely and brazenly used for private benefit since the 1989 postwar settlement? Reinoud Leenders goes inside Lebanon's public institutions in search of the answers. Through rich descriptions of select postwar institutions, Spoils of Truce advances our knowledge of corruption beyond existing aggregate survey indicators and anecdotal evidence. The result is a more‐complete understanding not just of the magnitude and dynamics of corruption, but also of how crucial institutions evolved between 1989 and 2005.         "
"2","Lebanon's postwar institutions—including healthcare, reconstruction, oil and gas, waste management, city planning, and environmental protection—emerge from this book as sites of perpetual administrative ambiguity. They lack defined mandates and regulatory arrangements, external oversight, and a strict separation between public and private interests. For Leenders, high‐level political corruption is a direct result of these deviations from Max Weber's ideal type of “bureaucratic organization.” Administrative ambiguity breeds countless opportunities for vast amounts of public resources to directly disappear into the pockets of high officials and politicians."
"3","To its credit, the book is not content with simply situating corruption in its institutional context. It also aims to explain the origins of these twilight institutions and points to the particularities of the powersharing arrangement that ended 15 years of civil war. The postwar emphasis on inclusion, consensus, and the ever‐elusive “national unity,” coupled with Syria's interference in Lebanese power struggles, set the stage for extreme dispersal of power, quasi‐ permanent gridlock in decision making, and political elites with weak popular support—all of which created political incentives for enduring ambiguity in institutions."
"4","By situating corruption wholly within an institutional and political context, Spoils of Truce joins a very short list of serious studies of Lebanon's contemporary political economy. Ultimately, however, the ambitious conceptual framework does not do justice to the empirical richness tracing Leenders's analysis of power struggles and high‐profile cases of corruption. In many ways, the Weberian framework straitjackets the content's potential. Although the reader is left without doubts that institutions in Lebanon operate well outside Weber's ideal criteria, many questions arise as to how these institutions do function. The descriptive narratives offer some clues, but the book misses the opportunity to provide a more‐original theoretical framework for how chaos is organized in postwar settings in Lebanon and beyond. The tension between organizational function and dysfunction, the unwritten rules that set limits for corruption, the incentives of players who against all odds battle to stem corruption, the unintended consequences of elite in‐fighting—all are elements that merit inclusion.         "
"5","Beyond limiting theoretical innovation, the Weberian framework also hinders causal inference. By measuring institutions solely against an ideal type, the book creates a binary distinction that eliminates variation on the independent variable, since no Lebanese institution is a paragon of bureaucratic efficiency. Yet as the case narratives illuminate, public institutions in Lebanon vary both in institutional qualities and in the form and magnitude of corruption. The infamous management of Beirut's port (in which a contract was terminated in 1997 by the firing of water cannons on company staff) marks a stark contrast with the professionalism of the Central Bank. Exploiting this variation would strengthen the book's causal claims and also better satisfy Leenders's call to take Lebanon's public institutions seriously."
"6","Similarly, a comparison of pre‐ and post‐war public institutions would offer greater causal leverage. By focusing on the period after 1989, the book assumes that post‐war political corruption differed in nature and scope from the corruption in Lebanon's First Republic prior to the 1975 war. Supporting this assumption is imperative for the book's causal claims. Moreover, this temporal analysis would help clarify the implications of this argument beyond Lebanon: does the Lebanese case suggest that corruption is inherent to consociational political arrangements (which have existed since independence) or rather that it is a cost of stabilizing post‐conflict societies?"
"7","These critiques pay tribute to the book's thought‐provoking engagement with power struggles and its spoils in Lebanon. The demand for an alternative theoretical framework originates in the intriguing possibilities offered by the book's careful investigation of corruption cases and how they interact with these struggles. It is above all a testament to Leenders's success in arguing that public institutions deserve a central place even in contexts where they are especially vulnerable to political manipulation."
