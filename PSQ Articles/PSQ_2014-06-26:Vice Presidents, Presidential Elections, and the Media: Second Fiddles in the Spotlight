"1","In Congressional Government, Woodrow Wilson asserted that “The chief embarrassment in discussing the [vice presidency] is that in explaining how little there is to say about it one has evidently said all there is to say.” This is no longer true. Stacy Ulbig's Vice Presidents, Presidential Elections, and the Media is a fine and welcome addition to a growing body of scholarship that examines various aspects of the vice presidency. It extends an analysis published in 2010 in examining how media coverage of vice presidential candidates from 1972 through 2008 affects evaluations of those candidates.         "
"2","Ulbig finds that the amount and tone of media coverage affects how independent voters evaluate vice presidential candidates. In chapter 3, she illustrates that “vice presidential candidates who draw more (and more intense) media coverage exert a stronger impact on voter decision making” (p. 7). Chapter 4 shows that negative media coverage of vice presidential candidates has little effect, except in the case of incumbent vice presidents in their re‐election bids. Chapter 5 focuses on media coverage of various demographic characteristics of vice presidential candidates. Here, the evidence suggests that “when the media focuses more on a vice presidential candidate's sex or religious preference (and to a lesser degree, his/her marital status), especially in a negative way, voters are more likely to let the candidate affect their vote choice” (pp. 7–8). Chapter 6 examines the effect of media attention to various candidate traits, demonstrating that while most seem of little consequence, “more negative coverage” of the political experience and intelligence of vice presidential candidates matters (p. 8). In conclusion, “when voters have information about VP candidates, they matter. When information about them is scarce, they do not” (p. 13)."
"3","The book is well written, and the analyses, based on National Election Survey data, are sound. In fact, the book has no major shortcomings, although there are a few that qualify as minor distractions. First, the title is rather misleading. The focus of the analyses is not on “vice presidents” but rather vice presidential candidates. While taking some license in titling a book is understandable, this probably goes too far. Second, the analyses are centered on the evaluations and vote intentions of pure independent voters. This is fine, but it might have been made more clear that there are relatively few pure independents. This has substantive implications. For example, she notes that the vote choice of partisans is largely unaffected by evaluations of vice presidential candidates (p. 23). Third, there are a number of typographic, printing, and bibliographic errors throughout the book (for example, several popular‐press references on page 61 are not in the bibliography)."
"4","Finally, Ulbig relies on faulty conventional wisdom about the vice presidency and vice presidential selection in the setup. For example the idea that incumbents might be dropped from the ticket in the modern era is dated. She also claims that there has been “considerable” scholarly “work put into forecasting the selection of” vice presidential candidates, but most of the research referenced is descriptive observations of the characteristics of those who have been selected (p. 4). As a final example, the idea that qualifications do not matter in the selection process is no longer true (p. 3)."
"5","These minor shortcoming do not detract from the fact that this short book is quite well done and a fine addition to the literature on the vice presidency. It would be a valuable read for any student of the presidency, presidential campaigns, and voting behavior."
