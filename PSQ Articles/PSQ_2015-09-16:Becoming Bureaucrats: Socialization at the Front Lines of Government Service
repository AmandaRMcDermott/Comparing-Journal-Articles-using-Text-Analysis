"1","Are bureaucrats born or created? This question is at the heart of Zachary W. Oberfield's book. He seeks to answer this question by examining street‐level bureaucrats in two distinct agencies: caseworkers from a welfare office and police officers. Oberfield presents a comprehensive analysis of the training, attitudes, and socialization of these street‐level bureaucrats. The book follows entry‐level caseworkers and police academy trainees from their first day through their second year as bureaucrats. This allows Oberfield to directly assess the attitudes, predispositions, and motivations of entrants and how these attitudes change over time as a result of socialization, training, and experience."
"2","Oberfield clearly outlines the theoretical basis for his research question. He draws on theories rooted in psychology and sociology as the basis for how individual dispositions and personalities shape preferences and career choices. Within the public administration literature, Oberfield points to research on representative bureaucracy and public service motivations as a theoretical basis for why individuals become bureaucrats. Alternatively, Oberfield presents an institutional perspective, highlighting work on rational systems, organizational socialization, and street‐level bureaucracy that emphasizes the importance of training, rules, norms, and codes—both formal and informal—that shape bureaucrats' values and behaviors."
"3","Oberfield finds that both police officers and caseworkers are motivated by altruistic (helping others) and egotistic (pay, benefits) factors, but not equally so. Interestingly, bureaucrats' initial motivations at the time of entry appear to persist throughout their early careers. That is, while the overall levels of altruism may decline, for example, those who identified altruistic motives as important at the beginning of their careers were also more likely to still identify those motives as important two years later. Oberfield also contends that organizational socialization, including training, has an effect on shaping attitudes. Caseworkers' views of claimants and police officers' attitudes on police–citizen relations were influenced, in part, by training and socialization, including informal influences and norms (particularly for police). This provides support for the argument that organizational culture (both formal and especially informal) plays an important role in shaping bureaucrats' attitudes."
"4","Perhaps not surprisingly, the answer to the question “Are bureaucrats created or born?” is complicated and perhaps the wrong question. Rather, Oberfield argues that bureaucracies operate as a complex open system in which organizations interact with their environment. This interaction includes the recruitment of new personnel. Thus, while organizations do change their people to some degree, what is more important is how they find people who will fit well within their organization."
"5","The generalizability of the results is an open question. The case selection of the agencies, the survey sample size, and the time period of the study all raise questions regarding whether the results are more broadly applicable. Oberfield recognizes these limitations in the book's appendix. Despite these shortcomings, the research design is arguably the book's greatest strength. Oberfield uses a mixed‐methods design and does so in a remarkably comprehensive manner. His approach includes participant observation (he worked as a caseworker for a year), in‐depth interviews, and surveys with which he conducts quantitative statistical analysis. The result is a fascinating book that offers rich accounts in the bureaucrats' own words while also providing systematic analysis and scientific rigor. The book is intriguing to read. It has clear theoretical motivations yet does not overuse academic jargon. Instead, it masterfully combines the richness of the interviews with well‐presented findings from the quantitative analysis to present his case. This results in a book that is highly accessible and enjoyable to read. Becoming Bureaucrats is a must‐read for anyone interested in better understanding street‐level bureaucrats and organizational behavior.         "
