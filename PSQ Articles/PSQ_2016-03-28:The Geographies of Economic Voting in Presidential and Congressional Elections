"1","IN THE ECONOMIC VOTING LITERATURE, the prevailing view is that individuals are instrumental when casting their ballot, rewarding or punishing incumbent politicians as a consequence of broadly defined economic expectations. “Sociotropic voting,” as it is known in academic circles, is prevalent in popular accounts of voting as well. As famed political pundit James Carville remarked, “It's the economy, stupid!” Although the evidence in favor of sociotropic voting is quite extensive, few have asked a key question: from what geographic context does economic voting originate?"
"2","We investigate this question by examining how changing economic conditions shape voting behavior at various geographic levels. Recent research has trended in the opposite direction: exploring nuanced questions with increasingly sophisticated methodologies. In contrast, we explore a basic—but nonetheless critical—issue in the economic voting literature. While researchers have studied the effect of national conditions in countless studies, there are plausible reasons why economic voting manifests at the local level. As various authors have noted, the theoretical justification for localism includes, first, that voters experience local conditions as a costless by‐product of their day‐to‐day lives; second, that a voter's local economy exhibits greater social salience than the national economy; and third, that national measures mask critical variation in economic well‐being that manifest at the local level. On the empirical side, some studies have indeed found that local economic conditions affect both sociotropic evaluations and election outcomes.1 As Andrew Reeves and James Gimpel suggest, federal elections “may ultimately come down to the forces of local context.”2"
"3","Using restricted data from the American National Election Studies (ANES), we model the effect of three economic indicators—the unemployment rate, average retail gas prices, and per capita personal income—at four geographic levels—county, media market, state, and national. Based on the results of two modeling strategies, and despite intuitive claims about the power of local conditions, we conclude that economic voting is almost exclusively a national phenomenon. Among the results, we find that variation in the national unemployment rate has robust effects in both presidential and congressional elections. In contrast, we find only limited evidence of economic effects at the subnational level (while the results are mixed, we uncover some evidence that local conditions affect the voting behavior of politically sophisticated voters).         "
"4","Within the economic voting literature, Gerald Kramer's contribution3 is particularly notable, with one review essay referring to Kramer's article as “one of the most influential empirical studies in the history of political science.”4 In his examination of congressional election outcomes from 1896 to 1964, Kramer identifies a robust relationship between the election year economy and the share of the two‐party vote won by the president's party. While few dispute the empirical wisdom of Kramer's research, hundreds of articles and books have explored how, exactly, individuals translate economic information into votes.            "
"5","As a theoretical matter, the prevailing view is that “sociotropic” evaluations are the primary mechanism linking economic conditions and an individual's vote choice.5 As one review essay puts it, “Clearly, sociotropic evaluations overwhelm egotropic ones.”6 Simply put, sociotropic voting proposes that individuals hold incumbents responsible for broadly defined economic expectations.7 In one article, Michael Lewis‐Beck and Martin Paldam note that across 200 books and papers, national economic factors explain approximately one‐third of the change in vote totals across various elections.8 A competing view holds that “egotropic” motivations are the key determinant of individual‐level voting behavior, with personal finances9 or employment status10 having a direct effect on voting behavior. As a whole, however, the empirical record on egotropic voting is mixed,11 although some authors suggest that both egotropic and sociotropic effects are important.12"
"6","A second theoretical debate concerns the proper way to operationalize “economic conditions.” Some authors claim that individuals vote “prospectively,” evaluating incumbents based on the direction the economy is headed,13 while others claim that individuals vote “retrospectively,” holding candidates accountable for current economic conditions.14 Although there remains debate on this question, with some authors claiming broad support for prospective voting,15 one review essay identifies sociotropic retrospective evaluations as the superior operationalization of economic voting.16"
"7","A final theoretical debate in the literature concerns whether the electorate is homogenous in its economic evaluations. For decades, political scientists and economists have examined the aforementioned questions without considering whether the answer varies across subpopulations. In multiple studies, Brad Gomez and J. Matthew Wilson find that political sophistication alters the manner in which individuals make causal connections between economic performance and their vote choice.17 With respect to presidential elections, consistent with their theory of “heterogeneous attribution,” Gomez and Wilson find evidence of egotropic voting among the most sophisticated voters.18 Sociotropic voting, by comparison, is most pronounced among the least sophisticated voters.            "
"8","While Kramer's work spawned an intense discussion about the proper linkage between economic conditions and voting behavior,19 certain fields in the literature remain untilled. For example, researchers have (largely) ignored Kramer's subsequent call to examine the possible effect of economic conditions at what he labeled “intermediate” geographies.20 As he noted 30 years ago, we lack a precise understanding of the spatial context from which voters derive their sociotropic evaluations.            "
"9","We document this “spatial gap” in Table 1, which lists the foremost studies in the literature. We conducted this search based on article citation counts using Web of Science.21 While other “landmark” or “major” studies exist, we focus on those that use vote choice as the dependent variable for comparability with our work. For each study, we catalogued the economic indicator(s) selected, the office(s) under examination, and (most importantly) the geography of each variable. We identified 17 distinct economic variables in 12 major studies, giving us a grand total of 39 economic covariates.            "
"10","Table 1 reveals a curious pattern: the theoretical breadth yet spatial narrowness of the literature. On the one hand, researchers have studied the effect of numerous economic indicators across an even balance of presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial elections. On the other hand, among the 39 economic covariates we catalogued, 14 (36 percent) were operationalized at the national level, while 19 (49 percent) were operationalized at individual level. We identified just 5 covariates (13 percent) measured at the state level and only 1 covariate (3 percent) measured at the local level.            "
"11","We believe this spatial gap is the product of three factors. First, because the field is dominated by political scientists and economists, the so‐called geographies of economic voting have received little attention. But, as Ron Johnston and Charles Pattie note,22 the spatial elements of voting behavior experienced a “revival” among political geographers in the 1990s.23 Second, the economic voting literature has focused largely on “valence” theories, such as distinction between sociotropic and egotropic voting, which has minimized other questions. Third, measuring economic conditions at the subnational level presents a series of challenges for researchers using large‐n, publicly available databases.            "
"12","Despite the clear spatial gap in the economic voting literature, a handful of studies have indeed explored the effect(s) of subnational conditions. According to M. Stephen Weatherford and Jeffrey Mondak and colleagues, local economic factors are predictive of voters' retrospective evaluations of an incumbent president's economic performance.24 In related research, Douglas Kriner and Andrew Reeves find that voters reward presidential candidates at the ballot box for the distribution of federal spending in their county.25 Reeves and Gimpel explore voters' sociotropic judgments in the context of “geotropic zones,” finding that local factors—including foreclosures, unemployment, and even gas prices—have discernible effects on individuals' national economic evaluations.26 In similar studies, both John Books and Charles Prysby and Cameron Anderson and Jason Roy find that local economic conditions shape voters' subjective assessment of national conditions.27 Finally, in a direct examination of the relationship between local conditions and voting behavior, Fred Cutler finds that local economies indeed affect a respondent's vote choice in federal elections in Canada.28 As he explains, the “pocketbook” versus “sociotropic” debate “obscures the fact that voters are embedded in many geographically and jurisdictionally defined economies.”29"
"13","Given these conclusions, the proposition that economic voting is a local phenomenon is not fanciful. Still, the geographies of economic voting are far from settled. For starters, almost all of the research supporting a link between local economic conditions and an individual's vote choice is indirect, examining perceptions of the president,30 the causes of aggregate outcomes,31 and modeling of voters' subjective economic evaluations.32 Simply put, few studies have examined the direct relationship between local conditions and an individual's vote choice. Among the few direct studies, the results either are limited in scope or have yielded mixed conclusions. For example, Cutler's important work is confined to federal elections in Canada33 and is contradicted by François Gélineau and Éric Bélanger, who find no relationship between provincial economic conditions and Canadian federal election outcomes.34 Similarly, John Owens and Edward Olson find no effect of district‐level changes in real income and inflation on House outcomes in the United States.35 Finally, studies by Thomas Holbrook and by Daniel Eisenberg and Jonathan Ketcham find little evidence of local economic effects in U.S. presidential elections.36"
"14","In this section, we review the various theoretical claims regarding the local versus national dichotomy. While each argument can be found in existing work, the discussion juxtaposes competing theoretical claims, which are almost always presented in isolation."
"15","According to the “all economics is local” hypothesis, economic voting is a function of variation in local conditions. We present three arguments for this perspective, drawing on theories of information processing, the power of social networks, and the pitfalls of statistical aggregation."
"16","As a starting point, we note the cognitive challenges individuals confront when linking economic conditions and their vote choice. On the one hand, gathering and processing information about the economy is “costly.”37 On the other hand, to the extent that voters possess accurate information about national economic conditions, research has shown that partisanship mutes the attribution process.38 With this in mind, some authors argue that both cognitive hurdles are muted when voters “experience” changing economic conditions.39 Rather than obtain costly information about the national economy, individuals also encounter objective economic conditions as a costless by‐product of their day‐to‐day routines. As a whole, when taking into consideration theories of information processing, one argument is that information about local conditions is simply more accessible compared with information about national conditions.            "
"17","Second, and relatedly, we know from prior work that individuals are powerfully influenced by proximate individuals and groups40 and that social networks are key determinants of voting behavior.41 We know also that local, “community‐based,” factors can influence the decision to run for elective office42 and that political parties are quite effective at utilizing local campaign resources to impact election outcomes.43 Rather than experience local conditions, voters may also obtain local economic information indirectly through their social networks. Furthermore, it is possible that voters are simply more concerned with the economic fate of those in their social network compared with the fate of “faceless” people throughout the nation. Social psychologists refer to such effects as “social salience.” As Pamela Conover aptly puts it, “information about particular salient groups will have more personal relevance for an individual than assessments of national well‐being.”44"
"18","As a final matter, a common argument in favor of localism is the possibility that measures of national economic conditions mask critical variation at the local level. Indeed, national economic conditions are an aggregation of countless local phenomena. For example, during recessionary periods, certain localities are little affected by changing economic conditions, while other geographies experience rather serious economic decline. Consider that in 2009, at the peak of the “Great Recession,” the unemployment rate in North Dakota was just 4.1 percent, whereas in Michigan, unemployment stood at 13.4 percent. Furthermore, studies have revealed that local indicators indeed affect evaluations of national economic conditions in a bottom‐up manner.45 Researchers have also shown that voters evaluate the national economy in response to the fortunes of more proximate “reference groups.”46 Whatever the precise linkage, the national economy is an aggregation of effects that manifest—quite literally—at the local level. Statistical aggregation could be masking critical variation in the constructs of interest.            "
"19","A less common, although nonetheless plausible, argument is that geographic variation in economic voting follows the contours of electoral boundaries.47 In this respect, economic voting could originate at a level somewhere between the local and the national depending on the type of election.            "
"20","According to the Framers of the Constitution, the aggregation of citizens' “whims and passions” from various localities serves as a check on the “limited wisdom” of the public.48 Congressional elections, in particular, fragment power at the national level by focusing the electorate's attention on state and local incumbents rather than national parties (which have no constitutional role) or presidents (who are separately elected). We might expect, therefore, that voters evaluate lawmakers based on economic conditions within an official's electoral jurisdiction. Cutler finds evidence of such an effect in Canadian federal elections, noting that the results seem to be driven by a “psychological identification with the political jurisdiction in which a citizen lives.”49"
"21","Consistent with this view, voters seem to evaluate at least some candidates, in some contests, based on electoral boundaries. We know from hundreds of studies that presidents are indeed held accountable for variation in their electoral jurisdiction (that is, national conditions). But is there any reason to suspect that voters consider congressional boundaries when casting their ballot? Yes, although the evidence here is only indirectly related to the topic of economic voting. Congressional scholars in the “distributive politics” camp contend that federal economic programs at the local level have beneficial effects for congressional candidates.50 For example, research has shown that vulnerable House and Senate candidates are more active in trying to acquire earmarks for their districts and states.51 Indeed, candidates for federal office do not simply “claim credit” for the performance of the national economy but instead emphasize economic accomplishments in their respective constituencies.52 But, most importantly, studies have also shown that local spending projects (such as earmarks) do in fact positively affect both election outcomes53 and the overall evaluations of representatives.54 As a whole, we know that members of Congress are deeply concerned about the economic fate of their constituents and that local conditions can, in turn, affect their electoral fate.            "
"22","In direct contrast to the “all economics is local” hypothesis, a final possibility is that economic voting is a national phenomenon. Because most economic voting studies use data aggregated at the national level, and given the robust evidence in favor of national sociotropic voting, the belief that “all economics is national” is quite common. However, this conclusion is an important presumption, as few studies have tested the effect(s) of national conditions against the effect(s) of local conditions. Further, we again note that some researchers have concluded that the effect of national indicators may be shaped by variation in economic conditions at the local level.55 So, while there are certainly good reasons to suspect that economic voting is a national phenomenon, we contend that a direct examination of this issue is needed.            "
"23","First and foremost, national economic voting could be a function of federalism. Within the literature, a number of authors cite “functional responsibility” as an explanation for geographic variation in economic voting. For example, studies have shown that governors are held accountable for state economic conditions, while presidents are held accountable for the same conditions at the national level.56 In a classic paper, Robert Stein notes the following: “Voters are thought to assign the federal government a preponderant responsibility for managing the national and regional economies, and thus hold congressional and presidential incumbents more accountable than their subnational counterparts for subnational macro‐ and microeconomic conditions.”57 In other words, in the U.S. federal system, presidents, senators, and representatives are all tasked with managing the nation's economic well‐being.            "
"24","A second possibility is that the news media is responsible for the nationalization of economic voting. In direct contrast to the local information processing hypothesis (which emphasizes voters “experiencing” local conditions), an alternative is that voters simply “consume” more information about the national economy. We know, for instance, that the national media plays an important role in shaping voters' economic judgments,58 in contrast to local broadcast news, which focuses overwhelming on crime, sports, and weather. A further possibility is that the media fosters national economic voting through framing and priming effects. For example, we know that media coverage can make a national issue more salient in the minds of voters59 as well as frame attributions of political responsibility.60 As a whole, we think that national economic voting may be a consequence of voters obtaining a disproportionate share of their information about the economy from the national media, which, naturally, emphasizes national conditions and frames elections as referenda on the state of the nation's well‐being.            "
"25","A third reason why economic voting could stem from variation in national conditions is the national nature of modern congressional campaigns. Unlike congressional elections from the 1950s to the 1980s, which are often described as “candidate‐” or “personality‐centered” contests,61 modern campaigns are national or “party‐centered” contents.62 We know, for example, that there has been a sharp decline in ticket splitting in presidential and congressional races over the past 30 years.63 Recent work has even shown that special elections—which occur off cycle and are thought to be highly candidate‐centered contests—have developed into national contents since the 1990s.64 We believe the nationalization of congressional campaigns fosters national economic voting, for two reasons. First, if these nationalized contests emphasize national issues, it is yet another reason why voters may be consuming more information about the national economy. Second, research has shown that one effect of the nationalization of congressional elections has been a stronger connection between presidential outcomes and congressional outcomes.65 Indeed, congressional elections often serve as a “referendum” on the president's handling of national issues.66 As a whole, therefore, modern nationalized campaigns and the strong linkage between presidential and congressional elections in the modern period may focus voters' attention on national conditions at the expense of candidate characteristics or local conditions.            "
"26","We merged an individual‐level data set of congressional and presidential elections (the ANES) with economic conditions at four geographic levels. We examine the period from 1992 to 2008. From the ANES we applied for (and were granted) the classified FIPS geographic identifiers. With these restricted data, we were able to identify the county of each ANES interview and code three economic indicators—the unemployment rate, average retail gas prices, and per capita personal income—at four geographic levels—county, media market, state, and national. We acknowledge that more sophisticated ways of measuring a respondent's local environment exist. For example, Reeves and Gimpel use GIS to identify “geotropic zones,”67 while work by Scott McClurg notes the importance of neighborhood effects on electoral participation.68 Given the large‐n, nationally representative survey used as our primary data set, we do not have this kind of granular data.            "
"27","We purchased a data file containing gas prices for each of the 3,141 counties from 1992 to 2008 from the Oil Price Information Service. Our measure of retail gas prices is the average price per county of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline. Unemployment and per capita personal income data are publicly available at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis Web sites, respectively. For these measures—the primary independent variables—we use objective economic conditions rather than respondents' subjective evaluations, given that the latter are simply global evaluations of various indicators.69"
"28","While we replicate the major trends in the literature, we depart from scholarly conventions in two important ways. First, while gas prices are seldom used in economic voting models, we felt retail gas prices represent an important test of localism. On the one hand, recent work by Reeves and Gimpel finds that local economic conditions (including gas prices) shape voters sociotropic evaluations.70 At the same time, not only do gas prices vary dramatically at the local level, but also we suspect the public is keenly aware of changing gas prices, as many individuals purchase gasoline on weekly basis. Second, to our knowledge, no research has examined economic voting at the media market level. For these measures, we aggregated the county indicators within the corresponding designated media market by first identifying the counties within each media market and then creating population‐weighted averages of each economic covariate. For the DMA (designated media market) economic indicators, we constructed population‐weighted averages of each economic covariate.            "
"29","In the analyses, we estimate the effect of economic conditions using retrospective indicators. We use retrospective indicators for two reasons. First, we are not aware of any publicly available data set that asks respondents to evaluate their local, state, and national economy in a prospective manner. Second, we view measures of “the economy” as inexorably linked. As Richard Nadeau and Michael Lewis‐Beck note, voters form sociotropic judgments based on multiple indicators.71 In the end, objective measures represent the only means of disentangling the effects of multiple indicators at multiple overlapping geographies.            "
"30","In every analysis, the dependent variable is a respondent's vote for the incumbent party's presidential or congressional candidate. For example, the variable is coded 1 if the respondent voted for John McCain in 2008 and 0 if the respondent voted for Barack Obama. We lose observations if respondents did not vote, refused to say whom they voted for, voted for a third‐party candidate, or did not have a Senate election in their state. We also lose observations because of missing data on some independent variables (with the largest source being respondents who indicated they “don't know” or “haven't thought much about” their ideology). We follow scholarly conventions in the House and Senate analysis and model the effect(s) of changing economic conditions contingent on the party occupying the White House.72 For example, the dependent variable is coded 1 if the respondent voted for a Republican congressional candidate in 2008 (during a Republican presidency) and 0 if the respondent voted for a Democratic congressional candidate. Because the dependent variable is dichotomous, each model was estimated by logit. At the outset, we estimated a multilevel model with yearly random effects, but because diagnostic tests failed to reject the null hypothesis of temporal homoscedasticity, we estimated a classic logit with robust standard errors.            "
"31","All measures of objective economic conditions are coded as the annual change from October in an odd‐numbered year before the election to October in the election year. Dozens of studies have demonstrated that the overall rates of change in economic conditions affect incumbent politicians' vote shares.73 In the analysis, the variables Gas, Per Capita Income, and Unemployment represent the annual change in retail gas prices, per capita personal income, and the unemployment rate, respectively. In the results, the prefixes C, D, S, and N indicate whether the indicator is measured at the county, designated media market, state, or national level.            "
"32","We also include a measure of respondents personal financial situation, coded such that higher values indicate their financial situation got much worse over the prior year, while lower values indicate much better. The variable Personal Financial Situation therefore operationalizes the theory of pocketbook voting. We offer two notes about this approach. First, the (objective) economic indicators could be a cause of variation in a respondent's (subjective) pocketbook condition. While plausible, we nonetheless find low covariance between a respondent's stated personal financial situation and the objective indicators. Indeed, the strongest correlation (0.20) is with the national unemployment rate. Second, we acknowledge that some authors recommend an instrumental variable approach as a measure of a respondent's personal economic situation.74 We nonetheless use the ANES's self‐reported variable for consistency with the most common approach in the literature and for parsimoniousness (egotropic voting is not the primary construct of interest in this article, and the modeling strategy we adopt contains numerous moving parts). We nonetheless acknowledge this as a limitation with our operationalization of pocketbook voting. Finally, in the models, we include various self‐explanatory candidate75 and respondent76 control variables that are common in similar analyses.            "
"33","Earlier, we cited research in the economic voting literature that finds that the link between economic conditions and voting behavior is conditioned by a respondent's degree of political sophistication. Because this is not our primary research question, we provide only limited discussion of sophistication in the following pages. We note that studies by Anderson and Roy, Cutler, and Mondak and colleagues offer thorough discussions of this issue.77 However, these studies have reached varied conclusions about the possible interaction between geography and a respondent's level of sophistication. Mondak and colleagues find that better informed voters rely on local conditions to a greater extent than less informed voters in their evaluations of the president's economic performance.78 In direct contrast, Anderson and Roy find that better informed and better educated individuals are less influenced by local economic conditions in their perceptions of economic conditions.79 Cutler finds no difference in local economic voting between low and high sophisticates.80 As a whole, while it is unclear whether sophistication is relevant to our examination of the geographies of economic voting, we tested this possibility nonetheless. Again, however, this is not the primary focus of our analysis.            "
"34","Consistent with both Mondak and colleagues and Cutler, in the following models, we interacted a measure of political sophistication with each economic covariate.81 We measure political sophistication according to Gomez and Wilson's operationalization,82 which captures “attentiveness” to and “knowledge” of public affairs.83 Following Gomez and Wilson, we categorized individuals as low, medium, and high sophisticates. Because of space constraints, we do not report the details of this measure here; however, it is available from the authors upon request. We note here that a principal components factor analysis of our five knowledge items produced a single dimension of political sophistication (eigenvalue = 1.8), with all five items loading onto the first dimension at a satisfactory level. We present these results in a separate section.            "
"35","While the covariates we include are common in the economic voting literature, we face a significant modeling challenge: identifying the “correct” specification. In particular, because our primary economic indicators exhibit significant geographic correlation (an unavoidable feature of our question), we need some routine for selecting covariates. Estimating a single model with all covariates would produce inefficient and potentially biased estimates because of problematic collinearity.         "
"36","Therefore, we implement a two‐step modeling strategy. In the variable selection stage, we estimated 39 baseline models where each individual economic covariate was included with the control variables. Because the baseline models are non‐nested, we use the information criterion (AIC and BIC) to identify the best performing covariate in each geographic cohort. In order to maintain a reasonable page length, we do not report the baseline models here; however, they are available from the authors upon request. In adopting this approach, we assume that each economic indicator affects voting behavior at one geographic level. We conducted a series of separate analyses (not reported) to examine whether the individual economic covariates affect voting behavior at multiple geographies. We found no evidence of interspatial effects in any of the models. A subsequent analysis (reported later) accounts for this possibility nonetheless. Finally, in the second stage, we estimate a single aggregate model with the best performing covariates identified in the first stage. While this two‐step approach is very “orthodox,” we feel it has the advantage of both being parsimonious and limiting collinearity in the covariates of interest."
"37","We present the findings in three parts. First, we review the baseline results, present the aggregate models, and discuss the main effects of each economic indicator. Second, we discuss the conditional effect of a respondent's level of sophistication. Third, once the findings are established in their entirety, we discuss the overarching conclusions and broader implications of the results."
"38","As noted earlier, to save space, we omit the 39 baseline models but will make them available upon request. In the variable selection stage, the baseline models reveal that unemployment, per capita income, and personal financial situation are all predictive of a respondent's vote choice. Recall that these variables represent the annual change in each covariate. So, for example, when we reference the “significant effect of national unemployment,” we mean the effect of increases or decreases in unemployment over the past year."
"39","In the baseline models, while gas prices are statistically significant in a few models, the effect is always in the opposite direction. We diagnosed this problem, a likely spurious effect of inflation,84 while also testing alternative specifications.85 In the end, we found no effect of gas prices at any geographic level or in any electoral contest. We discuss the implications of this finding in a separate section.            "
"40","Concerning the geographies of economic voting, the baseline results indicate that national unemployment outperforms measures of unemployment at all other geographies in all three electoral contests, while per capita income outperforms all rivals when measured at the national level in House elections and at the county level in presidential and Senate elections. We therefore included each (plus the sophistication interaction effects, discussed in the next section) in the aggregate models.            "
"41","Table 2 presents the aggregate models. As a substantive matter, in this section, we are interested in the main effects of each economic indicator (irrespective of the interaction effect). Indeed, the main effects reveal “how much” each covariate matters regardless of a respondent's political sophistication and provides a straightforward comparison of all indicators. We note that this mirrors Cutler's approach in his second hypothesis.86 But because each model contains at least one interaction effect, we cannot simply “eyeball” the raw coefficients. As various textbooks explain, in models with interactions, the base terms are substantively meaningless on their own and can be insignificant when the overall effect is statistically significant.87 Following the recommendations in the literature, we therefore computed the first derivative (∂y/∂x) of each economic covariate as well as the corresponding z‐statistics and p‐values.88 In this respect, the covariates in Table 2 represent the “conditional” effects, while the discussion regarding the magnitude of each covariate is the “main effect” (which we computed by hand).            "
"42","In the presidential model, we estimate that a standard deviation increase in the nation's unemployment rate (roughly +0.9 percent) decreases the likelihood of voting for an incumbent president by 8.1 percent, averaged for all respondents. Further, this main effect is statistically significant (z = –5.33; p < .001). In contrast, the main effect of county per capita income is not statistically significant at conventional thresholds (z = 1.92; p = .06). Ultimately, per capita income, the best‐performing local covariate, has statistically insignificant main effects in every model. Finally, in the presidential model, we estimate that a standard deviation change in a respondent's personal financial situation (changing from “somewhat worse” to “much worse”) decreases a respondent's likelihood of voting for an incumbent president by 3.4 percent, averaged for all respondents. As with the national unemployment rate, this main effect is statistically significant (z = –2.37; p = .02). As a whole, when we compute the main effects, we find that unemployment at the national level has the largest substantive effect on voting behavior in presidential elections regardless of a respondent's political sophistication. An F‐test (not reported) indicates that the size of the coefficient on national unemployment is indeed statistically larger than every other economic covariate.            "
"43","In the Senate model, we estimate that a standard deviation increase in national unemployment (roughly +0.9 percent) decreases a respondent's likelihood of voting for an incumbent senator by 1.4 percent for all respondents. Further, the results indicate that this effect is statistically significant (z = –3.40; p < .01). (While the base coefficient is not significant in the Senate model, when we compute the marginal effects, the overall effect is indeed statistically significant.) In contrast, the effects of county per capita income (z = 1.45; p = .15) and a respondent's personal financial situation (z = –1.73; p = .09) are each insignificant in the Senate model. Consistent with the presidential model, we again find that changes in the national unemployment rate have the largest statistically significant effect on voting behavior regardless of sophistication in Senate elections.            "
"44","In the House model, we estimate that a standard deviation increase in national unemployment (roughly +0.9 percent) decreases a respondent's likelihood of voting for an incumbent representative by 2.4 percent for all respondents. Further, the results indicate that this effect is once again statistically significant (z = –2.64; p < .01). In contrast, the main effect of national per capita income is not statistically significant at conventional thresholds (z = 1.53; p = .13). Finally, we estimate that a standard deviation change in a respondent's personal financial situation (changing from “somewhat worse” to “much worse”) decreases the likelihood of voting for an incumbent senator by 3.9 percent. We find that this effect is statistically significant (z = –3.54; p < .001). Notably, while the main effect of personal financial situation is larger in magnitude compared with the main effect of national unemployment, an F‐test (not reported) indicates that this difference is not statistically meaningful. As a whole, the aggregate House results once again identify unemployment measured at the national level as a key predictor of voting behavior regardless of a respondent's degree of sophistication. However, unlike the presidential and Senate models, a respondent's personal financial situation exerts just as large an effect in House elections according to the results.            "
"45","Regarding the effect of political sophistication, in the baseline models, we identified a series of statistically significant interaction effects and included them in the aggregate models. We find a statistically significant interaction between sophistication and national unemployment in all three elections. With per capita income, we find a significant interaction at the county level in presidential and Senate elections and at the national level in House elections. Finally, we find a statistically significant interaction between sophistication and personal financial situation in the House model."
"46","For ease of interpretation, Figure 1 presents each interaction effect and its associated confidence interval. Each point reflects the average marginal effect (y‐axis, expressed in probabilities) of a standard deviation change in each economic covariate for respondents in the low, medium, and high sophistication categories (x‐axis). When the confidence interval straddles the zero line, we are unable to conclude with 95 percent certainty that the economic covariate in question has a statistically significant effect for respondents at the corresponding sophistication level. Each figure is on the same scale, and all covariates were standardized, so we can conduct straightforward comparisons across economic indicators and elections.            "
"47","Average Marginal Effect of Economic Indicators on Vote Probability in Aggregate Models"
"48","Source: Figures created by the authors. Dots indicate the estimated effect of an economic indicator (y‐axis) for respondents in a sophistication category (x‐axis). When the confidence interval straddles the zero line, the economic indicator has no significant effect.                        "
"49","Figure 1 reveals a few general patterns. For starters, we can see that the effect of national unemployment (left column) increases in magnitude (in the negative direction) as sophistication moves from high to low. This indicates that the least sophisticated voters are less likely to vote for incumbent politicians when the national unemployment rate increases. We can also see that national unemployment has statistically significant effects for low sophisticates in the presidential and House models and statistically significant effects for moderate sophisticates in the presidential and Senate model. In the end, national unemployment is not statistically significant in any electoral contest for respondents in the high sophistication category. We discuss the substantive implications of this result next.            "
"50","Figure 1 reveals that per capita income has the opposite pattern as changes in the unemployment rate. We can see that the effect of per capita income (middle column) is insignificant, and small in magnitude, for low and moderate sophisticates. For high sophisticates, by comparison, county per capita income has statically significant and quite large effects in every electoral contest. Given our interest in the geographies of economic voting, Figure 1 reveals why national unemployment has statistically significant and large main effects in every election while county per capita income has statistically insignificant and relatively small main effects in every election. Simply put, the interaction effects reveal that national unemployment has large and significant effects for a wider range of the population (both low and moderate sophisticates) while the effect of per capita income (which performs best at the county level in two elections) is isolated to only the most sophisticated subset of the population.            "
"51","Finally, Figure 1 reveals that a respondent's personal financial situation has a significant effect on voting behavior for respondents in the medium and high sophistication categories. As with the main effect, this indicates that as the respondents personal financial situation goes from worse to much worse, they are significantly less likely to vote for an incumbent representative. Again, however, this effect exists in the House model only; no significant interaction with sophistication exists in either the Senate or presidential model (changes in a respondent's personal financial situation matter equally regardless of sophistication).            "
"52","Considering the results in their entirety, spanning presidential and congressional elections, we reach the conclusion that economic voting is principally a function of national economic conditions. Despite reasonable arguments about the informational effect of local experiences, the social salience of seeing one's neighbors and friends facing economic hardship, the fact that national measures mask variation in economic conditions at the local level, or the possible conditional effect of electoral boundaries, we find minimal evidence that local economic conditions are predictive of voting behavior. In stark contrast, we find that the effect of unemployment measured nationally has a robust effect in all three electoral contests and is a significant predictor for voting behavior for a large subset of the electorate (both moderate and low sophisticates). Although we do find that per capita income operationalized at the county level outperforms the effect of national per capita income in both presidential and Senate elections, we also find that the effect is small in magnitude and limited to only the most sophisticated voters. Indeed, the main effects of per capita income (regardless of sophistication) are insignificant in every model. While this is certainly some evidence for the “all economics is local” hypothesis, we also find that in House races the effect of per capita income manifests at the national level. At best, the evidence is both minimal and mixed. Finally, the results provide no support for the “geographic heterogeneity” hypothesis.            "
"53","We believe the null effect of gas prices only underscores the overarching conclusion about national economic voting and warrants further discussion. As noted at the outset, we consider retail gas prices a powerful test of local economic voting. Indeed, not only do gas prices vary dramatically at the local level, but also, from an information processing perspective, voters experience changing gas prices on a regular basis. Simply put, if there were one measure of local economic conditions that should matter in national elections, it would be increases in gas prices. For their part, Reeves and Gimpel found that varying local economic indicators—including gas prices—shape voters' national economic evaluations.89 While we do not dispute this finding, as we examine a different question, our results show that gas prices do not have a direct effect on voting behavior.            "
"54","A subsidiary conclusion is that economic voting is—as a whole—less consequential in congressional races. If we total the main effects of unemployment and per capita income in all three electoral contexts, standard deviation changes in each affect a respondent's probability of voting for an incumbent by 10.7 percent in presidential races, 3.3 percent in Senate races, and 3.4 percent in House races. In other words, we are able to conclude that economic conditions (in the aggregate) matter roughly three times as much in presidential elections as they do in congressional races. While this does not bear directly on the geographies of economic voting, it is an interesting result nonetheless.            "
"55","As a final matter, while we find little evidence of spatial variation in economic voting, we uncover robust evidence of heterogeneous attribution at the individual level.90 Simply put, we find considerable variation between economic conditions and respondents' level of political sophistication. More specifically, Gomez and Wilson conclude that “pocketbook voting” occurs among the most sophisticated voters, while “sociotropic voting” is strongest among the least sophisticated.91 Our results support this conclusion. We offer one important qualification, however. Our results also show that per capita income—a sociotropic evaluation—is limited to the most sophisticated voters. Although we can only speculate about the reason for this effect, as it is not examined by Gomez and Wilson, we think that per capita income is simply less visible an economic indicator (compared to the national unemployment rate) and therefore requires a sufficient degree of sophistication to affect one's voting behavior. Finally, the significant effect of county per capita income for the highest sophisticates in the presidential and Senate models lends support to Mondak and colleagues, who find the same effect in their research.92"
"56","In this final section, we take a second look at the overarching conclusion that economic voting is a function of variation in national conditions. Recall that because the economic covariates exhibit significant geographic correlation, we adopted an orthodox modeling strategy that first tested geographic variation in each economic covariate and then estimated an aggregate model with the top geographic performers pitted against one another. An alternative is to examine the combined effects of the economic covariates at the level of each geography. Rather than treat the individual economic indicators as the construct of interest, we treat the geographic context as the primary construct. We note that similar indices, combining economic measures, have been used elsewhere in the literature.93"
"57","We believe this approach has three advantages. First, it provides a robustness check of our conclusion that economic voting is a national phenomenon. Second, the geographic indices take into consideration the fact that voters consider multiple indicators of economic well‐being.94 Third, this approach reduces geographic correlation in the variables of interest and provides a theoretically straightforward test of the local versus national dichotomy. According to the data, the national index correlates at just 0.10 with the county index and 0.17 with the media market index. In the end, with the geographic indices, we do not need a routine for excluding covariates and can instead test the effects in a “heads‐up” fashion.         "
"58","Therefore, we reestimated the aggregate models for all three electoral contests. We included the control variables in each model but omit them in the results because of space constraints. Because the economic covariates were standardized earlier, in this section, we create additive indices that simply combine each economic indicator into a single geographic summary measure. For each index, higher values indicate improving economic conditions (decreasing unemployment, decreasing gas prices, and increasing per capita income), while lower values indicate worsening economic conditions. For example, we identified the 1998 midterm as the best overall national economy (gas prices fell about 20 cents, per capita income increased about $1,500, and unemployment dropped about 0.2 percent). In contrast, the 2008 presidential election represents the worst overall national economy (while per capita income rose slightly, gas prices increased about 20 cents, and the unemployment rate increased about 1.5 percent)."
"59","Table 3 contains the results. Given our interest in the national versus local dichotomy, we tested the national index against the county and media market indices. Interactions with sophistication were included for each economic index. Because we found null results on a state‐level index, we do not report these estimates.         "
"60","As earlier, we computed the first derivative (∂y/∂x) of each geographic index as well as the corresponding z‐statistics and p‐values in an attempt to gauge how much each variable matters regardless of sophistication. When we compute these main effects, we find a stark pattern. According to the results, all of the national indices have statistically significant and positive main effects, revealing that improvements in the nation's overall economic health increase the likelihood that a respondent will vote for incumbent presidents and incumbent lawmakers of the president's party.95 In stark contrast, all of the county and media market indices have statistically insignificant main effects. As a whole, the results confirm (rather definitively) the overarching conclusion that economic voting is driven by variation in national conditions.         "
"61","As earlier, we present each interaction effect and its associated confidence interval in a single figure. Recall that each estimate reflects the average marginal effect (y‐axis, expressed in probabilities) of a standard deviation change in each economic covariate for respondents in the low, medium, and high sophistication categories (x‐axis). Figure 2 presents the estimates. Given that we are interested in the national versus local dichotomy, we do not discuss the interaction between personal financial situation and sophistication. Further, because the county index outperforms the media market index in each electoral contest (as given by the higher pseudo R2 and lower AIC and BIC), we present those estimates.         "
"62","Average Marginal Effect on Vote Probability for Geographic Indices"
"63","Source: Figures created by the authors. Dots indicate the estimated effect of an economic indicator (y‐axis) for respondents in a sophistication category (x‐axis). When the confidence interval straddles the zero line, the economic indicator has no significant effect.                     "
"64","When we examine Figure 2, we see a few general patterns. First, it would seem that the national index has the strongest effect for the least sophisticated voters, consistent with Gomez and Wilson's conclusion that sociotropic voting is strongest for the least sophisticated subset of the population.96 In contrast, the national index is insignificant for high sophisticates in two of the three models. In the end, the overall pattern is consistent with the earlier results. Second, while there is no definitive result with respect to the county index, the general pattern suggests that local economic voting is strongest for the most sophisticated voters. As we can see, the county index generally trends upward (the proper direction) as we move from low to high sophisticates. Again, however, while this result is consistent with earlier results, the findings are far from definitive given that the overall effect of the county index is only significant for high sophisticates in the presidential model and medium sophisticates in the Senate model.         "
"65","Where do voters derive their “sociotropic” evaluations and decide to vote for or against incumbent politicians? We explored this fundamental question using restricted geographic data from the American National Elections Studies. While dozens of studies test competing theories of economic voting using national indicators, there are plausible reasons (and some evidence) that economic voting manifests at the local level. As other authors note, economic voting could manifest at the local level because voters experience their local economy as a costless by‐product of their day‐to‐day routines, local economic conditions exhibit greater social salience than national conditions, or measures of the national economy mask variation in economic well‐being that manifests locally. Based on the results of two modeling strategies, however, and in contrast to arguments about the power of localism, the results show that economic voting in presidential and congressional elections is largely a function of variation in national economic conditions, with the national unemployment rate having robust effects in both contests. To the extent that voters cast their ballot based on variation in local conditions, it would seem that this effect is restricted to the most sophisticated voters.97 At best, however, the results are mixed on this conclusion.         "
"66","Why do national conditions trump local conditions? Although we can only speculate, in the theoretical section we discussed three plausible explanations. First, the results we uncover could be a product of federalism. As various authors note, presidents, senators, and representatives are all “functionally” responsible for managing the nation's economic well‐being. Second, from an information‐processing perspective, voters may be consuming more information about the national economy in large part because of the national news media. Third, national economic voting could be a function of the national nature of modern congressional campaigns. Simply put, nationalized campaigns and the strong linkage between presidential and congressional elections in the contemporary era may focus voters' attention on national conditions at the expense of candidate characteristics or local conditions."
"67","As a whole, we believe these results have a few implications for the literature on economic voting. Foremost is that, within the literature, the prevailing view is that sociotropic evaluations are the primary mechanism linking economic conditions and vote choice.98 Indeed, the results show that voters hold politicians responsible for maintaining the nation's social welfare. But what constitutes “the economy” and what “society” voters consider have been overlooked. In this light, we think the results of this study produce a clearer picture of what “sociotropic” is, exactly. As we documented in the literature review, the national nature of economic voting is not obvious.         "
"68","As a final matter, we think that our findings require a two acknowledgments. First, we want to point out that our conclusions regarding national economic voting in presidential and congressional elections are not in conflict with evidence of subnational economic voting in gubernatorial contests.99 Rather than being in conflict, both findings are consistent with the theory of functional responsibility (in which state actors are held accountable for state conditions and federal actors are held accountable for national conditions). Indeed, we contend that localism is a key component of some electoral outcomes, just not federal elections. Second, we want to acknowledge that there are more sophisticated ways of measuring respondents' local context. While we think the county and media market indicators used in our models give us some leverage over the questions motivating this study, more granular data and refined modeling strategies may uncover greater evidence of localism. For example, Reeves and Gimpel use GIS to identify an effect of “geotropic zones” on voters' sociotropic judgments,100 while work by McClurg notes the importance of neighborhood effects on electoral participation.101 In the end, an unresolved question is why local economic conditions seem to have these kinds of granular effects on voters' subjective economic evaluations and rates of electoral participation, while this study finds no direct effect on voting behavior. As is often the case, more research is needed.         "
