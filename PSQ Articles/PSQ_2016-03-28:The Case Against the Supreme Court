"1","As the contemporary U.S. Supreme Court weighs in on the meaning of marriage equality, the First Amendment's protections for expression, and the limits of government interventions to structure voting and the availability of health care, veteran Supreme Court litigator Erwin Chemerinsky offers a salient and often scathing indictment of the nation's highest tribunal: “The Court has frequently failed, throughout American history, at its most important tasks, at its most important moments” (p. 5). Chemerinsky's detailed historical and contemporary overview of the performance of the Supreme Court challenges perceptions that the Court has fulfilled its constitutional role of enforcing the Bill of Rights against repressive majorities and protecting politically powerless minorities."
"2","Chemerinsky's case—which could be read loosely as a merits brief—examines the historical issue areas of minority protections, times of crisis, property rights, and states' rights alongside contemporary issue areas of employee and consumer protection, abuses of government power, and campaign spending in making his case against the Court. The Earl Warren Court is an exception for Chemerinsky, although even here, he argues the Court could have done more to protect those accused of crimes and encourage public school desegregation. Indeed, some readers may wonder whether any Court during any period of American history could produce the social impacts that Chemerinsky desires. The book's concluding sections, which offer recommendations for improving the Court's exercise of judicial review, may serve as valuable supplementary readings in undergraduate classes on judicial politics, the Supreme Court, or American constitutional development."
"3","Unfortunately, the cherry‐picking of cases that Chemerinsky discusses briefly in the book's introduction (p. 11) presents readers with a one‐sided assessment of the Court's performance. This problem is not ameliorated by selectively culling cases from the Court's 226‐year history—it is exacerbated. Political scientists concerned with making inferences may require more than fleeting attention to “good” decisions such as West Virginia v. Barnette (1943) and U.S v. Nixon (1974). A more persuasive case might take account of instances of conservative Courts (including the Warren Burger, William Rehnquist, and John Roberts Courts) willing to protect or extend Warren Court's rights‐based claims.         "
"4","Chemerinsky's prescription for judicial review bears resemblance to John Hart Ely's Democracy and Distrust (1981), which essentially recommends justices look to footnote 4 of U.S. v. Carolene Products (1938) for guidance. Protection for powerless minorities and the integrity of the democratic process are unquestionably important purposes of the judiciary, but this prescription is complicated by competing judicial philosophies that give primacy to other substantive values (Justice Anthony Kennedy's continued emphasis on individual liberty) or methods of interpretation (Justice Antonin Scalia's originalism), as well as the entrenched “negative liberty” understanding of rights in the American constitutional tradition. Conservative and liberal rights claims exist, and both appear to be undergirded by sincerely held beliefs about what the American constitutional tradition requires. Furthermore, it is unclear how Chemerinsky's vision will be realized given the admission that justices are somewhat determined by ideologies, prevailing social currents, and elite status (pp. 293–294).         "
"5","Ultimately, Chemerinsky makes an important contribution to a long‐running scholarly discussion about the nature of judicial review in a constitutional democracy and to what end that power should be exercised. Chemerinsky is an authoritative voice in the legal academy, and his argument—accessible and thought‐provoking—is informed by decades of experience in litigation, research, and teaching. While the decisions selected in making the case against the Supreme Court may conjure revulsion that transcends ideological commitments, limiting the analysis to the Court's failures and the pluralism of existing interpretive methods and rights‐based claims raises more questions than answers."
