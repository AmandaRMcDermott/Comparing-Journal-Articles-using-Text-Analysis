"1","Pessimism about the prospects for positive change in the Arab world runs rampant amid the chaos of Libya and Syria or Egypt's revitalized authoritarianism. It is far too soon to give up, according to Juan Cole in The New Arabs. The Middle East is only at the beginning of a long process of change, and it is the rising generation of empowered, wired youth who will determine its outcome. Cole's counsel of guarded optimism and emphasis on long‐term trends offers a useful—albeit partial—corrective to common verdicts on the failure of the Arab uprisings.         "
"2","Cole offers detailed and well‐crafted, if familiar, narratives of the rise of political mobilization, the dizzying early days of the Arab Spring, and the tough political battles that followed. The great strength of Cole's engaging book lies in his determination to seek out and learn from the young Arabs on whom he focuses. Cole, a popular and influential blogger, is a leading historian with deep expertise in Egyptian history. He combines a deep historical perspective with the immediacy of his interactions with these young, cosmopolitan activists, many of whom he met through their awareness of his online writing. At times, his close identification with these activists can get in the way, as in his overly sympathetic account of the Tamarod campaign that led to Egypt's 3 July 2013 military coup."
"3","His diagnosis of their impatience with corrupt, inefficient, brutal regimes and the traditional political class alike rings true, though. Cole views the Arab uprisings as a manifestation of deep underlying structural problems that remain unresolved. The rising generation is more educated, more connected, and more aware of the failure of the old order than its predecessors. He sees little prospect for this generation to be easily integrated back into authoritarian structures."
"4","This may be overly optimistic, however. The long term emerges from a succession of short terms, and those look grim indeed. These new Arab youth might remain frustrated, creative, and restless, but today, they face a daunting combination of resurgent authoritarianism and horrific state failure. They are not all as liberal, secular, and cosmopolitan as they appear in this book. Islamists, young or old, get short shrift, as do the many apathetic youth who simply want better jobs and easier lives and the large sectors of youth who actively resent the protest culture. In none of the three countries on which he focuses are the major political forces exhausted by “secular dictatorships, left‐liberal middle‐class activists, and supporters of political Islam” (p. 27)."
"5","Cole's deeply felt revisionist take on the prospects of the Arab uprisings is well timed and sorely needed. Still, it risks going too far in minimizing the very real problems confronting the once‐hopeful transitions or the role youth activists played in them. Activists in today's Egypt face harsher official repression than ever before, with many leading lights of the 25 January revolution in prison or in exile. The glorious moments of unity in Tahrir Square proved fleeting. A full account of the political impact of these mobilized youth would need to account for the popular embrace of restored military rule in 2013 as well as the demands for regime overthrow in 2011. Indeed, Cole's assertion that these youth “refused to let themselves be divided and ruled” (p. 24) sounds like a cruel joke in today's deeply polarized Egypt or shattered, warring Libya. Deeper engagement with the political science literature on transitions and democratic consolidation could have helped temper the optimism expressed by these young activists—and offered guidance on how they could avoid the pitfalls that followed and are still to come. Anyone inspired by the early days of the Arab uprisings will be reassured by The New Arabs—but they may struggle to discern a road map for getting to the promised brighter future.         "
