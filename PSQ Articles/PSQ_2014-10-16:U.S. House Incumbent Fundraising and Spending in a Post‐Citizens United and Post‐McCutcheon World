"1","IN A LANDMARK CASE HANDED DOWN IN JANUARY 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, effectively ended source prohibitions for corporations, labor unions, and other groups making independent expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of a federal candidate.1 Then in March 2010, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals—relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United—ruled in SpeechNow v. FEC that political committees making only independent expenditures cannot constitutionally be subjected to source restrictions on funds used to finance the expenditures.2 Taken together, the rulings effectively legalized an outside spending regime for non‐party entities that had been taking shape since the 1990s. Left in place by the judicial decisions was the hard‐money regulatory framework governing funds donated to federal candidates, political parties, and political action committees (PACs) that contribute directly to federal candidates and parties. As a result, the federal campaign system is now effectively two systems. One system is made up of regulated money contributed by individuals, PACs, and parties directly to federal candidates, as well as party independent and coordinated expenditures. The other system is made up of unregulated money spent independently by wealthy individuals and non‐party groups. In the regulated system, contributions and spending are publicly disclosed; in the unregulated system, they are mostly not.         "
"2","This article explores the relationship between these two systems by evaluating changes in House incumbent fundraising behavior since the case was handed down. In particular, we evaluate the extent to which the unregulated campaign finance regime unleashed by Citizens United has induced incumbents to ratchet up their fundraising as a strategic response to this new uncertainty in the electoral environment. We also explore the impact of Citizens United on incumbent party–connected contributions—contributions made by House members to the party and its candidates. Incumbent financial support for the parties has grown dramatically in the past two decades.3 If the spending regime unleashed by Citizens United induces incumbents to hunker down into self‐protection mode, they may be less willing to redistribute funds to the party and its candidates. Pressure from nervous colleagues might also induce members who continue to redistribute money to direct more of their funds toward fellow incumbents, leaving fewer dollars for promising non‐incumbents. We also offer some thoughts on the implications of McCutcheon v. FEC (2014) for congressional parties and members of Congress.4 Finally, we close the article by discussing the recent venturing of incumbents and parties into the world of super PACs—defined by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as “independent‐expenditure‐only committees.”         "
"3","Several findings are noteworthy. First, although increases in House incumbent receipts during the 2012 election cycle were no greater than increases during recent presidential election cycles prior to Citizens United, incumbents increased the sums of money available to their own campaigns in 2012 by reducing the proportion of their overall campaign spending they devoted to party‐connected contributions. Second, as House members reserved more of their principal campaign committee (PCC) funds for their own campaigns, they have relied more heavily on leadership PACs to make party‐connected contributions. We also show that members are helping to assuage colleagues' perceptions of increased risk by devoting a greater percentage of their contributions to electorally safe fellow incumbents, leaving fewer resources for competitive non‐incumbents. Finally—and perhaps most importantly—the parties and some incumbents have ventured into the super PAC world themselves, promising to fundamentally reconfigure the shape of congressional campaign finance by harnessing the endless flow of funds to benefit themselves.         "
"4","In the contemporary era of professionalized, media‐centered campaigns, observers have characterized incumbent fundraising as a relentless money chase. The threat of unlimited sums spent by unregulated groups out to defeat them is likely to intensify incumbents' race for funds even further."
"5","Relentless fundraising is in part fueled by members' risk aversion. As Gary Jacobson points out, incumbents “tend to exaggerate electoral threats and over‐react to them” by spending beyond what is objectively necessary to win.5 Spending excessive sums and building large war chests can be viewed as a rational effort by incumbents to maximize certainty in what they perceive as a politically uncertain environment. Although most House members are safe most of the time, every member knows a colleague who was unexpectedly picked off by a challenger.         "
"6","House incumbents are, if nothing else, highly strategic actors who attempt to anticipate electoral trouble and prepare for uncertainty.6 They are acutely aware that changes in the political and regulatory context can impact their reelection fortunes, and they tend to respond to electoral uncertainty by ratcheting up their fundraising. The strategic‐actor perspective of House incumbents implies that members will pay careful attention to the new regulatory regime ushered in by the Supreme Court's rulings in Citizens United and SpeechNow, which has the potential to increase electoral uncertainty for incumbents by making it easier for unregulated groups to finance a campaign to defeat them. The threat of such a campaign would motivate House members to raise more campaign money to protect themselves, if only as insurance. These dynamics would be especially likely to occur in the first few election cycles following the court decisions, while members are still uncertain how groups will deploy their newly unleashed spending power in congressional campaigns.7"
"7","The Citizens United ruling is only the most recent development to turn up the fundraising heat on House incumbents. Increased outside spending in House contests had already intensified the money chase even prior to the Citizens United ruling.8 Compounding the pressure, congressional party leaders have increasingly leaned on House incumbents to help finance the party's campaign efforts.9 We discuss both of these developments in further detail below.         "
"8","Ending 40 years of Democratic control over the House, the GOP takeover of the House in 1994 ushered in a new period of intense partisan competition. The intense competition for control of the House spurred both House parties to step up their fundraising efforts, and leaders in both parties began leaning on incumbents to redistribute campaign funds from their war chests to the party congressional campaign committee (CCC) and fellow party candidates.10"
"9","The passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in 2002 increased the pressure that leaders exerted on House incumbents to support the party and its candidates financially. Among other changes ushered in by BCRA, the law prohibited the national party and federal officeholders from raising soft money. The loss of soft money was hardly inconsequential for the CCCs. In 2002—the last cycle in which the CCCs could still legally raise unregulated funds—the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spent $54.4 million in soft money, whereas the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spent $69.7 in such funds. One of the ways in which the Hill committees replaced such sums was by increasing the funds they raised from incumbents.11 In 2012, for example, House Republicans supplied the NRCC with 29 percent of its receipts, compared to 11 percent in 2004.         "
"10","Figure 1 demonstrates the extent to which House incumbents have become integral components of each party's fundraising network since 1994. House members have several ways of contributing to other candidates and to the CCCs. First, members can make contributions through their principal campaign committees, the committees that they organize to finance their own reelections. Second, members may contribute through a leadership political action committee (LPAC), a committee sponsored by incumbents to finance political activities outside of their own reelection campaigns. Federal law governing transactions from each of these committees varies.12"
"11","Figure 1 graphs the total contributions (in inflation‐adjusted 2012 dollars) made by House incumbents from their PCCs and LPACs to federal candidates and the CCCs between 1990 and 2012. As the figure shows, incumbent contributions grew sharply after 1994, when it became clear to incumbents of both parties that party control of the Congress would be up for grabs. Incumbents' contributions grew dramatically again with the 2004 election, the first election in which BCRA took effect. Such contributions then tailed off slightly in 2012, the first full election cycle following the Citizens United decision. Prior to 2008, the median inflation‐adjusted increase in member contributions between election cycles was 28 percent (the mean was 42 percent). By contrast, total House member contributions grew at a much smaller clip (13 percent) between 2008 and 2010 and actually decreased by roughly 14 percent from 2010 to 2012. These figures suggest that the parties could have raised more money from incumbents if something had not changed during this period to dampen members' enthusiasm for sharing their riches.         "
"12","Pressure to raise ever more money for the party and its candidates has made the money chase even more burdensome for House incumbents. Yet House members who neglect to comply with party leaders' calls for heightened generosity risk missing out on plum party and committee positions—control over which has been centralized in the party in the post‐reform era.13 To alleviate the tension between spending on their own campaigns and helping the party financially, House incumbents have increased the sums of money they raise, largely by raising more from business PACs and large individual donors.14"
"13","Compounding electoral uncertainty for incumbents has been the rapid and dramatic increase in outside spending by interest groups and political parties.15 Prior to BCRA, parties and groups were both spending significant sums of soft money on so‐called issue advocacy ads since 1994.16 Unambiguously designed to impact federal election outcomes, issue advocacy ads typically looked no different from express‐advocacy ads to the average viewer. But because these ads stopped short of using words such as “vote for” or “vote against”—words identified by the Supreme Court as markers of express advocacy17—they were legally considered issue‐advocacy rather than express‐advocacy communications, allowing them to be financed with soft money. BRCA was passed in 2002 to end these practices. For parties, BCRA put an end to issue advocacy by banning the national party committees from raising soft money. For groups, BCRA brought issue advocacy into the regulatory fold by effectively classifying these ads as “electioneering communications”—a new category of spending subject to regulation.18"
"14","Although the Supreme Court initially upheld these key provisions of BCRA in 2003,19 the Roberts Court soon began chipping away at the group restrictions. In 2007, for example, the Court in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life held that political communications can be regulated only if they are “susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.”20 Then in January 2010, the Court in Citizens United struck down source restrictions for corporations, labor unions, and other groups making express advocacy independent expenditures. Finally, only a few months later, in SpeechNow v. FEC, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that political committees making only independent expenditures cannot be subjected to source restrictions on funds used to finance the expenditures.21"
"15","According to data available from the Center for Responsive Politics, 83 super PACs were formed for the 2010 election cycle to take advantage of the new spending avenues opened by the courts. They spent $62.6 million in congressional contests. But this was merely the proverbial crack in the dam. The 2012 election cycle spurred the registration of 1,310 super PACs—255 of which made independent expenditures during the cycle. They spent nearly $610 million, nearly a 1,000 percent increase over 2010."
"16","Although super PACs garnered considerable media attention in the presidential campaigns—both during the primaries and in the general election—they also played a substantial role in congressional contests. The vast majority of the 2012 election cycle's active super PACs—88 percent—were involved in at least one House or Senate contest."
"17","The result has been a sizable increase in non‐party outside spending in House contests. Table 1 presents party and non‐party–independent expenditures, as well as party contributions and coordinated expenditures, for the 2008, 2010, and 2012 election cycles. In 2008, political parties enjoyed a significant advantage over non‐party entities in outside spending. But the party advantage began fading in 2010 and evaporated in 2012 after the Citizens United ruling. As is typical in the contemporary period, direct party contributions made up a tiny portion of party disbursements. Party‐coordinated expenditures grew somewhat between 2008 and 2010, but then leveled off in 2012. Note, too, the shift in non‐party spending from electioneering communications to independent expenditures. This shift is in part a result of the regulatory clarity brought by Citizens United regarding how non‐party entities may engage in outside spending.22 It also suggests that not all of the independent expenditures made in 2012 constituted new money in the system. Instead, at least some of these dollars were likely to have been displaced dollars—funds that prior to Citizens United probably flowed through 527s, 501(c)3, 4, 5, and 6 organizations, and state‐level organizations. After Citizens United, such spending could easily and legally be done through a super PAC.         "
"18","Super PACs also disturbed the equilibrium of federal elections through their involvement in primaries. Traditionally, PACs have played a nearly non‐existent role in primaries due to their desire to retain good relations (and access) to winners and/or to support a party's candidate rather than to influence the particular candidate who represents a party.23 Yet in 2012, groups such as The Campaign for Primary Accountability made news for trying to defeat congressional incumbents of both parties in primaries—merely because they were incumbents (rather than ideological groups trying to purge party moderates, such as Tea Party–oriented organizations like Freedom Works).24 The group met with some success: four candidates that it targeted for defeat lost, although three candidates that it supported also lost and eight candidates that it opposed won anyway. (A total of thirteen House incumbents lost in primaries in 2012.) Although the Campaign for Primary Accountability was unusual in its singular goal of defeating incumbents and in the number of congressional primaries in which it engaged (fifteen), it was not the only super PAC to get involved in congressional primaries. Data from the Center for Responsive Politics show that 27 super PACs (11 percent of super PACs involved in congressional contests in 2012) made independent expenditures on candidates who lost their primary elections. The sums of money that super PACs spent on behalf of primary election winners is more difficult to determine, because the Center does not distinguish between super PAC spending in the primaries and in general election campaigns for candidates who advance to the general. Nevertheless, the possibility of an organization involving itself in a primary would unnerve incumbents because so many now represent safe districts in which a primary challenge is the greatest electoral risk.         "
"19","Political observers have speculated that the unregulated campaign finance regime unleashed by Citizens United will induce incumbents, now facing newly empowered independent spenders, to ratchet up their fundraising even more in order to protect themselves against additional electoral risk.25 Reporting on the rush of U.S. Senate incumbents to build bigger‐than‐ever war chests for the 2014 elections, POLITICO reporter Tarini Parti writes that “It's the new normal that's necessary to stay competitive in the age of well‐funded super PACs and outside groups that can drop millions on TV ads in their states in an instant, both in primaries and general elections.”26 Incumbents must increasingly be prepared to defend themselves against outside forces willing to spend millions undercutting their reputation. Raising and spending money is a hedge against this uncertainty.         "
"20","Besides inducing House incumbents to raise more campaign funds, Citizens United could make House members less willing to share their campaign funds with the party and its candidates. In earlier work, we found that House incumbents helped alleviate the tension between spending on their own campaigns and supporting the party financially by increasing their campaign receipts from business PACs and large individual donors.27 But this arrangement may not be sustainable indefinitely—the pool of campaign money is not unlimited, and the costs of raising money climbs for each additional dollar raised.28 Moreover, many lawmakers claim to detest fundraising.29 Thus, the pressure to raise more funds to counter the threat of newly unregulated outside spenders may make House incumbents less willing to redistribute funds. Indeed, POLITICO reported that fears of outside spending were keeping House Democrats from giving to the DCCC in 2012: “Some Democrats say they haven't ponied up because they aren't fully confident in their own reelection prospects. Memories of 2010—when well‐funded Republican outside groups targeted them mercilessly in the final weeks of the campaign—have instilled fear they are no longer safe electorally.”30 Below we investigate the extent to which House incumbents are less enthusiastic about sharing their campaign funds with the party and its candidates in the post‐Citizens United world.         "
"21","Our strategy for evaluating the impact of Citizens United on House incumbent fundraising is to compare incumbent fundraising in 2007–8, 2009–10, and 2011–12. In this comparative framework, 2007–8 serves as the pre‐Citizens United cycle, 2009–10 is a transitional cycle, and 2011–12 is the first full cycle in which the Citizens United campaign finance regime was in place. Comparing incumbent fundraising across these three election cycles does not allow us to conclude definitively that any changes we see are due to Citizens United. But we can tentatively assess the extent to which Citizens United is a plausible explanatory culprit for any changes we uncover.         "
"22","Beginning with some descriptive data, Table 2 indicates that incumbent receipts grew sizably after 2008—and especially in 2012, the first full election cycle under the Citizens United campaign finance regime. Indeed, between 2008 and 2012, mean inflation‐adjusted House incumbent receipts grew by 12.5 percent (from $1.52 to $1.71 million). Table 2 also shows that party‐connected contributions by House incumbents grew as well, but they increased at a far slower clip than did total receipts. (Incumbent party–connected contributions include contributions from a member's PCC to other candidates and to the party CCC as well as contributions from the member's LPAC to other candidates. All are in inflation‐adjusted 2012 dollars.) In particular, the typical member increased his or her party‐connected contributions by only 3.6 percent between 2008 and 2012—and this followed a slight decrease in member contributions during the 2010 cycle. It is also noteworthy that between 2008 and 2012, the typical House member reduced the percentage of overall spending by his or her PCC devoted to party‐connected contributions. Thus, incumbents appear to be more protective of their PCC funds in the post‐Citizens United campaign finance regime. On the other hand, the percentage of House incumbents who sponsored LPACs grew from 53 to 63 percent from 2008 to 2012. Moreover, the percentage of total party‐connected contributions made by incumbents through LPACs also increased in 2010 and 2012. In sum, Citizens United appears to have induced members to make more party‐connected contributions through their LPACs, while reserving the increased sums they have been raising for their PCCs to counter a potential onslaught of independent spending.         "
"23","These are only descriptive data, of course, and there may be factors other than (but correlated with) Citizens United that account for the changes we see in Table 2. To isolate Citizens United as the cause of increased incumbent receipts in the post‐Citizens United world, we employ multivariate regression to control for other variables that impact House members' fundraising behavior.         "
"24","The first model for which we present results estimates House members' total receipts using several variables expected to impact such receipts. Some variables incorporate a member's capacity to extract funds from interest groups, such as holding a party or committee leadership post, membership in the majority party, and freshman status. The party uses such factors in setting members' “dues”—which for some positions are six‐figure sums. Other variables capture a member's need to raise and spend money for his or her own re‐election: cash on hand at the beginning of the election cycle, being in a competitive contest, challenger spending, and the sums of party contributions, party‐coordinated expenditures, and party and non‐party–independent expenditures in the race. Using various group and party expenditures as independent variables is, in some respects, temporally problematic because many such expenditures are made in the final few weeks of the election, well after incumbents raise a sizable portion of their funds. But whereas incumbents may not know the precise sums of group and party spending that will occur in their contests, they can probably arrive at a rough estimate of such spending—if only because they know that money flows to the most‐competitive contests. Additionally, members have an array of other types of knowledge to help them estimate opposition spending, including the quality and experience of their challenger, early fundraising numbers reported to the FEC, the partisan make‐up of their district and election results from past cycles, party targeting lists, the cash‐on‐hand of PACs that have opposed them (and members like them) in the past, and lists of competitive contests from Rothenberg, Cook, and Congressional Quarterly. At the very least, actual group expenditures in an incumbent's contest can serve as a useful proxy measure for expenditures anticipated by the member.            "
"25","Importantly, we also include variables for the 2010 and 2012 election cycles in the model. Doing so permits us to compare incumbent receipts in 2010 and 2012 (after Citizens United was handed down) with incumbent receipts in 2008 (prior to the Citizens United decision), while controlling for the factors noted above. Because some House incumbents appear multiple times in the data set, we use fixed‐effects regression. Incorporating fixed effects into the models allows us to control for difficult‐to‐measure incumbent characteristics, assumed to remain constant over time for each incumbent, which may influence incumbent fundraising.31 See Table A1 in the appendix for details on the measurement of all variables.            "
"26","The regression results in Table 3 suggest that Citizens United may have fueled an across‐the‐board increase in House incumbent receipts, at least in 2012—the first full election cycle after the case was decided. As we would expect, House incumbent receipts are driven by a combination of institutional and contest‐specific electoral factors—the latter including the competitiveness of the race, challenger spending, and non‐party–independent expenditures (IEs). Non‐party IEs are especially important in driving up incumbent receipts, with incumbents increasing their receipts by an average of $0.48 for every $1.00 of non‐party independent spending in their contest. But even with these variables controlled, the coefficient for the 2012 election cycle dummy is large, positive, and statistically significant. On average, House incumbents raised $246,389 more in 2012 than they did in 2008. The difference between incumbent receipts in 2012 and 2010 is also statistically significant. Given that 2012 was the first full post‐Citizens United cycle, one plausible—if tentative—interpretation of the positive coefficient for 2012 is that House incumbents were protecting themselves against the threat of newly empowered independent spenders permitted by the court decision. We do not yet see the Citizens United effect in 2010, as evidenced by the statistically insignificant 2010 coefficient, most likely because the case was decided midway through the 2010 election cycle.            "
"27","To be sure, the 2012 dummy coefficient could be capturing other features of the 2012 cycle not controlled in our regression. For example, incumbents' increased receipts in 2012 might simply be a response to more‐volatile election swings since 2006, although, if that were true, we should expect to see a statistically significant increase in incumbent receipts in 2010 as well. Alternatively, it may be that the expectation of a close presidential contest in 2012 caused House incumbents to ratchet up their receipts. With only one full election cycle after Citizens United, this alternative explanation is impossible to rule out.            "
"28","The increase in average incumbent receipts in 2012 could also be a result of 2012 being the first election year in a new redistricting cycle. According to this logic, the increased electoral insecurity associated with redrawn districts would induce incumbents to raise more money. If the redistricting hypothesis is correct, we would also expect to see a substantial increase in incumbent receipts during the 2002 election cycle, the previous start of a new redistricting cycle. We do not. Between the 2000 and 2002 elections, members increased their total receipts only marginally, and not at all when controlling for inflation. (Results not shown.)"
"29","More problematic for attributing the increase in House incumbent receipts in 2012 to Citizens United is that House incumbents may always increase their receipts, over and above inflation, between pairs of presidential election years. In this scenario, the increase in House incumbent receipts we see between 2008 and 2012 would be similar to increases in receipts between any pairs of recent presidential elections. Table 4 shows this to be true. In the five pairs of presidential elections between 1992 and 2012, the percentage increase in average inflation‐adjusted House incumbent receipts from the prior presidential cycle is strikingly similar. The exception is 1992–1996, with a notably higher rate of increase than the other pairs of presidential election cycles. Taken together, these figures suggest that Citizens United was probably not the cause of the increase in House incumbent receipts we find between 2008 and 2012. Instead, the increase in House incumbent receipts from 2008 to 2012 appears to be a continuation of a trend that had been occurring prior to Citizens United. We revisit this issue below and place it in the context of our other findings.            "
"30","Using the same control variables as above, the regression results shown in Table 5 evaluate the extent to which incumbent contributions have changed as House members have transitioned into the post‐Citizens United campaign finance regime. The regression results in column 1 show that member contributions in the 2008–2012 period have mostly been driven by institutional features. Elected party leaders, committee chairs, and majority party members all redistribute greater sums of campaign funds to the party and its candidates than do members without these advantages. Although challenger spending significantly drives down incumbent contributions, independent expenditures (either party or non‐party) appear not to do so. Importantly, while the coefficients for 2010 and 2012 are positive, they are not statistically significant.         "
"31","The second column of regression results in Table 5 shows that following the Citizens United decision, the typical House member decreased the percentage of overall spending from his or her PCC devoted to party‐connected contributions. For example, according to the coefficient for 2012, House members devoted, on average, roughly 4 percent less of their total campaign spending to party‐connected contributions in 2012 than they did in 2008. Because the typical incumbent spent roughly $1.66 million in 2012, a 4 percent reduction in funds redistributed to the party adds up to $67,400 in additional funds available for the incumbent's own campaign. Moreover, unlike the typical increases in House incumbent receipts between presidential election cycles, a reduction in PCC campaign spending devoted by incumbents to party‐connected contributions has not been typical from one presidential election cycle to the next. Indeed, of the five pairs of presidential election cycles analyzed in Table 4, only between 2008 and 2012 did House incumbents reduce the proportion of their overall PCC campaign spending devoted to party‐connected contributions. Thus, although increases in House incumbent receipts in 2012 were no greater than increases in House incumbent receipts in recent presidential election cycles prior to Citizens United, incumbents did increase the sums of money available to their campaigns in 2012 by reducing the proportion of overall campaign spending from their principal campaign committees devoted to party‐connected contributions.         "
"32","Alternatively, the decrease in party‐connected contributions as a percentage of PCC spending in 2012 might be a result of a new redistricting cycle. In this scenario, the increased electoral insecurity resulting from redrawn districts would induce incumbents to devote a smaller percentage of their campaign spending to party‐connected contributions. If the redistricting hypothesis is correct, we would expect members to have decreased the shares of campaign money they devoted to party‐connected contributions in 2002, the previous start to a redistricting cycle. But we found only a tiny (.50)—and statistically distinguishable from 0—decline in party‐connected contributions as a percentage of PCC spending between the 2000 and 2002 election cycles."
"33","As the negative and statistically significant coefficient for non‐party IEs in column 2 indicates, non‐party–independent spending in a member's race also had a negative impact on the percentage of total PCC spending that the member was willing to devote to party‐connected contributions. Not surprisingly, then, incumbents hunker down when faced with outside spending in their contest—something that was true even before Citizens United. But by removing source prohibitions for independent expenditures, Citizens United has made such spending much easier for non‐party entities, and thus potentially a greater threat to incumbents. If the independent spenders unleashed by Citizens United increase their spending in future election cycles, the congressional parties can perhaps expect less financial support from House incumbents' PCCs.         "
"34","It is worth noting that the new threat of outside spending has not eliminated the factors that have traditionally caused incumbents anxiety. As the regression results in column 2 show, challenger spending and being in a competitive contest also decreased the percentage of total PCC spending that incumbents devoted to party‐connected contributions. This is indicated by the negative and statistically significant coefficients for these variables in the second regression. But the outside spending unleashed by Citizens United has added to incumbent insecurities, which may ultimately induce members to be less generous in funding the party and its candidates.         "
"35","In earlier work, we showed that House members were more likely to sponsor LPACs when party‐connected contributions made through incumbents' PCCs began “crowding out” the funds available for their own reelection efforts.32 If Citizens United has placed yet additional pressure on members—forcing them to make a choice between protecting themselves and giving to the party—we might expect to see incumbents redistribute party‐connected contributions through an LPAC rather than through their PCCs. The regression results in columns 3 and 4 of Table 4 suggest that this is occurring. First, the statistically significant and positive coefficient for 2012 in the probit regression (column 3) indicates that House incumbents were significantly more likely to sponsor LPACs in 2012 than in 2008. Indeed, with all of the control variables held at their means, House members were 18 percentage points more likely to sponsor an LPAC in 2012 than they were in 2008. Second, the statistically significant and positive coefficients for both 2010 and 2012 in column 4 demonstrate that, unlike total member contributions (column 1), member contributions from incumbents' LPACs increased significantly after Citizens United. The number of members sponsoring LPACs was growing at a remarkable clip even before Citizens United, but the uncertain electoral environment created by the court decision appears to have made these committees even more popular with House incumbents.33 By giving more money through an LPAC—the funds from which cannot legally be used to support a member's own reelection efforts—a member can reserve a greater sum of money in his or her principal campaign committee to counter an onslaught of independent spending, should one occur. Importantly for the bigger picture, members were forced to turn to LPACs if they wanted to maintain their level of funding to the parties, showing how the tension between reelection and redistribution forces incumbents to expand the ways in which they raise campaign money. Much of the campaign money raised by House incumbents comes as a result of their own solicitation.34 Donors seeking access to lawmakers, of course, have an incentive to respond generously. But a greater reliance on LPACs is not good news for the parties since PAC contributions to CCCs are capped at $15,000 per election whereas contributions from PCCs to the CCCs are unlimited. Tapping their members for large contributions from their PCCs is one key method by which party leaders have helped fund the CCCs since the implementation of BCRA.35"
"36","The Supreme Court's ruling in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (2014), which invalidated aggregate limits and sub‐limits governing individual donors, may offer some help for the parties. Indeed, seeking to demonstrate the potential corruption associated with the absence of aggregate limits, Justice Stephen Breyer's dissenting opinion in McCutcheon outlined several scenarios by which the Court's ruling could give parties and leaders new avenues for raising sizable sums of hard money. Joint fundraising committees, which were common but limited prior to the McCutcheon ruling, figured prominently in Breyer's discussion.         "
"37","Joint fundraising committees allow candidates and parties to join forces to raise money, sharing the overhead costs. In congressional elections, the largest joint fundraising operations tend to be organized by congressional party leaders. Participants in a joint fundraising committee cannot legally receive any more money from an individual contributor than if the contributor gave to them directly. But the joint fundraising arrangement permits the contributor to write one large check to the committee organizer, who then allocates the money to the designated candidates and party committees according to federal limits. Prior to the McCutcheon ruling, inflation‐adjusted aggregate limits on individual donors restricted the sum a donor could give to a joint fundraising committee to $123,000 (the 2013–14 aggregate limit). The aggregate sublimit for individual contributions to federal candidates—$48,600 in 2013–14—played an especially important role in limiting the scope and reach of these committees. For example, prior to the McCutcheon ruling, an individual donor maxing out at $2,600 per candidate would hit the aggregate sub‐limit for federal candidates of $48,600 after giving to only 18 candidates. With the aggregate limits gone, joint fundraising committees can in theory become much larger, meaning that donors can write much larger checks to committee organizers. For example, Speaker John Boehner might now conceivably set up a joint fundraising committee that includes, say, 100 Republican House candidates. Boehner could then ask wealthy individual donors to contribute $2,600 (the inflation‐adjusted per‐candidate limit for 2013–14) to each candidate. The contributions from just one donor would amount to $260,000—or $520,000 if the donor gave the maximum contribution to each candidate's primary and general election campaign. If the NRCC participated in the joint fundraising committee, individual donors could give an additional $64,800 directly to the joint fundraising committee over a two‐year cycle. Donors could also kick in $20,000 to any state parties involved in the joint fundraising effort. “Will party officials and candidates solicit these large contributions from wealthy donors?” Breyer asks in his dissenting opinion. “Absolutely,” he answers.36 We revisit McCutcheon's potential impact in the concluding section.         "
"38","Apart from the total amount that members of Congress redistribute to their party and its candidates, how incumbents allocate their contributions tells us about their goals and provides an important source of funds for the beneficiaries. In earlier work, we provided evidence that parties have become increasingly effective at steering incumbent campaign contributions toward candidates who would help the party win majority status (non‐incumbents for the minority party, endangered incumbents for the majority party) and away from safe incumbents who could help members achieve individualistic goals.37 If the new spending unleashed by Citizens United has affected members of Congress's perceptions of what it means to be electorally “safe,” we are likely to see members shift their funds toward safe incumbents, thus helping friends and allies decrease their risk from outside groups.         "
"39","Using Congressional Quarterly (CQ) ratings of competitive districts, we categorize contributions based on whether they were given to non‐incumbent candidates (challengers and open‐seat candidates), incumbents in competitive contests (rated at any level of competiveness by CQ), or safe incumbents. In Table 6, we present the percentage of total incumbent contributions given to non‐incumbents, safe incumbents, and competitive incumbents by Democrats and Republicans in the 2008–2012 election cycles.         "
"40","The percentages given to non‐incumbents (and endangered incumbents) respond to the electoral environment in the expected manner. The 2008 election was a promising cycle for Democrats, and 2010 was a good one for Republicans. In those years, the advantaged party invested heavily in non‐incumbents in an attempt to expand their number of seats (56.7 percent for Democrats in 2008; 75.2 percent for Republicans in 2010). The disadvantaged party shifted to incumbent protection mode with minority Republicans spending 47.9 percent on endangered incumbents in 2008, and Democrats spending 66.5 percent on them in 2010. The political environment in 2012 was more neutral. Majority Republicans spent 35.1 percent of their funds protecting at‐risk incumbents and 34.7 percent on non‐incumbents. Minority party Democrats, needing additional seats to win back the majority they lost in 2010, allocated 56.8 percent of their funds to non‐incumbents and 25.3 percent to endangered incumbents."
"41","We might expect that spending on safe incumbents would also respond to the political environment as incumbents take money from colleagues in uncompetitive contests to invest in races that could affect majority status in years that have a clear partisan tilt. That is not what we find in Table 6. Instead, we see an increase in aggregate and percentage spending on safe incumbents for both parties from 2008 to 2012. The shift is particularly notable from 2010 to 2012, where we would expect incumbents to react to the potential impact of Citizens United. To put these numbers in perspective, the GOP's routing of 30.2 percent of contributions to safe incumbents in 2012 is double their 15.5 percent rate from 1996 to 2006; similarly for Democrats, the percentage jumps to 18 percent in 2012 from 11.5 percent in the earlier period. While there is likely to be some incentive to shift money to pursue individualistic goals when majority status seems unlikely to change in an election cycle (as in 2012), the magnitude of the investment in safe incumbents by members of both parties lends credence to the possibility that they are providing additional protection to members who might face an outside spending onslaught.         "
"42","The shift of redistribution toward safe incumbents has come at the expense of non‐incumbents. In each election cycle, the total amount and the percentage amount donated to non‐incumbents has declined from $17.5 million (51.8 percent) in 2008 to $16.6 million (46.1 percent) in 2010, to $16.0 million (43.5 percent) in 2012. This shift in incumbent redistribution is particularly perilous for challengers, who already face difficulty in attracting funding, particularly from access‐oriented interest groups.38 Parties are more willing to spend on challengers when they demonstrate that they can raise money and run a professional campaign. But as Table 6 shows, challengers will also get dropped by their parties when times are tough as the party prioritizes protecting its incumbents. If outside spending creates greater risk for incumbents, and incumbents have traditionally used party organizations to protect themselves first,39 a key party source of funds for the most‐promising challengers would be limited. Without well‐funded challengers, the already‐limited competitiveness of congressional elections would diminish.         "
"43","It would be striking if a new source of campaign funds entered the political universe and members of Congress did not find a way to tap it for their own benefit. Yet two significant barriers stand in the way. First is the limitation that super PACs cannot coordinate with the candidates they benefit. Second is BCRA's restriction limiting members of Congress from soliciting contributions greater than $5,000."
"44","Regardless of these restrictions, three of the four congressional party caucuses have openly associated themselves with super PACs. The super PACs are headed by former leadership aides or former staff of the CCCs. Essentially, then, these organizations are super PAC extensions of the CCCs. Their independent expenditures are targeted to the party's candidates in the most‐competitive contests. As such, they are “party‐connected” expenditures because they assist the party in increasing its share of seats in the chamber, thus assisting the party's quest for majority status.40 Senate Democratic leaders have raised funds for the Senate Majority PAC, which spent $37.5 million on behalf of 24 Democratic Senate candidates in 2012.41 Similarly, Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi has raised funds for the House Majority PAC, which spent over $30 million on 82 Democratic House candidates in 2012.42 On the Republican side, The Congressional Leadership Fund is the super PAC aligned with the House GOP leadership.43 It targeted nearly $9.5 million to 14 House contests in 2012.         "
"45","Congressional leaders have been able to circumvent BCRA's limitations by appearing as headliners at the organizations' fundraisers or by making personal solicitation of mega‐donors, but without asking for a specific amount or by asking for $5,000. Other staff members of the organizations follow up with the big ask.44"
"46","The fine line that congressional leaders walk in supporting super PACs is illustrated by the YG Action Fund Super PAC. The “YG” brand encompasses several organizations run by former staffers of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and is associated with the “Young Guns” group of House Republicans led by Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, and House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan.45 (Cantor was defeated in a primary in 2014, and McCarthy subsequently became majority leader.) The YG Action Fund spent $4.7 million on 11 GOP House candidates in 2012. Yet when the super PAC made several independent expenditures in GOP primaries that inflamed divisions within the party, Cantor distanced himself from its decisions, arguing “this is an outside group that I have no control over” and “there are none of us federal officials that can be connected, involved with these super PACs and their decisions to spend money.”46"
"47","Senate Republicans are the only Hill caucus that had not aligned themselves with a super PAC by the end of the 2012 election cycle. POLITICO reporters John Bresnahan, Manu Raju, and Jake Sherman described Senate Republican leaders as “holding back” in raising funds for the super PAC.47 They noted that Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell had raised funds for American Crossroads, but not its super PAC. Instead, McConnell has been active in working with joint fundraising committees to raise and direct large sums to GOP Senate candidates.48"
"48","At the same time, McConnell illustrates another key feature of the new relationship between super PACs and congressional campaigns—the single‐candidate‐oriented super PAC. As McConnell geared up for his 2014 reelection campaign, Progress Kentucky, a liberal super PAC organized to oppose him, made national news for recording private conversations of the senator and his staff. The controversy forced Progress Kentucky to close up shop.49 At the same time, a pro‐McConnell super PAC, Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, formed and started airing advertisements to assist his campaign.50 As of August 2013 (more than a year before the election), Kentuckians for Strong Leadership had raised nearly $1.2 million and spent over $570,000 attacking McConnell's Democratic opponent, Kentucky Secretary of State Alice Lundergan Grimes.         "
"49","Our analysis of super PAC involvement in 2012 congressional campaigns shows that Senator McConnell is not alone in having a super PAC to supplement a single congressional campaign. These super PACs are presumably sponsored by allies of the congressional candidate who wish to spend beyond the maximum hard money limits for contributions to candidates. As Table 7 shows, 56 percent of super PACs involved solely in the 2012 congressional campaigns spent only to advocate or defeat a single candidate. Even this percentage underestimates the single‐candidate orientation of congressional super PACs. An additional 28 super PACs made independent expenditures for or against multiple candidates in the same contest—that is, they made independent expenditures supporting one candidate and opposing one or more of the opponents. Thus, fully 73 percent of congressional super PACs in 2012 were essentially a vehicle to influence the outcome of a single contest. David Magleby similarly finds that single‐candidate super PACs outnumbered party‐oriented and interest group super PACs in the 2012 election even among the largest super PACs that spent over a million dollars.51"
"50","Three of the single‐candidate super PACs were aligned with Representatives Henry Waxman and Howard Berman of California, two of the innovators of the practice of redistributing funds in congressional campaigns.52 Owing to redistricting in California, Berman was forced to run against fellow Democratic incumbent Brad Sherman. Berman's Hollywood supporters formed two super PACs to assist him. The Committee to Elect Effective Valley Congressmen spent $1.4 million advocating for Berman, whereas Californians for Integrity in Government spent $263,000 promoting Berman and $224,000 attacking Sherman. Despite the generous engagement of his “personal” super PACs, Berman lost, in part because the new district incorporated 60 percent of the territory of Sherman's old district. Congressman Waxman, in contrast, did not face a competitive contest (and has not faced one in years), yet was still assisted with $100,000 in promotional efforts from the Committee for an Effective and Trusted Congressman.         "
"51","Table 7 also shows that single‐candidate‐allied congressional super PACs run the gamut of sizes of super PACs. It would be easy to expect that single‐candidate organizations would be concentrated among the small super PACs, whereas the larger congressional super PACs would function more like traditional party organizations and PACs by funding many candidates across the country. This trend is certainly apparent in Table 7, but single‐candidate or single‐contest (two candidates in the same race) super PACs also have a notable presence among the biggest‐spending super PACs, primarily in Senate campaigns.         "
"52","The single‐candidate orientation of super PACs also appears to be more‐pronounced than that of committees making independent expenditures prior to Citizens United. Center for Responsive Politics data on the 2008 election cycle shows that only 28 percent of groups who spent more than $25,000 targeted a single candidate.53 Nearly two thirds (63 percent) of those groups spent less than $50,000, and several of the single‐candidate‐oriented groups were local party organizations and labor unions that were unlikely to be vehicles for supporting a single candidate over multiple election cycles. Super PACs, therefore, appear to be targeting their spending more narrowly on particular favored or disfavored candidates than their predecessors. At least in this vein, they do not appear to be a new label for the same old election activity.         "
"53","In short, while super PACs have certainly upset the equilibrium in congressional campaigns, parties and members of Congress have not merely huddled in a defensive crouch. We already see indications that they are responding to the new risks by trying to channel the gushers of funds to flow in their favor, if not entirely under their control. Much in the way that former party staff members reacted to BCRA's ban on soft money by establishing 527 organizations as alternative vehicles for large contributions,54 so now do parties and candidates appear to be using allied super PACs as a buffer against hostile super PACs.         "
"54","The Citizens United decision has created a large spending avenue outside of party and candidate campaigns. To an even greater extent than BCRA, the ruling has disrupted the federal campaign finance equilibrium in the short term and promises to usher in a new—and potentially very different—equilibrium in future federal campaigns. For now, the Citizens United ruling has essentially left the United States with two congressional campaign finance systems: one of regulated money contributed by individuals, PACs, and parties directly to federal candidates, and one of unregulated money spent independently by individuals and non‐party groups. Comparing House incumbent fundraising in the election cycle immediately prior to Citizens United (2008), during the transition (2010), and following the ruling (2012) allows us to explore the impact of the case on incumbent campaign finances.         "
"55","We show that the new independent‐expenditure regime unleashed by Citizens United has already begun to impact the hard‐money system. First, incumbents increased the sums of money available to their own reelection campaigns by reducing the proportion of their overall campaign spending that they devoted to party‐connected contributions. Second, as House members reserved more of their PCC funds for their own campaigns, they relied more heavily on LPACs to make party‐connected contributions. We also show that members are helping to assuage colleagues' perceptions of increased risk by devoting a greater percentage of their contributions to electorally safe fellow incumbents, leaving fewer resources for competitive non‐incumbents. Finally—and perhaps most importantly—the parties and some incumbents have ventured into the super PAC world, promising to reconfigure the shape of congressional campaign finance by harnessing the endless flow of funds to benefit themselves. Increased incumbent anxiety over campaign funds is an all but inevitable response to electoral uncertainly of any type; we should therefore not be surprised to see it as a response to Citizens United. For the foreseeable future, Citizens United will probably continue to intensify the incumbent hard‐money chase and, perhaps ultimately, push more and more incumbents into the super PAC world.         "
"56","We saw glimpses of incumbent involvement in the super PAC world during the 2012 election cycle, with the emergence of super PACs to support the campaigns of single candidates. Because presenting imposing fundraising numbers has traditionally been a way in which incumbents have sought to deter quality challengers,55 having an allied super PAC would probably help incumbents to discourage potential challengers and well‐heeled super PACs from taking them on. We can only speculate about the extent to which incumbents themselves are involved in the funding and operation of super PACs. But it defies much of what we know about incumbents to think that they would remain truly independent of this type of political operation.         "
"57","The post‐Citizens United regime offers mixed news for those who favor strong parties. On the positive side, House incumbents continue to remain committed—at least for now—to assisting their parties financially. Incumbents have, however, changed the way they are helping their parties, reserving more of their principal campaign committee funds for themselves and instead relying more heavily on LPACs to make party‐connected contributions. This is a highly unfavorable change for the party CCCs, which had become heavily reliant on the unlimited contributions from members' PCCs. The $15,000 cap on contributions from LPACs severely limits the CCCs' financial take from incumbents. Additional trouble for the parties is apparent in incumbents shifting their contribution strategies, devoting a greater percentage of their contributions to incumbent colleagues in non‐competitive races—and providing fewer resources to competitive non‐incumbents. Thus, although House incumbents have not cut back on their party‐connected contributions, they have shifted how they finance and allocate those contributions.         "
"58","The Supreme Court's ruling in McCutcheon may, we noted, help congressional party leaders counter the interest group advantage ushered in by Citizens United by expanding the scope and reach of joint fundraising committees. Worth noting here is that the ability to market a large joint fundraising committee is not spread equally across House incumbents. In the U.S. House, where power has increasingly become centralized in the parties (especially the majority party), the top party leaders will inevitably be the members who possess the fundraising clout required to head up the most‐extensive joint fundraising committees. In this respect, it may be that the large joint fundraising committees to emerge following McCutcheon will occupy a similar place in the party network as did the leadership PACs that emerged in the earlier post‐Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) regime—the period before seemingly every member of Congress sponsored his or her own leadership PAC. Organized almost exclusively by the top party leaders and leadership aspirants, such committees would be designed to advance the party's collective electoral fortunes while simultaneously advancing the individual power aims of their principals.         "
"59","The elimination of aggregate hard‐money limits—and the anticipated bolstering of joint fundraising committees—does not mean that congressional party leaders will no longer see utility in forging ties with an allied super PAC. To be sure, joint fundraising committees, which deal only in regulated hard money, offer the benefit of allowing congressional party leaders to (legally) solicit donors directly. But having ties with an allied super PAC, even if murkier from a legal standpoint, will probably remain attractive to congressional party leaders. Compared to a joint fundraising committee, an allied super PAC offers an organizationally nimble structure that can be entirely financed by a few mega donors. Of course, there is nothing forcing party leaders to choose between a large joint fundraising committee and an allied super PAC. As with large interest groups that employ a multi‐faceted organizational structure, congressional parties and leaders can be expected to deploy whatever mix of organizational tools will best help them achieve their strategic aims. We expect leaders to use super PACs and joint fundraising committees to maximize the amount of money they can direct to the party's priority contests."
"60","Although the McCutcheon ruling will probably help political parties, it remains unclear how far such a boost would go in offsetting the interest group advantage brought about by the Citizens United ruling. Following years of increases, House incumbents decreased the percentage of total PCC spending they devoted to party‐connected contributions in 2012. At a certain point, the need for more and more money to protect themselves against independent spenders unleashed by Citizens United may force incumbents to reduce even more substantially their financial assistance to the parties. Moreover, continued efforts by some incumbents to fortify the campaigns of nervous colleagues are likely to come at the expense of non‐incumbent candidates, further shrinking the limited pool of donors on which non‐incumbents can draw. Less money available for non‐incumbents could, in turn, negatively impact the ability of the parties to recruit quality candidates. Super PAC involvement in primaries could exacerbate these trends by making even incumbents in one‐sided districts feel less secure and thus less willing to share their campaign funds with the party and fellow party candidates.         "
"61","As with incumbents, the congressional parties have also begun adapting to the post‐Citizens United regime by venturing into the super PAC world. Although legally independent from the parties, these party‐connected super PACs are routinely run by familiar faces in the party network—former staffers, fundraisers, and political operatives. Yet such developments are not completely free of potential problems for proponents of strong parties. For the formal party organizations and their leaders, such committees carry the risk of going off message or having different spending priorities—potentially inflaming party factions and undermining the party's collective campaign efforts. Certainly such factional disputes were evident in the 2012 cycle. Without funding centralized in the formal party committees, it is unclear whether even the empowered congressional party leaders of the post‐reform era can rein in these factions.         "
"62","For incumbents and parties, all such forays into super PAC territory stretch the boundaries of “independent” expenditures and inevitably return elected officials to the big‐money game. These are the very arrangements that have so often vexed American political reformers, and their concerns will be familiar to those who have followed the development of American campaign finance.56 For elected officials, the level of fundraising required to support a super PAC means cozying up to those who possess sizable financial assets and, more often than not, seek access to policymakers who can advance their interests. Such cozying almost inevitably means better representation of well‐heeled interests and the ultra‐wealthy, running the risk that public policy in the United States will become less representative than it already is of the preferences of ordinary Americans.57 As has occurred in the past, such developments—perhaps reaching a crescendo in a high‐profile scandal—may galvanize political reformers to push for new reforms, starting yet another (familiar) chapter in the ongoing struggle to reform U.S. campaign finance laws.         "
