"1","In this thought‐provoking and well‐researched book, Patrick M. Garry rejects the modern Court's view of the Bill of Rights—that it was included in the Constitution to preserve individual autonomy by insulating the individual from various democratic outcomes. He argues instead that it was “designed primarily to better ensure the maintenance of limited government within the constitutional scheme” (p. 2). He contends that the individual‐autonomy model departs from the original intent of those who drafted and ratified the Bill of Rights, separates it from the structural orientation of the Constitution as a whole, and fosters judicial activism by converting its provisions into rights‐bearing constitutional trump cards that judges at their discretion can play whenever they find government to have impacted on their understanding of individual freedom and autonomy. By contrast, his limited‐government model (and he claims originality for it, see p. 5) is faithful to James Madison's explanation to the First Congress, when he proposed a bill of rights, that its purpose was “to limit and qualify the powers of the government,” harmonizes the Bill of Rights with the original Constitution by understanding that it is simply another structural feature of the Constitution that, along with separation of powers and federalism, is intended to limit the power of government, and promotes judicial restraint and objectivity as judges are not required to define the parameters of individual autonomy but rather need only focus on whether a particular right is necessary for maintaining limited government."
"2","Garry devotes a chapter to separation of powers and federalism—to the structural features of the Constitution that Madison, in The Federalist, No. 51, called a “double security” for individual rights. Liberty, the Framers believed, was best secured through limited government and through those constitutional structures that checked, diffused, and divided governmental power. He argues that the Bill of Rights, providing structural limitations on governmental power and authority, added, as it were, a third security. He notes that the original limited‐government understanding of the Bill of Rights can be seen when Madison opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts not because they impinged on an individual's right to free speech but because the First Amendment prohibited the government from acting in this arena.         "
"3","What would a Bill of Rights jurisprudence look like if it were based solely on the limited‐government model? Garry is a law professor and distinguished First Amendment scholar, and he spends the bulk of his book answering that question, with most of his examples involving speech and religious freedoms. Concerning speech, the limited‐government model would give political speech the highest First Amendment protection, because it is essential to maintaining democratic society's ability to control and limit the power of government. However, it would provide for far less protection to nonpolitical speech (for example, commercial speech, sexually explicit entertainment, and violent video games) because that speech is not aimed at limiting governmental power. Concerning the Establishment Clause, it would reject the Court's endorsement test and its creation of a minority “dissenter's right” to object to public displays of religious symbols. Garry takes the reader through scores of cases in which the employment of a limited‐government approach to the First Amendment would often (but not invariably) result in a different outcome from the Court's individual autonomy approach."
"4","Garry's command of the relevant scholarly literature is impressive—his Notes section comprises 51 pages. His knowledge of case law and his ability succinctly to summarize complex decisions are admirable. While it excessively repeats its key claims, The Bill of Rights and Limited Government is ambitious in what it sets out to do and successful in what it accomplishes. It deserves the careful attention of all constitutional scholars.         "
