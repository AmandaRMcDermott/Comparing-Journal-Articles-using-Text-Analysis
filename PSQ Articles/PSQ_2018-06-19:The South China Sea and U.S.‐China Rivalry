"1","IS THE SOUTH CHINA SEA a key flash point for U.S.‐China rivalry or a tempest in a teacup? This article examines the body of water from a geopolitical perspective and concludes that it is a significant flash point in U.S.‐China rivalry. By “rivalry,” I mean an antagonistic relationship between two states embroiled in “long‐term hostility” and competition manifested in “multiple disputes, continuing [policy] disagreements and the threat of the use of force.”1 Although the United States and China are not adversaries and there are significant and numerous dimensions and manifestations of cooperation between Washington and Beijing, according to this definition, a U.S.‐China rivalry exists. By “flash point,” I mean a “longstanding political dispute” that is “proximate to . . . adversaries” and “threaten[s] to involve more powerful actors [thereby] raising the possibility of . . . a broader war.”2 While at least one scholar has argued that “the South China Sea is not a flash point,”3 this article contends that in the second decade of the twenty‐first century, this body of water does indeed meet the criteria. Although it may be a different kind of flash point from the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait, or Vale of Kashmir, the South China Sea is a key hot spot nonetheless.         "
"2","To date, this Southeast Asian flash point has smoldered for decades at low levels of combustible agitation, punctuated by periodic sparks of confrontation, and elevated on occasion to flashes of armed confrontation. “[O]ne of the most dangerous South China Sea crises in recent years” flared up in March 2014 between China and the Philippines over the Second Thomas Shoal.4 On several occasions, Chinese coast guard vessels harassed Philippine supply ships attempting to offload provisions to a ramshackle Philippine outpost on the shoal, which is approximately 100 miles west of Palawan Island. The most serious incident occurred in late March, when a large People's Republic of China (PRC) coast guard cutter approached perilously close to the Philippine vessel while Chinese, Philippine, and U.S. military aircraft all buzzed around at low altitudes in close proximity. This incident could have quite easily escalated into military conflict between China and the United States because of a combination of aggressive actions by Beijing and “risk‐acceptant behavior” by Manila and Washington.5 According to one U.S. analyst, “The first [U.S.] challenge . . . [is to] address the risk of an incident at sea escalating into a major conflict.”6"
"3","First, this article illuminates how geopolitical analysis provides the best explanation for growing U.S.‐China tensions in the South China Sea. Second, this article examines the geopolitics of great‐power rivalries and highlights the tendency for these rivalries to have significant maritime dimensions. Third, this article examines the geostrategies of China and the United States. Finally, the article explores the implications of this analysis for U.S.‐China rivalry and the future of the South China Sea flash point."
"4","Why has the South China Sea become such a contentious issue in U.S.‐China relations? First, China has growing interests in the body of water, and Beijing's economic clout and military might are rising. These greater hard‐power resources provide China with the ability to advance its claims to the region from a position of far greater strength vis‐à‐vis the United States and other states. Hence, Beijing has become considerably more assertive in the South China Sea and elsewhere in recent years.7 Nevertheless, few scholars anticipated that the South China Sea would become such a focal point for U.S.‐China rivalry.8 This is because, on the face of it, the South China Sea should not be as important to China as the Taiwan Strait or Korean Peninsula.         "
"5","China has long exhibited a preference for a low‐key, gradualist approach toward the South China Sea, engaging with Southeast Asian states to “test the waters”—so to speak—to advance its territorial claims in the this body of water. For decades, this approach contributed to disarming other claimants and the United States. However, China has also adopted a strategy of pursuing “gray zone” activities, thereby seeking to change the facts on the ground—or, more accurately, the facts in the water—by building facilities such as docks and runways and constructing artificial islands. At the same time, China has stepped up its harassment and intimidation of the fishing boats and the maritime enforcement vessels of other states. Since at least 2013, however, China has invested greater time, energy, resources, and prestige in the South China Sea."
"6","Second, Washington determined that the South China Sea is a high‐priority body of water for U.S. maritime interests in the Asia‐Pacific as well as an important symbol of the U.S. commitment to broader principles of international law. As a practical matter, the United States seeks to prevent China from unilaterally occupying reefs, constructing artificial islands, and asserting sovereignty, dominance, and/or control over vast swaths of what Washington regards as part of the global commons. Moreover, as a matter of principle, the United States is adamant about maintaining freedom of the seas, freedom of navigation, and peaceful resolution of maritime territorial disputes around the world.9 Consequently, the United States has persisted in a tough, unwavering approach to the South China Sea, even as it appears largely ineffective at altering Chinese behavior.         "
"7","A geopolitical analysis—which considers the influence of geography on international politics—offers the most thorough interpretation. In calculating balances of power and assessing national interests, the geographic proximity of adversaries and allies as well as the locations of topographical and maritime features of critical strategic importance, including small uninhabited rocks and shoals, should not be ignored. Geopolitics highlights the tremendous geostrategic importance of littoral areas—what Nicholas Spykman has called the globe's “rimland” regions.10 The centrality of these maritime areas is underscored by the critical importance of seaborne international trade: 90 percent of the world's commerce is transported by ship, and approximately half of this trade either terminates on the rim of, or traverses, the South China Sea.11 Accordingly, one analysis describes the body of water as “both the fulcrum of world trade and the crucible of conflict.”12 This puts into sharper focus why the United States and China have come to view the South China Sea as center stage for their geopolitical maritime rivalry.         "
"8","The United States and China have not faced each other on the field of battle since 1953, and since 1972, they have enjoyed generally cordial and cooperative relations along with a dramatic expansion of economic and diplomatic contact as well as military‐to‐military exchanges and people‐to‐people interactions. Nevertheless, multiple contentious disputes have emerged along with significant policy disagreements, especially since the end of the Cold War. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, a series of U.S.‐China political‐military crises have occurred, each raising the specter of escalation to the use of military force. Yet the United States and China continue to cooperate on many issues and typically have maintained a cordial working relationship. However, mutual distrust and animosity pervade bilateral ties, and Washington and Beijing perceive each other as competitors or rivals.13"
"9","Rivalry between the United States and China in the Asia‐Pacific region is framed by geography. This trite observation, of course, demands clarification. Robert Ross has argued that China is predominantly a continental power and the United States is mainly a maritime one. As a consequence, he contends, their rivalry is more stable than the extended U.S.‐Soviet geopolitical contest, which encompassed significant continental and maritime components, and hence Ross emphasizes that the “geography of the peace” was likely to prevail.14 According to Ross, “The post–Cold War bipolar regional structure is characterized by Chinese dominance of mainland East Asia and U.S. dominance of maritime East Asia.”15 Ross explains that at the turn of the century, “China dominates mainland Southeast Asia,” while “the U.S. Navy dominates maritime Southeast Asia.”16 During the first two decades of the twenty‐first century, however, competition between the United States and China has heightened in the Western Pacific, with the South China Sea emerging as a central flash point. There is an emerging geography of conflict because China is becoming a major maritime power. Indeed, Ross observes that “China can only destabilize [the “bipolar structure”] by challenging U.S. maritime supremacy.”17 Under PRC president Xi Jinping, in particular, Beijing has focused more resources on expanding China's maritime capabilities.18 The rivalry has intensified because U.S. global hegemony in the post–Cold War era is being challenged by China. Specifically, China is contesting America's “command of the commons,” and this is playing out in a very high‐profile manner in the South China Sea.19"
"10","So, why did the South China Sea flash point catch many by surprise, including adherents of geostrategy? First, there tends to be an inherent bias toward continental thinking that emerges out of the writings of Sir Halford Mackinder. Thus, scholars such as Zbigniew Brzezinski emphasize the Eurasian landmass and focus on the geostrategic importance of Central Asia and the Caucasus—building on the foundation of Mackinder's “heartland” thesis.20 Of course, the Cold War had a maritime dimension, but it was global in scope and geographically dispersed. The most visible concentration of opposing forces was on the Central European Plain. Moreover, in prior “hot wars”—including World War I and World War II—the hostilities played out most brutally in continental battles and ground campaigns in Europe. The shackles of Cold War–era thinking have proved hard for Washington to break, and the Pentagon has been struggling for decades to understand the new map of the world in the absence of a Soviet Union and without the specter of a major land war on the European continent.21 Of course, the United States has engaged in sustained land power operations in the post–Cold War era, but these have not been in Europe. The extended employments of military force in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq have, in hindsight, proved unsatisfactory, costly in blood and treasure, and lacking an orderly exit strategy.         "
"11","Meanwhile, China has focused on modernizing its military and paramilitary forces, with particular attention to naval and maritime forces. Certainly, the United States has not ignored its own naval forces, but the swiftness with which the capabilities of the all services of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have begun to approach those of the U.S. military has been dramatic. The introduction into the Pentagon lexicon of “Anti‐Access/Area Denial” (A2/AD) is a testament to Washington's recognition of a new strategic reality in the Western Pacific. A2/AD refers to the increasing ability of China's military to hold at risk U.S. military assets that enter and operate in the Western Pacific. Moreover, more recently, the Pentagon has spoken of the need to pursue a “Third Offset Strategy” to deal with the daunting challenges posed to the United Stated by a variety of increasingly capable potential adversaries.22 Similar to the earlier iterations of “offsets,” the emphasis of the Third Offset Strategy is leveraging U.S. technological advantages to counter the increasingly potent conventional military capabilities being developed and deployed in large numbers by countries, notably China. However, unlike the offsets of the 1950s and 1970s, there is no single adversary, and the solution does not involve greater attention to nuclear weapons. While Beijing is certainly a major U.S. concern, it is not the only challenge that Washington faces. What the Third Offset Strategy does emphasize is technological advancements in the domains of sea and air, with a focus on countering standoff precision‐guided weaponry.         "
"12","One strategic thinker has drawn sustained attention to the maritime realm with a series of books on geopolitics, the Indian Ocean, and, most recently, the South China Sea.23 Robert Kaplan appears to be a disciple of Spykman, who, in contrast to Mackinder, stressed the importance of “rimland” and world's oceanic system in geopolitics.24 While globalization is not a new phenomenon, the pace and scope of this far‐reaching process have accelerated. Moreover, although the oceans of the world have long played a key role in this process—including the explorations of pioneering mariners such as Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama—the significance of the oceans has only increased as a result of the expanded volume of shipping tonnage that now traverses the sea lanes of the world. This underscores the importance of the South China Sea, which is crisscrossed by some of the busiest shipping lanes anywhere on the planet.         "
"13","A second reason that the South China Sea as a flash point has been such a surprise is that the body of water seems geographically well removed from the great powers. In short, the sea appears peripheral to recognized geopolitical centers of gravity. Often overlooked is that technological advances in weaponry have dramatically shrunk distances—ballistic and cruise missiles have greatly improved in both range and accuracy.25 Furthermore, the South China Sea does not appear to involve significant territorial claims. A glance at the location of major powers and the disposition of heavily armed potential adversaries would suggest the serious flash points of the Asia‐Pacific can be found in Northeast Asia. The Korean Peninsula remains very tense, with two heavily armed adversaries facing each other across the so‐called Demilitarized Zone. Moreover, North Korea has an expanding nuclear arsenal with enhanced delivery systems. Add to this the involvement of the United States—as South Korea's ally—with sizeable military assets both on the peninsula and more that can to be brought into the theater, and China—as North Korea's ally—with much at stake in what transpires on the peninsula. The result is a volatile situation. In addition, there are considerable simmering tensions between China and Japan, notably over the disposition of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Another flash point is the Taiwan Strait, which, like the Korean Peninsula, is the location of an unresolved civil war, albeit far less tense in recent years than its continental counterpart.         "
"14","A third reason for surprise over the emergence of the South China Sea flash point is that this body of water did not seem to be a high‐stakes issue in the U.S.‐China rivalry. Indeed, the escalation of tensions in the South China Sea seemed to come out of nowhere. According to Brzezinski, this body of water merely posed the risk of conflict between China and Southeast Asian claimants: he saw no danger of a U.S.‐China showdown over the South China Sea.26 Moreover, Ross, writing in 1999, considered the body of water the “least significant” flash point compared with the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan Strait.27"
"15","The late 2000s appear to be a tipping point in the status of the body of water because of a confluence of events. The global financial crisis of 2008 hit the United States hard but left China relatively unscathed. The newly elected administration of Barack Obama, who took office in January 2009, seemed initially consumed with addressing the economic fallout, somewhat less committed to Asia, and more prepared to accommodate Chinese interests.28 In March, when Beijing probed U.S. intentions by harassing the USNS Impeccable in the South China Sea, Washington did not seem to push back hard; in May, China submitted documents supporting its extensive claims to that body of water to the United Nations; then, in November, during the U.S.‐China summit, the Obama administration agreed to a joint declaration with language stating that each country should respect the other's “core interests.” The following month, at a high‐level global climate change summit held in Copenhagen, Denmark, China appeared intent on sabotaging U.S. initiatives and embarrassing President Obama.29"
"16","By mid‐2010, Washington had concluded that Beijing's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and elsewhere required a firmer U.S. response. China interpreted the Obama administration's tougher actions as a complete U‐turn and reacted angrily. A diplomatic face‐off occurred at the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum Ministerial Meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, in July, when U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton articulated U.S. policy toward the South China Sea and implicitly criticized Chinese actions. PRC foreign minister Yang Jiechi responded heatedly, seeking to intimidate the smaller states of Southeast Asia.30"
"17","The United States and China are geopolitical rivals. While there are elements of cooperation as well as elements of competition—which commonly characterize many interstate relationships—the two countries are at risk of being drawn into unintended war.31 When scholars revisit the epic conflicts between the great powers in different historical eras, most easily recalled are the land campaigns and battles between opposing armies. While the ground game is what appears to matter most, the maritime component is often overlooked. Thus, while the most storied battle of the Napoleonic Wars is undoubted Waterloo (1815), an equally important maritime confrontation occurred off the Cape of Trafalgar (1805) near the Strait of Gibraltar where the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea meet. Moreover, while the most epic struggle of World War I is likely the Somme (1916) and the most significant and brutal land battle of World War II may have been Stalingrad (1942–1943), these wars each entailed significant maritime components with corresponding epic sea battles: in the former, the Battle of Jutland (1916), and in the latter, both the extended Battle for the Atlantic (1939–1945) and the more concentrated Battle of Midway (1942) in the Pacific Ocean.         "
"18","Indeed, many of the epic rivalries in world history have included significant maritime dimensions. Particularly famous was the Anglo‐German rivalry, chronicled by scholars such as Paul Kennedy, which eventually escalated into World War I.32 Moreover, it is noteworthy that for each of these rivalries and wars, a specific body of water invariably served as a focal point or cradle of conflict.         "
"19","During the second decade of the twenty‐first century, the South China Sea has emerged as a focal point for confrontation between the United States and China. Yet there are other overlapping rivalries that further raise the importance of the body of water: China is now also involved in rivalries with India, Japan, and Taiwan, in addition to a number of Southeast Asian claimant states (see Figure 1). For India, the South China Sea seems to be very relevant, although secondary to the Indian Ocean, and a trigger for increased tensions between Beijing and New Delhi.33 For Japan, the South China Sea has far greater salience, but it is still less central to its rivalry with China than the East China Sea.34 Meanwhile, the rivalry between Taipei and Beijing extends beyond the Taiwan Strait and spills over into the South China Sea.35 The cumulative effect of these rivalries suggests that the South China Sea is probably “the most contested maritime space in the world.”36"
"20","So why has the South China Sea become the locus of U.S.‐China conflict? The answer is quite obvious: because China cares about the South China Sea. But why does China care so much? While Beijing has significant land border disputes, many of which have been resolved through peaceful negotiation, maritime disputes, notably the South China Sea, have only increased in importance over time.37 Moreover, Washington has also attached greater importance to the South China Sea in recent years. Most conspicuously, China has become a major maritime power primarily in the Asia‐Pacific (although Beijing does have global aspirations), and the United States has been forced to take note.            "
"21","Furthermore, the South China Sea has been elevated to an issue of vital national interest, emerged as a matter of principle, and become central to the domestic political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). For Beijing, this body of water has come to symbolize the heart of the PRC's inviolable historical maritime claims, crystalize the principle of territorial integrity and national unity, and become ground zero for blatant interference in China's internal affairs by its most significant great‐power rival. In short, for Chinese leaders, the sea has emerged as the principal flash point and a fundamental dispute in Beijing's geostrategic rivalry with Washington. Consequently, in the minds of China's communist rulers, there is no room for compromise. In May 2017, President Xi Jinping reportedly told visiting Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, “We don't want to quarrel with you. . . . But if you force the issue, we'll go to war.”38"
"22","As China embraced foreign investment and expanded international trade in the reform era after 1979, Beijing began to attach much greater weight to maritime matters. China adopted a grand strategic naval vision—widely attributed to the late Admiral Liu Huaqing (1916–2011)—first set out in the early 1980s in which the PLA Navy would gradually extend its reach into the Pacific Ocean in a phased expansion of Chinese sea power.39 In the first phase, by 2000, the PLA Navy was to extend its area of operations in the Near Seas (South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea) as far as the so‐called first island chain—the Kuril Islands, Japan, the Ryukyus, Taiwan, the Philippines, Borneo, and Natuna Besar. The PLA Navy extended its responsibilities beyond China's coastal waters to include “near shore” or littoral (jinan) and “near seas” (jinhai).40 In the second phase, by 2020, the PLA Navy aims to project its operational reach to the so‐called second island chain—the Bonins, the Marianas, and the Carolines. In the third phase, by 2050, China would become a global sea power and hence on par with the U.S. Navy. Indeed, the PLA Navy's activities and power project efforts have so far kept pace with this timeline.            "
"23","Furthermore, many PLA strategists have embraced the writings of U.S. naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan.41 Mahan emphasizes the central importance of sea power to a nation, notably the link between a state's naval expansion, economic development, and the growth of maritime commerce as Chinese naval thinkers have observed.42 Hainan Island has become a maritime hub for China. The PLA constructed a modern naval base on the south side of the island at Yulin that permits submarines to enter without surfacing in plain sight and hence be visible to satellites. These subsurface platforms likely include ballistic missile carrying submarines (SSBNs), which will become increasingly important as China complements its land‐based nuclear missiles with sea‐launchable ones. The PLA may view the South China Sea as an “SSBN bastion”—a body of relatively secure water from which it can safely deploy ballistic missiles in peacetime and launch in time of war.43"
"24","But why did the South China Sea emerge as the key maritime flash point for Beijing, and what happened to the flash point of Taiwan? Three trends are most relevant. The first is that China has evolved from being a purely continental power in the mid‐twentieth century to a maritime one by the turn of the twenty‐first century. The second trend is that China's economic center of gravity has shifted southward from northeast China—Dongbei or Manchuria—to a swath of eastern coastal China stretching from Tianjin to Shanghai to Fuzhou and further south to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Haikou, and the beaches of Sanya. Third, the waters in the Taiwan Strait became calmer with the election in 2008 of the Nationalist Party presidential candidate, Ma Ying‐jeou, who was widely viewed as pro‐unification. With Ma as Taiwan's head of state between 2008 and 2016, relations between Beijing and Taipei improved substantially.            "
"25","During the first four decades of the PRC's existence, flash points were squarely continental. In the early 1950s, China's primary flash point was the Korean Peninsula (with the Taiwan Strait being a secondary hot spot). In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, China's foremost flash point was its vast land border with the Soviet Union, with a secondary flash point being its southern land border with Vietnam. By the mid‐1990s, however, China's most prominent flash points had become maritime ones: the Taiwan Strait was of primary concern, with the East China Sea as a secondary hot spot. This switch occurred as Beijing resolved most of its land border disputes with neighboring capitals, with the notable exception of New Delhi.44 The height of post–Cold War tensions occurred in the Taiwan Strait, notably during a crisis in 1995–1996.45 Korea and Taiwan continued to be focal points of tension into the first decade of twenty‐first century.            "
"26","Nevertheless, by 2010, the South China Sea appeared to have replaced the Taiwan Strait as China's most serious maritime flash point. This change appears to have coincided with the southward drift of China's economic center of gravity. A significant element of this is China's greater seaborne trade with maritime Southeast Asia and beyond to Europe and the Middle East, but one should not overlook China's growing economic interaction with continental Southeast Asia, with Yunnan Province and its capital, Kunming, as a major road, rail, and air terminus. Furthermore, U.S.‐China tensions over Taiwan dissipated and were supplanted by the South China Sea. This body of water became a focal point for mutual suspicion and U.S.‐China rivalry because it came to crystalize for the two powers both concrete regional disputes and broader abstract principles within the larger context of geopolitical rivalry."
"27","The Korean flash point has both continental and maritime dimensions. Continued instability on the peninsula is alarming to China not just because of a shared land border with North Korea but also because of considerable maritime trade with South Korea and Japan. Tensions in Korea have escalated, especially since 2010, as North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs have made dramatic progress. Consequently, Beijing‐Pyongyang relations have soured noticeably. Hence, the South China Sea is not China's only tense Asia‐Pacific flash point in the 2010s. Although China has been distinctly subdued in its rhetoric and restrained in its actions vis‐à‐vis North Korea, where the South China Sea is concerned, Beijing has been increasingly hard‐line and assertive.46"
"28","Chinese leaders have adopted a geostrategic outlook from their vantage point in Beijing. When members of the ruling CCP Politburo nervously look out from their leadership compound of Zhongnanhai, they tend to perceive their environment in terms of four concentric circles.47 The first ring they see begins in the street outside their office window—China's domestic security situation, which includes all the territory within the borders of the PRC that Beijing controls or claims. The second ring of security comprises the PRC's immediate periphery—a zone that includes 14 neighbors, five of which China has fought wars with in the last 75 years. The third ring encircles the entire Asia‐Pacific neighborhood, while the fourth and outermost ring extends to the world beyond. In this geostrategic conception, the South China Sea looms large because it is considered to be part of the first, second, and third rings as well as constituting an important stepping stone into the fourth ring. Not only is the lion's share of this body of water claimed as Chinese territory, territorial waters, or Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), but also it is a critical element of China's periphery, a crucial subsystem in China's neighborhood, and an important conduit to the world beyond. Thus, according to one prominent Chinese scholar, the South China Sea dispute “involves significant political, security, and economic interests.”48"
"29","Uncertainty has swirled around whether China has defined the South China Sea as a “core interest.” In recent years, Beijing has begun to use this term to refer to a set of high‐priority national security issues, notably sensitive territorial matters such as Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Some assert that the PRC has designated the South China Sea as a “core interest.” While Chinese officials have reportedly used the term in closed‐door discussions with U.S. counterparts, the phrase has yet to appear in a public statement or PRC document.49 Why? Although there is no doubt that the South China Sea is one of Beijing's most important issues, Chinese leaders appear to have concluded they have nothing to gain from making this designation official. Doing so would likely further escalate tensions with other claimants and the United States because it would only serve to reinforce China's position on its claims in the South China Sea as non‐negotiable and “maximalist.”50 Moreover, it would almost certainly raise stakes of the body of water in the eyes of the Chinese people and hence only increase the pressure on PRC leaders.            "
"30","The importance of the South China Sea has only been underscored by recent policy initiatives. In 2013, President Xi Jinping publicly launched with considerable fanfare the “One Belt, One Road” program.51 He announced the initiative in two high‐profile speeches, one in Central Asia and the other in Southeast Asia. There are two major components to the initiative, a continental one and an oceanic one. Xi proposed the development of an overland “belt” of roads, rails, and pipelines from China into Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central Asia, stretching onward to Europe and the Middle East. Xi also proposed the development of a “maritime silk road” from China through the South China Sea and into the India Ocean and beyond. The plans emphasized the importance of two regions: maritime Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The former is a key waterway, while the latter is emerging as a nexus of the overland belt and the maritime road. This bold initiative appears to have its roots in the great western development plan of the early twenty‐first century to build up China's infrastructure in its far western interior that spurred economic growth in the underdeveloped landlocked regions of China, which lagged behind the more prosperous and dynamic coastal provinces.            "
"31","Moreover, the intellectual predecessor of “One Belt, One Road” was the “March West” concept articulated in 2012 by Beijing University academic Wang Jisi.52 Wang argued that China needed a geostrategic “rebalance,” and this required putting greater efforts into developing relationships and linkages with its western neighbors. Nevertheless, it was not a call to turn way from China's eastern coastal provinces; rather, it was a call for a more balanced approach to China's domestic and foreign development strategies. When Beijing looks east, it finds itself hemmed in by U.S. military bases on the first and second island chains, a powerful U.S. Navy contesting the Near Seas, and robust allies, notably Tokyo and Seoul. By contrast, looking west reveals a more open geostrategic landscape. While there was a U.S. military presence in Central Asia during the first and second decades of the twenty‐first century, the balance of power in this location is much less skewed in America's favor. Beijing had developed good relations with Central Asian capitals and increasingly the region was coming within China's economic orbit.53 Moreover, the United States had embarked on a drawdown of its military forces in Afghanistan and China's influence in that country is on the rise.54"
"32","Beijing's policy stand on the South China Sea has been consistent across many decades. The PRC has long claimed sovereignty over virtually all the islands, reefs, and atolls in this body of war on the basis of historical presence and activity in the maritime area. The PRC's claims are consistent with the territorial claims of the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. Indeed, the PRC inherited its famous “nine‐dashed line” map from the ROC. While Beijing has sought to use legal means to strengthen its territorial claims on this body of water, the primary rationale for its claim is historical, and indeed one prominent PRC scholar, Zhu Feng, director of Nanjing University's Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea, has characterized Beijing's approach as grounded in “historical fundamentalism.” Zhu contrasts this Chinese approach to a U.S. approach that he dubs “legal fundamentalism.”55"
"33","China's strategy toward the South China Sea for many decades has been variously described as one of “delay,” “creeping assertiveness,” or “Slow Intensity Conflict” (SLIC).56 In this approach, China adopted a gradualist, long‐term approach to improve its claims on the features in as low‐key manner as possible. Since at least the 1970s, China has opportunistically occupied islands and reefs, sometimes by force (for example, the Paracel Islands in 1974 and the Spratly Islands in 1988) and other times unopposed (for example, Mischief Reef in 1995), as well as by stealthily strengthening its hold on formations it already occupies through the construction of fortifications, docks, and runways. In the 1970s and 1980s, for portions of the 1990s, and during much of the first decade of the twenty‐first century, China was very successful at implementing this SLIC strategy in such a way as to avoid much attention, controversy, or resistance.            "
"34","By 2010, however, China's activities in the South China were increasingly less SLIC in the sense that Chinese actions were more high profile and assertive, so Southeast Asian claimants were increasingly alarmed and prepared to react. But claimants such as the Philippines and Vietnam were wary of confronting China directly, either individually or collectively, because of a significant imbalance of power. Instead, they preferred to press the United States to challenge Beijing publicly on the matter. As a result, the South China Sea became a contentious issue in U.S.‐China relations.57 Beijing perceives Washington's high‐minded rhetoric about upholding the principle of freedom of navigation as an excuse to interfere in the South China Sea. According to one Chinese scholar, “maritime disputes have become a growing source of insecurity in East Asia.” The causes are varied and “further complicated by the involvement of third parties.”58 Notable from a Chinese perspective, is the “high profile intervention of the United States.”59"
"35","China's response under President Xi Jinping has been to ramp up its activities in the South China Sea. Since December 2013, Beijing has embarked on a massive program of land reclamation—a total of more than 2,900 acres have been added to seven of China's eight occupied formations in the Spratly Islands archipelago.60 Moreover, PRC naval and maritime law enforcement ships have vigorously advanced Chinese claims in a concerted series of demonstrations of force, including harassing, expelling, and ramming fishing boats and other vessels from claimant states. The most remarkable demonstration of concerted PRC power occurred in May 2014, when dozens of fishing boats, coast guard vessels, and seven PLA Navy warships formed concentric rings of protection around oil rig HD‐981 120 miles off the coast of Vietnam.61 The exploration was announced ahead of time with specific start and end dates. This highly coordinated maneuver was well executed, although the exercise ended about a month early, but not before some 30 Vietnamese ships confronted the flotilla. The episode was a clear show of overwhelming force by Beijing.            "
"36","Why does the South China Sea matter to the United States? As the global hegemon, the United States defines its national interests on a global scale.62 Militarily, the paramount U.S. interest is the defense of the homeland and American allies; politically, the United States seeks to promote democracy and strengthen human rights around the world; economically, the United States looks to protect the global trading and financial systems. Moreover, since the end of the Cold War, the United States has been the world's dominant naval power. Until quite recently, U.S. aircraft and naval vessels have been able to operate in air and waters almost anywhere in the world without fear of serious challenge. Consequently, Washington is both concerned with every corner of the world and accustomed to having a remarkable degree of freedom of action in international waters and air space.            "
"37","Not surprisingly, many in the U.S. Navy are Mahanians. They believe firmly in the primacy of sea power, and the emphasis on “command of the sea” reflects the enduring influence of Mahan on U.S. naval strategists.63 The maritime realm in the Asia‐Pacific has been especially important, and in 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense issued an Asia‐Pacific Maritime Security Strategy, major portions of which focused on the South China Sea.64 For decades, the United States has conducted more trade with Asia than it has with Europe. Today, a multitude of trade routes reach across the Pacific Ocean, and the United States has built a network of free trade agreements. Following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the rise of new democracies, greater political attention shifted to Asia. The battleground for waging the war of ideas moved to Asia as countries including North Korea and Myanmar become the focus of concern for widespread human rights violations. Moreover, democracy appeared on the march in the 1990s with significant steps toward democracy in Thailand and Indonesia. More recently, Myanmar has made considerable strides in democratization, while Thailand has suffered a setback. In the defense realm, the United States has sought to strengthen its ties with allies, expand security ties with other democracies (notably India) across the region, and shift more resources to the Asia‐Pacific.            "
"38","The much‐hyped “rebalance” or “pivot” to the region announced by the Obama administration signaled that the United States was intent on focusing more attention on the Asia‐Pacific. The clearest and most detailed articulation of the “rebalance” comes in the form of a recent book by a key architect and implementer.65 However, the administration of Donald J. Trump, since coming into office in January 2017, has been attempting to rethink U.S. policy toward the region. Nevertheless, during its first year in office, the Trump administration was largely preoccupied with events on the Korean Peninsula. Trump as president‐elect publicly criticized Chinese actions in the South China Sea in a December 2016 tweet.66 Moreover, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson indicated that he favored a harsh U.S. response to China in the South China Sea during confirmation hearings in January 2017.67 Senior Department of Defense officials have also spoken in hard‐line terms about responding to Chinese actions in the South China Sea. Speaking at the June 2017 Shangri‐La Dialogue in Singapore, Secretary of Defense James Mattis condemned “China's disregard for international law, [and] its contempt for other nations’ interests” in the South China Sea.68 During 2016 public testimony before the U.S. Congress, Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the Pacific Command, was remarkably blunt, characterizing Chinese actions in the South China Sea as “provocative and expansionist.” He insisted the goal was to “build a great wall of sand” in an audacious effort to establish control over disputed waters.69"
"39","High‐profile attention to “choke points” and “sea lines of communication” (SLOCs) only serve to obscure the reality that bodies of water matter as much, if not more, than narrow straits and straight‐line shipping lanes. Michael Wesley has underscored the importance of bays and drawn attention to three in the Indo‐Pacific: the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the South China Sea.70 Much hype surrounds Beijing's purported “Malacca dilemma” and Washington's alleged obsession with “SLOC protection.”71 While there is an element of truth to these claims, in broader geostrategic terms, what matters more is command of the seas, specifically, efforts to control bodies of water by one state or at least efforts to deny or limit access to other states. Much has been made of Chinese strategists’ focus on two island chains, but these are merely boundary markers—they are not military objectives in and of themselves to be seized, occupied, and fortified.72 Beijing's goal is to deny the waters inside these island chains to the air and naval platforms of an outside power. Thus, these islands are not walls to be defended but geographic features marking the outer reaches of China's desired maritime domain. In short, China seeks to hold at increased risk U.S. surface ships, submarines, and aircraft operating on, in, and above what Beijing dubs the Near Seas.            "
"40","Similarly, the United States is more concerned about the ability to operate freely in the Western Pacific than it is about occupying particular islands or controlling specific straits. A foremost publicly articulated Department of Defense objective in the Asia‐Pacific is “to safeguard the freedom of the seas,” including “uses of the sea and airspace . . . for military ships and aircraft.”73 Therefore, the Pentagon is more focused on how to counter the improved A2/AD capabilities of the PLA inside the Near Seas than it is about particular archipelagic positions or littoral chokepoints.            "
"41","Washington's approach to the South China Sea can be characterized as standing firm in principle and somewhat flexible in practice. Of course, this characterization is frequently applied to Beijing's policies on various issues. In this case, it is the United States that is adamant on the matter of the inviolability of the principle of freedom of navigation and the priority of protecting the global commons. The higher principle to which the United States and other liberal democracies subscribe is “freedom of the seas,” which is enshrined in key documents such as United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Article 87 of UNCLOS states, “The high seas are open to all States whether coastal or landlocked.”74 However, on a day‐to‐day basis, the United States tends to emphasize subsets of “freedom of the seas” (mare liberum), namely, “freedom of navigation” and “freedom of overflight.” The United States has also consistently sought to take neutral stands on the competing claims of rival states in the South China Sea. But Washington does insist on abiding by international law. The oft‐noted irony is that the United States has yet to ratify UNCLOS. Still, from Beijing's perspective, Washington appears to be biased against China and interfering in a maritime region far removed from U.S. geostrategic core interests. Moreover, the high‐profile freedom of navigation operations (also known as FONOPS) conducted by the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea from a Chinese perspective appear to be aimed at publicly humiliating China.            "
"42","Officially, the U.S. Navy performs FONOPS in international waters around the world in order to “demonstrate a non‐acquiescence to excessive maritime claims asserted by coastal states.”75 Furthermore, the long‐standing U.S. program to defend the principle of freedom of navigation includes not just “operational activities by U.S. military forces,” but also “consultations and representations by U.S. diplomats.”76 The U.S. interpretation of UNCLOS is that military vessels can operate unhindered in international waters, meaning anywhere outside of the 12 nautical mile limit of a country's territorial waters.77 In contrast, China insists that a country has additional rights within its EEZ to deny access to the military vessels of another state unless permission has been granted.78"
"43","The United States is also engaged in other, less prominent initiatives where the South China Sea is concerned. Among these is an effort to coordinate with other countries—claimants and nonclaimants—to build on the sweeping decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) issued in July 2016.79 The ruling amounted to a total repudiation of China's claims to and actions in the sea. The PCA ruled that China's sweeping claims to the South China Sea were “contrary to the Convention and without lawful effect.”80 Washington and a number of other capitals welcomed the ruling and called for all states to abide by the decision; meanwhile, Beijing condemned the decision and insisted that China does not recognize the ruling.81 It is unclear whether the PCA ruling will prove to be a landmark and a turning point in the South China Sea dispute, or whether it is on its way to becoming an extremely fascinating but largely irrelevant footnote in international law journal articles.            "
"44","Each side seeks at a minimum to manage the issue of the South China Sea or, ideally, to persuade the other side to concede or at least compromise. However, a geopolitical analysis suggests that the future of this body of water is likely to be choppy, and the potential for unintended escalation is greater than has been assumed."
"45","What does the future hold for geopolitical competition between the United States and China in the South China Sea? On the one hand, neither side is likely to back down from its position on this semiclosed sea. On the other hand, neither side desires a state of heightened tensions in bilateral relations, let alone outright military conflict. This state of affairs all but guarantees a continued slow boil in the South China Sea. But beyond this is the real possibility of heightened great‐power rivalry and even potential escalation to interstate war. At least three factors suggest significant cause for alarm: the existence of multiple and overlapping interstate regional rivalries, the emergence of a variant of the stability‐instability paradox, and a mounting security dilemma."
"46","First, the geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States is complicated by the existence of regional rivalries in which the South China Sea plays either a primary or a secondary role (Figure 1). Thus, the rivalries between Japan and China and between India and China also involve posturing and competition over this body of water. Moreover, there is competition among multiple Southeast Asian states and between these states and China, including allies and partners of the United States. These third parties—which include U.S. treaty ally the Philippines and U.S. security partner Taiwan—can either mitigate conflict or exacerbate tensions in the South China Sea and spill over into heightened U.S.‐China tensions.         "
"47","Second, a non‐nuclear variant of the stability‐instability paradox appears to be at play in the South China Sea of the early twenty‐first century, whereby each side tends to feel emboldened to demonstrate stiff resolve and remarkably unconstrained to exert muscular assertiveness because it perceives the likelihood of escalation as negligible. In other words, since both Beijing and Washington seem to recognize that a full‐blown conventional conflict between China and the United States would have grave and devastating consequences to their economies, each perceives the resort to war by the other side as illogical and hence highly improbable.82 The result of this logic is that both sides feel emboldened to vigorously signal their commitment to matters of principle. Nevertheless, some analysts contend that prospect of military conflict between the United States and China is not insignificant and includes the specter of what they dub “mutually assured economic destruction.”83 Of course, the paradigmatic case for the stability‐instability paradox was the Cold War confrontation between nuclear‐armed superpowers—the United States and the Soviet Union.84"
"48","The stability‐instability paradox may be more acute in the case of the United States and China because of dangerous assumptions held by one or both of the rivals. First of all, U.S. and Chinese leaders are overconfident in their respective abilities to manage crises. Many Americans look to the peacefully negotiated resolution of the 2001 EP‐3 crisis as proof that similar incidents involving loss of life can be resolved without escalation. But the EP‐3 incident is not a good case to generalize from because it is almost certainly unique in several key dimensions: there was little time pressure, and China held the trump card.85 There was no great sense of urgency in Beijing or Washington, and China was squarely in the driver's seat: the damaged U.S. aircraft had made an emergency landing on a PLA air field on Hainan Island so the detained the air crew became de facto hostages. Beijing was angry over the death of a Chinese fighter pilot when his airplane collided with a larger U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft in international airspace over the South China Sea approximately 70 miles from Hainan. While Washington was eager to obtain the return of 24 service men and women—and the aircraft—the crew was not in imminent danger, so Washington could afford to be patient. With the luxury of time and little danger of unintended escalation, Beijing could remain adamant in demanding that Washington issue a public apology and the United States could firmly push back against the blanket Chinese demand.86 Ten days after the collision, the U.S. Embassy issued a carefully worded statement of regret and China released the crew the very next day. Three months later, in July 2001, after further negotiations, the U.S. aircraft was dismantled and returned to the United States aboard a Russian cargo aircraft.         "
"49","While Chinese analysts readily admit that Beijing did not handle the 2001 crisis particularly well, Chinese leaders believe their crisis management capabilities have significantly improved since then because of extensive research and analysis on the topic producing new procedures and mechanisms, including a National Security Commission—modeled after the U.S. National Security Council—which held its first official meeting in 2014.87 However, there is little reason to believe that there has been significant improvement in China's ability to manage crises.         "
"50","Moreover, Beijing believes that it is adept at escalation management, or what Chinese dub “war control.”88 In short, Chinese military leaders seem to believe that they can manage escalation in both wartime and peacetime and this belief is reinforced by “successful” confrontations, such as Beijing's demonstrated show of force around the HD‐981 oil rig in 2014 in waters disputed by Vietnam (noted earlier)—an incident that could be considered successful because it did not escalate into armed conflict. Indeed, according to one PRC official, in dealing with small states such as the Philippines and Vietnam, “we [that is, China] could teach them a lesson but not go to war.”89"
"51","Meanwhile, some U.S. policymakers and analysts seem to be firmly convinced that the United States must be hard‐line in pushing back against Chinese actions in the South China Sea. According to one prominent analyst, “We [that is, the United States] have to be willing—not just able but willing—to put the United States on the line here and incur some risk.” The analyst added that if the United States was “not willing to incur some risk,” then “the Chinese would not take the U.S. seriously.”90"
"52","Third, many Chinese elites have convinced themselves that they are skilled at handling maritime issues peacefully and that they understand the security dilemma. Certainly, China has successfully managed to avoid major interstate war since 1979. Many in Beijing seem to have convinced themselves that China has been adept at pursuing its territorial claims incrementally and mostly without high stakes confrontations or armed clashes and there is no reason why this state of affairs should not continue.91 What Beijing does not seem to recognize is that past performance is not necessarily a good predictor of future success. Unlike in earlier decades, China is now much more powerful relative to other states, notably those in Southeast Asia, and since at least 2010, China is perceived as far more assertive and threatening by other states. Hence, Chinese actions in the South China Sea are now interpreted in more ominous and alarming terms. But all indications are that Beijing has yet to grasp this change. Indeed, PLA Senior Colonel Zhou Bo recently wrote in the CCP‐controlled Global Times that “there is not realistic threat of massive conflict at sea. . . . [because] China hasn't used its increased military strength to trigger any territorial disputes or conflicts.”92"
"53","Lastly, neither the United States nor China is good at understanding and dealing with the security dilemma, despite the fact that policymakers and scholars in both countries have acknowledged that it exists and should be addressed. The most prominent official expression of this to date was in September 2009, when then Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg pointedly identified the security dilemma as a central problem in U.S‐China relations in a speech.93 While U.S. leaders often find it difficult to understand how U.S. policies and actions might be viewed from a Chinese perspective, it is even more challenging for Chinese leaders to appreciate how the leaders of other countries might interpret PRC policies and activities. Beijing finds it especially difficult to apply the security dilemma in concrete situations because, in Chinese minds, China is still a weak country that is routinely bullied by others. In short, it is not easy for PRC leaders to appreciate that China is now a powerful country and can be perceived as a bully itself.94"
"54","The South China Sea has become a central flash point in the rivalry between the United States and China. The South China Sea has only grown in importance to Beijing and Washington, emerging in the early twenty‐first century as “a principal node of global power politics.”95 China has adopted a geostrategic approach to Southeast Asia and the South China Sea. Geopolitics also underscores why the Asia‐Pacific region is considered extremely important to the United States. The United States has adopted a geostrategic approach in its early twenty‐first‐century grand strategy: this is why the Obama administration initiated the “pivot” or “rebalance” to the Asia‐Pacific. While it remains unclear what policy the Trump administration will adopt, Washington will likely be obliged to respond to geopolitical realities and likely pursue a hard‐line vis‐à‐vis Beijing in the South China Sea.         "
"55","The United States and China are geopolitical competitors, and, like a good number of great‐power rivals before them, Beijing and Washington are playing this rivalry out in the maritime domain. China desires a “blue water” navy and to expand gradually its sea power out from its littoral waters to the so‐called first island chain to the second island chain and beyond. Washington appears determined to sustain its worldwide oceanic preeminence and status as chief protector of the global commons, and seems to view the South China Sea as a central arena for this struggle. Beijing aspires to these ambitions partly because it views this maritime region as China's rightful sphere of influence, but the intensity and determination are driven by the logic of a geostrategic rivalry with the United States."
