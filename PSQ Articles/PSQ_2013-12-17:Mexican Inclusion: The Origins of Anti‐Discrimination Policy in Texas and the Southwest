"1","Matthew Gritter's book examines the origins and significance for Mexican Americans of the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC), whose short‐lived existence from 1941 to 1946 represented the first U. S. federal anti‐discrimination agency. While President Franklin D. Roosevelt's initial executive order was aimed at African American concerns, FEPC's mission of encouraging “full participation in the national defense program by all citizens of the United States, regardless of race, creed, color, or national origin” soon embraced wage inequality among other minorities (p. 1). The first round of hearings began in late 1941 in Birmingham, Chicago, and Los Angeles, treating African American claims of employer and labor union inequities. The second executive order, in 1943, expanded the presidential committee beyond its previously centralized headquarters in Washington, DC to 13 regional offices, which led to coverage in New York (of clusters of Jewish workers) and in the greater Southwest (of Mexican Americans)."
"2","The committee owed its initial inspiration in part to the Roosevelt administration's conduct of the Good Neighbor policy, with an expansive view toward relations with Latin American countries. The FEPC focus on Mexico and Mexican Americans involved affiliations with Mexican consuls as well as with University of Texas‐based civil rights actors, primarily historian Carlos E. Castañeda—who served as special assistant to the committee chairman and later regional director—and George I. Sanchez, educator and leader of the League of United Latin American Citizens and (later) of other organizations. These prominent individuals participated in what the author terms “small‐scale state building during wartime [in] structures of American state power” (p. 1). One of his chapters examines the “transnational” aspects of FEPC's relationship with Mexico, mentioning consular officials who frequently brought forth workplace complaints and also governmental considerations for workers in negotiating the Bracero Agreement with the United States in 1942."
"3","The author argues persuasively, in 7 somewhat sketchy chapters, that FEPC's investigations and hearings combatted workplace discrimination while encouraging Mexican American leadership. The chapters do, however, coherently develop the author's proposed model and add new material, although more‐exhaustive research on Texas (part of FEPC Region X) might have yielded additional evidence and significant findings of wage discrimination in San Antonio, Houston, and other cities with large Mexican American populations. The book is based largely on research conducted in the National Archives and Records Administration and the Carlos Castañeda Collection (and others) of the Benson Library at the University of Texas. It seeks to build on Clete Daniels's earlier and more‐comprehensive FEPC study as well as Emilio Zamora's historical account of Mexican laborers during the 1940s. The author's focus on the consuls and civil rights leaders demonstrates wartime expansion of the federal government, inasmuch as FEPC rulings granted relief in the form of promotions for Mexican American workers at Shell Oil and other industrial enterprises."
"4","In the end, a lack of congressional support precluded creation of a permanent federal anti‐discrimination agency, though fair employment legislation emerged in most states of the Southwest. New Mexico passed the region's first significant state employment law in 1949, Colorado in 1951, Arizona in 1955, and California in 1959. Texas in 1943 had created the state‐level Texas Good Neighbor Commission, which could receive complaints but could not conduct investigations. In that state, however, Castañeda, Sanchez, and several other civil rights leaders during the 1940s and 1950s increased their advocacy and activism in courts, communities, and cities, though not much more with respect to the federal government. Mexican Inclusion traces the important role of FEPC's World War II‐era involvement in incorporating Mexican Americans within this evolving sphere of race relations.         "
