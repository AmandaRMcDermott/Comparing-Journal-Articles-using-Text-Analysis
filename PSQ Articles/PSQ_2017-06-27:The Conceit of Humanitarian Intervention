"1","There are few subjects that have received as much attention as humanitarian intervention in the study of international relations since the end of the Cold War. While military campaigns aimed at halting mass atrocities abroad have their share of supporters and critics in both the policy and scholarly communities, Rajan Menon's book, The Conceit of Humanitarian Intervention, is a particularly critical analysis of this controversial subject. Menon's argument is that the moral fervor that animates supporters of humanitarian intervention leads them toward an unwarranted confidence in the rightness of their cause that not only results in paradoxical outcomes but also entails a good bit of hypocrisy, historical amnesia, and even bad faith.         "
"2","For Menon, the moral consensus on which these policies of humanitarian intervention are based is extremely weak, and so, then, is the alleged commitment to take action to end such atrocities. The episodic practice of humanitarian intervention thus vindicates the realist view of world politics, in which the decisive factor driving state policy is promoting national interests, not upholding universal moral principles. As a result, Menon argues, efforts to try to forge such a consensus and articulate criteria for responding to mass atrocities—such as the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principle—are unlikely to succeed and will only reinforce existing global hierarchies."
"3","Menon's book is as much a critique of liberal internationalism, writ large, as it is a critique of humanitarian intervention as a specific policy manifestation of it. Indeed, the “Enlightenment mindset” (p. 32)—universal morality, the inevitability of human progress, and the triumph of knowledge—motivating humanitarian intervention is as much to blame for its perverse results as the politicians who countenance it. Throughout the book, Menon takes care in demonstrating the limits of this sort of thinking, indicating in no uncertain terms how Western states almost always place their own self‐interests, sovereignty, and well‐being above their commitment to alleviating human suffering abroad. This is evidenced, among other things, by the selective practice of humanitarian intervention and the reluctance of interveners subject their own soldiers to danger in such operations. As a result, attempts by scholars and activists to try to convince states to internalize these obligations and articulate policy agendas to more effectively respond to mass atrocities (such as R2P) end up only validating the power politics status quo, but behind the cloak of humanitarianism."
"4","As someone who largely agrees with his assessment, especially his sobering analysis of R2P, I find it hard to take issue with the thrust of Menon's analysis here. Yet his portrayal of humanitarian intervention's supporters is not always entirely fair. There is frequent reference to an unspecified “they” as targets of his critique who, we are told, believe there is a (near) universal consensus that humanitarian intervention is legitimate and who are passionate about humanitarian intervention as well as certain of its feasibility and nobility. While the author does address specific writers and arguments directly, a majority of the literature cited in these discussions is over 15 years old, sometimes much older, going back to debates inspired by the original publication of Michael Walzer's Just and Unjust Wars (1977). There is a great deal of more recent literature on R2P and humanitarian intervention that is not nearly as sanguine as that critiqued here that the author could be engaging.         "
"5","Despite these weaknesses, Rajan Menon has written a clever and convincing book that has made an important contribution to our understanding of humanitarian intervention and the problems associated with it in both theory and practice."
