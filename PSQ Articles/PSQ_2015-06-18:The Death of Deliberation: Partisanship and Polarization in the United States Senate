"1","In this book, James I. Wallner provides a much‐needed window into the modern Senate. The U.S. Senate is now the most important and powerful upper chamber in the world. The critical test for most legislation is whether it can attract the 60 votes necessary to pass the Senate. To do so, it must undergo an open deliberation process on the chamber floor, at least compared with the U.S. House. Because of its small size and informal rules, the Senate is ever involving as its personalities change and senators develop informal floor procedures to balance their formal commitment to open participation with their obligation to act."
"2","Consequently, the Senate that can be written is not the eternal Senate. Donald Matthews's classic U.S. Senators and Their World (1960) provides an extraordinary account of the 1950s Senate that was already disintegrating when the book went to press. More aggressive senators, accommodating party leaders, the acceptance of low‐cost filibustering, and increasing partisanship soon transformed the Senate. This new Senate is an opaque case to study. The agenda‐setting process largely consists of backroom negotiations. When these negotiations stalemate and we observe a filibuster on the Senate floor, it is difficult for outsiders to allocate blame. Is the minority party obstructing the public interest to deny the majority party any credit for legislating effectively? Or is the minority party filibustering to defend its right to deliberate on major legislation against a steamrolling majority party? If the former, why does the minority party not filibuster every single proposal to its utmost ability?         "
"3","The Death of Deliberation provides a much‐needed explanation of the modern Senate. Wallner is a top Senate staffer and a political scientist. In the proud tradition of participant‐observant research, Wallner combines institutional history, data, case studies, and personal experience with a theoretical framework for understanding the evolution of Senate decision making. Wallner's framework describes three styles of legislating: a collegial style, which was most prevalent during the “textbook” era of Congress; a majoritarian style of majority party dominance; and a structured consent style, in which parties bargain over the terms of floor debates with the active guidance of party leaders.         "
"4","The empirical portion of the book (Chapters 3–6) traces the decline of collegial lawmaking and the emergence of majoritarian and structured consent processes. In my view, the highlights of this portion are the description of the agenda‐setting process under structured consent, the data on aggregate patterns of amendments from 1989 to 2012 (both in Chapter 4), and the comparison of decision styles on major legislation in four Congresses from 1991 to 2010 (Chapter 5). Chapter 5 makes clear that the Senate continues to utilize all three styles in the modern era, but majoritarian and structured consent decision making have become more prevalent over time. In addition, one overall finding (illustrated by a case study of the 2011 debt ceiling debate) is that the partisanship and obstruction we observe in the modern Senate is based on a subterranean foundation of partisan cooperation that keeps the Senate functioning from day to day. In addition, the book's emphasis on amendment votes as the focus of interparty negotiation underlines how important it is to senators to manipulate the set of roll call votes they cast.         "
"5","Like any book, The Death of Deliberation has its limitations. For the study of major legislation in Chapter 5, it would be helpful to have a better understanding of how bills are categorized into decision‐making styles and some explanation for why deliberative style varies across issues and over time.         "
"6","This book should also inspire further research on Senate agenda setting. How do parties balance the tension between policy and electoral goals that is at the center of negotiations over the agenda? Are minority party “moderates” (those between the party median and chamber median) systematically disadvantaged by a voting agenda that seems to be skewed against their proposals? This book is valuable both for what it reveals and for the research it should provoke."
