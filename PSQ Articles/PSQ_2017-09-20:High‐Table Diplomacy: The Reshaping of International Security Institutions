"1","This book investigates a less studied area of scholarship: how formal international security institutions often rely on informal processes and how informal institutions establish connections with formal ones. It focuses on the great powers—the five permanent members (P5) of the United Nations Security Council (USNC) and the G7/G8—and rising middle and second‐tier great powers (for example, those occupying the rotating seats of the UNSC and the other G20 states) and concludes that as these institutions interact and intersect, they are self‐correcting and mutually beneficial."
"2","The book assumes that multilateralism declines in utility after the mid‐1990s because of the lack of progress in trade, UNSC reform, and climate and the BRIC states’ dissatisfaction with their roles and power. In addition, Western‐oriented institutions are no longer meeting great power expectations or providing the prestige sought by rising powers."
"3","Kjell Engelbrekt studies how formal multilateral institutions such as the UNSC and minilateral ones such as the P5 intersect with informal institutions such as the multilateral United Nations General Assembly opening session and “GX” summitry. The book first examines whether the powers integrate or separate formal and informal institutions and processes. Second, it tracks how institutional roles evolve in traditional security issues such as conflict management and in nontraditional areas such as terrorism or climate disruption. Specifically, does the effectiveness of informal GX activities, based on their flexibility and nontransparency, lead to their integration with (or separation from) formal UNSC processes? Formal institutions confer legitimacy, whereas informal ones offer decisive, timely decision making and coordination of actions."
"4","Based on a thoughtful empirical research design, Engelbrekt finds that formal and informal institutions are separated in the traditional area of conflict management but interconnected in nontraditional counterterrorism matters (with climate in the middle). The P5 of the UNSC “vigilantly” guard their exclusive role in conflict management while forging enduring connections with GX summitry to fight terrorism. Similarly, traditional and nontraditional concepts of security were accepted as complementary in counterterrorism, while they were seen to be in conflict with regard to climate disruption. Most UN members rejected UNSC engagement on climate, and GX summits did not fully and consistently embrace the issue. Overall, Engelbrekt finds that formal institutions offer what informal ones lack, and visa versa. While the UNSC provides legitimacy, GX summitry offers effectiveness. Thus, the great weakness of each is the major strength of the other. The formality/informality interactions serve as a self‐correcting process whereby the effectiveness and great power decisiveness of summitry can be combined with the legitimacy of the UNSC."
"5","Of course, in reality, too often great power interests clash, as in the horrifying case of the Syrian civil war, and then both formal and informal institutions are paralyzed in international conflict management. Indeed, such situations are worsened when rising powers such as Brazil and India join Russia and China in blocking UNSC, minilateral, and multilateral processes. A complementary, if not alternative, explanation of when international security institutions are both effective and legitimate is international political leadership (and reputational motivations)—what is most missing when both formal and informal high table diplomacy fails (or what is most present when they succeed) is strong, consistent political leadership, regardless of whether the issue is climate, terror, or conflict management (see, for example, David A. Deese, World Trade Politics: Power, Principles and Leadership [New York: Routledge, 2008]; Rüdiger K.W. Wurzel and James Connelly, eds., The EU as a Leader in International Climate Change Politics [New York: Routledge, 2011]; and Jennifer L. Erickson, Dangerous Trade: Arms Exports, Human Rights and International Reputation [New York: Columbia University Press, 2015]). When an individual political leader or a state more generally conducts a committed, persistent campaign to advance an agreement, it is likely to gradually expand the consensus group and eventually prevail, for example, President Barack Obama and Xi Jinping's climate announcement of 2014 and the United States, European Union, and Russia on the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. Furthermore, small‐group (G2, G3) leadership or minilateralism is often at work within multilateralism. That is how leadership and institutions get things done.         "
