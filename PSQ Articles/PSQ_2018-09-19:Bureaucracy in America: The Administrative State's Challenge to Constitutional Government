"1","Joseph Postell's comprehensive treatment of the tension between constitutionalism and the administrative state that he contends has existed throughout U.S. history stakes out an admirable—and needed—niche in the literature on bureaucracy. Postell presents a strong case that the use of administrative law by reformers who attempted to calibrate a balance between constitutional checks and a burgeoning federal bureaucracy across various eras never succeeded, leading to a perpetual “crisis of legitimacy” (pp. 4, 315) for the administrative state."
"2","Postell's work is timely since the United States appears to be entering a new chapter in this saga. The Donald Trump administration and conservative legal thinkers are challenging the power of the administrative state in an apparent response to its growth during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Indeed, the theme of the Federalist Society's 2017 National Lawyers Convention was “Administrative Agencies and the Regulatory State,” while the foreword to the Harvard Law Review's November 10 edition was titled, “1930's Redux: The Administrative State under Siege.”         "
"3","Early on, Postell uses primary sources from the founding period to lay out the “relatively sophisticated principles” (p. 30) that guided the Framers in debates about shaping administrative structures and power. He returns to this theme throughout the book to highlight profound concerns about the compatibility of the administrative state and core constitutional principles that regularly emerge."
"4","This work is detailed but accessible, and thus it is potentially useful to scholars in various disciplines as well as judges researching the administrative state. Postell's discussions bring this dense subject matter to life and tie critical themes together across historical breaches. For instance, his explanation of the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion in Humphrey's Executor (1935)—which empowered Congress to limit the president's ability to remove certain commissioners—as creating a category of agencies wielding “quasi” powers that are insulated from presidential interference provides excellent context to recent litigation involving the president and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (p. 211).         "
"5","As another example, Postell traces the administrative expansion into social regulation in the 1970s to a “New Left” reform movement that responded to the Richard M. Nixon administration's consolidation of presidential power by focusing on increased judicial and interest‐group oversight of “captured” agencies (p. 278). Postell describes how these reformers differed fundamentally from their New Deal predecessors because they cast aside the paradigm of deference to agencies and instead invoked due process to empower judges and stakeholders to influence administrative behavior."
"6","Postell occasionally shines a light on startling ironies that have resulted from the tensions between constitutional principles and the administrative state, but he stops short of attributing them to pure politics. For instance, Postell explains how conservatives during the “Reagan Revolution” encouraged enhanced deference to federal agencies—a reversal of their positions during the Progressive Era and New Deal (pp. 281–282). This new deference, according to Postell, manifested itself in the judicial branch by conservatives defending the Supreme Court's opinion in Chevron (1984), a famous case that effectively shifted control of the administrative state from judges to bureaucrats by entrenching deference as a judicial principle.         "
"7","Postell ultimately resists the temptation to predict the fate of Chevron, but he correctly recognizes that conservatives have since returned to their original position of relative disdain for deference. And with the ascension of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, it appears the precedent could be in peril.         "
"8","In short, Postell compellingly argues the case that the Constitution continues to play a robust role in how agencies function. The tension that has characterized this relationship still results in headlines and helps make Postell's book a worthy addition to the debate over the administrative state."
