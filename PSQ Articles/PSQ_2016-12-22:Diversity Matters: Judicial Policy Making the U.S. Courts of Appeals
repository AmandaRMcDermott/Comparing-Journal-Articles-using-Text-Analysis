"1","It is difficult to understate the importance of this research agenda. Diversity Matters explores how racial and gender diversity affect the federal judiciary. While numerous U.S. Supreme Court cases establish diversity in postsecondary education as a compelling state interest, there is not nearly as much credible empirical evidence on this issue as one might think. Why? It is incredibly difficult to disentangle the effects of diversity from alternative explanations that are just as sensible a priori. For example, if we were to find that minority judges vote differently from those of the majority, how can we be sure that the disparate voting behavior is driven by race or gender rather than, say, the ideology of the appointing president? Moreover, even if we control for the appointing president (as the authors do), what are the mechanisms that might drive such results? A book on diversity on the bench must be able to navigate such empirical challenges and provide a sufficiently rich and balanced theoretical framework to help interpret the results.         "
"2","What do the authors find? In Chapter 1, Diversity Matters explores whether race is a strong predictor of a judge's voting behavior across various types of cases. There are a number of reasons why we might expect that race matters, and the authors provide a rich theoretical framework. As an example, the authors provide extensive background on the lives of prominent African American judges, including Thurgood Marshall, Spottswood W. Robinson III, and William Hastie, that breathe life into the idea that race is an integral part of one's identity. However, their empirical results are not in lockstep with the theory. It is interesting that the authors find no evidence that race matters when they pool across all cases; it is only when the authors examine cases separately by type that they find evidence of differential voting behavior by race. For example, there is no evidence that African American judges vote more liberally in cases involving distributive politics in comparison with white judges. It is only among cases involving employer discrimination that African American judges vote more liberally in comparison with white judges. However, these patterns do not persist across Latino judges. It is not entirely clear how these mixed results reconcile with theory.         "
"3","Chapters 2 and 3 study the effects of gender and then gender‐by‐race interaction effects, respectively. The authors find that female judges are more likely to empathize with the plaintiff in sex discrimination cases but otherwise exhibit similar voting patterns as males. An important contribution of this section is their study of oral histories that show initial cohorts of female judges were instrumental in fostering inclusiveness in the work environment. Thus, an analysis that focuses only on statistics will likely understate the influence of gender diversity on the bench. In a twist, the authors find that African American women are more likely to side with the plaintiff in sex discrimination cases but not in cases of racial discrimination. The converse is true for African American men. It may be interesting in future research to examine these results further."
"4","The rest of the book follows similar structure and investigates additional intriguing questions, including whether the number of minorities on a panel is an important predictor of voting behavior. Diversity Matters is an important book and makes many contributions to our understanding of judicial behavior. Some of the issues raised in this review should not detract enthusiasm for their work and, if anything, point us toward future research. On the whole, the authors contribute powerful descriptive evidence that diversity on the bench indeed does matter as well as a clear conceptual framework to organize their findings.         "
