"1","Alexander Hamilton is enormously significant, yet difficult to classify. He had great doubts about the American republican experiment, which led Thomas Jefferson and others to suspect him of monarchism; yet no one did more than Hamilton to make that experiment a success. He valued social rank, yet Hamilton himself emerged from poverty and social chaos. He displayed a conservative's attachment to order and was disgusted by the French Revolution; yet he sought radically to transform American economic life from agriculture to manufacturing. His statecraft and political thought defied political labels, then and now."
"2","In The Political Philosophy of Alexander Hamilton, Michael P. Federici portrays Hamilton as a prudent conservative for whom humanity was irreducibly both good and evil; the evil could be restrained but never eradicated (pp. 50–65). Federici compares Hamilton's conservatism to that of Edmund Burke (pp. 7–10, 14, 42), though he admits that Hamilton's expansive plans for national government do not quite fit the Burkean mold (p. 130, 198). He contrasts Hamilton's understanding of human nature and politics with that of Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and the French Revolutionaries, who believed that democracy and science could drive political and moral evil from the world (pp. 14, 53, 214–226). The Hamilton–Jefferson opposition is well‐traveled scholarly ground, but Federici provides fresh perspective by emphasizing Hamilton's hopes as well as his pessimism about human nature, in contrast to those who claim that Hamilton considered human beings unremittingly selfish and depraved (pp. 51, 55). He refutes the charge that Hamilton aimed to institute a monarchy on the ruins of the Republic (pp. 124–133).         "
"3","In the domain of foreign policy, Federici acknowledges that Hamilton's realism in some respects resembled that of Machiavelli. (On this theme, see John Lamberton Harper's excellent American Machiavelli: Alexander Hamilton and the Origins of U.S. Foreign Policy.) But Federici rightly emphasizes that Hamilton considered international obligations to be morally binding; only in extreme cases could they be justifiably suspended (pp. 15, 163–164). He persuasively characterizes Hamilton's foreign policy as prudently defensive, not imperialistically expansive (pp. 23–24, 148–152).         "
"4","Federici's treatment of Hamilton's constitutional theory is less persuasive. He notes that Hamilton hoped to vest the national government with “all the most important prerogatives of sovereignty” (p. 112), yet suggests that Hamilton long favored a division of sovereignty between federal government and states (pp. 108–111). What Federici characterizes as Hamilton's principled support for state sovereignty in The Federalist was actually Hamilton's reluctantly accepting that the Constitution left the national government weaker than he considered necessary and the states too strong. In his argument for a national bank—essential to his plans for a genuinely national economy—Hamilton famously advocated broad construction of the Constitution's language, in opposition to Jefferson's strict constructionism. Federici denies that Hamilton's record lends support to twentieth‐century progressives and New Dealers (pp. 142–147, 191). It is true that Hamilton's policy aims differed from those of twentieth‐century progressives. But his reading of Congress's power to legislate under the Constitution's Article I, section 8 was very expansive with respect to both constitutional means and constitutional ends. Twentieth‐century advocates for the constitutionality of broad congressional powers over taxation, spending, and economic regulation find legitimate precedent in Hamilton's constitutional thought, however different his purposes were from theirs.         "
"5","Federici notes the difficulty of reconstructing Hamilton's political theory from writings produced at different times in response to shifting events (pp. 4–12), but accepts the challenge anyway. The Political Philosophy of Alexander Hamilton enriches our understanding of this important and complex statesman and thinker.         "
