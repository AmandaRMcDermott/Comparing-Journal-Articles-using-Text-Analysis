"1","Election monitoring has fast become a prominent tool of international democracy promotion. But does it work? In this pioneering study, Judith Kelley shows that election monitors can make a difference by altering incentives and building domestic capacity, but monitors are also subject to pressures and biases that can weaken their impact. The book is organized around two questions: Do monitors assess elections accurately and objectively? Do they improve electoral quality? Two new datasets are introduced: the Data on International Election Monitoring codes for the assessments and problems documented by more than 600 international monitoring missions; the Quality of Elections Data provide alternative measures coded based on U.S. State Department human rights reports. The quantitative analysis—covering 1,324 elections from 1975 to 2004—makes an essential contribution to the literature. While previous studies (mainly single case studies) have come to divergent conclusions about the effect of election monitoring, this book's global, systematic analysis convincingly shows that monitors can improve elections, though their impact is mediated by domestic and international political factors."
"2","Chapters 3 and 4's exploration of monitors' assessments documents the rise of a “shadow market” whereby less‐credible organizations have emerged to challenge the more‐established, professional entities. But biases are not limited to this “shadow market”; even credible organizations face pressures to water down their criticism, for example, in countries that experience electoral violence or that demonstrate progress despite continued irregularities. Understanding this variation in the quality of monitors is essential for assessing their effects. Indeed, chapter 7 finds that only high‐quality missions are associated with better electoral conduct. To identify these effects, Kelley uses statistical matching—a method that helps correct for the non‐random assignment of monitors. Chapter 8 then presents country case studies that examine the longer‐term effects of repeated engagement with monitors. Here, conclusions are more mixed: of the 15 countries examined, 11 experienced only minimal or piecemeal progress, shedding light on a number of factors that mediate the impact of monitoring."
"3","Like any path‐breaking study, this book illuminates several directions for further research. First, more can be done to explore whether politicians strategically adapt to monitoring by increasing their use of “safer” (typically pre‐election) forms of manipulation that are less likely to evoke criticism. Chapter 5 presents descriptive evidence on this point, showing that different forms of misconduct tend to be complements, rather than substitutes. But without establishing a firmer counter‐factual—that is, what would the level of pre‐election misconduct have been in a particular case in the absence of monitors?—the possibility of strategic adaptation cannot be dismissed. One way to probe this issue qualitatively would be to trace changes in forms of misconduct in countries that host monitors over repeated electoral cycles. A second point for further research relates to the need for measures of electoral quality that are independent of the biases and shortcomings of monitors' reports. The solution proposed in this book—to examine U.S. State Department Human Rights Reports—may be the best available, but it remains imperfect because these reports themselves borrow from monitors' assessments. More could be done to explore the nature of this relationship: which monitoring organizations influence State Department reports the most? For which countries is bias greatest? Are there other sources of information on electoral quality—such as reports from domestic observation missions or even opposition parties—that are more independent? These and other questions remain to be explored. But this book provides a rich, cogent, and thought‐provoking entry point. It is essential reading for those interested in democracy promotion, international organizations and norms, and international influences on domestic politics.         "
