"1","The U.S. “pivot” to the Asia‐Pacific has received considerable hype, but until now, no credible and extended articulation of the concept has been forthcoming. As one of the chief architects and implementers of the policy, Kurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs in the Barack Obama administration from 2009 to 2013, is well placed to provide an authoritative and detailed discourse. Yet this volume defies simple labeling: it is part geopolitical assessment, part policy prescription, part memoir, and part travelogue. This is not surprising because the author has a long history of involvement in Asia. The result is a lengthy, albeit encyclopedic, erudite, and frequently engaging read. Separate chapters document the rise of Asia economically and geopolitically (Chapter 2), examine the history of U.S. policy toward the region (Chapters 3 and 4), explore possible future trajectories for Asia (Chapter 5), and address the challenges to implementing a successful Asia policy (Chapter 7)."
"2","As the author notes, the pivot has been widely misinterpreted and much maligned. So what is it? According to Campbell, the pivot is “a mixture of policies and actions—diplomatic, military, and economic—that together [make] . . . a more credible American commitment to the [Asia‐Pacific] region” (p. 13). The initiative is eminently logical given the growing importance of the region to the United States. Yet the policy has been criticized on a number of fronts, and Campbell responds to some of the most prominent in a refreshingly candid manner. He acknowledges, for example, that “one of the most significant critiques . . . is that it lacks resources and follow‐through” and admits that “the United States needs to do more” (p. 26)."
"3","Campbell's vision for how to implement the pivot is described comprehensively and at considerable length in the “Plan for the Pivot” (Chapter 6), which runs almost 100 pages. This chapter addresses in turn recommendations on major issues and on each of the key U.S. security partnerships in the region. Campbell advocates the “strengthen[ing]” of individual bilateral alliances—the so‐called hub‐and‐spoke system with the United States in the center—with bilateral spokes radiating out, and he urges “seeking to link alliances together” (p. 204). This sensible recommendation of course is not new; indeed, others have proposed similar steps. However, coming from a seasoned policymaker with extensive Asia‐Pacific experience who is poised to make a return to government service, this articulation merits careful attention."
"4","The future of the pivot remains uncertain—dependent on the priorities of the successor foreign policy team to the Obama administration and the domestic political climate. Campbell rightly observes, “The pivot is a work in progress” (p. 26). A Hillary Clinton administration—with the author almost certain to play a key role—could be expected to follow through, while a Donald Trump administration would be likely to abandon the idea. But whomever the next president is, the substance of the pivot will be at risk and with it the credibility of the United States in the eyes of U.S. allies and friends in Asia and elsewhere. As of late 2016, a key economic component of the pivot—the Trans‐Pacific Partnership or TPP—is on life support. Not only has the Republican‐controlled Congress refused to allow the legislation to come up for a vote, but also both major presidential candidates have publicly come out against the TPP. Moreover, there is no shortage of pressing contemporary foreign policy challenges outside of Asia to divert the attention and resources of the next administration."
"5","The Pivot will find an avid following among Asia specialists, policy wonks, and those who aspire to join one of these groups. Readership is likely to expand substantially if the author returns to government service. But, in the final analysis, the fate of this book depends on the fate of the pivot: this volume will either become an inspirational blueprint or the policy's articulate obituary.         "
