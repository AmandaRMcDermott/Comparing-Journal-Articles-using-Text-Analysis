"1","ARE DEMOCRACIES MORE REDISTRIBUTIVE than autocracies? That is, do they enact regulatory and fiscal policies that tend to equalize market incomes and transfer wealth from the rich to the poor? If so, are there certain conditions under which this pattern is amplified—or suffocated?"
"2","These questions are motivated by an influential literature on the distributive foundations of regime types that put class conflict waged between the rich and poor at the center of political life. Newer entries are centered on the median voter paradigm and are known collectively as social conflict theory.1 They are inspired by a host of celebrated earlier contributions.2"
"3","Social conflict theory makes several predictions. First, relatively unequal countries will tend to transition to democracy. Second, under democracy, the poor will take to the polls and favor policies that tax the rich and transfer income and wealth to themselves. Third, elected officials will cater to the preferences of those less well‐off because the logic of electoral competition drives them to converge on the preferences of the median voter. Fourth, democracies will be more redistributive than dictatorships.3 Fifth, the magnitude of redistribution will reflect the level of inequality: a poorer median voter means greater redistribution.         "
"4","The evidence supporting these claims is mixed, however. Several authors argue that democratic transitions are not driven by the redistributive demands of the poor.4 While the distribution of income is right‐skewed throughout the world, redistribution from the rich to the poor does not seem to be higher in democracies.5 Even at the highest levels of inequality, democracy does not map onto redistribution.6 This may be because politics is often about something other than pocketbook issues.7"
"5","On the other hand, several researchers have uncovered evidence that at least some democracies are quite redistributive. Policies that benefit the median voter and the poor under democracy have far from vanished,8 even for democracies that are fully integrated into global trade and investment.9 Public employment still serves as the backbone of the economy in democracies such as the Philippines and Indonesia. Elected leaders have successfully implemented effective pro‐poor conditional cash transfers in developing countries such as Brazil and Mexico.10 And robust welfare states in Western and Eastern Europe have weathered calls for austerity and continued to finance generous safety nets and publicly provided services.11"
"6","Moreover, and consistent with social conflict theory, pro‐poor policies and redistribution in fledgling democracies seem to cut across ideological orientation centered on the typical left/right divide. This pattern is evident in Latin America. In Argentina, the Kirchners have peeled back neoliberal reforms to appease coalitions that include labor unions and the poor, groups that lost the most ground during the 1980s and 1990s. Venezuela's Hugo Chávez walked a similar line. He and other populists favored subsidies, wage increases for labor along with price controls, legislated profit sharing, and the expropriation of capital. Conversely, pro‐poor policies in Brazil and Mexico were first enacted by centrist presidents and parties. In Chile, Sebastián Piñera, leader of the center‐right Alianza coalition, who became president in 2010, refrained from reversing progressive social policies adopted since 1990 under Concertación governments."
"7","If not ideology, then what motivates elected politicians to tax the wealthy and transfer resources to the majority of citizens through spending and regulatory policies? To answer this question, this article introduces and tests a theoretical framework that outlines the conditions under which politicians will be responsive to the median's preferred policies versus policies that benefit a narrow elite. It all depends on the legacy of the previous autocracy and whether economic elites are able to manipulate the rules of the game for their own advantage. To motivate the theory and test it empirically, this article focuses attention on Latin America (LATAM), a great laboratory for evaluating the relationship between regimes and redistribution."
"8","I theorize that if outgoing elites are able to impose roadblocks to popular representation before democratic transition, it is more likely that a democracy will not usher in greater redistribution than autocracy. Specifically, democracies in which elites impose the rules of the game through a constitution inherited from the previous autocracy should eschew the taxation of income, profits, and capital; stifle taxation in general; engage in less social spending; have lower levels of government employment; and be less likely to expropriate fixed assets.12 Elite‐biased democracies should also have lower levels of social spending and higher unemployment rates.13 The mechanism by which this occurs includes constitutional strictures and similar legal and political limits on the scope of government policy, as well as the political overrepresentation of elites through electoral rules and the politicized drawing of electoral districts.         "
"9","Conversely, democracies in which the median voter has a strong hand in writing the rules of the game, which I proxy with the adoption of their own constitution after transition, should enact policies that potentially benefit the majority by taxing the wealthy and redistributing to the poor. Specifically, “popular democracies” should be more likely to levy direct, progressive taxation; exhibit higher taxes in general; indulge in greater social spending centered on education, health, housing, welfare, and social insurance; have higher rates of public employment; and be more likely to expropriate capital."
"10","LATAM is a great laboratory for several reasons. While several of these countries have cycled back and forth between democracy and autocracy, many of them have experimented with public policies that should appeal to popular sectors at the central government level.14 Despite experiments in pro‐poor policymaking, the region's uniformly high levels of inequality mean the median voter is relatively poor across LATAM countries. Thus, this is a context in which we can conduct several before‐and‐after comparisons of the effects of democratization and we should not only expect greater redistribution after transition, but expect a lot of it.         "
"11","Therefore, to test this theory, I employ an original panel data set that identifies the constitutional legacy of the region's numerous democratic experiments and codes institutional arrangements that range from popular democracy to elite‐biased democracy. The theory is corroborated by the evidence. In terms of the comparison between popular democracies and elite‐biased democracies, the former have raised greater tax revenues, including increases in both direct, progressive taxation and value‐added taxes (VATs). They have also undertaken greater amounts of social spending, exhibited greater public employment, and expropriated more fixed assets in the form of land and firms involved in mining and hydrocarbon extraction. In terms of the effect registered by a democratic transition, while a change from autocracy to popular democracy is a boon for these outcomes, a change from autocracy to elite‐biased democracy seems to make no difference. The results are robust to a host of alternative explanations, country fixed effects, year fixed effects, and country‐specific time trends."
"12","To put distribution and redistribution at the center of the study of democratization, social conflict theory leans on a few interconnected assumptions. The first is that the pretax and transfer distribution of income is right‐skewed, as that guarantees that the median income is below the mean, and therefore the poor constitute a majority of the population. The second is that democracy is majoritarian: public policy reflects the preferences of the median voter. That means that assets, income, and rents will be extracted from the rich to level the playing field and programs that protect against risk will be instituted. It follows that while the poor should support democratization, the rich should generally oppose it because under autocracy it is their preferences, not the majority's, that are represented."
"13","However, under certain conditions, the rich should accept democracy—especially if the alternative might be a revolution that culminates in a socialist or communist dictatorship. If the poor's power is fleeting—they cannot credibly threaten to mount a revolution in the future—they will accept the franchise and regular, competitive elections as a credible commitment to redistribution. In other words, the rich may concede democracy to the poor as a bribe against revolution. This is more likely to occur under conditions of high inequality. When assets and income are unevenly distributed, the poor have less to lose from revolutionary change because they have little to no stake in the assets and income flows destroyed by violence—for example, while fighting for political change, they are less likely to destroy their own capital stock.15"
"14","There is strong evidence supporting social conflict theory among the advanced democracies. Democratization in Western Europe was often driven by the fear of revolution.16 Moreover, the steady widening of the franchise across Western Europe and the United States through the removal of income, wealth, and property restrictions on the right to vote for adult men, followed by suffrage for women, appears to have stimulated redistribution.17"
"15","Progressive taxation and high levels of social spending were the warp and woof of this equilibrium. At first, governments raised direct taxes with progressive marginal rates to provide basic public goods in urban areas undergoing rapid industrialization.18 Governments’ fiscal role then evolved to encompass national programs devoted to welfare, pensions, health care, and housing.         "
"16","The welfare state experienced a gradual, secular increase over the first half of the twentieth century, followed by a veritable quantum leap during the postwar era. Across the developed world, and especially Western Europe, spending on education and social insurance programs skyrocketed.19 The heyday of this equilibrium was the so‐called embedded liberal international order under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. During this era, all democratic governments in the developed world—and many developing countries—used capital controls to avail both fiscal and monetary policy for redistribution, full employment, and social insurance.20"
"17","However, there are reasons to be cautious about the belief that democracy is always a credible commitment to redistribution. There may be strong barriers to redistribution under democracy, especially in today's globalized world, even among the most unequal countries. While framing effects and ignorance about the distribution of income and fiscal policies may blunt demands for redistribution,21 regional, ethnic, or religious differences may be more salient than class‐based redistributive appeals.22 Moreover, if poorer citizens are relatively risk acceptant and anticipate upward mobility, they may eschew redistribution to avoid being taxed in the future.23"
"18","Even if the poor prefer redistribution, globalization may tie the hands of policymakers by enabling asset holders to move easily across borders to avoid redistribution.24 Several policy tools that facilitate redistribution are made more difficult by capital mobility. These include a government's ability to regulate labor markets and levy progressive taxation.25 Almost universally, countries have reduced marginal tax rates on high income earners, adopted flatter tax structures centered on VATs, and cut both corporate tax rates and rates on capital gains.26"
"19","Despite the aforementioned obstacles to redistribution under democracy, there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that some democracies should engage in progressive policies, even in the face of important obstacles. On the one hand, so‐called neoliberal policies have increasingly faced a backlash, especially after prolonged periods of austerity and unemployment.27 On the other hand, several researchers argue that the presence of strong unions and left‐wing parties can put pressure on elected governments to deliver redistributive policies.28 Similarly, Haggard and Kaufman argue that the effect of regime type is conditioned by the distribution of stakeholders and how they are organized.29 If public entitlements have historically been extended broadly, this bolsters electoral support for the welfare state; narrow coverage provides opportunities to court new constituencies and expand social programs yet limits stakeholders’ ability to defend their entitlements in the face of shocks.         "
"20","Similarly, there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that some democracies should systematically engage in regressive policies. Several researchers suggest that when the democratic rules of the game have been rigged in favor of the elites, they disproportionally influence economic policy and block redistribution.30 This echoes a host of anecdotal evidence. Consider Keefer's observation that “allowing a popular vote for one legislative chamber, but not another, the system prevailing in the United States in the nineteenth century, gave…elites a way to veto the efforts to redistribute their wealth.”31 Indeed, this might even be the case in the most “egalitarian” democracies. In Scandinavia, centralized bargaining by government‐sanctioned peak associations has historically engendered collective wage restraint32 and has had little, if any, causal effect on inequality.33"
"21","Finally, redistribution may be conditional on state capacity and the structure of the economy. Governments in the developing world may be unable to engage in the type of fiscal redistribution that was typical across Western Europe during the twentieth century. A more progressive tax structure and greater social spending were functions of the advent of lower tax collection costs borne by institutional reforms, the spread of elementary education, and modern record keeping.34 Government agents tasked with monitoring tax compliance have an easier time securing compliance when the population is concentrated in urban areas and it is literate and numerate—because it is easier for citizens to complete self‐assessed tax returns.35 Conversely, shadow economies and hard‐to‐tax sectors raise fiscal transaction costs.36"
"22","In the next section of this article, I elucidate a theory that provides scope conditions to explain why some LATAM democracies indulge in redistribution while others do not, despite the fact that the levels of asset and income inequality are very high across the region. To do so, I consider the politics of autocracy, elite‐led democratization, and popular democracy. I also integrate into the theory the idea that fiscal transaction costs may condition the ultimate level of redistribution as well as what form it takes; unorthodox measures may be undertaken when low state capacity and tax evasion make the taxation of income and assets next to impossible."
"23","The key to making sense of the equilibrium set of economic policies observed under any regime is to identify the power that critical actors have in society and whether they are able to shape the rules of the game in ways that favor their interests. In democracies, the key issue is whether it is the median voter who is able to influence economic policy rather than a smaller subset of the population, the economic elites. In autocracies, the chief determinant of economic policy is the outcome of the competition between ruling political elites and economic elites, who may not always have the same interests."
"24","There are three groups of critical actors who influence the economic policies that are adopted across regimes. The first are the economic elites. These individuals may enjoy selective property rights that grant them special privileges and flows of rents in exchange for generating revenues. Their property rights can be withdrawn by political elites if political calculations drive them to do so, however, making their privileged position inherently tenuous. This is particularly the case in an autocracy, in which the political elites can sometimes betray the economic elites and continue to hold power. These are not merely rare or passing threats; political elites sometimes have strong incentives to expropriate and harass economic elites.37 This is not the case under democracy if economic elites have a strong hand in its design, however.         "
"25","The political elites are the second group of critical actors. Composed of key civilian politicians under democracy, they can include state party cadres, important military players, and powerful civilians or ruling families under autocracy. While there may be conflicts within this group across any regime, they share the organizational and coercive capacity to control government. Their monopoly on violence and control of the legislative process allows them to grant and withdraw property rights."
"26","What does this difference between economic and political elites imply about economic elites’ preferences over regime types? While their incentives can sometimes be aligned to protect the rights and interests of the economic elite, the policy preferences of political and economic elites are not always shared.38 And even if political elites choose to protect the property rights of economic elites, leading to an overlap in their policy preferences at a given time, this does not mean that these property rights cannot be rapidly withdrawn.         "
"27","The third important actor is the mass of the population. The masses constitute the majority of society and therefore contain both the median voter (a poor agent when the distribution of income is right‐skewed) as well as all members poorer than the median. What the median voter wants is redistribution and social insurance.39 Therefore, in the case of fiscal policy, what the median voter wants is a progressive tax structure and redistributive social spending.40"
"28","Therefore, while the masses may temporarily support a populist dictatorship, their optimal outcome over the long run is full democracy. A suboptimal alternative is democracy biased by elites. As I argue later, they can obtain their preferred outcome if they successfully sweep out economic elites and erstwhile political elites and codify a new democratic constitution. This is not always possible, however, because economic elites are often able to control the terms of democratic transition and monopolize the rules of the game after democratization—usually by imposing their own constitution before the end of authoritarianism."
"29","Elite‐biased democracy is a regime in which free and fair elections are paired with devices, both constitutional and de facto, that codify and enforce the rights and interests of economic elites during the democratic transition process. On the one hand, rotation in office through elections and checks and balances ensure that executives cannot grow powerful enough to threaten elites. On the other hand, restrictions on the franchise, populism, and rules that overrepresent economic elites across political institutions such as the legislature and constitutional court ensure that the median voter cannot impose his or her preferences on the policy agenda."
"30","Elites prefer a democracy biased in their favor to an autocracy. This is because they can institutionalize their interests in ways that do not depend on the capriciousness of a dictator, military junta, or even a ruling party. Economic elites’ uncertainty about their property rights, while not eliminated, can nonetheless be mitigated under democracy."
"31","Therefore, the key variable that motivates economic elites’ willingness to abandon dictatorship and accept democracy is their relative ability to bargain for institutions that can safeguard their rights and interests after democratization. If such a bargain can be forged, and if elites can mobilize a critical mass of citizens or strike a deal with political dissidents to generate the coalition needed to support a transition, an elite‐biased democracy is likely to obtain.41"
"32","Throughout the region's history, economic elites have adopted rules that lead to the overrepresentation of their interests and that tie the hands of would‐be populists who seek to win electoral support through redistribution. These measures have included de facto property qualifications for elected representatives, literacy requirements for voters,42 and executive elections through indirect means, such as unelected electoral colleges or the legislature. LATAM democracies have also been burdened with rules that make it easier for conservative parties to gain power. Among the most pervasive measures to advance this end are malapportionment that overrepresents the owners of large landholdings, the appointment of senators opposed to redistributive policies, and the banning of left‐wing parties. What these disparate measures share is that they make it more difficult for the median voter to have his or her preferences enacted.            "
"33","Examples of these constitutions and their antiredistributive measures are scattered throughout LATAM. Argentina's democratic experiments have always included two chambers that are considerably malapportioned, especially the upper house—a pattern typified by the short‐lived introduction of three senators for each region in 1972, one of whom represented wealthy constituents. Both Guatemala's 1956 constitution and Brazil's 1967 constitution banned socialist and communist parties. Similarly, military juntas aligned with conservative parties, for example, in El Salvador, supported permissive electoral rules during transitional constitutional conventions to bolster the representation of rightwing parties.43"
"34","Bolivia's 1967 constitution is an egregious example of constitutional engineering to limit populist policies. Colonel René Barrientos spearheaded a coup against a civilian government in 1964, and, three years later, under the aegis of a new constitution, he dismantled the mine workers’ union, suppressed strikes, exiled union leaders, and granted private investors preferential treatment.44 This constitution was then bequeathed to Bolivia's democratic government in 1979.            "
"35","Perhaps the quintessential example of constitutional engineering that has served to prevent redistributive policies is Chile. Specifically, a bicameral chamber with malapportionment and restrictions on left‐wing parties were bequeathed by the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship to an elected government in 1989. Chile's revived democracy also inherited a host of appointed senators in a bid to limit the power of ascendant leftist political parties. In that vein, the 1980 constitution also prescribed a binomial electoral system tilted in former elites’ favor."
"36","Former autocratic elites can prevent constitutional safeguards from being eroded under democracy by steadfastly exploiting the power afforded by the constitution to further cement their political advantages. For example, elites can gerrymander electoral districts in a way that produces even more skewed malapportionment to their advantage. Also, former political elites can push early on for public policies that widen inequality, giving them an advantage in terms of collective action, resources, and de facto power over the less well‐off. Former autocratic elites can then gain favorable policies, either through legal means, such as lobbying and financing campaigns, or illegally, through corruption.45 For example, elites can embrace vote buying and clientelism in an effort to undercut populist economic policies.46 Moreover, if former autocratic elites can finance and support political parties and social actors such as the media, they can mobilize coalitions around issues that benefit them economically and politically.            "
"37","Consider Ecuador, where the 1946 and 1967 constitutions, both adopted by dictatorships, hobbled the executive branch's ability to use public policy to favor the poor majority. The Supreme Court and Congress repeatedly blocked legislation unfriendly to elites during the “populist” presidencies of Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy (1961–1963) and José María Velasco Ibarra (1968–1972). These measures included higher corporate taxes, agrarian reform laws, and import tariffs that threatened business owners.47 In describing this situation, Isaacs writes that               "
"38","[D]iscussion of either socio‐economic reforms or even promised political reforms, such as the extension of suffrage to the illiterate population, were conspicuously absent from the Velasquista agenda. When asked by a journalist how he could have held power so often and with such broad popular support and yet never have promoted social reform, Velasco reportedly responded incredulously: “Sir, do you think that if I had introduced reform I would have lasted in power another five minutes?”48"
"39","Democracy biased in favor of elites clearly does not always hold, however. While an elite‐friendly democracy may be better for economic elites in expectation than more uncertain autocratic rule, the elites cannot always manipulate the timing and circumstances of a democratic transition. Unexpected moments of elite weakness may elicit pressure for democratization, leading to a transition despite the inability of elites to guarantee a commitment to their rights under democracy. In cases in which elites are caught off balance, they are pressured to rush into a transition bargain more quickly than they would otherwise have done, decreasing their ability to manipulate the process to safeguard their interests after democratization.            "
"40","Prominent examples of democratization amid elite weakness are those transitions that occur when an incoming democratic regime can overturn the old order by writing a new constitution that empowers the majority. This may also occur when consolidating democracies are able to rewrite the social contract years after transition in favor of the popular sectors. Under these circumstances, democracies will tend to adopt economic policies that favor the majority."
"41","The theory detailed here posits that there are scope conditions that explain why some democracies indulge in policies that have the potential for redistribution while others do not. I expect an increase in potentially redistributive policies after democratization only when a new democracy is biased by economic elites on the eve of a democratic transition. As a proxy for the ability of elites to dominate the transition process in order to game the political system in their favor, I draw on four assumptions. First, economic elites can be either weak or strong on the eve of democratization. Second, this variation is correlated with elites’ ability to manipulate the political system in their favor during regime change by imposing a constitution that is friendly to their interests on the eve of transition. Third, the legacy of the democracy's transition process influences the relative power of the elites versus the masses after democratization.            "
"42","From these three tenets, I deduce the prediction that this constitutional legacy should influence whether policies will favor the poor versus the elites. When a democracy inherits a constitution from the previous authoritarian regime—which therefore intimates that economic elites were strong on the eve of democratization and imposed their interests on the succeeding regime—I expect reduced reliance on income taxes, fewer taxes collected in general, lower social spending, reduced public employment, and lower rates of expropriation. Conversely, when democratization follows a transition process in which elites are relatively weak and cannot manipulate the process by imposing a constitution, I expect the opposite."
"43","I evaluate these empirical implications by generating a time‐series, cross‐section data set of LATAM and Caribbean countries between 1965 and 2006. The countries included in the data set are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela."
"44","Ideally, I would like to measure the reduction in income inequality effectuated by taxes and transfers to capture the degree of redistribution. Fiscal redistribution is the difference between pretax and transfer income derived from wages and salaries, self‐employment, property, and pensions and post‐tax and transfer disposable income. Indeed, this is the approach to measuring redistribution undertaken by canonical works on the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development) democracies.49 Unfortunately, historical calculations of either market income inequality or disposable income inequality are impossible to come by for LATAM.            "
"45","Therefore, given these data limitations, I attempt to capture redistribution by employing variables that suggest that redistribution is taking place. I measure several dimensions of the capacity of states to tax, grow, and increase social spending and expropriate wealth. These are the progressivity of taxation, the progressivity of public spending, public employment, and the expropriation of capital in the form of fixed assets."
"46","To be sure, none of these dependent variables measures redistribution individually. Taxes do not really indicate whether revenues will be redistributed or whether they will be redistributed in a means‐tested manner. Neither do high levels of state consumption tap into redistribution per se. Social spending is also questionable, as it is often diverted to clientelism, cronyism, and corruption, or, as in the case of university spending or some pensions, the spending is captured by segments of the population that are well‐off. Finally, the expropriation of land, mines, and oil wells may not be followed by their redistribution to the poor. When taken together, however, these outcomes point to the possibility that redistribution is occurring."
"47","To attempt to capture the progressivity of the tax structure, I take two steps. The first is to identify the taxes levied on income, profits, and capital gains (as a percentage of gross domestic product [GDP]). The second is to identify the VATs levied on goods and services, as well as other taxes on goods and services, such as excise taxes. To operationalize both variables, I follow the guidelines and coding rules set forth in the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.50 I use both this source and, when needed, complement it with several secondary sources. Coverage begins in 1972 for both variables.            "
"48","The logic of this measurement strategy is that reductions in income inequality from before taxes and transfers to after taxes and transfers are engendered by more progressive taxes and thus are preferred by the median voter.51 A more progressive tax incidence means that taxes are levied on income, profits, and capital at graduated rates. In LATAM, effective income tax rates have a progressive incidence.52 Citizens who pay income taxes tend to be upper class, not wage earners in either the middle or lower classes. Moreover, property, estate, inheritance, and capital gains taxes levied at flat rates have tended to be progressive: relative to poorer citizens, wealthier citizens tend to own property, have estates, inherit wealth, and invest their savings. Indeed, even income taxation levied at flat rates is progressive in LATAM because of generous deductions and exemptions for the poor.53"
"49","However, it is also important to identify the level of taxes generated by VATs and other sales taxes with a regressive incidence and to evaluate whether increases in progressive taxes have been matched or superseded by increases in regressive taxes. Even if increases in the share of taxes on income, capital, and profits are registered, and even if we find that public spending is progressive, it could be the case that taxes with a regressive incidence nonetheless make up a greater share of total government revenues. In this scenario, the poor are paying a greater share of what they receive, and the overall fiscal structure is not necessarily progressive."
"50","Indeed, the norm in both the developed and developing world has been one of more regressive taxation combined with more progressive social spending. On balance, there has been radically increased regressivity in the tax burden in Western democracies since the late 1970s. European countries have increasingly relied on consumption taxes, especially VATs, and have cut both corporate and individual (statutory) income tax rates substantially. This pattern contrasts drastically with the reliance on progressive taxation on personal income and corporate profits following World War II across the Western democracies.54"
"51","Yet, at the same time, social spending has continued to increase steadily across the Western democracies and many countries in the developing world—a pattern that has been visible in LATAM.55 For example, over the past two decades, Brazil's centrist and social democratic governments have been able to implement progressive social policies because the prior military dictatorship succeeded in raising taxes through various less than progressive means, including the VAT.56 Later, I discuss why LATAM countries may be particularly susceptible to conducting redistribution through methods other than direct taxation.            "
"52","The third dependent variable is social spending (as a percentage of GDP). This is government spending on education, health, housing, welfare, and social insurance, and it is constructed from the same sources used for the taxation variables (it is also available since 1972). Public spending on education, health, and housing tends to be progressive because it involves the transfer of social resources to alter inequality induced by market outcomes and the attempt to equalize the life chances of poorer individuals through investments in human capital that boost the income and life chances of the poor majority.57 Direct transfers also tend to be progressive because they consist of government expenditures on unemployment and disability insurance, health insurance and pensions, and welfare transfers such as food stamps.            "
"53","To construct Democracy with Autocratic Constitution and Democracy Amends Autocratic Constitution, I had to first decide what counts as a regime transition. I use the binary electoral version of regime type provided by Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland.58 A country is coded as democratic if the chief executive and legislature are elected, there is more than one political party, and there is political alternation.            "
"54","Democracy with Autocratic Constitution captures whether a democracy is elite biased. It is coded as 1 when a democracy operates according to a constitution inherited from the previous authoritarian period. It is coded as 0 if the constitution is a prior democratic constitution in place before the previous period of dictatorship or the democracy passes a new constitution sometime after democratization.59 Because I seek to examine how the conditions under which countries democratized affect their subsequent public policies, elite weakness on the eve of transition is a legacy variable.            "
"55","Conversely, popular democracy is the obverse of elite‐biased democracy. A democracy is considered to be operating under a democratic constitution—and is thus a popular one—if several following conditions hold. It either creates a new constitution upon democratization, operates according to a prior democratic constitution that was in place before the previous period of dictatorship, passes a new constitution sometime after democratization, or amends an autocratic constitution adopted on the eve of democratization. This means that I must also operationalize a variable called Democracy Amends Autocratic Constitution. It is coded as 1 if a democracy amends an autocratic constitution that it previously inherited and 0 otherwise.            "
"56","Table 1 identifies all of the episodes of LATAM democracy since 1950, whether the democracy inherited a constitution from the previous autocracy, and the most important constitutional impediments to majoritarianism associated with these elite‐biased charters.60 Specifically, it outlines which constitutions prescribed executive elections through indirect means, such as unelected electoral colleges or the legislature, bicameralism, the appointment of senators opposed to populist policies, and the banning of left‐wing parties.61"
"57","Table 1 reports the relevant patterns. There have been more than 30 transitions to democracy in Latin America since 1950. Seventy‐one percent of democracies that transitioned during this time (22 out of 31) were elite biased. Several of these regimes annulled their autocratic constitutions at some subsequent point.62"
"58","To make sure that the regressions reported and discussed are not confounded by omitted variables, I take several steps. First, I adjust the data through a within transformation across the models to control for country‐specific heterogeneity that is constant over time (country fixed effects). This includes religion, culture, and history. I therefore focus on variation over time, examining how the transition between different regimes within countries, rather than the variation in regimes between countries, impacts the dependent variables. Additionally, I include a series of time‐varying factors that influence both the demand for and supply of fiscal redistribution in the statistical analyses. Because the results may be confounded by the omission of time‐varying variables, I also include country‐specific time trends across each regression."
"59","Finally, I also add a host of time‐varying determinants of redistribution. I control for log(Per Capita Income) because increases in wealth are expected to boost demand for public spending. I also include log(Population) because the scope of government regulation and spending may be characterized by economies of scale. The log of Total Resources Income Per Capita is included because corporate taxes on the profits earned by oil, gas, and mining firms may boost social spending and/or inflate the total income tax receipts collected by the government.63 Trade Openness, measured as exports plus imports (as a percentage of GDP) from the Penn World Tables  6.2, is included because it may influence both the demand and supply of redistributive transfers. The Old Age Ratio, from the World Bank Development Indicators (WBDI), is the percentage of the population above 65 years of age; it captures the extent of demand for intergenerational transfers.64 I lag all of these controls by one period.            "
"60","Table 2, Columns 1–10 present the results of ordinary least squares models for the five dependent variables: taxes on income, profits, and capital gains; VATs and similar taxes; social spending; government consumption; and the expropriation of land and assets in extractive sectors. I address heteroscedasticity, contemporaneous correlation, and serial correlation using Driscoll‐Kraay standard errors with a Newey‐West adjustment whose lag length is decided by Arellano‐Bond tests of serial correlation.         "
"61","Let us begin by reporting and discussing the results of the regressions in which we evaluate the determinants of taxes on income, profits, and capital gains, as well as the regression in which social spending is the dependent variable. To assess the overall progressivity of the fiscal system, we can then compare these results to those associated with VATs. To preview the findings: on the one hand, there is evidence that popular democracy increases the yield from taxes on income, profits, and capital gains; on the other hand, this increase is not enough to finance a concomitant increase in social spending. However, an increase in VATs seems to make up the difference, suggesting that the poor are getting what they pay for."
"62","Columns 1 and 2 serve as benchmark models that can be used as a basis of comparison to assess the remaining regressions.65 There, the dependent variable is progressive taxation and regime type is measured in a naive fashion: a country year is considered democratic if it satisfies the minimum requirements of electoral democracy.66 Although democracies have more progressive taxation at a high level of statistical significance, the substantive effect of regime type is quite small. Once I hold other determinants of redistribution constant (Column 2), taxes from income, profits, and capital gains are only 0.66 percentage point greater (as a percentage of GDP) in LATAM democracies than in autocracies.67"
"63","In Columns 3 and 4 (the dependent variables are taxes on income, profits, and capital gains and social spending, respectively), I decompose democracy along the lines suggested by the theory outlined earlier. Namely, I specify whether democracy is popular, because it operates according to its own constitution, or elite biased, because it inherits a constitution from its autocratic predecessor. In those models, there are three parameters of interest. The first is the difference in redistribution between elite‐biased democracies and popular democracies. The second is the difference made from switching from autocracy to popular democracy. The third is the difference made from switching from autocracy to elite‐biased democracy."
"64","The results in Columns 3 and 4 conform to theoretical expectations. Elite‐biased democracies are less reliant on taxation from income, profits, and capital gains (Column 2; p =.07) and register lower levels of social spending than democracies with their own constitutions (Column 3; p =.08). A regime transition from autocracy to popular democracy induces greater revenues from taxes on income, profits, and capital gains (p =.003) and increases social spending (p =.04). Conversely, a transition from autocracy to elite‐biased democracy tends to not make much of a difference to these variables. Moreover, these effects are substantial. For example, while taxes on income, profits, and capital gains increase nearly 2 percentage points after the transition to popular democracy, social spending registers an increase of almost 3 percentage points.         "
"65","Do these results demonstrate that fiscal systems become more progressive after transition to popular democracy, however? In order to find out, we now consider these results in conjunction with those in which the dependent variable is revenues from VATs and similar regressive taxes (Column 4). While the change in revenues from income taxes as a share of GDP yielded by a transition from autocracy to popular democracy is only 1.6, the change in social spending as a share of GDP after a transition from autocracy to popular democracy is 2.8. The discrepancy between these two figures is 1.2 percentage points. That implies that social spending is being financed by something other than redistributive taxation; one possibility is the VAT. The results in Column 4 appear to bear out this possibility: the magnitude of the coefficient associated with a change from autocracy to popular democracy is 2.6 as a percentage of GDP (significant at the 95 percent level). If one adds this coefficient to income taxes, the revenues obtained total 4.2 percentage points, which can more than account for increased social spending (2.8)."
"66","Moreover, these results seem to agree with work that shows that the LATAM governments that collect the most taxes rely on VATs, whereas the governments that levy the most progressive taxes potentially collect fewer taxes because the wealthy evade them. For example, consider Bergman's survey evidence from Argentina during the late 1990s: over 80 percent of the country's taxpayers reported that they were willing to evade taxes.68 In short, although government spending appears to be more progressive in LATAM's popular democracies, it is not necessarily the case that the net fiscal impact is progressive.         "
"67","Why might this be the case in LATAM? There are several interconnected reasons. First, greater reliance on VATs and a reduction in marginal tax rates have been increasingly common across the developing world, in part because the IMF has pushed countries that have received its financial assistance to shift their attention toward more efficient and less distortive taxes in an effort to broaden the fiscal base and promote growth. At the same time, the IMF has also encouraged recipients to sustain their social safety nets and abstain from cutting public spending on social programs. Second, LATAM countries may lack the administrative competence to collect direct taxes, including a professional and ethical staff that is well paid and has the resources at its disposal to audit self‐assessed tax returns. Third, because of the increasing globalization and sophistication of capital, the wealthy have been better able to evade income taxes: they can shelter their money offshore or engage in transfer pricing, for example."
"68","In their attempt to tax citizens’ income, profits, and capital, governments may face numerous transaction costs. These influence whether democratization translates into increased fiscal redistribution. One set of fiscal transaction costs are forensic and include the costs of identifying taxpayers’ wealth, income, and salaries; verifying tax obligations; and conducting audits on tax returns, especially when those returns are self‐assessed. Others are related to the tax bureaucracy's ability to project a credible threat of sanctions in retaliation for tax evasion and the administering of tax laws and its ability to gain citizens’ compliance."
"69","Usually, high fiscal transaction costs to direct, progressive taxation imply that there is a large group of hard‐to‐tax individuals in the population.69 This category includes white‐collar professionals who generate capital income and are self‐employed, such as lawyers, doctors, and architects. This group also includes another notorious set of tax evaders: businesses, trusts, and partnerships, which may keep the bulk of their income and capital earnings in foreign currencies and sometimes hold these assets offshore. The hard‐to‐tax category also includes street vendors and others groups who occupy the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder and generate labor income (for example, street vendors).            "
"70","Conversely, individuals and businesses participating in the formal economy are easier to tax. The income, profits, and capital gains they produce generate a paper trail recorded through transactions at domestic banks. Modern firms operating in the formal sector produce salaried jobs, regular payrolls, and tax withholding. They regularly process accounts receivables and accounts payable. All of these features make individuals’ and firms’ taxable obligations much easier to monitor, making it much less likely that they will fail to submit self‐assessed tax returns. Similarly, they should be less likely to claim fraudulent exemptions and deductions."
"71","Historically, LATAM countries have tended to lack the sophisticated and formal economic activities that help to reduce fiscal transaction costs, and its tax bureaucracies have been less than effective and honest. Moreover, these costs tend to be higher when populations are poorly educated, rural, and work in the informal economy—all problems endemic to LATAM. The region's governments have therefore tended to refrain from undertaking the invasive, costly procedures required to successfully conduct progressive direct taxation."
"72","What do the high fiscal transaction costs that are prevalent throughout LATAM imply for the theoretical framework outlined here? If they are responsible for the lack of fiscal redistribution under popular democracy, and not a lack of demand by poor citizens or a lack of electoral incentives, then a clear empirical implication follows. Namely, redistribution through unorthodox measures that can circumvent these fiscal transaction costs should be more likely under popular democracy than autocracy or elite‐biased democracy. Indeed, if such measures are available, then it is likely that politicians may even eschew reforms capable of reducing these costs to avoid sucking up dear resources and incurring high opportunity costs."
"73","One of these unorthodox redistributive tools is public employment.70 As a way of transferring wealth to favored constituents, politicians can spin government posts out of whole cloth or even erect entirely new bureaucracies. This may involve the creation of a large public workforce that commands higher than market salaries and ties the state to future unfunded liabilities, which means that regimes that indulge in this strategy tend to end up with much larger governments. Therefore, I proxy public employment with Government Consumption (as a percentage of GDP) from the Penn World Tables; because this measure excludes income transfers and public investment and is weighted by the relative prices that prevail in the world economy, it closely approximates outlays associated with government salaries and similar benefits for public employees.            "
"74","The results of a regression in which Government Consumption is the dependent variable are reported in Table 2, Column 6. Consistent with the hypothesis, transitions in which new democracies adopt their own constitution unleash larger governments (p =.04). This result is substantively large. While in comparison to elite‐biased democracies the public sectors of popular democracies are, on average, 3 percentage points smaller (as a percentage of GDP), a transition to a popular democracy yields a 3 percentage point increase in the public sector versus the autocratic periods. Meanwhile, transitions to elite‐biased democracy do not stimulate larger governments.            "
"75","The relatively liquid assets represented by modern, formal sectors composed of investors, salaried white‐collar workers, and wage laborers constitute a relatively elastic tax base. When capital is mobile in this way, it is considerably harder to tax: it can exit high‐tax jurisdictions for those with lower tax burdens.71 And in some political and economic contexts, it is difficult for the state to either impose restrictions on outbound capital flows—perhaps because policymakers want to retain monetary sovereignty and cannot maintain fixed exchange rates—or entice investors and firms to stay put in exchange for concessions, such as public goods or an educated workforce. Historically, most LATAM countries have fit this description.            "
"76","Therefore, LATAM policymakers who are intent on redistribution may focus their attention elsewhere: on economic sectors with assets that are less mobile and therefore constitute a more inelastic revenue base. On these grounds, there are two types of fixed assets, in particular, that may be attractive targets. The first is the extractive sector, including the mining of industrial and precious minerals and the extraction of hydrocarbons—oil and natural gas. Similarly, land is fixed and impossible to hide—and, in the case of LATAM, has typically been concentrated in a few hands."
"77","Nonetheless, the orthodox taxation of these assets and their associated revenues has remained difficult for LATAM countries that lack professional and reliable tax bureaucracies—even if, ultimately, they are immobilized. For example, while extractive firms may engage in transfer pricing to reduce their taxable income, large landholders may bribe public officials to evade their fiscal obligations. Thus, I predict that popular democracies in LATAM will be more likely than autocracies or elite‐biased democracies to expropriate firms operating in extractive sectors and large landholdings and then redistribute these to poorer population segments.72"
"78","To test this hypothesis, I code a dummy variable called Fixed Asset Expropriation. It identifies the expropriation of either firms operating in extractive industries (mines and hydrocarbons) or large‐scale landholdings. The bulk of these data are from Albertus and Menaldo, who produce an exhaustive set of these expropriations until 2002; in order to extend these data to 2006, I follow their coding rules and rely on a host of primary and secondary sources.73 In regard to firms operation in extractive industries, they record all expropriations of oil, gas, and mining firms. In regard to land, they only code expropriations of private landholdings when these exceed 3 percent of cultivable land, and argue that this threshold best captures the cases accepted as major takings in the land reform literature. Between 1965 and 2006, there were 77 separate expropriation episodes registered in the 22 LATAM countries that make up this sample, which translates to 8.3 percent of country years.            "
"79","The evidence confirms this hypothesis. In Table 2, Column 7, I report the results of a linear probability model estimated by ordinary least squares that is identical to the models reported in Columns 2–6, save for the fact that the dependent variable is Fixed Asset Expropriation.74 Democracies with elite‐biased constitutions are 29 percent less likely to expropriate firms operating in the extractive sector or large landholdings (p < .001). And while a transition to a popular democracy induces a 22 percent increase in the probability of expropriation (p =.002), a transition to an elite‐biased democracy reduces the probability of expropriation by 7 percent (p =.09). Considering that Fixed Asset Expropriation is a binary variable and the relationship between the covariates and the probability of expropriation may be nonlinear, Column 8 re‐estimates this regression using a probit framework with maximum likelihood. The results are materially unchanged. Finally, I note that the results are robust to estimating a Cox proportional hazards model—and treating expropriations as “failures”—with random effects (results not shown but available upon request).            "
"80","Social conflict theory predicts that because democracy is a credible commitment to redistribution, a transition to democracy ushers in greater redistribution. Building on this literature, I introduce a theoretical framework that ties the constitutional origins of democratization to the divergent fiscal and spending policies adopted under democracy. I argue that democracies with legacies that incentivize policymakers to appeal to the median voter, which I proxy with the adoption of their own constitution after transition, adopt policies that benefit the majority by taxing the wealthy and spending on the poor. Conversely, elite‐biased democracies, in which economic elites are able to impose a constitution that overrepresents their interests before democratization, block redistribution."
"81","I corroborate these predictions empirically in LATAM, an ideal laboratory to test the theory. I exploit the sizable variation over time there in political institutions, and, most particularly, changes from autocracy to different types of democracy, as well as the fact that, historically, the distribution of market income has been highly right‐skewed there. Democracies that adopt their own constitutions impose higher taxation on income, profits, and capital gains; collect more taxes in general; engage in greater spending on education, health, housing, welfare, and social insurance; exhibit higher rates of public employment; and expropriate fixed assets."
"82","The theory and evidence introduced in this article reconciles the impressive democratic gains made in LATAM with the fact that in many of the region's democracies, assets, income, and human capital remain unequally distributed, and the elite continue to dominate public policy. The reason is that democracy in LATAM has often been commandeered by the rich, despite veritable regime changes. This article thus supports the basic intuition advanced by social conflict theory, although it also qualifies it. It is indeed the case that institutions and, most particularly, regime types, matter for social welfare—but not all democracies are created equal."
