"1","More than a decade since the U.S.‐led war on al Qaeda and its affiliate terrorist networks, we are nowhere near defeating this vexing adversary. On the contrary, the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and America's renewed engagement with countering radicalization at home and abroad demonstrate the failure of earlier strategies to contain, delegitimize, and defeat violent extremists. After two major wars, extensive security assistance to allied nations, billions spent on new homeland security institutions and measures, and a plethora of programs intended to delegitimize and deradicalize extremists, what else can be done to counter the threat of terrorism?"
"2","It is in this context that Alex S. Wilner introduces the case for deterrence as an underexplored strategy in the war against Islamist extremists. Deterring Rational Fanatics offers a lucid, if not entirely compelling, argument for seeking to deter terrorists by altering their motivation to orchestrate violence. His central argument is that despite the aura of fanaticism surrounding groups such as al Qaeda and the Taliban, these entities are rational actors that could be manipulated, influence, and compelled to rethink their violence. The key to deterring these organizations is to break their terrorism systems into their component processes and to seek ways to exercise leverage at each stage. Terrorism involves recruiting, financing, training, arming, competing, planning, striking, and communicating. Each part produces opportunities for counterterrorism states to deter through punishment, denial, and delegitimization.         "
"3","Wilner acknowledges the daunting challenge in formulating the position that al Qaeda, and its more ominous successor ISIS, are rational strategic actors that are susceptible to the logic of deterrence. To his credit, he takes on deterrence skeptics such as Fareed Zakaria who ask a simple question: “How do you deter someone who is willing, indeed eager, to die?” (p. 2). These skeptics argue that Cold War deterrence theory is the wrong prism with which to frame the contest against stateless actors. Unlike the Soviet Union, these substate actors lack a “return address” that is a prerequisite for establishing the threat of punishing retaliation in response to unacceptable attacks. Absent clear state assets that could be targeted by nations confronted with a terrorist adversary, the logic of deterrence collapses."
"4","Moreover, deterrence skeptics point out that fundamentalist religious ideology interferes with rational calculations such as prioritizing utility maximization over sacred imperatives. Fundamentalists often pursue means that are not efficiently and plausibly connected to their worldly objectives and instead pursue costly strategies to earn heavenly rewards. Additionally, terrorists often attack to provoke conflicts and induce military responses; therefore, they would welcome escalation when the logic of deterrence requires the adversary to be sensitive to punishment. Terrorists may use escalatory violence for organizational purposes such as attracting new recruits or outbidding competitors. In these situations, they may welcome retaliation from the targeted state instead of viewing it as an intolerable cost."
"5","Wilner begins his case for deterrence by making a distinction between fanatical members, who may be all too eager to die for transcendental rewards, and their organizations and leaders, who are genuinely interested in temporal strategic objectives. The former may not be susceptible to deterrence, but the latter can be manipulated and influenced through the right mix of deterrence strategies. Furthermore, “terrorists may be stateless, but they are not asset‐less” (p. 8). Each terrorist group has things that it values, including its state sponsor(s), public image, financial networks, physical sanctuaries, relationships with supporting constituencies, and so on. Wilner argues that targeted states can identify what it is that specific terrorist groups value and begin to threaten those domains as part of a tailored deterrence strategy."
"6","Deterring Rational Fanatics is excellent at outlining the issues, summarizing several decades of deterrence theory, and highlighting debates about the efficacy of deterrence strategies such as targeted assassinations. However, it falls short of offering a compelling empirical case for deterrence. Wilner focuses on targeted killings of four major Taliban leaders to make the case that coercive deterrence works. His measure of success, however, is not the overall decline of Taliban violence after targeted assassinations but rather the degree of effectiveness and professionalism of attacks following a targeted killing. This nuanced measure is reasonable, but it misses the point. As the author notes, deprofessionalization of terrorism is valuable because of its second‐order effects, such as the inability to maintain earlier levels of recruitment and retention. Yet in none of the cases presented does the author show that these effects have indeed materialized. There is little evidence that the Taliban today is weaker in its ability to attack, recruit, and retain fighters. Indeed, the opposite seems to be the case, as evinced by the U.S. administration's decision to maintain major combat forces well beyond 2016 in response to a resurgent Taliban.         "
"7","Despite the empirical weakness of the book, the lucid argument and theoretical analysis of deterrence as it pertains to stateless actors makes this book an important contribution to the field of terrorism studies."
