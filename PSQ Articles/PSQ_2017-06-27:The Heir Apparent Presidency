"1","In this fine new volume, Donald A. Zinman examines the presidencies of those who immediately followed regime‐building presidents. Zinman's project, in the tradition of American political development, is to delve into one of the cyclical aspects of Stephen Skowronek's notion of political time (The Politics Presidents Make: Leadership from John Adams to Bill Clinton) and articulate a difference within a broader category.         "
"2","Skowronek's reconstructive presidents establish enduring regimes; articulating presidents are those that follow and uphold that tradition. From within the articulating presidents who maintain the regime, Zinman identifies a difference, that of the heir apparent. Heirs apparent, in Zinman's classification, are the five presidents who immediately followed regime builders. He includes in this number James Madison, Martin Van Buren, Ulysses S. Grant, Harry S. Truman, and George H.W. Bush. Grant is included in this group even though Andrew Johnson immediately followed Lincoln because Zinman sees Grant as the more natural heir to Lincoln due to several unique aspects of Johnson's presidency."
"3","With an engaging style, Zinman uses well‐known episodes in each presidency to arrive at commonalities that he argues sets heirs apart from other regime‐maintaining presidents who are less immediate to the regime's establishment. The case studies are concise yet rich in narrative. This volume is imminently suitable for the general reader as well as for scholars of the American presidency and those interested in American political development specifically."
"4","Zinman finds that heir apparent presidents engage in three common approaches in their unique positions in political time. First, they will pursue continuity as they seek to maintain the new regime. By emphasizing their ties to the previous administration, however, heirs inherit the good with the bad. As a result, another approach that heirs have will be a corrective one. Care will be taken to “refine, repair, and even repudiate” (p. 154) policies established by the regime‐building president. Finally, heirs will expand commitments by building on previous policies and furthering the unfinished business of the regime, keeping justifications within the ideology of the regime but also staking out their own territory. Zinman concludes with lessons for heirs apparent in how to survive the unique position in political time that they inhabit; however, these lessons seem equally applicable to all heirs, not just the immediate ones."
"5","One aspect that I do not believe Zinman adequately addresses in his account is the extent to which the heirs apparent are really that unique from the later heirs, that is, those who are still trying to maintain the regime but are more removed in time from the regime establishment (a John F. Kennedy as opposed to a Truman, for example). There ought to be more consideration of the role the heirs apparent play in the cementing of the regime. After all, regime builders do not arise in a vacuum; regimes are not immediately noticeable, or identified, in political time. If the heir was not elected, we would not talk of a regime. Later heirs, but not the heirs apparent, have the benefit of hindsight, as do scholars. Regardless, Zinman's engaging book contributes to how we might consider more nuances in political time, and for that reason, it is a worthy contribution to the varied literature in this vein."
