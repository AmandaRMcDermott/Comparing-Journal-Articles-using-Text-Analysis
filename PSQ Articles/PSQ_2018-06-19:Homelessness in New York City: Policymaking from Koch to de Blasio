"1","German mathematician Horst Rittel first described wicked problems as “a class of social system problems which are ill‐formulated, where the information is confusing, where there are many clients and decision makers with conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the whole system are thoroughly confusing” (quoted in Richard Buchanan, “Wicked Problems in Design Thinking,” Design Issues 8 (Spring 1992): 5–21, at p. 15). Among their defining properties are the lack of a definitive formulation, the presence of multiple explanations, and the fact that every wicked problem is a symptom of another higher‐level problem. Contemporary urban homelessness is clearly a wicked problem of the first order that has bedeviled New York City's citizens, government officials, advocates, and social service providers since its reemergence in the late 1970s.

"2","In Homelessness in New York City: Policymaking from Koch to de Blasio, Thomas J. Main, of Baruch College of the City University of New York, delivers a comprehensive history of the New York's ongoing efforts to address this problem, skillfully illuminating how the complex interplay of political, organizational, legal, and interest group forces have shaped both the policymaking process and the nature of the robust and costly system of shelters and related services that has evolved over the past 40 years. The author has deeply mined the abundant written record, drawing heavily on documents and reports growing out of a long‐running legal struggle between public officials and homelessness advocates seeking to influence policy. He complements this evidence with copious stakeholder interviews and his own firsthand observations. What emerges is a detailed, carefully nuanced, and balanced account that brings the issue's convoluted history to life in a way that elucidates the city's ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful efforts to solve this seemingly insoluble problem.

"3","Main rightly spends significant space analyzing the long‐running saga of multiple lawsuits, court orders, and judicial oversight panels that led to the establishment of shelter as a right in New York City, a development that has profoundly affected the policymaking process. This in‐depth examination is especially illuminating, as it clearly demonstrates both the positive impacts of the litigation in forcing the responsible public agencies to improve what were by all accounts deplorable conditions in the shelters while simultaneously illustrating the serious costs and limitations inherent in judicial efforts to resolve complex social problems. Another important issue that receives well‐deserved attention is the way in which policymakers’ strongly held beliefs continued to drive key decisions despite weak or nonexistent empirical support for them. In particular, the idea that addressing homelessness by providing permanent housing to shelter users would lead to “perverse incentives” and thereby increase the overall demand for shelter continued to hold influence even after convincing evidence to the contrary was produced by academic researchers."
"4","One of Main's conclusions is that the extreme fragmentation characterizing New York's policymaking environment, while typically seen as impeding reform, actually encouraged significant policy innovation by creating opportunities for “policy entrepreneurs” to drive positive change. For example, he rightly credits the influence of academics and advocates in effectively promoting the Housing First philosophy, which led to the city beginning to reorient its primary approach away from a focus on “fixing” homeless people's deficiencies and toward swiftly providing permanent housing. Despite this positive step (along with others, including significantly improved shelter conditions), the sad fact is that 40 years later, the wicked problem of homelessness remains atop New York's list of social policy challenges, where it is likely to remain until the problem of the city's dwindling supply of affordable housing is effectively addressed."
