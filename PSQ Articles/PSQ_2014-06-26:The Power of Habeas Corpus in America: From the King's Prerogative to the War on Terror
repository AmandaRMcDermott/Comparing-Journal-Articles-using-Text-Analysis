"1","Anthony Gregory portrays the history of the writ of habeas corpus—the legal proceeding whereby a prisoner seeks release from government‐enforced confinement—as a complex and conflicted one. Challenging the prevailing view, Gregory argues that habeas has often been rendered “impotent” by government manipulation (p. 5) and even becomes, at times, a tool for increasing government power. These consequences stem from the writ's dual nature. “It is a tool known for its service of liberty,” he says, “yet at its core it entails an authoritarian element” (p. 4). Habeas corpus amounts to an order by a government actor commanding another government actor to bring forth a prisoner. Thus, it has been subject to political forces."
"2","Developments in the writ's history illustrate this paradox. For example, the 1679 Habeas Corpus Act resulted from an intragovernmental power struggle. In antebellum America, habeas corpus petitions were filed to recover fugitive slaves as well as to free slaves and abolitionists. In Ableman v. Booth (1859), proslavery Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that state courts could not interfere, via habeas actions, with the process of recapturing slaves (p. 89). Another example that Gregory provides is the Warren court's criminal procedure rulings of the 1960 s, which increased federal supervision of state criminal proceedings by broadening habeas corpus (p. 165). While the Warren court supported defendants' rights, it also asserted federal control over the affairs of state government. Finally, post‐September 11, the George W. Bush administration denied “war on terror” detainees the chance to file habeas petitions and thereby gain access to the federal courts. Even when the Supreme Court overturned that policy, the Bush and Barack Obama administrations sought ways to limit the availability of habeas relief. Gregory also notes consistent patterns of state behavior across time periods. The most‐striking example is where the executive, whether English king or U.S. president, seeks to evade the reach of habeas corpus by moving prisoners out of the realm. In early modern England, this meant sending them to Scotland; after September 11, it meant holding them in Guantanamo Bay, or in Afghanistan, or in more‐secret sites (pp. 36, 206). These actions show that the writ has often been circumvented, in the same manner, for centuries.         "
"3","Gregory's analysis is most compelling when it shows historical deficiencies in the habeas corpus process, as judges and other state actors allow political factors to occlude the writ's operation. But he surely overstates things when he says that “habeas corpus has become nationalized so as to no longer serve as a meaningful decentralist check on the central state's detention policies” (p. 292). Gregory would like to empower state courts to challenge federal detention. He believes that much of the liberty‐enhancing potential of habeas corpus lies in its use by the state courts. But this recommendation ignores history, both earlier and recent. In pre‐Civil War America, state governments were hardly reliable guardians of freedom. The Wisconsin court in Ableman wanted to free abolitionist John Wilkes Booth, but the Southern states held a very different view of the fugitive slave conflict, of course. During the civil rights era, it is true that the federal courts became more powerful, but they did so in response to an unwillingness of the state courts (and Congress, until 1964) to act. Moreover, the Supreme Court's protection of habeas corpus in the war on terror has in fact been a check—although often an insufficient one—on executive power. That is why the executive has fought so hard to circumvent its rulings. The fact that courts often fail to utilize the writ's potential should not be a reason for fundamentally reconceptualizing habeas. Instead, it should inspire stronger advocacy for the effective use of existing habeas procedures.         "
