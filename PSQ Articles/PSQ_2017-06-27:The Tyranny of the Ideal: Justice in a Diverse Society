"1","Part of the immense success of John Rawls's A Theory of Justice stemmed from the sense that it showed how rigorous formal models of reasoning could be applied to ethics. In this book, Gerald Gaus continues that tradition, but with a twist. Rather than arguing that formal models can be used to establish an ideal theory of justice, Gaus employs social choice models to demonstrate our lack of the precise knowledge required for the specification of ideally just social conditions to orient the search for improvements in justice here and now. Along the way to this conclusion, in admirably clear prose, he sympathetically but critically introduces his readers to post‐Rawlsian contemporary political philosophy, interweaves the history of utopian political thought, and ends by suggesting how we might construct a public social world not governed by ideal theory but rather acceptable to diverse perspectives, despite the intractable and deep disagreements that characterize the exercise of human reason under free institutions. Thus, Gaus has produced a rich, challenging, and at times brilliant book, one that strives to put forth a vision of what political philosophy may and may not do to advance human freedom.         "
"2","Drawing on Amartya Sen's The Idea of Justice, in addition to Karl Popper's critique of utopian political thought in The Open Society and Its Enemies, the outcome of Gaus's analysis is that the quest for an ideal theory of justice entails not merely an epistemological mirage but also a morally and politically dangerous social project. Dangerous, because the quest for an ideal theory of justice forces us to choose between obvious local increases in justice and the pursuit of a less certain ideal. Ideal theorists of justice play down the difficulty of choosing between these alternatives, but by foregrounding the wide‐ranging complexity necessary to realize and orient our search for justice, Gaus's social choice analysis emphasizes how such conflicts are unavoidable under the terms of ideal theory. Further, in the aftermath of Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot, this dilemma is no mere philosophical puzzle, he argues: “those who are convinced that they have a perfect vision of an unchanging utopia are all too likely to give into the temptation to march us toward their promised land” (p. 88).         "
"3","Demonstrating that the tradition of political philosophy begun by Rawls, when developed formally and pursued rigorously, leads to skeptical conclusions is a great strength of this book. Less clear is that the book's skeptical conclusions imply that utopian political thought is itself—as Gaus, following Popper, suggests—mere fiction and imagination, not to be seriously considered as human beings strive to make their world more just (p. 142). After all, others have reached the conclusion that the Rawlsian quest for ideal theory is a mirage without abandoning the moral and political work that fiction and imagination offer. Indeed, rather than continue to embrace the idea that rigorous formal models of reasoning should be applied to ethics, some philosophers have turned from questions about what we ought to do toward questions about what it is good to be or what it is good to love. While much recent work has been done on the Aristotelian question of what it is good to be, less work has been done—despite the influence of thinkers like Iris Murdoch on contemporary philosophers such as Susan Wolf—on what it is good to love. As Gaus's book powerfully illustrates, whether the Rawlsian project of ideal theory is a dead end remains a live issue. Regardless of whether the question of what it is good to love provides an alternative framework, one distinct from the Rawlsian framework Gaus employs, how to understand the moral status of utopian political thought remains a live question, despite the reach and brilliance of Gaus's book.
