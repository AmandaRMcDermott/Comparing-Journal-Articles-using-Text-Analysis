"1","For more than 200 years, Americans have tried to make sense of the present by looking to the past. In Democracy's Muse, historian Andrew Burstein examines the many versions of Thomas Jefferson that politicians from the Great Depression to the present have used to explain modern American politics and culture. Jefferson is a fitting focus of this study, as, in Burstein's estimation, “he is the one ‘founding father’ whose political sentiments reverberate loudest” throughout American history (p. ix). Burstein opens with several chapters exploring the myriad ways that Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and others used Jefferson to support their political agendas. Burstein is less interested in making any particular argument about how Jefferson was used than he is in revealing the “several noticeable facelifts” that Jefferson “passively endured” (p. ix).         "
"2","Some readers may wish for a stronger analytical framework, but this approach serves two important purposes. By eschewing a specific argument in favor of a more open‐ended exploration, readers can better understand both the lens through which presidents asked Americans to view Jefferson and the historical context in which those presidents used Jefferson. The exploratory nature of the first half of Democracy's Muse also makes Burstein's analysis of the culture wars surrounding Jefferson in the second half of the book much more impactful. Chapters on race and religion are highly effective at demonstrating why it is important to interrogate modern‐day uses of the past and of Jefferson in particular. Many Americans, including many of Jefferson's heirs, have rejected the possibility that the author of the Declaration of Independence could have fathered children with one of his slaves, Sally Hemings, even in face of DNA evidence and overwhelming logic. Burstein persuasively asserts that such rejections, and the discourse surrounding them, raise difficult questions about the way we understand the historical Jefferson and about race and racism today.         "
"3","Burstein is at his best in deconstructing the efforts of the religious right, the Tea Party, and conservatives more generally to reconstitute Jefferson as a defender of the role Christianity should play in American government. Burstein pulls no punches in going after those who ignorantly or maliciously contort Jefferson's beliefs on religion and the separation of church and state in an effort to bolster a particular politico‐religious agenda. I have no doubt that some conservative readers will take issue with Burstein's conclusions, but his analysis is powerful and grounded in an expert's familiarity with the historical sources."
"4","While it is natural to look to someone like Jefferson for wisdom and inspiration, Burstein masterfully illuminates the fool's errand that is the application of specific Jefferson quotes to modern policy questions. Far too often, we read our current concerns and personal beliefs into Jefferson's writings: FDR's Jefferson was motivated by a humane concern for the well‐being of the individual while Reagan's abhorred government overreach and abuse. Both presidents offered a valid reading of Jefferson, but each reflected only a partial reading of his complicated political ideology. Burstein makes clear that the danger of these partial readings is that Jefferson's reflections on rights, race, religion, and government hinged on the context of the world in which he lived. His assessments of the problems of the early American Republic cannot and should not be excerpted, decontextualized, and applied to modern times. As Burstein aptly asks, “why do we imagine that Jefferson had anything to say to Reagan's America or to America today?” (p. 74). Democracy's Muse forces us to confront the past on its own terms and challenges us to ask the same of our political leaders.         "
