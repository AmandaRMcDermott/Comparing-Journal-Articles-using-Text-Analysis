"1","After being largely ignored for far too long, the deeper psychological, biological, and evolutionary bases of political beliefs have made for something of a crowded book market of late. Jonathan Haidt's, The Righteous Mind continues to receive much deserved attention; Milt Lodge and Charles Taber's The Rationalizing Voter is another important recent contribution, and my own book—Predisposed—(with Kevin B. Smith and John Alford) was published at about the same time as Avi Tuschman's Our Political Nature. In light of this situation, readers are likely to wonder whether Tuschman makes a unique and important contribution to the field and the answer is that he clearly does.         "
"2","Tuschman believes three core personality clusters shape human political orientations: tribalism, inequality, and perceptions of human nature. Tuschman further believes that each of these clusters derives from evolutionary pressures and that these traits and their corresponding pressures structure the six parts of this immensely engaging book. The first part explains tribalism; the second, tribalism's evolutionary roots. The third part explains inequality; the fourth, inequality's evolutionary roots. The fifth part explains perceptions of the human condition; the sixth, these perceptions' evolutionary roots. As Tuschman sees it, the tribalism cluster is connected primarily to mate choice; the inequality cluster to the nuclear family; and perceptions of human nature to altruism outside the immediate tribe."
"3","What sets this book apart? This organizational structure allows an amazing amount of ground to be covered. In addition to its tremendous scope, Tuschman's book is set apart by the extent to which he sees politics through “evolutionary glasses” (p. 13). Finally, the third personality cluster (perceptions of human nature) is also somewhat novel. Previous attempts to delineate the core principles dividing liberals and conservatives have focused on attitudes toward change and attitudes toward inequality, with conservatives tending to prefer stability even if it leads to inequality, and liberals tending to prefer equality even if it requires change. As such, variations in perception of the human condition have received less attention. Tuschman fixes that."
"4","Because the book is so fresh and provocative, it naturally generates questions and alternative points of view. First, do these three personality clusters cover the entire gamut and do they operate independently of each other or tend to combine into meta political orientations? Second, I am not sure I fully agree with Tuschman's connection of attitudes toward inequality to matters of the nuclear family rather than the tribe (see Part III). After all, though the distribution of family resources is important, much current and past political debate is about how to divide resources across members of society at large. Finally, I am a big believer in the value of an evolutionary perspective, but, particularly in the modern age, as selection pressures are relaxed, it may be possible to push it too far. For example, Tuschman makes much of the role of mate choice in structuring politics and suggests that liberals want more liberals around because they want to expand their mate choices. As Tuschman concedes, however, liberals also are using birth control with abandon, so perhaps populating the world with more liberals is not their ultimate goal. Procreation aside, perhaps liberals simply enjoy the company of other liberals just as conservatives enjoy the company of other conservatives."
"5","Still, details in need of further reflection can be identified by any reviewer. The important point is that the discipline of political science has been far too slow to locate politics firmly inside the evolved human condition, tending instead to view politics as exogenous, culturally idiosyncratic, and entirely learned. Our Political Nature constitutes a bold, valuable, and eminently readable strike against that outdated view.         "
