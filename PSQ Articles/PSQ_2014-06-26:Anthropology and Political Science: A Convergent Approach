"1","Linkages between state actions and those of ordinary people are becoming increasingly important for grasping the dynamics of world affairs in the twenty‐first century. That situation makes understanding the mutual relevance of anthropology and political science more important than ever. In Anthropology and Political Science: A Convergent Approach, Myron Aronoff and Jan Kubik set out to demonstrate that mutual relevance and to explore it systematically.         "
"2","Anthropology and Political Science is a welcome addition to the conversation about how the two disciplines might profitably enhance one another. The book consists of 10 chapters, comprising an introduction, a conclusion, three conceptual chapters, and five empirical chapters that illustrate the value of combining anthropological and political science approaches. Written by two scholars who have for a long time worked at the intersection of political science and anthropology, the book gathers together and updates somewhat earlier published work, especially in its empirical chapters, which are framed by original and useful discussions of the epistemological and ontological differences between the disciplines.         "
"3","In the first chapter, Aronoff and Kubik begin with a very useful discussion of the differing assumptions that underlie the methods of each discipline. They then move on in their second chapter to examine the added value that ethnography brings to attempts to bridge macro and micro levels of analysis. They present a useful typology of five different kinds of ethnography, and they explore the various contributions that each of these approaches can make. Although there is considerable attention paid to the underlying assumptions of each type of ethnography, I found the description of ethnography to be curiously limited to a somewhat‐underspecified discussion of the method of participant observation. Anthropologists will recognize that ethnography often involves more than this technique. Chapter 3 discusses conceptual advances “beyond political culture,” focusing (too) briefly on each of the following areas: the importance of symbols and signs, myths, ritual, rhetoric, legitimizing discourses, collective memory, tradition, ideology, and utopia and hegemony. Chapter 4 then expands on the symbolic dimensions of politics, discussing some of the important ways in which political ritual works in this area. Included in the discussion is an interesting recounting of classical distinctions between modern and traditional societies. Many of the topics and examples taken up in this and the previous chapters seem rooted in the anthropology of the '70s and '80s, as does some of the empirical material presented. Chapters 5 through 9 present case studies that offer an indication of the value of combining anthropological and political science approaches. As with some of the conceptual material, the studies themselves have a slightly dated feel, insofar as they are largely revised or reprinted from the authors' earlier work, which has spanned several decades. A final brief conclusion seeks to reflect on the material presented earlier, and makes some useful points about the ways in which binaries and the problem of scale are important when trying to integrate anthropological and put of the science analyses. This final chapter raises many very useful points, but does so in a rather telegraphic manner. The body of the book is followed by an extensive bibliography and both name and subject indices."
"4","The material in Anthropology and Political Science: A Convergent Approach pulls together and summarizes the authors' decades‐long work and thinking in this area. To some extent, this is reflected in the fact that many of the topics considered in the volume would be viewed as dated by anthropologists, for example, the discussions of substantivism versus formalism in economic anthropology. A person encountering the challenge of integrating anthropology and political science for the first time will find the book engaging and informative. It is a book that could profitably be used as an adjunct text in methods classes or theory classes in both anthropology and political science. Despite its shortcomings, Anthropology and Political Science: A Convergent Approach is a welcome addition to the conversation between these two disciplines.         "
