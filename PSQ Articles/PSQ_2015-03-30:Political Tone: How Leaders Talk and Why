"1","This is an important book. Roderick P. Hart and his coauthors have extended a long line of research that focuses on presidential style. Starting with Verbal Style and the Presidency (1984) and including his masterful The Sound of Leadership (1987) and Campaign Talk (2000), Hart has led the way in computer‐assisted analysis of presidential discourse. In this latest book, the authors turn to the matter of tone.         "
"2","Admitting that tone is a difficult concept to define and that its workings often seem mysterious, the authors nevertheless do an admirable job of clearly defining their topic and setting forth the assumptions underlying their analysis. “Tone,” they argue, “is a subset of style” (p. 8) and “a tool people use to create social impressions via word choice” (p. 9). Analysis of word choices is what this book is all about."
"3","Using a data set of some 30,000 texts, all of them drawn from the ongoing Campaign Mapping Project at the University of Texas at Austin, Hart and his coauthors use the multiplatform program DICTION 6.0 to analyze talk—talk by presidents, talk by citizens, and talk by reporters. The DICTION program is sophisticated, using some “10,000 search words in thirty‐three word lists or dictionaries” (p. 14). Master variables include Certainty, Optimism, Activity, Realism, and Commonality. Each master variable reflects dozens of words that are conceptually linked to that variable. In addition, the program allows users to construct their own customized dictionaries. For this project, Hart and associates constructed five such dictionaries: “Patriotic terms (homeland, justice, liberty, pilgrims, etc.) [2] Party references (Democrats, Republicans, etc.), [3] Voter references (constituents, electorate, citizenry, etc.), [4] Leader references (Adams, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Perot, etc.), and [5] Religious terms (doctrine, spiritual, heavenly, Sabbath, etc.)” (p. 15).         "
"4","The book is divided into 10 chapters, with Chapter 1 setting forth the definitions and assumptions; Chapters 2–5 exploring the tone of social forces such as diversity, partisanship, modernity, and institutionalization; Chapters 6–9 analyzing personal forces by investigating the tone of Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal (“resilient tone”), George W. Bush across the eight years of his presidency (“measured tone”), Barack Obama during the 2008 campaign (“neighborly tone”), and Sarah Palin's postcampaign speaking (“wandering tone”); and Chapter 10 reflecting on the possibilities of political tone."
"5","Much of what the authors uncover in this book is unsurprising. Yet there are moments of real insight, as when the authors argue that George W. Bush was “more a pragmatist than an ideologue, a person often bedeviled by the intricacies of his job but whose remarks contained considerable nuance nonetheless” (p. 152). And they have the data to prove it."
"6","One final point: a book on political tone must itself have a tone, and this one does. The tone is respectful of different analytic approaches, inclusive of research from a wide variety of traditions, and humble in its interpretations. Even scholars who work at the opposite end of the methodological spectrum (as I do) can learn from this book."
