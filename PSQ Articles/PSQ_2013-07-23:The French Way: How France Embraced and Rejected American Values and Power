"1","Richard Kuisel is no stranger to the convoluted affairs of Franco‐American relations. These have been conflicts of cultures and values as much as historical situations and politics. His new book harks back to his 1997 work, Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization. In that earlier work, Kuisel had established himself as a careful and balanced analyst of France's passionate struggle to remain master of its culture, economy, and politics in the face of an American challenge tous azimuts.         "
"2","In historical terms, the French Revolution was constantly compared with the American one as contrasting paths to modern democracy. Though much diluted, this perception of “French exceptionalism” survives as counter to the idea of American exceptionalism."
"3","In The French Way, Kuisel studies the 1980s and 1990s as opposed to earlier times more sharply incised by Gaullism and French communism. He argues that in the eighties, the François Mitterrand/Ronald Reagan/George Bush '41 presidencies amounted to a period of “transatlantic affability” following the anti‐Americanism of the 1950s, due mainly to the French Communist party, and the resistance to American diktat during the period of de Gaulle's presidency (p. 3). The 1970s, the Jimmy Carter/Valéry Giscard years, were a period of transition. During the 1990s, foreign policy differences were a sticking point between Bill Clinton and Jacques Chirac. In the wars in the former Yugoslavia, “The French found themselves subordinate to an erratic and dominating ally” (p. 259). But Chirac was no de Gaulle.         "
"4","At his best in discussing cultural clashes, a delightful extended chapter on “The Adventures of Mickey Mouse (Euro‐Disney Land), Big Mac and Coke in the Land of the Gauls” details the financial interests and psycho‐dramas of how much these American icons would adapt to France or the reverse."
"5","France's place in the international order is another recurrent theme of Franco‐American complexity. French foreign policy in the late '90s attempted what Kuisel terms a “new realism.” Appropriately, he several times quotes former French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine in this regard."
"6","Vedrine, a Gaullist‐Socialist in foreign policy, is a matter‐of‐fact realist and by no means the anti‐American he (and de Gaulle) were made out to be in Washington. He coined the infinitely quoted term “hyperpower” to describe America's “unilateral moment” in relation to other powers in the world order. France, he said, still sometimes plays an important role, but its policymakers would do well to stop “acting like the Great Nation” whose diplomatic wisdom and experience merit unique consideration (p. 265)."
"7","The French Way ends on an upbeat note: “There is a viable French way,” Kuisel concludes, meaning that France can adapt incrementally to “a globalized, Americanized modernity…without sacrificing the essence of the French difference… .” If so, “it will be healthy for the French, for Americans, and for others.”         "
"8","Nevertheless, other European countries, in particular Germany, matter increasingly for the French financial and economic future—first of all because so much depends on German policy in the European Union. Logically, French media should be leading public opinion toward a more‐informed awareness of at least Germany, including domestic society. The same could be said for every EU country."
"9","That European eyes continue to look first at America expresses a psychological limit on European integration."
