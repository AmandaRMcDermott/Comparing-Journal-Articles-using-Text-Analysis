"1","Michael Schudson went looking in the 1960s for the origin of an unheralded sociocultural change favoring openness and the “right to know” and came up short. He also did not find much evidence of full transparency as a fundamental democratic virtue lurking in the Founding Fathers’ rhetoric—a good second guess. Instead, Schudson discovered, against his sociological training, which favored structure over agency, a disparate group of individuals who brought Americans a broad array of political, economic, and cultural changes, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); a more adversarial, analytical press; environmental impact statements (EIS); consumer‐informing disclosures, such as unit pricing in supermarkets; “informed consent” research procedures; and open discussion about formerly private matters, such as women's health and sexuality from Our Bodies, Ourselves to Betty Ford's radical mastectomy. The book's main argument is that these changes together ushered in a “society of self‐disclosure” (British sociologist John Thompson) in which openness and transparency became “a practice and . . . a value” (Schudson).         "
"2","The individuals most responsible for these changes include familiar names such as Ralph Nader and Henry “Scoop” Jackson along with the less familiar, such as John Moss (FOIA), Esther Peterson (unit pricing), and the political scientist Lynton Caldwell (EIS)—unsung heroes of the first stage of the “openness revolution.” Far from being the leaders of a coherent social movement, with raucous street demonstrations and rousing speeches, Schudson's reformers worked mostly separately and inside organizations. They often pursued instrumental and particular ends that had little to do with fealty to abstract principles, although their achievements had large ancillary benefits, including the elevation of those principles. For example, Representative Moss's push for FOIA arose from his frustration about Cold War executive secrecy vis‐à‐vis Congress and the press. His principal intended beneficiary was Congress. FOIA now stands as an emblem of democracy and openness as much as it is a tool that citizens use to force agencies to disclose unnecessary secrets."
"3","Schudson is up front about the limits of his causal analysis. Social scientists looking for finely honed and tested hypotheses will not find them here. This is instead a meticulously researched, illuminating history written by a sociologist who teaches journalism classes. Schudson's disciplinary heritage clearly shapes his thinking; he is forever searching for causes, albeit with a loose multidisciplinary attitude. His comfort with writing history allowed him to chronicle and interpret causes rather than trying to securely configure them to outcomes. Which causes? On top of leading individuals, Schudson considers the rise of television, critical thinking in higher education, the spike in college attendance, Judy Blume books, the loss of neighborly corner stores to impersonal supermarkets, events such as Watergate and the Pentagon Papers revelations, and popular beliefs about the country's founding documents. There is a tension in the book between the loose, tentative consideration of causes and the recurring search for them. Readers who appreciate the study for what it is—a work of history—should quickly get beyond that tension.         "
"4","For most of the book, the developments proceed on separate tracks, making them seem disconnected. Fortunately, Schudson ties them together in a much‐needed conclusion and a penultimate theoretical chapter that conceptualizes the arrival of “monitorial democracy” after World War II. Readers who make their way through this mostly accessible but richly detailed book will recognize with fresh eyes the objects, ideas, and patterns of far‐reaching sociocultural change. Schudson acknowledges that the openness revolution has not been complete. One example is the problem of excessive government secrecy, which has persisted despite FOIA and other reforms. But this book's history ends in 1975, when those reforms were pregnant with promise, before they had a chance to fail. Overall, the book offers a convincing and well‐told origin story of an understudied, underappreciated broad change and provides a useful counterpoint to other scholarship that has focused on secrecy."
