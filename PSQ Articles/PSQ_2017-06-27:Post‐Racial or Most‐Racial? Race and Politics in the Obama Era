"1","After the historic 2008 election of President Barack Obama, many pundits proclaimed that the United States had entered a new era in which racial prejudice no longer existed. However, numerous scholarly works, including Michael Tesler's first book, Obama's Race (coauthored with David Sears) debunked the notion of a postracial era. Obama's Race demonstrated that the historic nature of a potential black president made race more accessible in the minds of many Americans, compared with previous presidential campaigns. In many ways, Tesler's solo‐authored book, Post‐Racial or Most Racial: Race and Politics in the Obama Era can be thought of as the sequel to Obama's Race.         "
"2","The premise of Post‐Racial or Most Racial is that President Obama's position as the most prominent figure in American politics ushered in a most‐racial political era in which mass politics was divided by and over race, a phenomenon that Tesler refers to as “the spillover of racialization hypothesis.” As in his other work, Tesler relies on an impressive variety of surveys and research designs to advance his argument. Although alternative hypotheses are scrupulously considered, Tesler convincingly demonstrates that racial attitudes’ influence on a variety of political evaluations increased significantly after becoming connected to President Obama— including evaluations of Obama's rivals (such as Mitt Romney), public policy preferences previously unrelated to race (for instance, health care), and even the public's impressions of Portuguese water dogs (the breed of the Obama family's dogs). Although the deluge of data is sometimes a bit overwhelming, by the time one reaches the conclusion, it is difficult to dispute that racial considerations seem to carry more weight and extend to more issues than before Obama's presidency.         "
"3","However, not every political position that Obama staked out during his presidency is expected to polarize public opinion by racial attitudes and race. Accordingly, Tesler outlines four theoretical conditions for the spillover of racialization hypothesis: (1) racial spillover effects are expected to be weak and fleeting for issues on which Obama has not taken a visible position; (2) racial spillover effects are expected to be more enduring when African Americans are the perceived beneficiaries of the policy; (3) Obama was more likely to activate racial considerations than partisan attachments for issues that were not already highly racialized; and (4) weakly held attitudes are more susceptible to racial spillover effects than more crystallized attitudes. Of these four theoretical conditions, two are especially noteworthy."
"4","First, the notion that racial spillover effects are expected to be more enduring when African Americans are the perceived beneficiaries of the policy is of note because it suggests a central role for group interests in the spillover of racialization hypothesis. One of the ongoing debates in racial attitudes research has to do with the role of group interest, and Tesler appears to be sympathetic to the group interest perspective. Group interest is also central to his definition of racial resentment, which he defines as akin to “Old Fashioned Racism” in that it is a set of attitudes designed to “justify the pervasive racial inequities in American society” (p. 20; see also p. 34). Thus, Tesler's definition of racial resentment is a marked departure from the definition used by some of the forerunners in the field (such as Sears and Donald Kinder), who argue that modern racism is based on pre‐adult socialization rather than whites’ real or perceived group interests."
"5","Second, although the fourth theoretical condition suggests that crystallized attitudes such as partisanship should not be susceptible to racial spillover effects, Tesler finds that party identification was more polarized by race during the Obama era than it was shortly prior to his ascendancy. White racial liberals became increasingly Democratic, while racial conservatives became increasingly Republican during Obama's tenure. Because partisanship is consistently one of the most influential predictors of political behavior, the growing racialization of partisanship is equivalent to the growing racialization of American politics more broadly. This result, among many of the other findings from the book, is likely to have a far‐reaching influence on the ongoing discussion about impact of race in America."
"6","Thoroughly researched and theoretically nuanced, Post‐Racial or Most Racial is certainly a must‐read for scholars of race and politics, as well as for anyone interested in understanding the growing political polarization in contemporary American politics.         "
