"1","Group interest often overshadows self‐interest in the study of political behavior, political psychology, and public opinion research. In The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind, Jason Weeden and Robert Kurzban challenge self‐interest's relegated status by refocusing attention on the role of self‐interest in policy evaluation. Weeden and Kurzban argue that self‐interest consists of more than “some material gain now or soon” (p. 36); instead, they “view self‐interest as advancing any range of people's typical goals, whether directly involving material gain or not, whether involving immediate gain or something more subtle and advances someone's progress over the longer term” (p. 37).         "
"2","This is a more inclusive definition, but in practice, the distinction between self and group interest is rarely straightforward. In many circumstances, group and self‐interests align. This broad definition produces a degree of conceptual slippage throughout The Hidden Agenda, as it is occasionally difficult to differentiate group‐ versus self‐oriented motives. In spite of this, the authors develop a theoretically and empirically convincing account regarding how fundamental exogenous factors—such as race, religion, gender, education, and income—intersect to produce policy preferences.         "
"3","It may be tempting to view this as old wine in a new bottle, as students of political behavior have known for some time that these factors are important. However, it becomes clear that even if this is a new bottle, it has a more informative label (complete with nutritional information, dietary guidelines, interactions, and consumer warnings). Throughout the text, Weeden and Kurzban demonstrate the various ways in which these demographic factors converge to produce clusters of like‐minded voters. For instance, the Republican coalition (Chapter 8) consists of four categories, whereas the more tenuous Democratic coalition is described in Chapter 9."
"4","While there are compelling theoretical reasons to slice the electorate in the ways described in The Hidden Agenda, there exists an opportunity for subsequent work to significantly bolster Weeden and Kurzban's claims. For instance, a useful empirical exercise would be to demonstrate that the clusters described in the book best describe their data—that is, the clustering solution minimizes within cluster variation and maximizes between cluster variation. Cluster analysis or latent class analysis might demonstrate such a pattern. Such an exercise would also contribute to Weeden and Kurzban's argument concerning intraparty dynamics. They suggest that wealthier, more educated, conservative voters (“Boehners” in The Hidden Agenda) form the backbone of the Republican Party; however, the Democratic coalition is more tenuous, having “no trunk—it's more like a log pile” (p. 177). Yet it is unclear whether a more systematic approach would demonstrate greater heterogeneity on the left. As I write this, 12 candidates have entered the Republican primaries; House Speaker John Boehner continues to manage a diverse coalition of “Tea Party” Republicans, libertarians, and mainstream conservatives; and moderate Republicans have adjusted their legislative behaviors to avoid being “primaried” out of office by ideologically extreme candidates.         "
"5","The Hidden Agenda is an important contribution to a field dominated by group‐oriented explanations. While addressing many important paradoxes in the political behavior and ideology literatures, the work opens several important avenues for future research. For example, Weeden and Kurzban advance a relatively bottom‐up account of opinion formation, in which self‐interest is seen as causally prior to policy preferences. It remains unclear what role elites play in this process. Public opinion scholars have noted the volatility of public opinion, and models of survey response suggest that political beliefs are not fixed but subject to a stochastic sampling process (see, for example, John Zaller and Stanley Feldman's 1992 article “A Simple Theory of the Survey Response” in the American Journal of Political Science). Likewise, citizens are highly susceptible to elite cues by forming opinions on the fly based on the positions of like‐minded experts and opinion leaders (see, for example, Zaller's 1991 book The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion).         "
"6","An open empirical question is whether elites contribute (or detract from) an individual's ability to connect self‐interest to policy preferences. We learn from The Hidden Agenda that human capital—education, income, and cognitive resources—interacts with one's group orientation to predict preferences on a host of domestic policies. Future work might consider how this process unfolds in the presence of policy debate, elite cues, and other contextual circumstances. I suspect that addressing these issues will only strengthen the main conclusion: that self‐interest should return to forefront in the analysis of political behavior.         "
