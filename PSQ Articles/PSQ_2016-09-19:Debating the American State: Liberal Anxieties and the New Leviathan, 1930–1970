"1","In this book, Anne M. Kornhauser chronicles how sympathetic, liberal critics of the modern administrative state confronted tensions they saw in the “statist liberal project” of the mid‐twentieth century (p. 2). The book focuses on the liberals who were most concerned not with the size and scope of modern administrative government but with how its new functions would be carried out. Kornhauser alleges that they, not conservatives who rejected the very premise of a more robust state, were the most insightful thinkers regarding the problem of modern administrative power."
"2","After sketching the ongoing controversy over the administrative state's legitimacy, Debating the American State thoroughly and somewhat laboriously describes three attempts to grapple with the problem. The first, undertaken by scholars of law and social science during the New Deal, sought to preserve the rule of law and democracy in the face of the administrative state's appeal to efficiency, emergency politics, and technocratic expertise. Through procedural safeguards and participation in administrative government, they sought to make the administrative state democratic and accountable. The second encounter came when critical liberals, particularly German émigrés, confronted the tension between administrative governance and the rule of law in light of post–World War II challenges, including the occupation of Germany and the Nuremburg trials. Finally, John Rawls sought in the 1950s to construct a new social contract theory to “overcome the legitimation issues that had swirled around the modern Administrative state for decades by placing it on a more secure ethical footing” (p. 176).         "
"3","In addition to the extensive research it presents, one virtue of this book is its honesty and clarity regarding the challenges posed by modern administrative government to democracy and constitutionalism. Rather than efface these tensions, Kornhauser acknowledges them openly. She engages thinkers troubled by the administrative state because it challenged fundamental principles. They “looked for a more lasting basis for the administrative state's legitimacy” by “confronting the sacrifices necessary for living with the leviathan, and by trying to find ways for minimizing or circumventing the damage to democracy, the rule of law, and individual autonomy” (p. 13). Consequently the “critical thinking about the administrative state…cannot be reduced to programmatic, ideological, or partisan differences” (p. 222). As opposed to many scholarly treatments of the administrative state, this book admirably refuses to paint concern about administrative government simply as a way of masking libertarian opposition to government itself."
"4","Debating the American State is a work of intellectual, not policy history. This is both the strength and the weakness of the book. Because it confronts fundamental theoretical questions, the book has much to offer those who favor modern government's ends but are ambivalent about its methods. However, it is unclear whether these arguments had a substantial role in influencing the development of the administrative state during the twentieth century.         "
"5","Of course, the administrative state has changed substantially since it arrived in full during the New Deal period. Consequently, it is an overstatement to suggest that “the institutional underpinnings and basic priorities of the administrative leviathan remained little changed from the beast that had emerged out of the 1930s and 1940s [to today]” (p. 229). But the fundamental dynamic that Kornhauser presents has not changed. Therefore, Debating the American State is an important attempt to assess the ongoing tension between the ideal of constitutional government and our practice of administrative governance.         "
