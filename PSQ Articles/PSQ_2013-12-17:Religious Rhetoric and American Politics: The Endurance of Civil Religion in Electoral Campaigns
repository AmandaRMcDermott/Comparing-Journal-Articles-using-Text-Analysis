"1","Christopher B. Chapp begins his foray into the effects of religious rhetoric in American politics with a comparison of two elections familiar to those interested in the topic: the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections. Chapp's research challenges the popular notion of the 2004 election as driven by social issues “values voters,” and uses this example as a jumping off point for his research on religious rhetoric and its effects on presidential campaigns. Arguing that we empirically know little about religious rhetoric and how it motivates voters, Chapp theorizes about the nuances of American religious rhetoric and empirically tests its effects in electoral campaigns. To do so, he uses data sets of computerized speech analysis from the 1980 to 2008 presidential campaigns, national surveys, including the American National Election Survey, the National Civil Religion Identity Study, and an experimental research study of undergraduate college students experiencing religious rhetoric on a website. By incorporating these varied data, Chapp facilitates a clear social scientific analysis of religious rhetoric's effects."
"2","Although Chapp devotes Chapter 2 to detailing the historical development of religious rhetoric in the United States, the reader will quickly discern that this section is primarily background for his data analysis. At times, the historical chapter feels overly succinct, detailing the Puritans through the Cold War. Readers looking for a more‐nuanced account of religious voices in American political history, particularly the struggles as well as successes, should seek among the references that Chapp cites—although these references might have benefited from more interdisciplinary breadth, incorporating more religious rhetoric scholarship from the humanistic study of Communication (rhetorical studies) and English (rhetoric and composition)."
"3","Chapp's four analytical chapters serve to further our understanding and knowledge about the complicated nature of religious rhetoric, exploring emotive appeals, identity formation, candidate evaluation, and the effects of discourse. In appealing to these different aspects, Chapp identifies three types of religious rhetoric: civil religion appeals, drawing on Robert Bellah's notion of civil religion; religious subgroup appeals to particular groups, such as denominations or factions within denominations (orthodox Catholics, progressive evangelicals); and culture war appeals. These “three types of religious identity” are shown to have “distinctly different consequences in the American mind” (p. 41), which the book examines in detail. He writes in a manner that makes the data accessible and applicable to those who are less familiar with social scientific modeling, and utilizes interesting case studies and examples to illustrate these larger conclusions."
"4","Two notable conclusions are representative of the scholarly work done in Religious Rhetoric and American Politics. First, in his analysis of the emotive content of religious rhetoric, Chapp concludes that culture war rhetoric is less about anger—what we might typically associate with a “war”—and more about a deep anxiety over what is perceived as a corrosive element of American culture. Furthermore, contrary to some popular accounts, Chapp's evidence suggests that, at least in presidential campaigns, “the rhetoric of a culture war has not been on the rise since 1980” (p. 75). Second, Chapp's experimental research suggests that while civil religion may work to activate identity in many Americans, there is a deep, “alienating effect of civil religion” that may, for some groups, be “stronger than previously thought” (p. 120). Indeed, this marginalization may not only lead towards alienation from the candidate using the civil religion rhetoric, but also may “lead to negativity towards the country more generally” (p. 121). These insights, as well as many others like them, make Chapp's book an important read for anyone interested in the interplay and effects of contemporary American religion and presidential campaigns.
