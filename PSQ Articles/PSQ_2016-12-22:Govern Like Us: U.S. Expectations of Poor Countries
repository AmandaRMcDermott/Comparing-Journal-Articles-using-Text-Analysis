"1","An array of strategies have been advocated to promote development around the world since World War II, with emphasis in recent decades on the importance of good governance. However, these strategies have clearly failed to lift significant portions of the global population out of poverty and insecurity and into stable, well‐governed societies. Despite a handful of success stories, most developing states remain stuck in the “poverty trap” of weak governments that are too poor to produce the stability and rule of law needed for economic growth and unable to strengthen themselves without economic growth."
"2","M.A. Thomas argues that “good governance” strategies fail because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the state in developing countries. Thomas argues that poor governments do not just govern less, they govern differently. Unable to afford the rule of law and social welfare provisions that legitimate the state in the wealthy West, poor states instead rely on older strategies of patronage, clientalism, and repression to stay in power, buying off individuals and groups or suppressing resistance. Development aid that expects poor countries to act like rich ones is doomed to failure, as aid is siphoned off in graft and redirected to preserve the position of weak elites. Good governance is therefore, per Thomas, a worthy goal but not a practical one. Development agencies should acknowledge this and change strategies accordingly."
"3","Thomas's book has a number of strengths, perhaps most of all its readability, combining a clear writing style with a wealth of enlightening examples. This book is at its strongest in describing the neopatrimonial state in action, focusing on how the weakness of the state drives officials to corruption. Thomas also provides a concise but detailed description of the origins of the neopatrimonial state in the patterns of nineteenth‐century colonization. Colonial governance based on resource extraction and reliant on financial and logistical support from the colonizing power left newly independent postcolonial states in a much different and weaker position than either the European states or the settler colonies of North and South Americas."
"4","Thomas's analysis suffers from an ill‐defined division of states between “rich” and “poor.” There are significant differences between, for instance, a relatively strong, relatively wealthy, and industrialized authoritarian state like China and a relatively weak democracy with a resource‐extraction economy such as Nigeria, but these differences are rarely considered. Additionally, little attention is paid to what may be learned from development “success stories.” The American and European experiences may be too different to be of value, but South Korea and Botswana built functioning states that provide the stability and rule of law needed to promote growth. Understanding the differences among the developing states could be valuable."
"5","Ultimately, this book is more a conversation starter than a definitive take on the problems of development in poor states with weak governments. Thomas outlines the challenges facing poor governments in detail, but potential solutions are only roughly sketched out. As Thomas notes, many of these problems are well known to academics and on‐the‐ground practitioners, but they are only poorly understood by policymakers more removed from the situation who nevertheless provide the funding and guidelines for development aid. Govern Like Us is a valuable guide to outsiders looking to familiarize themselves with some of the challenges of development. It also should be of great value to students, as it provides an excellent outline of the origins and operations of the neopatrimonial state and the challenges to escaping the poverty trap.         "
