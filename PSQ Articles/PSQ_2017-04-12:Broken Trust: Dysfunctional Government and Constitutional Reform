"1","Stephen M. Griffin has helped redefine the study of constitutional development by calling scholars’ attention to transformations in the fundamental structures and processes of governance. These changes often escape notice because they tend to occur outside the courts and without a formal announcement, yet Griffin demonstrates that to ignore them is to miss crucial features of our constitutional order and its development. His most recent book, Broken Trust: Dysfunctional Government and Constitutional Reform, continues this important project.         "
"2","In Broken Trust, Griffin sets out to demonstrate that a late twentieth‐century decline in American citizens’ trust in government (mis)shaped America's governing institutions and that we should understand this decline as a constitutional problem. He argues that representative government cannot operate effectively in an atmosphere of citizen distrust and that Americans’ lack of trust in the federal government is ultimately responsible for the dysfunctional condition of American politics today.         "
"3","In the first chapter after the introduction, Griffin joins scholars such as Sandy Levinson (author of the book's interesting foreword) in urging Americans to overcome their instinctive veneration of the federal Constitution in order to grapple with its problems. The chapter explores four “policy disasters” (September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina, the 2008 financial crisis, and rising income inequality) to demonstrate that particular features of America's constitutional order are ultimately responsible for the government's failure to function effectively."
"4","Through a useful review of the literature on public trust in government, Griffin then argues that a lack of trust is responsible for government's dysfunctional condition. Chapter 3 describes the empirical evidence that trust in government has been declining since the late 1960s and reviews a range of possible explanations for this decline. Ultimately, he contends that the best account lies in the work of John Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss‐Morse, who offer empirical evidence that Americans prefer consensual over contentious politics. Griffin argues that the Great Depression, followed immediately by World War II and the Cold War, provided a sense of external threat that facilitated the suppression of political contestation. Low levels of political conflict inflated Americans’ (reported levels of) trust in government. The increasingly contentious politics that marked the end of the Cold War caused these high levels of trust to decline, kicking off a vicious cycle in which lower levels of trust in government resulted in worse governance, further reducing people's trust."
"5","The book's final two chapters look to the political histories of U.S. states for possible avenues of escape from the cycle of declining trust and governmental inefficacy. In particular, they examine California's experience to argue that direct democracy may help restore public trust in representative government by allowing democratic majorities to intervene when they perceive dysfunction."
"6","Throughout, Broken Trust is deeply engaged with several political science literatures while remaining accessible to a broad audience. It defines an ambitious research agenda for the study of constitutional politics. Scholars might fruitfully evaluate the causal chain Griffin posits from low levels of trust in government to changes in the structure of governing institutions to bad policy outcomes. His policy proposals also warrant empirical investigation. For instance, one could plausibly study whether the introduction of procedures for direct democracy actually leads to an increase in reported levels of trust or to different kinds of institutional development. Such investigations are particularly warranted in light of the vast political science literature casting doubt on citizens’ ability to evaluate their government's performance or to hold it accountable for the outcomes for which it is plausibly to blame (see, for example, Christopher H. Achen and Larry M. Bartels, Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2016]).         "
"7","In addition to such empirical questions, the book also prompts us to develop richer understandings of distrust. For instance, the political right's insistence on the danger and illegitimacy of a large and active federal government certainly seems to qualify as distrust. (In fact, many of the dysfunctional outcomes that Griffin describes—such as rising income inequality and the failure to respond to Hurricane Katrina—could be seen specifically as the product of the Republican Party's antistatist, antiregulatory agenda.) Antistatism seems importantly different from the left's assertion that our governing institutions are biased against people of color and those born without wealth, yet both sentiments might be described as a lack of trust in government. Another form of distrust is the belief that those in office routinely flout the law or that the results of an election have been achieved through coercion or trickery. To move forward in the study of distrust a constitutional problem, it seems important to specify its different forms and their potentially different consequences for constitutional development."
