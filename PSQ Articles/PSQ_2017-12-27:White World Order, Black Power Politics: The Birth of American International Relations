"1","It is not often that a book completely challenges the way you think about a given subject. White World Order, Black Power Politics is a book that debunks much of the conventional wisdom that students and practitioners have about the discipline of international relations that has ostensibly sought cognitive authority over the subject matter of international politics. Yet, as Robert Vitalis explains, the subject that mattered most to the early pioneers of the field was race and race relations. Incredulously, he demonstrates that the early ancestors of the modern social science discipline of international relations were preoccupied with issues of imperialism, empire, and race war. More than anything, they worried about the possibility of a race war leading to the end of the world hegemony of whites.         "
"2","After reading Vitalis's book, one is left wondering how we have come to forget, or ignore, the centrality of race in the development of international relations. Nothing illustrates Vitalis's revisionist thesis better than when he chronicles the story of how the field's very first journal, the Journal of Race Development, first published in 1910, was sold to the Council of Foreign Relations in 1922 and renamed Foreign Affairs. This is just one of the many fascinating stories that is carefully chronicled in this groundbreaking book.         "
"3","Vitalis's intellectual history is a tour de force of forgotten individuals who once struggled to make sense of the racialized world of international politics. While the analysis is heavily focused on what might be considered the dark side of the discipline's past, when many scholars were both horrified by the prospects of racial equality and open proponents of empire and the subjugation of “inferior” races, the bright side of the book is Vitalis's discovery of the Howard School of international relations. This remarkable group of black scholars, which included luminaries such as Alain Locke, Ralph Bunche, and Rayford Logan, were struggling to resist the racism and racial segregation they experienced while they wrote and taught at Howard University in Washington, DC. While white political scientists were carving out a science of colonial administration as one of the avenues for preserving the hegemony of the Western hierarchical order, the scholars of the Howard School were relentlessly critiquing “the supposed truths of racial science and the role racism played in sustaining imperialism” (p. 12). As Vitalis demonstrates, the work of the Howard School was adversely impacted by the institutional racism that they fought to overcome. While the conditions under which they worked were indeed bleak, their struggle against empire and racism is inspirational for all those who still seek a more inclusive and ethical discipline."
"4","The story that Vitals tells is in no way limited to the field of international relations. Recent studies that have focused solely on international relations have not been able to capture the themes that Vitalis uncovers in his erudite study. While he is not always clear on how he is conceptualizing the field, Vitalis insists that its disciplinary boundaries have always been amorphous and thus overlap with a number of cognate fields, including African studies. Vitalis also underlines the importance of institutions such as the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Social Science Research Council in building the field. Throughout his study of the scholars who were developing a new field of study, Vitalis is sensitive to constructing the appropriate context for understanding the early field's obsession with race and empire."
"5","Despite claims to the contrary, disciplinary history matters. By chronicling this incredibly important and ignored episode of the field's history, Vitalis has done a remarkable job in demonstrating the relevance that the past has on the present contours of international relations."
