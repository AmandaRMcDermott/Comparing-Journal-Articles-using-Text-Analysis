"1","THE ELECTION OF RONALD REAGAN IN 1980 signaled a sea change for Christian evangelicals and other socially conservative forces. After decades of political marginalization, they believed that their issues would finally move to the top of the policy agenda. Imagine their disappointment when President Reagan seemed to betray them on the issue that first motivated many evangelicals to enter into politics: tax exemption for religious schools. Reagan initially reversed the Jimmy Carter administration's withdrawal of tax exemption for some religious colleges; but a public firestorm over Bob Jones University's interracial dating ban forced Reagan to ask Congress to reinstate the policy.1 Bob Billings, Jr., the son of prominent evangelical organizer Robert Billings, noted social conservatives' reaction at the time to Reagan's shift:            "
"2","We all booed. … It was almost like [Reagan] put the racial monkey on our back. Now we're being branded racists, which couldn't be farther from the truth. We feel he has a moral obligation to reframe the issue. If he doesn't, he will lose the support of the religious right.2"
"3","At the same time, conservative fundraiser Richard Viguerie angrily reported in his magazine, Conservative Digest, that Reagan's aides were encouraging the President to abandon social conservatives. Viguerie cited a Washington Post report in which Reagan's pollster, Richard Wirthlin, referred to abortion and school prayer as “no‐win issues.” In another Post article, a Reagan operative apparently told a reporter what Reagan would offer social conservatives so that they would not turn on him: “symbolism.”3"
"4","The challenges facing social conservatives in Reagan's era remain today. Indeed, social and economic conservatives are enmeshed in a longstanding alliance that, intellectually at least, stretches back to the 1950s. But the political calculus of this alliance does not give equal weight to both parties. Due to the historical development of the coalition, economic conservatives act as senior partners, with social conservatives filling a more junior role. As with all coalitions, these disparate political actors come together because they seek political power, and they see their alliance as their best available means of obtaining it. But when the partnership is uneven, coalition dynamics may involve pacifying the junior partner while the senior partner gets on with the business of policymaking. Social conservatives are especially problematic junior partners because their controversial policy agenda, from the school tax exemption to abortion and marriage rights, makes coalition leaders wary. These leaders recognize the necessity of “paying off” social conservatives, but want to avoid the electoral risks involved in effecting their desired policy changes."
"5","Murray Edelman4 famously captured this coalition dynamic through a distinction between symbolic politics and material benefits. Thus, as GOP officials, and the economic conservatives who support them, looked for ways to reward social conservatives without granting them material policy gains, they found that symbolic politics were one way to solve this “payoff problem.” But like many coalition partners, social conservatives grew tired of mere acknowledgement, promises, and symbols, and demanded action on their agenda. So the conservative coalition has developed an additional option. Using a particular type of discourse, “issue frames,” coalition leaders can convince social conservatives that some of their policy goals have been achieved. In fact, coalition leaders use frames to persuade social conservatives to add issues onto their agenda that the coalition was going to pursue anyway. Specifically, by framing economic issues in a way that makes it easy for social conservatives to adopt them as their own, coalition leaders give social conservatives reason to believe that they are gaining from their alliance with economic conservatives within the Republican Party.         "
"6","Repeal of the estate tax, or inheritance tax, is just such an economic issue. Economic conservatives have no trouble opposing the estate tax, since the reduction and elimination of taxes is central to their own goals. Although social conservatives espouse a similar anti‐government critique, they are typically only concerned with taxes that have a clear moral or social dimension, such as child tax credits. But if a largely unrelated tax issue is framed as a “family” or moral issue, their calculus changes, as I will demonstrate below. Once such a frame was established for the estate tax, social conservatives—primed by decades of describing themselves as a “pro‐family” movement, and helped by other, less‐prominent ideological commitments—began to view the issue as their own. By the time changes to the estate tax were incorporated into the 2001 Bush tax cuts, social conservatives began to support permanent repeal."
"7","Why try to recruit social conservatives to the estate tax cause? It is possible that some coalition leaders remembered the acrimonious battles over tax cuts in previous years, when various conservative interests pushed for their own favored tax proposals. Such a battle had occurred in 1998, for example, when social conservatives were criticized for emphasizing a child tax credit too much; according to one Republican staffer, “It's tough to have a seat at the table when you're kicking everyone in the shins underneath.”5 If there were united support for the same tax issues, then this conflict might be avoided. In fact, that was exactly the strategy laid out a decade earlier by William Kristol and other conservative leaders, according to a 1993 article in The Washington Post. These conservatives argued that an important part of a broad attack on “big government” would be the inclusion of pro‐family tax cuts. Kristol argued that such a plan “appeals to market conservatives for competition reasons and social conservatives for values reasons.”6"
"8","Still, the development of a “family” frame for the estate tax was not centrally coordinated; a cabal of political operatives did not meet in a smoke‐filled room and hatch a sinister plot to manipulate social conservatives. Yet the social conservatives' adoption of the estate tax issue would not have happened without the efforts of think tank intellectuals and their contacts at advocacy organizations working within conservative networks. Because frames for the estate tax, including the “family tax” frame, were adopted—and, in some cases, developed—by conservatives who are prominently placed within conservative networks, the frames were disseminated effectively and widely. After the intervention of these discursive entrepreneurs, estate tax repeal took up valuable space on the social conservative agenda. And the alliance between economic and social conservatives, both inside and outside of government, was strengthened by their newly shared goals."
"9","Below, I explore the movement of estate tax repeal onto the agenda of social conservatives. First, I provide a brief overview of the classic distinction between material and symbolic benefits, and suggest how issue frames present another possible solution to the classic coalition payoff problem. Then, I present a detailed case study of estate tax repeal, relying on a series of individual interviews supplemented by primary and secondary documents from conservative movement actors. I show how conservatives developed a “family” frame for the issue, and illustrate how the frame moved through conservative networks, placing estate tax repeal onto social conservatives' agenda. Finally, I speculate about the factors that enable this process within coalitions, and whether and how this particular solution to the payoff problem could appear in other contexts."
"10","Since Murray Edelman's groundbreaking work,7 scholars have recognized the importance political coalition leaders place on giving “the rhetoric to one side and the decision to the other.”8 According to Edelman, political events and actions have both “instrumental” and “expressive” dimensions, with the former referring to policy effects and the latter to the more dramaturgical or symbolic side of political action. These symbolic aspects, however, do not have to coincide with instrumental policymaking. Purely symbolic responses to the claims of coalition partners can act, therefore, as a chief way of solving the payoff problem noted above: the need to reward actors and groups for remaining loyal members of the coalition. Symbolic gestures gain the support of these coalition partners without the need to undertake any costly instrumental actions; they are policy statements without “actual policy outputs.”9 Instead, coalition partners may be “rendered quiescent by their success in securing nontangible values.”10"
"11","Edelman's theory has been used fruitfully for decades by a number of social scientists; articles from the past few years engage with subjects as diverse as eco‐politics in advanced industrial economies,11 state tobacco policy,12 and international human rights agreements.13 While not citing Edelman specifically, Thomas Frank14 has applied this dynamic to American conservatives, claiming that it operates as a form of distraction for Republican voters. Frank suggests that social conservatives are fooled into working against their own economic interests thanks to Republicans' largely symbolic acknowledgement of social issues. So, for example, in the early months of 2004—not coincidentally an election year—President George W. Bush called for a constitutional amendment to limit the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples,15 knowing full well that gathering enough support to actually pass such an amendment was next to impossible. Without having to pursue real policy change on a controversial issue, Bush offered symbolism instead. On the other hand, Frank's work has been countered by Mark A. Smith,16 who argues that the kind of “bait and switch” that Frank describes is not supported by the evidence. Rather than talk about values in order to distract voters from the devastating economic effects of their policies, says Smith, Republicans actually spend most of their time campaigning on economic issues.         "
"12","My argument suggests that the claims of Smith and Frank are not necessarily contradictory, but may in fact complement each other; conservatives can talk about economics and values at the same time, particularly through the use of issue frames. These are a relatively coherent collection of narratives and symbols that surrounds a particular policy issue and influences interpretation of that issue—in short, a lens through which the policy issue is viewed. The idea of frames goes back at least to the pioneering work of Erving Goffman,17 who proposed that shared “schemata of interpretation” help us bring meaning to the events in our lives. This theoretical structure has been adopted by other social scientists to address the ways that policy issues are presented in political discourse. A series of works from the public policy literature, for example, suggests that an issue's framing can be a significant indicator—perhaps even a determinative one—of eventual policy gains.18 And some social movement scholars assert that frames can be particularly resonant if they connect with the “existing cultural narratives” to which political coalition partners are committed.19"
"13","But frames do more than just influence interpretation of an issue; they may reestablish the connection between symbolic and instrumental politics. Edelman's original model maintains that the political gains from purely symbolic gestures can be tenuous. Indeed, Amy Mazur's work on symbolic politics in France leads her to note that “in the long term, symbolic reforms fail to generate an active network of state and societal actors interested with the success or failure of the policy.”20 Yet the framing processes I describe here seem much more useful for coalition building; they suggest that coalition leaders can pursue an alternative path to solving the payoff problem by aligning rhetoric with an actual political decision, even if the coalition partner has other decisions they would prefer to be made first. Rather than distracting coalition partners from “real” policies through mostly empty symbolic action, as Frank intimates happens with conservatives in Kansas, entrepreneurs convince them to accept the very real policy goals of coalition leaders as their own. Issue frames thus do not mask actions or divert social conservatives; rather, they are used to engage political actors—in this case, social conservatives—in decisions and policies that they might otherwise have ignored or downplayed, thus strengthening their ties to the coalition as a whole.         "
"14","The framing dynamic I describe above is readily apparent in Republican efforts to repeal the federal estate tax during the 1990s. At that time, only estates under $600,000 were exempted completely; thanks to inflation, more and more Americans at least had to consider the tax in their financial planning. Still, the estate tax only truly affected a small number of taxpayers. For example, only 81,000 estate tax returns were filed in 1995, as compared to over 100 million individual returns and almost four million corporate returns; and of these 81,000, 15 percent did not even involve a payment.21 In fact, according to Internal Revenue Service data, the number of taxable estates in each year of the 1990s represented less than 2 percent of all adult deaths.22 Therefore, repeal generally was not considered a viable political option. Still, a number of anti‐estate tax groups, led mostly by conservative outsiders and funded by a number of the country's wealthiest families, attempted to get Congress to repeal the tax.23"
"15","In their definitive account of the repeal battle, Michael Graetz and Ian Shapiro24 argued that one of the keys to success for repeal advocates was the way in which they framed the debate about the estate tax. These authors' emphasis, however, concerns the “death tax” language used by tax opponents. Conservative operative Grover Norquist later argued that this “fatal renaming” was a “milestone” in the battle for repeal,25 and understandably so: who would support a tax on death? Graetz and Shapiro, as well as Norquist, suggested that the language that positioned the estate tax as an issue of fairness was also important. For example, repeal proponents claimed that since the estate tax is levied on capital that has probably been subject to other taxes before death, the estate tax amounts to double (or triple, or even quadruple) taxation. These arguments, noted Graetz and Shapiro, had a substantial impact upon public support of estate tax repeal not because of their basis in fact—in fact, capital hit by estate taxes often has been sheltered from other taxation26—but because of their appeal to the important American principle of fairness.         "
"16","Yet in order to win over a specific audience to the issue, conservative discourse began to shift toward another frame, as can be seen in important reports on the estate tax written by conservative analyst Bill Beach. Beach had been specifically brought to the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank, thanks to funds raised by Alabama estate planner Harold Apolinsky, who formed the American Family Business Institute (AFBI) in 1992 to lobby against the estate tax.27 Beach's work became singularly important to the success of estate tax repeal. According to Beach, “Heritage has a formula. We create the key foundational paper,” otherwise known as a “backgrounder.” Backgrounders are significant documents for Heritage analysts; they are central resources that lay out the Foundation's main arguments for or against a particular policy, and subsequent smaller policy publications are based upon it. Beach notes that “when we started in '94, '95, and '96 to build the coalition, we had to do things well. We had to build the argument.”28"
"17","In a 1996 backgrounder,29 Beach built his argument by presenting almost exclusively macro‐economic reasons for repealing the estate tax. He offered three main arguments for repeal: the estate tax is a diminishing source of revenue; it fails to achieve its purported goals of wealth redistribution; and the tax does more harm than good in lost productivity, lost jobs, and decreased revenue through other taxation. He tied these arguments to an overall view of taxation as a hindrance to both liberty and economic growth. Yet a second backgrounder on the same subject, published two years later, was different in tone. While he offered the same economic arguments in the later document, Beach focused more directly on the effects of the tax upon small business owners and farmers, noting the “great threat” to these enterprises. The burden of the estate tax, Beach argued here, fell upon “hardworking men and women whose thrift and entrepreneurial spirit expose them to confiscatory tax rates.”30 The new argument reflected a shift in focus to small enterprises and farmers, rather than macroeconomic forces. And the language shifted to match; Beach emphasized hard work, thrift, and the “entrepreneurial spirit.” Along with the original economic factors, an element of morality was subtly introduced.         "
"18","The moral aspect of the estate tax became even more pronounced when the discussion of small enterprises became connected indelibly with the term “family” to become “family farms and businesses.” This simple phrase, as well as the larger frame that accompanied it, united the powerful imagery of business and farming with the equally powerful symbolism of “family values.” One should note that the purported threat to farms and small businesses from the estate tax is, at best, exaggerated. While it is probably true that some small business owners and farmers would rather forego the expense of estate planning and that some may sell off assets to pay the tax, repeal proponents are still unable to produce a single, verifiable example of a farm or business closing due to the burden of estate tax payments.31 Still, whatever its basis in fact, Beach's Heritage backgrounders again charted this discursive shift. The 1996 report contained one reference each to “family farms” and “family businesses.” The change two years later is striking; in the 1998 paper, estate taxes hit “a family's estate,” and hurt “family‐owned businesses” or “family businesses and farms.” In fact, at least 10 examples of this language can be found in the latter report.         "
"19","Were it just Beach who used this argument, the change in language might not be noteworthy. But the “family” frame became widespread among conservatives, traveling across networks with seeming ease. A 1999 report from the media watchdog group Accuracy in Media (AIM) complained that mainstream media relied on the wrong polls to argue that “the American people don't really want a tax cut.” Mainstream reporters, the AIM report warned, do not directly ask about popular tax cuts like estate tax repeal, which affects “farmers and small business owners, whose heirs have to sell off assets or land to settle the estate tax obligation.”32 Later, a 2004 press release from the American Conservative Union painted presidential candidate John Kerry as “anti‐family” because of his opposition to estate tax repeal.33 A similar ACU release the following year noted that the “widely despised and onerous” estate tax “destroys small family businesses, farms and ranches”; it also argued that the burden of estate taxation falls on the people “who have worked hard all their lives” to pass on their family enterprises.34 The National Federation of Independent Businesses even named their pro‐repeal coalition the Family Business Estate Tax Coalition.         "
"20","Dan Miller, senior economist at Congress's Joint Economic Committee (JEC), wrote an influential JEC report in 1998, with updates in later years, that argued against the tax.35 While Miller offered mostly economic arguments, he included nods to “family‐owned businesses” and cited some of Beach's sources. Miller later claimed that his work was driven more by academic articles and his own intellectual interests than anything else, but his connections to other conservatives certainly helped promote the family frame; he admitted that “I do remember seeing what Bill [Beach] had done, what Heritage had done—also some work by the Cato Institute, the Tax Foundation.” In fact, Miller was invited to speak in person at the annual Death Tax Summit organized by the National Federation of Independent Business's pro‐repeal coalition.36"
"21","The spread of the family frame was assisted by the ease of Internet connectivity. For example, a 2005 post on the Web site of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity (AFP) darkly warned that the estate tax's sunset clause could trigger mass death in 2010, as elderly Americans either decided to die, or would be “encouraged” to do so by greedy family members, while the tax was temporarily repealed.37 (In fairness to AFP, their Web post included a link to a New York Times article that also presented this rather macabre possibility; longtime conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly discussed it in her newsletter as well.38) This posting demonstrates the integration of conservative groups surrounding the estate tax issue. The AFP page included links to a 2003 Heritage WebMemo by Beach; public opinion data posted on the Tax Foundation's Tax Policy Blog; a 2000 Wall Street Journal op‐ed, itself re‐posted on the Web site of the National Bureau of Economic Research, an economic think tank; and an online column by Ron Paul, the Libertarian congressman and future presidential candidate, who warned (without evidence) that “many family farms across this country have been bought by large corporations because of the estate tax.”39 Similarly, Paul Weyrich's Free Congress Foundation pushed the “family farms and businesses” line in a Web article by its director of development;40 this post later appeared on the Web sites of both Accuracy in Media and the anti‐tax seniors group 60Plus Association, continuing the circulation of the frame.41"
"22","Republican officials eventually began to use family language as well. Senator George Allen argued in 2005 that the estate tax hurt “modest Americans who worked hard throughout their lives to save for their families.”42 And in a blog entry on his Volunteer Political Action Committee (VOLPAC) Web site, Senator Bill Frist noted that the tax attacks virtue because it “punishes hard work and savings”; he then underlined the danger to families by recounting a tale, possibly apocryphal, of a Tennessee family that had to sell land to pay their estate tax.43 Still, while Republicans adopted the family language, the selection and dissemination of this frame was not driven by Party operatives or officials. George W. Bush, for example, may have included the estate tax among his initial tax cut proposals, but Bush's advisers suggested that the President was not counting on widespread conservative support for estate tax repeal. Bush's chief economic adviser, Larry Lindsay, claimed that the Bush campaign chose estate tax repeal for its economic benefits, and not because of popular views of the tax.44 Even if Lindsay was being disingenuous, Bush campaign adviser Martin Feldstein used solely economic arguments, with a slight nod toward ideas of fairness, when arguing against the tax in The Wall Street Journal in 2000.45 As Apolinsky pointed out, “Sure, Bush used [the estate tax] for his run for the election, and in 2004 also. But this is not a Bush idea.”46"
"23","Instead, the family language seemed to originate from Beach at the Heritage Foundation. Fueled by Beach's influential backgrounders, Heritage became a central institution for anyone interested in making family arguments against the tax. In a 2001 backgrounder on repeal, Beach cited a 1999 report by the economically conservative Institute for Policy Innovation47 that argued against the tax using both economic and family arguments. One of the co‐authors of this report, Gary Robbins, later joined the Heritage Foundation as a visiting fellow in tax policy. Robbins even wrote a backgrounder of his own in 2004 that was based upon a presentation at a 2003 roundtable on “Jobs, Growth, and Abolition of the Death Tax” at the Department of the Treasury.48 And a regular publication issued by the Heritage Foundation intended for candidates for federal office, The Candidate's Briefing Book, included a section on taxes. The 2006 edition's tax section advocated the elimination of the “death tax,” providing the talking point that “many small businesses and family farms are destroyed by its penalty, which distorts incentives and hurts families.”49 Thus the pro‐family arguments Beach chiefly developed were spread throughout conservative networks thanks in great part to Heritage's extensive reach. This reach clearly extended to social conservatives as well.         "
"24","The first reason Beach provided for using the language of morality and the family is rather simple: moral arguments appeal to everyone. According to Beach,            "
"25","Moral arguments almost always are [more effective] on any issue. If you are talking to an audience who are not trained [in economics], you need to address them in the terms that they will understand. Almost everyone is educated by their parents, or at least their community, in moral argument. … It wasn't a clever strategy. We started off with it as a normal part of the argument.50"
"26","Journalist Joshua Green suggested that the family language used by tax opponents thus lent a “populist appeal” to their cause.51 Of course, just because estate tax opponents monopolized moral arguments for the repeal side does not preclude a moral case for keeping the tax. Bradford Plumer argued in Mother Jones that such a case should be easy to make: America is a meritocracy, and socialites like Paris Hilton do not deserve the seemingly limitless fortunes they will inherit.52 Still, the rhetorical appeal of pro‐repeal claims remains clear, as the family frame could provide positive associations for repeal in the same way that the “death tax” label limited support for the tax. After all, who opposes the family?         "
"27","Still, it was also clear that the use of the frame was a targeted attempt to garner support for repeal among specific constituencies. Indeed, Graetz and Shapiro suggest that arguments about farms and small businesses were an obvious attempt to get business and farm owners to support repeal.53 One Republican staffer and longtime conservative activist observed later that this is exactly what happened in the case of the estate tax:            "
"28","You just re‐frame your issues. Like the big push with tax cuts. They were able to expand their coalition. … They reframed tax issues in a family way, like the inheritance tax. It was framed: save the family farm, save the family business.54"
"29","Beach acknowledged that “there was an effort made after 2001 to broaden the language, to connect to other groups.”55 But to whom were he and others trying to connect?         "
"30","Certainly Beach's efforts indicate some strategic targeting rather than a “kitchen sink” approach of including all arguments for all audiences. Indeed, a narrowly tailored memorandum he wrote as late as 2003 did not refer to family values. This “WebMemo,” aimed directly at House members and their staffs, focused almost exclusively on economic arguments about “wealth creation.”56 Yet his 1998 and subsequent backgrounders relied heavily on the family frame; these broad documents were meant to be more widely distributed. The choice of family and moral language in these documents seems even more calculated when one considers the two parts of the conservative coalition. There was some history that suggested that economic appeals to social conservatives, when properly framed, could be successful.         "
"31","The history of conservative thought includes a number of arguments that connect family bonds to property rights, from Richard Weaver's Southern agrarianism57 to George Gilder's critique of welfare.58 And as “new right” social conservatives were organized during the 1970s, they included tax issues among their array of concerns; new right leader Howard Phillips, a devout Christian, later formed the U.S. Taxpayers Party, for example. Also, as noted at the beginning of this article, evangelical Christians had joined the conservative movement in the 1970s largely because of a tax issue: the perceived persecution of religious schools by President Carter and the Internal Revenue Service. In new right organizer Paul Weyrich's words, “It was the school interference issue that drove most of them that had [previously] thought that it was a sin to get involved in politics.”59"
"32","Of course, evangelicals are based in the Protestant tradition, which, as Max Weber famously argued, might have a particular affinity for capitalism.60 But the connection between Protestant evangelicalism and free market thinking has a more recent midwife. According to journalist Frederic Clarkson,61 a small group of Protestant thinkers who have had an outsized influence on American evangelicals argued that economic policies deserved as much attention as social ones. Originally led by the late R.J. Rushdoony, Christian reconstructionists believe that Biblical law can and should be brought into the modern context, and that it provides a basis not just for ethical and private life, but for public life and policy as well. In this view, all governmental policies—laws, court decisions, regulations, etc.—should be directly based upon Biblical law. Reconstructionism was influenced by a number of theologies and thinkers, from John Calvin to the presuppositionalism or Biblical worldview of Princeton scholar Cornelius Van Til, and had dispersed institutional bases ranging from conservative Presbyterianism to the John Birch Society.         "
"33","Reconstructionist ideas were spread through organizations like the Chalcedon Foundation, the Rutherford Institute, and the Coalition on Revival, and have had a major influence on Pentecostal churches (which became politically active largely as a result) and Charismatics. Clarkson ties reconstructionism to the Christian Coalition and Republican politics through Pat Robertson's supposed commitment to dominionism, a theological and political tendency based on the Biblical notion that God gave dominion over the earth to mankind.62 Clarkson may have overstated these ties; Robertson publicly distanced himself from reconstructionism in the 1990s. According to one biographer, Robertson often espoused a more majoritarian rationale for Christian right involvement in politics; he felt that since “religious conservatives are the largest single group of Americans, their ideas should naturally find expression in the nation's laws.”63 Still, Clarkson was probably correct in noting that “the Christian Coalition would not have been possible without Reconstructionism,” thanks to the latter's emphasis on worldly affairs.         "
"34","Because they seek to broadly apply Biblical principles to civil government, reconstructionist writers like Gary North also emphasize the importance of private property and free‐market capitalism for ensuring the freedom and responsibility of the individual before God. In books like An Introduction to Christian Economics,64 North and his colleagues rejected government price controls, welfare and other entitlement programs, and any kind of wealth redistribution. According to reconstructionists, taxation should only be as high as necessary for the maintenance of a libertarian state that allows individuals to act freely, although in accordance with God's moral law.         "
"35","Still, social conservatives typically focused specifically on tax issues that had a clear moral dimension, rather than arguing a broad philosophical or theological case against taxation in general. For instance, Christian groups in the 1980s often protested the use of tax funds for welfare programs, insisting that these programs created a culture of dependency among the poor. An early mission statement for the Religious Roundtable noted that “the Bible nowhere justifies the use of coercive government power to plunder some elements of society and dole out to others,” although it took no position on taxation overall.65 Later, the Christian Coalition included family‐related tax policies like the so‐called marriage penalty on its agenda. Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed announced in a widely read 1993 article in Heritage's Policy Review that “the primary objective of fiscal policy should be to make the tax code more family friendly.”66 Other social conservatives had made similar calls; Paul Weyrich's colleague Connie Marshner had argued a few years earlier that “the economic survival of the family is the key issue for the next decade,” citing excessive taxation as a big problem for families.67 Yet at no time during the 1990s or earlier did social conservatives include the estate tax among these “family” issues.         "
"36","Influences like reconstructionism and social conservatives' increasing emphasis on economic issues certainly might have made it easier for social conservatives to at least consider estate tax repeal. But the estate tax seemed to need the family frame in particular to move onto their agenda. Religious right leaders have long wrapped themselves in the mantle of the family. Prominent evangelists such as Tim LaHaye, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell were part of a self‐identified “pro‐family network” during the 1970s and '80s.68 Still, it was not until the 1990s, when Ralph Reed began to steer the Christian Coalition toward the political mainstream, that leaders of religious right groups began to more overtly describe themselves as a “pro‐family movement.” Indeed, today's most influential Christian political groups, such as the Family Research Council (FRC), Concerned Women for America, and others, often subtly downplay their Christian affiliation in hopes of making broad appeals to “family values.” Even the names of the dominant Christian political organizations of the early 1990s and the 2000s (the Christian Coalition and the Family Research Council, respectively) reflect this shift.         "
"37","It seems hard to believe that Bill Beach and other conservative operatives would be unaware of how a newly christened “family” tax would operate in this environment. If they were simply focused on building popular support for estate tax repeal, or targeting business owners, they could have used the term “small business.” As historian Mansel G. Blackford noted, “Many Americans have seen the owners of small businesses as epitomizing all that is best about the American way of life.”69 Instead the term “family farms and businesses” was chosen and promoted, suggesting that the frame was intended for “pro‐family” forces to hear; and social conservatives seemed to be listening.         "
"38","Social conservatives had some reason to be excited about the 2000 election of George W. Bush; after all, he had cited Jesus Christ as his favorite philosopher.70 Still, they were not knee‐jerk supporters of the President; Bush's political adviser, Karl Rove, estimated that millions of evangelicals who should have supported Bush had instead sat out the 2000 election.71 Even so, they might have been expected to support Bush's first major policy initiative, his 2001 tax cut package. But certain provisions of the bill were specifically promoted above others. In its June 2001 issue, the Christian magazine World reported that social conservatives were happy with the “family‐friendly” Bush tax program. While the article specifically cited a reduction in the so‐called marriage penalty as “mark[ing] families as a favored group,” it also noted favorably the repeal of the estate tax, “which sometimes forced children to sell the family‐owned farms and businesses their parents had spent a lifetime building.”72"
"39","The inclusion of estate tax repeal, rather than other provisions, as “family‐friendly” is telling. Certainly, on the face of it, modifications to retirement accounts and educational savings credits would have as credible a connection to the family as the estate tax. But it was not these parts of the bill that social conservatives celebrated. Instead a 2001 paper by the conservative Catholic group, the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, stated that estate tax repeal would help grant “material stability to the family.”73 And a March 2001 press release from Concerned Women for America noted that Bush's 2002 budget included estate tax repeal among other “pro‐family tax cuts.”74 For the first time, social conservatives seemed ready to follow Bill Beach's lead in characterizing estate tax reforms as “pro‐family.”         "
"40","The influence of Beach's work at Heritage on this new landscape was clear. Focus on the Family published a brief report after the tax cut bill was passed celebrating the “good news for families” in the new law, including the end of the “death tax.”75 While there was no explanation as to why estate tax repeal would be pro‐family, Beach was quoted in the Focus article supporting the tax cuts. The “family” frame for the estate tax eventually became internalized within religious right organizations. Years later, the Family Research Council's Peter Sprigg used Beach's arguments to describe why the FRC supported estate tax repeal:            "
"41","A large part of the concern is that the estate tax is a concern of those who have family businesses, and they're worried about passing their businesses on to their children. This is a little more specific family‐related concern. We think that families should be encouraged to pass on their businesses.76"
"42","Thus taking their cue from Heritage and the existing “family” language that described the tax, Christian groups began to regularly see the issue as a family one."
"43","The most striking example of the Christian embrace of the estate tax as a family issue was a polished, 29‐page pamphlet issued by the FRC in the fall of 2001. The report, written by the group's then‐Director of Family Tax Policy, Leslie Carbone, was entitled “Death and Taxes: How Divorcing the Two Benefits the Family.”77 The idea for the report, Carbone noted, came from            "
"44","a conflation of things. The death tax was a big issue back then—it was part of the Bush tax cuts. I felt that all the arguments that were being made were economic arguments. I felt that the family impact and the social impact were equally important. I wanted to write something on it.78"
"45","Carbone began by noting that “anything that undermines virtue weakens the family; the estate tax is no exception.” By disrupting inheritance, the estate tax upset the kinship bonds that make up the family. She contended that:            "
"46","By interfering directly with the natural or family order, the death tax works against the family to a greater extent than other forms of taxation. By artificially separating the family along generational lines, it disrupts the extended family. … The death tax considerably weakens the role and status of families in American life."
"47","The estate tax was not just a threat to farms and businesses, then, but attacked the very structure of the family, even the structure of society itself."
"48","Carbone's family language demonstrated the provenance of her report. She cited Heritage's Beach, as well as the Institute for Policy Innovation and Joint Economic Committee reports mentioned above. In addition, Carbone relied on the work of economic conservatives such as the libertarian National Center for Policy Analysis, the television and Web production Small Business 2000 (now SmallBusinessSchool), and even Fortune magazine. Still, she largely adopted the family language, rather than the economic arguments, of these sources. And some of this language clearly came from efforts, probably generated from Heritage, to connect social and economic conservatives. Indeed, Carbone had met with Beach and his colleagues:            "
"49","I had known people at the Heritage Foundation—I was aware of their work. … I'd go to meetings at Heritage, Cato, you know. Heritage was actually very helpful; they set up a couple of roundtables with economists, and helped me bounce ideas off them. Because I am not an economist.79"
"50","Beach himself remembered several outreach attempts with Carbone's colleagues: “I've sat in on several meetings with [then‐FRC head] Gary Bauer and the Family Research Council.”80"
"51","Carbone's report was not an isolated phenomenon; the FRC's other publications on this issue followed the family frame. In a short column published around the time of the Carbone report, for example, FRC President Ken Connor noted that the estate tax is “cruel” in that it hits “family farms and businesses” at a vulnerable point, “when they are dealing with the loss of their leaders”; it also discouraged virtue by punishing hard work and responsibility.81 The estate tax repeal of 2001 even seemed to make the FRC more amenable to larger arguments about taxation in general. A group of Christian intellectuals based at the Rockford, IL think tank, the Howard Center for Family, Religion and Society, saw many forms of government taxation as unnecessary interference with this natural order of the family. Two years after Carbone's report was issued, the Center's President, Allan Carlson, published an article in the Family Research Council's short‐lived “academic” journal, Family Policy Review. In it, Carlson argued against government payments to parents to help support children, as they “tend to draw governments deeply into the family economy and to substitute state largesse, and intrusion, for parental earnings.” Carlson argued that tax policy should be structured to strengthen the natural order of families and marriage, and in the least intrusive way possible.82"
"52","Armed with such views, social conservatives found common cause with the rest of the Republican coalition. In August 2005, the popular evangelical organization, Focus on the Family, ran an article on their Web site claiming that “Death Should Not Be a Taxable Event”;83 the article quoted Bill Beach as well as estate tax lawyer Apolinsky's colleague Dick Patten. Earlier, Apolinsky met directly with FRC head Gary Bauer, as well as socially conservative John Ashcroft, as they prepared for their 2000 presidential campaigns. According to Apolinsky, “Bauer got very interested in it. He wanted it to be a major plank in his run for the presidency. Ashcroft said the same thing.”84 The FRC's Connie Mackey suggested that the Republican Party's Values Action Team (VAT), a socially conservative House caucus, may have been included as well:            "
"53","I think we got involved the way we get involved in any issue. We follow what's happening, and we decide to get involved or not. The VAT team up on the Hill—are you aware of them? Through the VAT team, we can bring this problem to particular members of Congress and say this is something that you should look at, or they can come back to us. So the death tax may have been one of what they were looking at.85"
"54","Whether through the VAT or more‐informal channels, socially conservative Republicans were then recruited to promote repeal. The same FRC journal that featured Allan Carlson's intellectual arguments against the estate tax also included a piece by Republican Representative Joe Wilson, who noted how the tax “undermines the American Dream” by forcing family businesses and farms to sell.86 Not only is one of Bill Beach's backgrounders subtitled “The Nightmare of the American Dream,”87 but Wilson also cited economic data from the 1998 JEC report—all in a publication from a “pro‐family,” socially conservative group.         "
"55","Eventually, the estate tax issue—unlike other parts of the 2001 tax cut package—became absorbed as a largely unquestioned part of the pro‐family agenda. The (now largely defunct) Christian Coalition included it among its top priorities on its Web site88 and listed the issue on its 2004 presidential voter scorecard.89 Grassroots conservatives like Phyllis Schlafly often argued for estate tax repeal as well. When asked about it later, Schlafly claimed she did not even remember including the issue in her newsletters. But she seemed to have internalized Beach's arguments about family: “I don't remember writing about it. [But] I would oppose the death tax. It's very hard on small businesses, and very hard on farms. It's bad law.”90"
"56","The Family Research Council remained a leader on the issue throughout the decade; it included permanent estate tax repeal on its Web site as part of its three policy priorities for “Economics and Taxes”;91 it listed the tax as a “pro‐family issue” on its voter scorecards;92 and it reported on the issue in its updates to members.93 A 2006 edition of the Family Research Council's weekly radio program featured a discussion of pending repeal legislation with AFBI's Dick Patten. The show's guest host, Republican Congressman Mike Pence—a favorite among the religious right—agreed that it is “morally wrong” to take the “after‐tax resources of American families” at the time of a family member's passing. Pence and Patten thus used the language of family and morality to speak to religious listeners about an economic issue.94"
"57","The addition of the estate tax to the FRC's voter scorecards is especially telling. The Republican Party thus has one more policy area upon which it can be rated “pro‐family.” Even though the estate tax is arguably more an economic than a family‐related issue, Republican action in this policy area—which, whatever the merits, provides direct financial benefits to wealthy economic conservatives—also earns points from social conservatives. This strengthens the GOP's political support, and furthers the support of social conservatives for economic issues. Moreover, it lessens the amount of time and energy that the FRC and other groups spend on more controversial issues, like abortion and marriage equality, that the GOP finds difficult to address. In this way, Republican and coalition leaders solve, at least temporarily, the payoff problem described earlier. Social conservatives gain more than mere symbolism, and instead can point to material policy gains like estate tax reduction and repeal. Yet the coalition avoids the costly battles over controversial policies like abortion that may hurt them among the general electorate. Instead, they are able to follow the policy agenda to which they were already committed."
"58","The solution I outline here to the payoff problem may be manifest in other coalitions. However, certain conditions probably need to be present in order for similar framing to be successful. Today's Republican coalition demonstrates an almost unprecedented level of coordination. While not the “vast right‐wing conspiracy” that critics have often denounced, American conservatives form a loosely coordinated but extended network of policymakers, think tanks, advocacy organizations, and media outlets.95 Conservatives of all stripes meet often, whether at public events like the Conservative Political Action Conference, or at the more‐private weekly meetings hosted by anti‐tax activist Grover Norquist and, until his recent death, Paul Weyrich. These networks were helped along by rightwing‐leaning foundations, who sought to build movement infrastructure during the 1980s and '90s.96 This extensive coordination presents a particularly effective structure for communicating issue frames. Still, it is possible that the technological advances of modern communication and media help make this level of coordination and discourse circulation available to a wide variety of coalitions.         "
"59","In any case, the Republican Party remains a primary example of possibilities beyond the material and symbolic. Indeed, the framing processes described here probably are utilized in other issue areas as well. For example, President Bush's frequent use of the language of “evil” and “evil‐doers” after the September 11 attacks97 and even his (supposedly mistaken) use of the word “crusade”98 could be interpreted as an attempt to frame his anti‐terror policy agenda in Christian terms. Here, again, social conservatives would gain material benefits—that is, anti‐terror policies and military actions—outside of their core interests; yet thanks to the framing of these issues, they could adopt these issues as their own. Still, due to the structure of the Republican coalition, it is more likely that other framing episodes will concern economic issues. As Stephen Moore, former head of the Club for Growth, noted, “Low taxes are the central linchpin of conservatism. … It's possible to disagree about abortion, gay rights or the proper level of military spending, but we can't disagree about our one unifying message as conservatives.”99 By re‐casting tax and economic issues as family matters, conservatives can make this agreement easier to find.
