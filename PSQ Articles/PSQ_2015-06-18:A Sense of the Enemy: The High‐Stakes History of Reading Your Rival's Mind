"1","The principal goal of this study is to illuminate the task of predicting behavior in “matters of war and peace.” According to Zachary Shore, strategic empathy, or the ability to think like your opponent, is a critical skill for doing so successfully. This comes not from analyzing patterns of past behavior but from close attention to performance during pattern breaks, or departures from such regularity that expose an opponent's underlying “drivers and constraints” (pp. 2–4, 6–8, 163)."
"2","From this description, A Sense of the Enemy appears to be one book. However, it reads more like two (strikingly different) books. Similar themes run through both, but the method of inquiry and theoretical coherence vary greatly.         "
"3","The first explains how strategic empathy helped three leaders recognize the impact of pattern breaks on their opponents. These cases—Mahatma Gandhi's response to the British massacre at Amritsar in April 1919, Gustav Stresemann's attempt to restore Germany's standing after World War I, and Le Duan's evaluation of the United States during the Vietnam War—offer plausible explanations of these leaders' growing understanding of their opponents' motivation. Moreover, all are supported by historical research based on primary sources."
"4","By contrast, the cases in the second book—Joseph Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempts to assess Adolf Hitler's threat and British Undersecretary Eyre Crowe and American diplomat George Kennan's efforts to evaluate Germany and Russia—are neither satisfactorily explained nor based on adequate research. (In a footnote [p. 94 n. 16], Shore questions my conclusions in Roosevelt and the Munich Crisis about Roosevelt's evolving perception of Hitler. While I do not believe this difference of opinion affects my view of Shore's book, I will recuse myself from commenting on the Roosevelt chapter.)         "
"5","Many of the problems in this section concern methods and sources. Most troubling are poorly supported conjectures about the thinking of these leaders. Thus, Shore claims that Stalin's failure to foresee Hitler's attack in 1941 arose from neither personality nor Marxist ideology but an obsession with power. Unfortunately, this conclusion rests on little hard evidence (pp. 75–77, 186)."
"6","This section also has problems with theory, exemplified by Shore's treatment of several theoretical notions from the social sciences. These are often inadequately explained and sometimes misinterpreted, especially theories from political science such as realism (pp. 154–157) and the concept of intentions and capabilities, which receive much, perhaps unjustified, criticism (pp. 196–197, 200)."
"7","For example, Shore argues that considering intentions misses motivation arising from religion, nationalism, ideology, or psychology. Capabilities, defined as military factors, omit “financial, political, organizational, environmental, or cultural” factors (pp. 200–201). Most political scientists, however, see such factors as an integral part of intentions and capabilities (see, for example, Robert Jervis, Perception and Misperception in International Politics [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1978], 33, 48–52), which, properly defined, subsume Shore's preferred substitute, “drivers and constraints.”         "
"8","Shore emphasizes the novelty of his methodology, terming it “unorthodox” in combining rigorous historical research with findings on decision making from other fields and including “interpretative essays” on various leaders' thought processes (pp. 204–205). However, although such methods might be new to historians, they have long been employed by political scientists, such as Deborah Larson (in Origins of Containment), who clearly do not use history merely to “prove” their theories (p. 200).         "
"9","Many of Shore's other insights are equally familiar. The idea behind the “continuity heuristic” (using past behavior to predict future behavior [p. 152]) has a substantial history in the social sciences from cognitive consistency in psychology to the tendency to assimilate incoming information to preexisting beliefs in international politics (Jervis, Perception and Misperception, 117, 124–127, 143–155), as does one of Shore's key concepts, “pattern breaks.” That leaders seeking to discover their opponents’ motives attend to behavior during unexpected events, especially if costly, has long been recognized by students of foreign policy decision making (Jervis, Perception and Misperception, 34–36, 167).         "
"10","Rather than a new theory, then, this book offers a new vocabulary for concepts that have been understood and applied to decision making for years. Thus, while A Sense of the Enemy makes some contributions (for example, the successful case studies provide added evidence for these theories), on balance, it does not significantly extend our understanding of decision making in international politics.
