"1","Few historical works seek to tackle what Elliot A. Rosen describes as “depression causation,” or the complex set of variables that scholars believe were involved in the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Fewer still seek to capture the full scope of the political and ideological tumult that the New Deal caused within the Republican Party or to tie the party's antistatist reaction to Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency to the policies and thinking of the modern Republican Party. This is precisely what Rosen sets out to do in The Republican Party in the Age of Roosevelt, and he is, for the most part, successful in his efforts.         "
"2","Rosen grounds his study in an analysis of Herbert Hoover's personal and intellectual reaction to his 1932 presidential defeat to Roosevelt. Despite the scope and persistence of the economic downturn that followed the 1929 crash, Hoover viewed the interventionist, regulatory policies proposed by Roosevelt not only as counterproductive but as wholly inconsistent with the tradition of limited, decentralized government that had made America the great and powerful country it was. In Hoover's opinion, “to embark . . . on the course proposed by [his] opponent would undermine and destroy the nation's basic institutions and achievements,” Rosen writes (p. 12). Roosevelt and his New Deal policies, resting as they did on an unprecedented expansion of federal power over the economy, posed an existential threat to the country, in Hoover's mind. It is an important point for Rosen to emphasize because it helps us understand the depth of the opposition, then and now, of many prominent Republicans to the idea that government should play an active role regulating the nation's economy."
"3","It is equally important to highlight, as Rosen does, the extent to which Hoover's antistatist vision was shared and subsidized by powerful elements within the nation's business community, most notably, in Rosen's analysis, the DuPonts of Delaware, the Pews of Pennsylvania, Monsanto of Missouri, and the Strawn Group in Chicago. For many of the economic elite whom these families and companies represented, wealth and success followed from hard work, individual initiative, and competition. They did not come from centralized management of the economy or unnecessarily contentious labor relations fostered by federally protected labor unions."
"4","But, as Rosen ably describes, Hoover's strict antistatism did not go unchallenged within the GOP. Much to the ex‐president's consternation, a growing number of Republican leaders, particularly in Congress, began to abandon, in the face of sustained economic hardship, the precepts of limited government that had prevailed during the so‐called New Economic Era of the 1920s (p. 3). Attempts were made over the course of the 1930s, as Rosen notes, to somehow “modernize” the Republican Party, or to reconcile its traditional economic philosophy to the demands of a modern industrial economy and, later, to the need for greater U.S. leadership in a world at war. But as the leadership of Robert Taft and Arthur Vandenberg in the Senate, John Hamilton at the Republican National Convention, and the business‐backed Liberty League ensured, any attempt to bring the party into the twentieth century would result, as the hapless party reformer Wendell Willkie discovered, in unending conflict and failure."
"5","It is here, in his retelling of the clashing ideas, policies, and personalities that propelled the GOP through the 1930s and early 1940s, that Rosen's narrative is richest. Where it falls short is in connecting this period to the present, as he alludes to in his introduction. It is an intriguing linkage, but its absence hardly detracts from the volume given how otherwise tightly constructed Rosen's historical narrative is."
