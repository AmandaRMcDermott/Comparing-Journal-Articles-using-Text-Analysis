"1","The federal government's role in education has increased dramatically over the last century, but operational control of American schools remains in local hands. Douglas S. Reed offers a novel take on the tale of shifting educational governance, telling it from the local point of view and situating it in the literature on American political development. This expansive book chronicles the response to federal education policy in Alexandria, Virginia, across six decades, tracing the local politics surrounding desegregation, special education, bilingual education, and accountability. Reed introduces the organizing concept of an interconnected education state as an alternative to the “grouping of segmented entities arrayed in a federalist structure” (p. 6). He demonstrates how local schools are embedded within two broader systems, the education state and the local political regime governing across policy areas. Doing so lays bare the tension inherent in an institution that must serve the political priorities of local actors while meeting federal pressure to increase equity.         "
"2","The story of the Alexandria school system is a good one; readers may find themselves flipping to this book's final page and turning to the Alexandria Times to find out what happens next. But Building the Federal Schoolhouse offers more than an engaging read. By linking four reform periods into a continuous narrative, Reed effectively demonstrates the importance of sequencing and feedback in education policy. Across decades, federal education policies structure local politics—displacing regimes, empowering actors, creating coalitions, and reconfiguring political geography. The resulting political arrangements then determine the effectiveness of the next round of federal education reform.         "
"3","Reed traces several such processes: desegregation in the 1970s culminates in sweeping political change and creates obstacles for federal accountability policy three decades later; federal matching funds for special education mobilize new constituencies and change the political economy of the city, increasing the local education budget despite declining enrollment. In a fascinating section on immigrants and English as a second language (ESL) policy, Reed tracks the ripple effects of low political status among immigrants and Latinos as it renders related federal education reform ineffective. Federal policy failure, in turn, generates feelings of political “marginality” and exclusion among many ESL teachers and students (p. 176) but, at the same time, mobilizes small groups to protest."
"4","In explaining these interdependencies, Reed advances understanding of education governance considerably and adds a welcome education policy perspective to the literature on American political development. The book is somewhat less convincing in explaining whether and why federal education policies boost student outcomes. Reed condemns contemporary reform efforts as a “misguided quest to reinvent the basic tasks of teaching children” (p. 3), substituting “quick and dirty” test score change for more promising improvements (p. 232). Unlike the compelling historical and political arguments, statements about the effectiveness of policies such as performance‐based accountability and charter schools are not always consistent with the book's empirical evidence, which, for example, does not extend to charter schools and shows accountability reform to be damaging in some cases but effective in others. For instance, “[t]o the extent that Alexandria has responded to the educational needs of immigrant students it has done so because [of] school‐level accountability requirements under No Child Left Behind” (p. 231)."
"5","Instead, we learn a more fundamental lesson about “what works” in education from this book. Rather than accountability, choice, or any specific reform, the answer here lies in political power. Local and federal actors want more from schools than academic outcomes, and Reed shows us that they get it: educational successes and failures are produced by patterns of incorporation and interest, but they also generate our political future."
