"1","Although the art of espionage is timeless, the practice of “intelligence” is a relatively recent phenomenon. By the middle of the nineteenth century, spies had begun undertaking new police and surveillance missions while also adopting new analytic techniques that produced reports containing more than just stolen secrets. By the early twentieth century, these developments had coalesced to form professionalized, government organizations that engaged in many of the functions—code making and breaking, scientific and social analysis, data “fusion,” surveillance, and counterintelligence—that we associate with modern intelligence institutions. Today, individuals use information technologies to undertake activities that were once limited to the great powers. State domination of intelligence might in fact be waning as various nonstate actors, virtual organizations, and individuals play an ever more active role in an emerging digital age of surveillance."
"2","In this lively history, Michael Warner describes how modern intelligence organizations emerged from the social, political, economic, and technological developments that occurred during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and how these same organizations have, in turn, shaped these very same developments. Warner is not particularly interested in providing the details of famous, or infamous, incidents in the annals of intelligence, although his narrative sometimes pauses to explain how some specific demand levied by a government, some revolutionary movement, or some new technology caused a fundamental shift in the art and practice of intelligence. Instead, he explores a series of international, domestic, or technological crises and how governments and intelligence professionals scrambled to meet these challenges, only to see these innovations shape future events in sometimes unanticipated and unwanted ways."
"3","For instance, the military's desire to capitalize on radio communications created a need for increasingly advanced code making to meet the challenge of increasingly advanced code breaking. During the interwar years, this duel between code makers and code breakers intensified as sophisticated techniques and technologies were brought to bear to gain entry into opponents' communications. During World War II, the coders' battle facilitated an Allied victory when Washington and London benefited from an asymmetric advantage in terms of their ability to read their opponents' communications. Similarly, the information revolution saw governments and militaries everywhere rush to create digital networks to support intelligence and military activities, only to realize that the new technologies created myriad vulnerabilities. As Warner also notes, whether the offense or the defense will dominate this new information battlefield has yet to be determined."
"4","Although The Rise and Fall of Intelligence offers a unique and interesting overview of both the influence of history on intelligence and the influence of intelligence on history, readers might take exception to some of the sweeping generalizations offered by Warner. Not everyone might agree that the greatest impact of intelligence on the Cold War was to prolong it by allowing the Soviets to steal technology from the West. In my view, flawed British and American estimates concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs had a far greater impact on British, not American, politics and strategic debates in the aftermath of the Second Gulf War, a judgment not shared by Warner. But, in general, Warner's judgments are reasonable, and his assessment of the broad interaction of intelligence developments and world history is bold, balanced, and compelling. The Rise and Fall of Intelligence is a unique and significant contribution to intelligence studies and provides new insights into the course of recent international affairs.         "
