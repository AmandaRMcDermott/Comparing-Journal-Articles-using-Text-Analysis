"1","THE U.S. PUBLIC LIKELY HEARD the terms “de‐Baathification” and “de‐Nazification” together in the same sentence for the first time a month before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Karen DeYoung and Peter Slevin of the Washington Post introduced the George W. Bush administration's de‐Baathification plan in an article titled “Full U.S. Control Planned for Iraq,” as follows: “Under a decision finalized last week, Iraqi government officials would be subjected to ‘de‐Baathification,’ a reference to Hussein's ruling Baath Party, under a program that borrows from the ‘de‐Nazification’ program established in Germany after World War II.”1 However, the Nazi analogy was already pervasive among the principal U.S. decision makers. They had been using imagery from post–Second World War Germany to describe the Iraqi situation since the 1990s.         "
"2","For instance, George H.W. Bush compared Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and relied on the Munich analogy during the Gulf War in 1990 to justify the war and convince the American public.2 After September 11, 2001, George W. Bush compared the war on terror with the struggle against the Axis powers during World War II. A week before the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in Iraq issued the de‐Baathification order, President Bush used the Second World War analogy during his commencement address at the University of South Carolina. He said, “some believe democracy in the Middle East is unlikely, if not impossible . . . These same arguments have been heard before in other times, about other people. After the World War II, many doubted that Germany and Japan . . . could ever function as free and peaceful societies.”3 Many other U.S. officials, especially neoconservatives such as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, utilized the same analogy over and over again. Before the war, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice promoted the Second World War analogy to emphasize the importance of taking action after September 11.4 Senators Ted Stevens and John Warner wrote that “we see the next Hitler in Saddam Hussein” in a Washington Times op‐ed in October 2002.5"
"3","While researching the rationales, design, and implementation of de‐Baathification between 2010 and 2012, I found that the vast majority of the U.S. and Iraqi officials whom I interviewed made comparisons between de‐Baathification and de‐Nazification even when they were not prompted. This shows that the decision makers continued to use this analogy even after the war. They continued to use it in justifying the war and covering up the mistakes of the invasion, particularly those stemming from de‐Baathification. This quote from Walter Slocombe, a CPA senior adviser for security and defense, indicates how U.S. officials used the Nazi analogy as an ex post facto justification for de‐Baathification:            "
"4","It would be a huge mistake to think of either, Nazi Party or Baath Party, as a political party. They were not like political parties in any normal sense of the word. But the structure of the Nazi Party and the Baath Party was probably like much the same . . . You had a lot of people who were members and it was important to be a member, to get privileges . . . The parties were driven by a much smaller inner circle of professional members . . . Other people who were in the party had real jobs in industry, agencies and institutions, but the people at the top of the party did not; their job was to run the party. So in that sense the National Socialist German Workers Party [Nazi Party] and the Baath Party were similar. I think it was also true and relevant that the Baath Party like the Nazi Party bore moral and direct responsibility for terrible crimes.6"
"5","Similarly, the majority of Iraqi officials I interviewed explained that their suffering under Saddam Hussein's regime was no different from the sufferings of Germans under Adolf Hitler and, as a matter of fact, that Baathism was as dangerous as Nazism.7 Iraqi exiles, who were motivated by political advantage and retribution, liked the de‐Nazification analogy that neoconservatives used.8 Yet some of the interviewees criticized the constant reminder of de‐Nazification in the Iraqi context. For instance, Feisal Istrabadi, professor at Indiana University, participant in the Future of Iraq Study (FoIS),9 and principal legal drafter of Iraq's interim constitution, eloquently explained that “only studying one case that took place sixty years ago would be like studying the spread of today's communicable diseases by only reading articles and texts written in the 1940s.” He continued that a good scientist would survey all the articles written since the 1940s rather than reading only the ones published in the 1940s.10"
"6","Although there is no information that the U.S. officials who designed and implemented de‐Baathification had thoroughly studied the de‐Nazification case and its successes and failures, the data provided in this article suggest that they had not. The similarities and differences between these two processes show that de‐Baathification as a transitional justice mechanism looks like a flawed application of de‐Nazification. The different circumstances that brought about de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification affirm that the de‐Nazification analogy was problematic to begin with. Few articles exist comparing the German and Iraqi experiences and the nation‐building strategies of the U.S. government in these contexts; among those that do, some confirm and describe that the United States used the German analogy during the planning and implementation of Iraqi reconstruction.11 However, there has been no comprehensive comparative description and analysis of de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification in order to describe and analyze their relationship to each other. Therefore, this article is a valuable contribution to the understanding of the use of German analogy in designing and implementing Iraq's transitional justice program. This article begins with detailed examinations of the design and implementation of de‐Nazification in Germany and de‐Baathification in Iraq, offering a comparison of these two transitional justice mechanisms before turning to a comparison of the circumstances and conditions that brought about each mechanism.         "
"7","In 1945, after the collapse of the Third Reich, Allied forces had to deal with the arduous task of rebuilding Germany and extirpating Nazism. At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Big Three Allies—Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union—declared their goal of cleansing the Nazi Party and its influences from German public and cultural life. In August of the same year, they agreed on the extent of the de‐Nazification program along with the de‐militarization, de‐centralization, de‐cartelization, and democratization of Germany at the Potsdam Conference. Soon after, they established the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to prosecute the Nazi leaders most responsible for crimes against humanity, crimes against peace, and war crimes."
"8","In part to facilitate the implementation of the principles agreed to at Potsdam, the Allies agreed to temporarily divide Germany into four military occupation zones, each under the control of one of the Allied forces.12 When it came to implementing de‐Nazification, each nation had a different approach. The British followed a modest and pragmatic approach that focused on screening only those who were in positions of authority.13 France, the only country overseeing an occupation zone that had itself been occupied, pursued a very relaxed approach that focused on individual responsibility.14 As Perry Biddiscombe analyzed, “humanism and recognition of the individual set the tone for a policy that would eventually take shape as Franco‐German reconciliation.”15 The Soviets started by pursuing a sensitive strategy, attempting to differentiate active Nazi Party members who had been involved in crimes from the rest; however, they eventually moved to an authoritarian and arbitrary approach because their underlying intention was the imposition of communism.16 The implementation of de‐Nazification in the American zone was much more brutal than in any of the other zones.17 As de‐Nazification was a U.S.‐initiated plan, American devotion to an extensive implementation demonstrated a remarkable zeal in achieving its objectives.18 As this article compares and contrasts the U.S. implementation of de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification, this section focuses on de‐Nazification in the American zone and the program's transition to German authorities.         "
"9","The U.S. government began discussing postwar policies toward Germany and plans to purge the Nazi apparatus, its officials, and its supporters from Germany's political, economic, and cultural life in 1944.19 The War Department under Secretary Henry Stimson and the State Department under Secretary Cordell Hull were reluctant to approve an extensive purge of the entire Nazi Party apparatus. The State Department's priority was integrating a Western‐oriented Germany back into the international community, and the War Department put an emphasis on U.S. security and the reaffirmation of the principles of international legality.20 Both Stimson and Hull favored a soft peace that hinged on economic reconstruction and political unity.21 On the other hand, the Treasury Department under Secretary Henry Morgenthau proposed a hard peace plan that focused on de‐Nazification, de‐militarization, and de‐industrialization.22 Secretary Morgenthau believed that to prevent future German aggression and to ensure a lasting peace, it was necessary to destroy German heavy industry, pastoralize the country, and implement a long‐term comprehensive purging plan based on the notion of collective guilt.23"
"10","After the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Morgenthau lost his influence, and President Harry S. Truman counted on the State and War departments when it came to foreign policy and military matters.24 On 26 April 1945, President Truman issued the primary official directive for the Military Government (MG) in Germany, Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive 1067 (JCS 1067). Thereafter, Morgenthau took an active role in revising JCS 1067; he worked hard to make sure that the Treasury Department's interests were represented in the U.S. occupation policy. His efforts to make JCS 1067 resemble his original plan were successful. Although the revised JCS 1067 that President Truman signed on 10 May 1945 and the Morgenthau plan were not the same, they were similar. As Dewey Browder described, “the wartime spirit of righteous vengeance that Morgenthau had captured in his plan and that was widespread in the United States . . . was still to be found in the language of JCS 1067.”25 According to JCS 1067,            "
"11","All members of the Nazi Party who have been more than nominal participants in its activities, all active supporters of Nazism or militarism and all other persons hostile to Allied purposes will be removed and excluded from public office and from positions of importance in quasi‐public and private enterprises such as; civic, economic and labor organizations; corporations and other organizations in which the German government or subdivisions have a major financial interest; industry, commerce, agriculture and finance; education; and the press, publishing houses and other agencies disseminating news and propaganda. Persons are to be treated as more than nominal participants in Party activities and as active supporters of Nazism or militarism when they have held office or otherwise been active at any level from local to national in the party and its subordinate organizations, or in organizations which further militaristic doctrines; authorized or participated affirmatively in any Nazi crimes, racial persecutions or discriminations; been avowed believers in Nazism or racial and militaristic creeds; or voluntarily given substantial moral or material support or political assistance of any kind to the Nazi Party or Nazi officials and leaders. No such persons shall be retained in any of the categories of employment listed above because of administrative necessity, convenience or expediency.26"
"12","Although the ultimate mission of de‐Nazification was the physical purging of Nazi Party members from influential posts, it also had moral cleansing and individual rehabilitation aspects to it.27 It aimed to rehabilitate the German population and to help Germany come to terms with political guilt by developing a democratic political culture.28 Yet achieving rehabilitation through a project that focused on collective guilt was contradictory.         "
"13","In the early phases, the implementation of JCS 1067 was extremely difficult. The major questions were how to find the people who were to be purged; how to replace Nazis and collaborators with democrats in the government, administration, judiciary, and other positions of influence; and who should be responsible for making such decisions and implementing the process.29 Determining the extent of an individual's involvement and collaboration with the Nazi regime was difficult because of the lack of reliable data. Many documents had been destroyed during the war.30 Hence, the American MG generated its own information through a detailed 131‐point questionnaire, the Fragebogen.31 This questionnaire was designed to fully identify career details, including the dates of joining the party and its affiliated organizations, dates of promotion, and changes in the social and economic status of every adult living in the American zone.32 The Special Branches of the MG were responsible for distributing these questionnaires to the German populace and determining who was to be purged.33"
"14","However, the problem was that a total of 45 million people had been involved in the Nazi Party and its affiliated organizations.34 Also, there was no guarantee that these 45 million people would tell the truth about their connections with the party and its organizations. Those who had money and influence could avoid or delay their Fragebogen submission,35 while many nominal and minor Nazis who dutifully filled out the form were being deprived of their jobs and livelihoods.36 In order to control the process, eliminate potential lies, and make it impossible for anyone to avoid scrutiny, obtaining food coupons and travel and work permits were conditioned on submission of the Fragebogen.37"
"15","Despite the problems associated with identifying the targets of de‐Nazification, the American MG managed to review almost two million Fragebogen and dismissed nearly 400,000 certified Nazis from their posts.38 This far‐reaching process left the country in despair. Concentrating on purging small fries and establishing a community of suffering among Nazis led to countrywide Nazi sympathy.39 The enormousness of the task and the criticisms from the German population, authorities, churches, and some political parties, such as Christian Democrats and Liberal Democrats, were just some of the few reasons for the failure of de‐Nazification under the auspices of United States.40"
"16","There was a scarcity of competent and reliable replacements for former Nazis. The idea was that there would be enough personnel (especially those who had been in concentration camps or suffered under Nazi regime) to staff the de‐Nazification offices as well as other public offices. Yet the reality was that most of those people either had died or were too weak to work.41 The healthy ones started filling up the positions that they had no expertise in. For instance, unemployed engineers started working as math teachers, and shoemakers began working at the tribunal.42"
"17","The lack of enough qualified and willing American MG officers to continue implementing de‐Nazification added another challenge. As Petra Goedde wrote, the officers “did not encounter many Germans characterized by the government's official wartime image of a monolithic people unified by their support for the war. Instead they found a defeated population devastated by the destruction of the war . . . The lines that once had so clearly separated ‘us’ from ‘them’ became increasingly blurred.”43 MG officers were no longer driven by revenge or antifascism. The preponderance of women and children as well as the pervasiveness of hunger in postwar Germany redirected American MG officers’ attention from those who were responsible for the Nazi crimes to those who were the victims of Nazi crimes and shifted their role from conqueror to protector and provider.44 Most of the MG officers gave priority to providing Germans with basic human needs such as security, housing, food, and water instead of de‐Nazifying them.45 Also, they were just “policemen from Miami, engineers from Pittsburgh, teachers from Binghamton and lawyers from Nashville” whose main concern was getting their jobs done, even if it meant they needed to work with Nazis to do so.46 Eventually, this apathy toward de‐Nazification prevented the antifascist drive in Germany, normalized Nazism, and humanized Nazis.47 These internal deficiencies of de‐Nazification also coincided with the escalation of the Cold War and the change in the international system.            "
"18","At the end of November 1945, Military Governor General Lucius D. Clay appointed a commission to investigate the de‐Nazification program and to discuss its prospects with German officials. The key finding of this commission was that German support and participation in de‐Nazification was crucial.48 As a result, in March 1946, the American MG drafted the Law for Liberation from National Socialism and Militarism. This law transferred primary responsibility for de‐Nazification to the Germans.49 The principles of this law were as follows:               "
"19","To liberate our people from National Socialism and Militarism and to secure a lasting base for German democratic national life in peace with the world, all those who actively supported the National Socialist tyranny, or are guilty of having violated the principles of justice and humanity, or of having selfishly exploited the conditions thus created, shall be excluded from influence in public, economic and cultural life and shall be bound to make reparations."
"20","Everyone who is responsible shall be called to account. At the same time, he shall be afforded opportunity to vindicate himself.50"
"21","In order to make an accurate determination and to impose fair sanctions, every German would be grouped into one of five categories: major offenders, offenders, lesser offenders, followers, and persons exonerated."
"22","Major offenders were those who had committed crimes against victims or opponents of National Socialism and those who were active in leading positions in the Nazi Party, one of its affiliates, or any Nazi or militaristic organization. They were usually active members of the Gestapo, Security Service, Elite Guard (SS), secret military police, border police or those who had participated in atrocities in concentration camps, hospitals, or insane asylums. Punishments for major offenders included work camp sentences of up to 10 years; confiscation of all property; ineligibility to hold a public office and claim a pension; loss of the right to vote, to be elected, and to be a member of a political party; being barred from membership in a trade union or vocational association; ineligibility to hold an active profession independently for 10 years; restrictions with regard to housing; and the loss of all licenses, concessions, and other privileges.            "
"23","Offenders were activists, militarists, and profiteers. They were those who had taught Nazism and benefited from it, spied or informed on their fellow citizens, and exploited their positions of influence to commit and profit from offenses. Punishments were similar to major offenders except work camp sentences and ineligibility to hold active professions were limited to five years rather than ten.            "
"24","Lesser offenders were those who could be under the category of offender but were expected to prove themselves as peaceful and democratic citizens after going through probation. During probation, lesser offenders were prohibited to work in or administer business enterprises or hold positions such as preachers, teachers, editors, authors, or radio commentators. They were expected to work as laborers.            "
"25","Followers were nominal participants or supporters of National Socialism. The sanctions against followers could be considered insignificant compared with sanctions against those who were in other categories. Some of the sanctions included mandatory retirement, lower pay, and demotion if the follower worked as a civil servant.            "
"26","Finally, persons exonerated were those who had not actively participated in and who had even resisted the tyranny and suffered from several disadvantages despite their formal membership in the Nazi Party or its organizations. There were no sanctions against persons exonerated.            "
"27","These detailed categories and varied sanctions were intended to provide fair standards and guarantee the rule of law. Individual responsibility would be respected, and rehabilitation would be given priority over pure punishment. Local boards, appeals tribunals, and de‐Nazification ministries began implementing de‐Nazification.51 The American MG still had the power to oversee the implementation of de‐Nazification.52 Shortly after German authorities began implementing de‐Nazification, the Special Branches of the MG learned that Germany had relaxed the de‐Nazification program and that many of those who had been purged before were now classified as followers or persons exonerated.53 Even though General Clay had openly criticized this whitewashing process, the need for German cooperation against the Soviet threat prevented the United States from interfering directly in the German‐controlled de‐Nazification process.54"
"28","Secretary of State James F. Byrnes's Stuttgart speech of 6 September 1946, during which he renounced the hard‐line policy for Germany, was the first signal that the de‐Nazification program would eventually end.55 In August 1946, the de‐Nazification commission granted amnesty to party members born after 1919, assuming that they had been brainwashed; during Christmas 1946, the commission expanded the scope of amnesty to include low‐income individuals and the disabled.56 In late 1947 and early 1948, General Clay announced additional amendments to the de‐Nazification program; major offenders were downgraded to the category of follower and granted amnesty.57 These changes were the coup de grâce for de‐Nazification,58 finally bringing it to an end in March 1948.            "
"29","Later, in May 1951, the Bundestag adopted a law on the reintegration of Nazi officials into the civil service under the Article 131 of the German constitution.59 With an additional amendment in August 1953, all public servants of the National Socialist state, except agents of the Gestapo and those who had been categorized as major offenders in the de‐Nazification proceedings, gained the right to claim reemployment and back pay for the time they had not been able to work. Moreover, all public administration departments required that at least 20 percent of their employees must be former Nazis.60"
"30","This short summary clearly indicates that the overall implementation of de‐Nazification was full of inconsistencies. First, the United States implemented de‐Nazification quickly and unevenly and did not consider the importance of basic human needs such as food and public services.61 Later, it suffered from insufficient planning and the lack of adequate resources and personnel with which to carry out de‐Nazification.62 The apathy of MG officials when it came to implementing de‐Nazification and the difficulty of distinguishing between persons classified as devoted Nazis and others classified as sympathizers hindered its implementation.63 Finally, amnesty allowed major offenders to be downgraded to lower categories, with these individuals earning the chance to return to their jobs or hold important positions in public service.64"
"31","De‐Nazification lost popularity among Germans; according to polling results in the American‐administered zone, the approval of de‐Nazification plummeted from 54 percent in early 1946 to 32 percent in 1947.65 Therefore, “the process that had begun with wholesale incriminations turned in the direction of wholesale exemptions and then ended in wholesale exonerations.”66 The weaknesses and many criticisms of de‐Nazification and even of the Nuremberg trials suggest that the process mostly failed with regard to guilt and accountability issues. When it came to dismantling Nazi organizations and discrediting Nazism as an ideology, some argued that it had achieved its goal,67 whereas others claimed that the complete reversal of the de‐Nazification process and the increasing sympathy for Nazis following 1951 had not, but rather had strengthened Nazis in the postwar years.68"
"32","In March 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, but the U.S. government had begun discussing de‐Baathification before the invasion. Less than a month after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and over a year before the invasion of Iraq, a group of Iraqi intellectuals, lawyers, engineers, businesspersons, doctors, and other professionals, led by a senior Department of State officer of the Bureau for Near Eastern Affairs, Thomas S. Warrick, began meeting in Washington, DC, to discuss future prospects for Iraq. This project became known as the Future of Iraq Study. From July 2002 to April 2003, there were 33 meetings, and the result was a 1,200‐page, 13‐volume report that contained information about various complex issues that the U.S. government might face following a potential invasion. The FoIS was the first official arena in which de‐Baathification was discussed in depth, along with its predecessor de‐Nazification. Some of the participants contacted Rebecca Boehling, an expert on German de‐Nazification, to understand the de‐Nazification case and discuss its applicability.69"
"33","Meanwhile, the State Department was actively studying the German case. Richard N. Haass, director of policy planning for the State Department and a close adviser to Secretary of State Colin Powell, and one of his staffers, Drew Erdmann, prepared a 15‐page information memorandum titled “Reconstruction in Iraq—Lessons of the Past,” dated 26 September 2002. Germany was one of the postconflict reconstruction cases that this memorandum detailed.70 Being informed by the FoIS and analysis of the German experience, the State Department advocated a policy of de‐Saddamification that focused on purging only those who had committed crimes and those at the very top of the command structure.71 The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agreed with the State Department on this mild purging plan. However, the Department of Defense, under the influence of Iraqi exiles such as the leader of the Iraqi National Congress, Ahmed Chalabi, demanded a broader purging process that was similar to de‐Nazification and advocated for a prohibition on rank‐and‐file Baath members holding senior government posts.72"
"34","The Defense Department's wholesale purging proposal received support from Vice President Dick Cheney's office. While the public focus was on Afghanistan, the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans (OSP) under the supervision of the under secretary of defense for policy, Douglas J. Feith, started working on a plan to purge the Baathists and to disband the army.73 There is no clear information on whether the Defense Department and OSP staff had studied de‐Nazification, but they relied heavily on the de‐Nazification analogy. Rumsfeld compared Nazis to Baathists on NBC's Meet the Press on 13 April 2003.74 At a National Defense University conference on counterproliferation on 13 May 2003, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz said, “There's no question that history will judge harshly those who saw the coming danger but failed to act . . . For years the world allowed the Nazi's to build a war machine . . . That is why we must take these issues so seriously in a post‐September 11 world.”75 At a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee on 22 June 2004, Wolfowitz claimed that the Iraqi Intelligence Service, or Mukhabarat, was the modern‐day equivalent of Nazi Gestapo and that Fedayeen Saddam was similar to the Hitler Youth or German SS.76 Both Wolfowitz and Feith came from families that had been devastated by the Holocaust, and both later admitted that the Second World War had shaped their political views.77"
"35","In December 2002, the OSP drafted a proposal that was later known as National Security Presidential Directive 24; Rumsfeld presented it to President Bush and persuaded him to sign it. This directive handed the control of postwar Iraq to the Department of Defense and presented its plans for postconflict stabilization, including de‐Baathification. Immediately after this directive was signed, Rumsfeld created the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Affairs (ORHA) under the leadership of Lieutenant General Jay Garner, a retired U.S. Army general. Garner began implementing a pragmatic and incremental de‐Baathification process. During a 2007 interview with Charles H. Ferguson for his No End in Sight documentary, Garner explained that ORHA implemented the unwritten de‐Baathification policy by bringing everybody back into the system and letting Iraqis themselves identify the “bad guys.”78"
"36","However, in April 2003, the CPA replaced the ORHA. General Tommy R. Franks announced the establishment of the CPA, a temporary body that was responsible for the administration of the government and managing the process of disestablishing the Baath Party and reforming the armed forces and security organizations. On 6 May 2003, President Bush appointed former ambassador L. Paul Bremer III as Garner's successor and the head of the newly created CPA. Bremer arrived in Baghdad less than a week later, on 12 May 2003, and within four days, he had issued CPA Order No. 1: De‐Baathification of Iraqi Society. The goal was to increase coalition security by removing party members and collaborators from positions of responsibility and by prohibiting the display of symbols and images glorifying Hussein and his party. Bremer, like his colleagues at the Defense Department and OSP, embraced the Nazi analogy. He described the Iraqi dictatorship “as absolute and abusive as that of Nazi Germany” at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Appropriations on 22 September 2003.79"
"37","CPA Order No. 1 removed full members of the Baath Party holding ranks of ‘udw qutriyya (regional command member), ‘udw far’ (branch member), ‘udw shu'ba (section member), and ‘udw firqa (group member) from their posts and banned them from future employment in the public sector. The CPA also planned to vet individuals holding positions in the top administrative layers in every national government ministry, affiliated corporations, and other government institutions, including universities and hospitals, for possible Baath Party affiliation. Yet Bremer or his designees had the right to grant exceptions when necessary. On 3 June 2003, the CPA issued its first memorandum. This document explained that until the CPA transferred the administration of de‐Baathification to Iraqis, U.S. nationals would conduct the necessary investigations to determine any person's Baath Party affiliation. After a thorough review process, the investigator would make a factual finding about the Baath Party membership of the individual and give information regarding the appeals process.         "
"38","On 23 May 2003, Bremer issued CPA Order No. 2: Dissolution of Entities. This order has been the most criticized application of de‐Baathification. It dissolved the Iraqi army, air force, navy, air defense force, republican and special republican guards, emergency forces, al Quds force, and directorate of military intelligence. Other dispersals included the ministries of defense, information, and state for military affairs; the Iraqi intelligence service; the national security bureau; the directorate of general security; the special security organization; the Murafaqin (Hussein's companions) and Himaya al Khasa (special guard); and other organizations and paramilitaries. This order cancelled any rank, title, or status granted to a former employee or functionary of a dissolved entity and indefinitely suspended conscriptions for that entity. It also dismissed any individual who worked in these entities, noting that they remained accountable for acts they had committed during their employment. In other words, this was a wholesale dismantling and dismissal."
"39","Individuals who were not senior members of the Baath Party were eligible for termination payments. Those who were receiving pension payments before 16 May 2003, including war widows and disabled veterans, would continue to be paid unless the original beneficiary was a senior member of the party. Individuals who provided information leading to the recovery of assets of the dissolved entities would be rewarded. This order also gave discretion to Bremer to grant exceptions to those who were removed from their posts. These two orders started the official de‐Baathification process in Iraq."
"40","In order to have a consistent and effective de‐Baathification process, CPA officials tried to rely on numerous resources such as interviews, public records of promotion or ascension of party members, judgments of CPA ministry advisers, testimony of Iraqis who had worked or lived with the person in question, assessments of leading Iraqi figures, and government records revealing bonuses or other privileges.80 Nevertheless, it was impossible to systematically collect enough reliable data for an extensive database to be established. The implementation of de‐Baathification at the ministerial level was extremely challenging.            "
"41","First, officials responsible for having ministries up and running had difficulty understanding the necessity for de‐Baathification. Because their task was to make Iraq's ministries functional as soon as possible, Baath Party membership was not as important to them as competency. Second, these officials were given no guidance on how to implement the order. Third, they believed that they did not have enough knowledge to judge who was a criminal when they did not have enough documentary evidence, especially when the Iraqis they worked with were reluctant to disclose their party status. These challenges at the ministerial level hint at the lack of thorough planning. Those who tried to follow the order and implement de‐Baathification decided to use other individuals working in the ministries to give information on their colleagues81 or to hire only Shiites or Kurds with the idea that the more Sunnis were out of the government, the less Baathist influence there would be in the system.82"
"42","After the CPA issued its first two orders, there was also administrative confusion about how to set up a commission to implement and oversee de‐Baathification. Finally, in November 2003, the CPA handed over the implementation of de‐Baathification to the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC), the provisional government of Iraq, and established the Higher National De‐Baathification Commission (HNDBC). Under new regulations, any citizens who were dismissed from their position should have been entitled to advance written notification, the opportunity to respond to the notification, and the right to appeal. The result of an appeals process would be either denial or reinstatement. If the employee's appeal was denied, he or she could request further review of the matter by the HNDBC. If an appeal resulted in an employee's reinstatement, the employee should receive back pay retroactive to his or her dismissal date. Bremer retained the right to reinstate an employee “if he concludes that it is in the interest of the Iraqi people or that failing to reinstate the employee would be fundamentally unfair.”83 Yet these changes remained on paper as Iraqis started implementing their own de‐Baathification project.            "
"43","Ahmad Chalabi, an ardent proponent of de‐Baathification and member of the IGC, became chairman of the HNDBC and immediately extended the scope of the purges. The limits of the commission and how it would enforce implementation of its decisions were unclear.84 As my interviewees indicated, there was no transparency in the commission's decisions; its documents were inaccessible to outsiders, and nobody had the power to assess the commission's work.85 Hence, corruption became inevitable, and many used de‐Baathification to blackmail alleged Baathists.86"
"44","After allegations arose that Chalabi had given flawed intelligence to the United States and had leaked U.S. secrets to Iran, he was temporarily excluded from the de‐Baathification process in August 2004. His exclusion opened the way for the interim government of Ayad Allawi to lift barriers against former members of the Baath Party.87 In late 2004, Ayad Allawi called for the disbanding of the HNDBC because de‐Baathification was undermining national unity. Bremer withdrew the authority he had given to the HNDBC and allowed the government to establish a new body in its place.88 However, after the 2005 elections, Allawi lost power, and the process of reintegrating Baathists, mostly Sunnis, into the government was brought to an end.            "
"45","De‐Baathification eventually served the purposes of other constituencies. For example, it was also a tool for escalating political conflict between ethnic groups in Iraq. In fact, de‐Baathification became the campaign catchphrase of the Shia Islamist parties during the 2005 elections, namely, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and al‐Dawa. With their victory, the government under the leadership of Ibrahim al‐Jaafari started implementing de‐Baathification harshly, mainly targeting Sunnis. Consequently, Sunnis criticized de‐Baathification as being a de‐Sunnification process. Later on, Prime Minister Nouri al‐Maliki acknowledged that de‐Baathification was an obstacle on the road to reconciliation. With his so‐called national reconciliation program, he proposed changes to the de‐Baathification law, allowing former Baathists to join the political process. However, in reality, he continued to alienate Sunnis.89"
"46","Meanwhile, the Iraqi parliament passed various de‐Baathification provisions as part of the new constitution. Article 7 banned the Baath Party, and Article 135 reinstated the power of the HNDBC as an independent commission. However, it put the HNDBC under the control of the Council of Representatives and stated that the “Council of Representatives shall form a parliamentary committee from among its members to monitor and review the executive procedures of the Higher Commission for De‐Baathification and state institutions to guarantee justice, objectivity and transparency and to examine their consistency with the laws. The committee's decisions shall be subject to the approval of the Council of Representatives.”90"
"47","In 2008, the Iraqi parliament passed the Law of the Supreme National Commission for Accountability and Justice. This law dissolved the HNDBC and established the Accountability and Justice Commission (AJC) to undertake the HNDBC's functions. In order to establish a clear and transparent sanctions framework, the law introduced new principles about the status of ‘udw firqa’ members and pensions. It also proposed a new system and attempted to create an independent appeals mechanism, called the Cassation Chamber. This new system provided an independent appeals mechanism whereby individuals who appealed did not need to give up their right to pension and lose their positions immediately. Instead, these individuals were to be placed on paid leave until the appeals process ended. However, it did not change the process of exceptions and reinstatements other than making them more difficult to obtain.91"
"48","This law aimed to change the structure of the corrupt and highly politicized HNDBC, but instead, it extended the reach of de‐Baathification. Chalabi stayed on as the chairman and Ali Faisal al‐Lami as the executive director of the new commission. Other members of the AJC were selected from those who had deep personal antipathy toward the Baath Party and its members, which signaled that, like the HNDBC, the AJC would be infused with ideological bias and a desire for revenge.92 Like its predecessor, the AJC could charge people for being Baathists without even producing evidence. When it produced documents, they were mostly incomplete, and the criteria for purging were often arbitrary. For instance, over the course of the 2010 parliamentary elections, the AJC proposed to disqualify 511 candidates because of alleged ties to the Baath Party. As Kanan Makiya, the intellectual figure behind de‐Baathification, explained, “many of the senior politicians did not say anything about this decision because they did not want to be seen as being soft on Baathists during the election campaign.”93 Iraqi politicians reinforced this trend in the 2013 provincial elections and the 2014 parliamentary elections as well.            "
"49","In addition to the politicization of the process, de‐Baathification, especially demilitarization, increased security problems in Iraq. Some argued that the wide reaching de‐Baathification process provided enough capacity for the insurgency. According to former director of the CIA George Tenet, de‐Baathification “wasn't protecting Iraqis; it was destroying what little institutional foundations were left in the country. The net effect was to persuade many ex‐Baathists to join the insurgency.”94 Similarly, David Dunford recalled,               "
"50","Suddenly the top 30,000 Baathist parties were out, and that was ideological. It certainly wasn't practical. What that meant, in my view, was those 30,000 people were basically told they had no future in Iraq. They were Iraqi; they had really no other place to go. Every one of them probably was the head of a fairly large family of Iraqis, so with that policy we made very quickly a huge number of enemies, and many of those enemies we find shooting at us today. I did, sort of under the guise of a memo on the Foreign Ministry, I did a memo to Bremer not challenging his de‐Baathification policy, but simply saying we now are going to have a major security problem and we'd better be ready for it.95"
"51","In April 2015, the German magazine Der Spiegel revealed a link between ISIS and ex‐Baathists showing how de‐Baathification aided the rise of terrorism in the region.96"
"52","Moreover, with the dissolution of army and other government entities and the de‐Baathification of ministries, the United States and later the IGC created a huge governance gap in Iraq. As Alex Dehgan explained,               "
"53","[M]ost important scientists who were sitting at home without a salary, who were being approached by Iranians and by insurgents . . . We discussed the issue of Baath Party membership with Washington. I argued that de‐Baathification should not be applicable to our program, which people [in Washington] seemed to clearly agree with. We floated a memo through the CPA, which argued the same point. Then I went to the Iraqi Government. I was meeting with the Minister of Science and Technology on a weekly basis. And the Ministry Administrator himself took me to the de‐Baathification Committee. We explained that we needed to work with people whose knowledge is very, very important, (regardless of their previous political affiliations.) For me, finding stockpiles of weapons was not the critical issue. The critical issue was co‐opting people with knowledge. Take the expression, “If you give a man a fish, he eats for a day, if you teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime.” Well, these are the people who teach people how to fish, these are people whose knowledge is in high demand and can be very valuable, but, at the same time, people who were not getting salaries.97"
"54","Throwing teachers, professors, doctors, engineers, scientists, and those who had the background, experience, and knowledge of running the day‐to‐day functions of Iraq out into the street, jobless, paralyzed the Iraqi government machine and wasted a huge chunk of human resources.98"
"55","When the ongoing de‐Baathification process will formally end is unknown, but its chances of providing reconciliation, peaceful coexistence, and democracy are long gone. Many argued that de‐Baathification was needed “to break the emotional wall of fear and passivity that has imprisoned most Iraqis for decades,” but it may be best remembered as “the original sin”99 that moved Iraq into the midst of its current problems of sectarianism, unemployment, terrorism, and many more.            "
"56","This section provides a comparative analysis, laying out the similarities and differences between de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification, and argues that as much as the similarities imply that U.S. leadership looked at the de‐Nazification case, the differences suggest they did not competently investigate the de‐Nazification case. It also compares the conditions that brought about these processes in order to criticize the choice of the de‐Nazification analogy in the Iraqi context."
"57","The first similarity between de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification is that both of these processes could be categorized as purges under transitional justice mechanisms. Despite the limited literature on de‐Baathification, after 2003, many transitional justice scholars began listing de‐Baathification as an example of purging, along with de‐Nazification. There is no general consensus among scholars as to how to differentiate lustration, vetting, purging, banning, screening, and administrative justice, but purging is often described in the literature as a process that “target[s] people for their membership in or affiliation with a group rather than their individual responsibility for the violation of human rights.”100 During an ideal vetting process, on the other hand, the criteria for assessing suitability for public employment under the new system should be individual responsibility rather than collective responsibility. In other words, purging focuses on collective guilt for social practices, while vetting is interested in an individual's responsibility for particular actions. As noted earlier, individual responsibility was largely ignored during the implementation of de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification for various reasons. Notably, outside forces in each case did not have enough knowledge or reliable data to assess individual responsibility. Therefore, they chose collective guilt over individual responsibility for pragmatic reasons.            "
"58","A second similarity is the element of U.S. involvement in rationalizing, designing, and implementing both programs. According to Bremer, the shared U.S. motive behind de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification was to cleanse the system of repugnant ideologies to make Germany and Iraq better places for their citizens.101 Transforming institutions and political culture to safeguard the democratic transition, eliminating the influence of the previous regime and ideology, and preventing the recurrence of human rights abuses were leading justifications.            "
"59","Third, even though Bremer argued that the scope of de‐Nazification was wider than de‐Baathification, it is also true that both processes affected those who were not within their scopes and left out some of those who were originally set out to be purged. Fourth, both processes suffered from arbitrary, inconsistent, and politically motivated implementation under the leadership of the United States and later domestic authorities, leading to many criticisms."
"60","These implementations under U.S. leadership also share several similarities. For instance, the appointment of governors who had limited information about the countries that they were sent to reconstruct was glaring in both instances, but especially so in Iraq. Governors and many other officials also lacked sufficient language skills and knowledge of local cultures.102 In Iraq, only a few Americans in the field knew Arabic or anything about Middle East.103 Paul Hughes, the senior staff officer for the ORHA and later CPA, described how Americans did not grasp the culture: “Women were patted down in the security checking points in the open by American male soldiers . . . You have to have females doing this not men. And you cannot do this in front of everybody else, you got to separate it. But nobody understood this . . . We did not understand the climate we were getting into. We did not understand the social geography, and the worst part was nobody was interested in understanding.”104"
"61","Furthermore, in both cases, the United States attempted to transfer implementation into the hands of domestic authorities while still retaining its right to oversight and intervene, leading to many complications. However, the difference between the implementation of de‐Nazification under German authorities and the implementation of de‐Baathification under the Iraqi authorities indicate that U.S. implementation meant different things for each group. After German authorities obtained the authority to implement de‐Nazification, they relaxed its measures because the priorities were stability and reconstruction, whereas in Iraq, the HNDBC, motivated by revenge, extended the scope of de‐Baathification, giving rise to the insurgency."
"62","A final similarity is that when the overall implementation of each program is investigated in detail, it is clear that both programs had moments of relaxation. For instance, de‐Nazification was much more aggressive in the beginning than the later phases of its implementation. In Iraq, the CPA had to relax the implementation of de‐Baathification when the insurgency erupted.105 Roman David classifies programs that oscillate between exclusion from office and continuation as mixed systems. He argues that tempering the implementation of both de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification as the security threats increased and the governance gap paralyzed the state apparatus led to several inconsistencies during the implementation phases.106"
"63","These shared elements of de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification suggest that the former informed the engineers of the latter. However, the next two sections, which describe the differences between these two programs and the different circumstances that brought them about, suggest that the U.S. leadership had not studied de‐Nazification, and, most importantly, the de‐Nazification analogy that they relied on was improper for the Iraqi context."
"64","There are several differences between the design and implementation of de‐Nazification and de‐Baathification. First, the de‐Nazification document was complex and sophisticated. Although it was not fully implemented as proposed, the official de‐Nazification document showed an understanding of Germany's political atmosphere and cultural nuances. This was sorely missing in the Iraqi case. Furthermore, in Germany, the Allies achieved effective and rapid demobilization and co‐opted the indigenous armed forces, militias, and internal security apparatus.107 In Iraq, the CPA immediately dissolved the military and many necessary organizations and did not implement a well‐planned disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) process, despite there being a robust literature on this.            "
"65","Another difference was the relationship between the transitional justice mechanisms. If there is a holistic transitional justice process in a given country, the designers of transitional justice mechanisms should plan them in such a way that one does not impede the implementation of other(s).108 Especially because vetting and purging processes are prone to political manipulation and tend to increase security threats, they might easily impede the work of the other transitional justice mechanisms.109 Hence, they should be structured as such that they complement other transitional justice measures. In the German case, both the Nuremberg trials and the de‐Nazification program worked to achieve their mandates without impeding each other's functions. However, in Iraq, the relationship between the Iraqi High Tribunal (IHT) and the HNDBC was problematic. For example, after June 2005, the HNDBC repeatedly interfered in judicial appointments at the IHT. The chief investigative judge of the IHT, Raid Juhi al‐Saedi, explained this in an interview with detailed examples.               "
"66","They [the HNDBC] threatened some of the judges including myself. They told us that because we had Baathist backgrounds, they would fire us. Some of us were lower‐level in the party structure or had no role in the party. We told them that they cannot use de‐Baathification against us, but they responded, “We do not use our law against Iraqi High Tribunal. We use Article 33 of the IHT statute.” Then, we told them that they had no jurisdiction over IHT because the IHT was independent and the only one had jurisdiction over the tribunal was the president of the tribunal. But . . . they fired eighteen, nineteen employees including judges and administrative staff from the IHT. They did not stop there.110"
"67","The judges maintained their positions, but administrative staff were dismissed. Later in January 2006, the HNDBC removed Judge Sa'id al‐Hammashi from Trial Chamber One, where he was expected to assume the role of presiding judge.111 Finally, in October 2006, the commission threatened four tribunal judges and told them that “they would be given the opportunity to apply for transfers rather than face the public humiliation of de‐Baathification.”112 This final wave of de‐Baathification of the IHT judges occurred just before Saddam Hussein's judgment was being finalized. As a result, one member of the Cassation Chamber was replaced, other judges modified their behaviors, and Saddam Hussein's death penalty was assured.113 The relationship between the IHT and the HNDBC is an unfortunate example of how one transitional justice mechanism can impede the functioning of another transitional justice mechanism.            "
"68","These differences suggest that although de‐Nazification analogy was very popular among the U.S. leadership, as detailed earlier, not enough attention was paid to the de‐Nazification case and its details, successes, and failures. Thomas Ricks, a Pentagon correspondent for the Washington Post and the author of Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq, explained,               "
"69","De‐Nazification was very carefully done from the very bottom up. They went into each village and they talked to anti‐Nazi people about who the Nazis had been and they compiled information at the village level . . . Bremer did the opposite. He came in at the very top and issued a sweeping rule that really didn't even have information about who the Baathists were, why they were Baathists and who wasn't a Baathist. It was really just almost a casual imposition on the society that's not particularly informed about the nature of Iraqi society. I think the occupation of Germany was much more an excuse than real analogy.114"
"70","U.S. decision makers chose the de‐Nazification analogy based on their mind‐set instead of its political usefulness.115 When decision makers fail to question the political usefulness of an analogy and when there is no critical and systematic use of the history, they end up with analogies that distort their new policy and misinform their assessment of the current situation.116 Decision makers usually use analogies improperly, and they keep using them even when their defects are pointed out to them.117 As Dirk Nabers explained, “once an analogy is adopted, it can be extremely difficult to shift gears, to reevaluate previous conclusions.”118 This is exactly what happened in Iraq. The constant reminder of the Nazi analogy by the U.S. leadership, particularly neoconservatives, provided perfect grounds for de‐Baathification; getting rid of the Baathists became as morally right as getting rid of the Nazis.119 Noah Feldman, the constitutional adviser to the CPA, recollected that on his way to Iraq in May 2003, his colleagues were reading books about the American occupation and reconstruction in Germany instead of reading about Iraq and the conditions awaiting them on the ground.120 Without immersing themselves in the information available about Iraq and without comparatively investigating German and Iraqi contexts, U.S. officials disingenuously used the German analogy. Yet the problem was that the circumstances that brought about de‐Nazification were quite different than the circumstances that brought about de‐Baathification.            "
"71","First, Nazi oppression was more systematic and extensive than Baath oppression. Over a period of 12 years, the Nazi regime put hundreds of thousands of people into concentration camps and used brutal methods ranging from involuntary medical experimentations to starvation and working people to death. Approximately six million were directly killed in the Holocaust. In addition, the Second World War destroyed much of Germany's infrastructure, creating many postwar recovery hurdles for the country. In Iraq, while Saddam Hussein and his Baath regime also used violent tactics for 35 years to control and rule the country, the atrocities were not nearly as systematic as those in Germany."
"72","Second, living standards in Germany were relatively good compared with those in Iraq. Despite the Nazi regime and the war, Germany was a developed and economically advanced country with a long tradition of law, order, constitutional government and civil society, but Iraq did not have the same luxury.121 The informational memorandum prepared by Richard N. Haass and Drew Erdmann in 2002 explained how the conditions in Germany and Iraq were different:               "
"73","Germany suffered widespread destruction during the war and over a decade of Nazi rule. Still, even amid the rubble of 1945, West Germany possessed the basis for a strong, successful nation‐state because of its educated population, pre‐war capitalist economy, institutions of governance with some degree of popular acceptance and people experienced running them, some history of democratic politics and a common national identity. After removal of top Nazi officials and the demobilization of Germany's military, Western occupation authorities supervised the establishment of a strong democracy and economy within a matter of years . . . Iraq possesses some of the capacity for a viable state, including rich economic resources, familiarity with elements of a market economy, a strong apparatus, a largely secular, educated middle class, a talented Diaspora community and experienced managers, entrepreneurs, and bureaucrats. At the same time, Iraq lacks experience with democracy, has endured economic sanctions and international isolation and is riven by fractious ethnic, tribal, and clan relations. The devastation of the war would add to the challenges.122"
"74","Hence, after the Second World War and the de‐Nazification process, Germany retained a culture that preceded Hitler and his 12‐year‐long Nazi rule, but in Iraq, this was not nearly as possible. After 35 years of Baath rule, Baathism was the only civic culture, meaning that one had no choice but to move ahead in the party in order to move ahead in the society.123"
"75","Third, the role of outside forces was different in each case. The major difference was that the Allies militarily had defeated the German army, which had surrendered unconditionally. Yet in Iraq, the military was not defeated; the opponents and proponents of U.S. involvement in Iraq named the process “invasion” or “liberation,” respectively. The Allies applied massive force to control and occupy Germany in order to build a stable, secure, and democratic nation free from Nazi influence and the Germans surrendered, but in Iraq, the term “occupation” was never used and there was no formal surrender.124 As Atina Grossman and Mary Nolan analyzed, “Germans did not welcome the Americans as liberators, but they did not see them as enemies and did not openly resist the occupation. Iraqi responses are more mixed, with many expressing relief, many others suspicion and some open resistance.”125 The emergence of insurgency in Iraq is an example of this open resistance. Consequently, the difference between the victors and the defeated in Iraq was not as clear as it was in Germany.            "
"76","Fourth, the legality of the Allied occupation and de‐Nazification were widely recognized.126 According to Grossman and Nolan, the American occupation of Germany succeeded because “it took place in the wake of a widely supported defensive war and operated in a context of internationalism and multilateralism.”127 Yet this was not the case in Iraq.            "
"77","Fifth, Germany's neighbors did not try to benefit from the country's vulnerable position as in Iraq.128 As Mowaffak al‐Rubaie, an IGC member, former national security adviser, and former member of council of representatives, observed, “our neighbors were all hostile: some were pro‐Baathists, some were anti‐Baathist,” and they tried to benefit from Iraq's situation.129 As analyzed by Haass and Erdmann, developments during the reconstruction of Germany rebuilt its reputation and reassured its neighbors. However, this was not the case in Iraq. Haass and Erdmann warned the U.S. officials,               "
"78","Iraq is situated in a troubled neighborhood, due in large part to its own making. Many of its neighbors can be expected to try to shape, overtly or covertly, the future of Iraq before any reconstruction effort begins. Turkey could move to occupy northern Iraq to ensure that Kurdish nationalism does not spill over and fuel irredentist tendencies amongst its own large Kurdish minority. Iran, attacked by Baghdad in the past, will likely seek to expand its influence in Iraq through contacts with Iraqi Shiite Muslims and through longstanding relationships with Kurdish parties in the north. Iran could also unilaterally seek to rectify some of its outstanding territorial disputes with Iraq, particularly if Turkey moved into northern Iraq. Should the Baath Party remain in power in Baghdad, Syria too could seek to exert influence through its contacts with the party.130"
"79","Most of these foreseen incidents did in fact occur; Iraq's neighbors as well as terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda have tried to benefit from chaotic circumstances in Iraq, and ISIS is doing the same thing today."
"80","Sixth, Allied forces in Germany had much more time to plan for de‐Nazification than the occupying forces had in Iraq. The Allies had been planning for over two years prior to the occupation, but Jay Garner noted that he had just two months.131 And those two months of planning were extremely disorganized.132 Similarly, Bremer had little time to prepare and had an inexperienced staff. Although Rumsfeld claimed that civilian and military personnel accomplished more in Iraq within seven months than American authorities had achieved in Germany after the Second World War,133 most of the independent observes did not perceive de‐Baathification as successful as de‐Nazification in Germany when it came to planning.134"
"81","Seventh, Germany was not as fragmented by ethnicity, religion, culture, and language as Iraq, and Nazi Germany was not associated with one ethnic or sectarian community.135 Iraq was, and still is, a deeply divided country. With Baathism being closely associated with the Sunni Arab community, this division has been exaggerated during the implementation of de‐Baathification. Therefore, many criticized and perceived de‐Baathification as essentially a de‐Sunnification process. As Slocombe explained in an interview,               "
"82","A key difference between de‐Nazification in Germany and de‐Baathification in Iraq was that de‐Nazification in Germany did not have the sectarian/ethnic dimension as in Iraq. Iraq was more complicated. It was almost as if Germany had been a country with a very big Polish Jewish majority and rather small German minority who ran the place. Breaking the power of the Baath Party was important because it represented a change in sectarian or ethnic domination and demographic power as well as political power.136"
"83","Finally, the differences between U.S. and Iraqi culture were more obvious than the differences between U.S. and German cultures. The cultural similarity between Germany and the United States “reduced some of the tensions that could have built during de‐Nazification,” but in Iraq, “occupied citizens were understandably confused about the new social and political constructs that they were encountering.”137 Therefore, it was much more challenging for the United States to control de‐Baathification than de‐Nazification.            "
"84","It is quite normal for policymakers to turn to the past in dealing with current policy problems, but as Nabers described, “each event is . . . unique and needs to be understood on its own terms before ‘lessons of the past’ are consulted.”138 The similarities and differences between de‐Nazification in Germany and de‐Baathification in Iraq illustrate that the designers of de‐Baathification studied the de‐Nazification case to some extent but used it poorly as an analogy to justify de‐Baathification. As Istrabadi suggested, studying and learning from de‐Nazification as well as many other similar examples could have led to a better transitional justice program in Iraq. Also, the designers and implementers of de‐Baathification should have acknowledged the eight profound differences between post–Second World War Germany and post‐2003 Iraq to use the de‐Nazification analogy accurately.            "
"85","There is no one‐size‐fits‐all approach for transitional justice and no guarantee that any transitional justice mechanism that has worked in one context will work in another. Nevertheless, surveying previous examples of transitional justice mechanisms, learning from their successes and failures, and exploring how they have dealt with the challenges of transitional periods while remembering that the same blueprint cannot be produced again can be crucial. Such investigative work is necessary, especially when an outside power imposes a transitional justice process on another country, as in the case of post–Second World War Germany and post‐2003 Iraq. Under occupation, transitional justice processes are more complicated. In addition to the population of the occupied territory and the ousted government, the occupier and its interests come into play.139 International law, lacking clear instructions, leaves the occupier with tremendous responsibility to restore and ensure public order and safety.140 Therefore, a thorough investigation and detailed comparison of the contexts and conditions of both previous transitional justice mechanisms and the current situation might prevent occupying forces from designing unjust and unfit transitional justice processes as in the case of Iraq.         "
"86","Having had limited knowledge and understanding about de‐Nazification and the context it was used in, the United States tried to collect support for the occupation through the de‐Nazification analogy. As the differences between Germany and Iraq and their regimes as well as the position of the United States as an outside force in each period show, the de‐Nazification analogy was initially inaccurate. Unfortunately, U.S. officials, while repeating the mistakes of de‐Nazification in Iraq, did not replicate its successes."
"87","There are three lessons to be learned from de‐Nazification that were vastly ignored in Iraq, leading to many hurdles that continue to bedevil the process today. First, a detailed document, created after thorough planning, that explains the targets, scope, sanctions, and details of implementation is essential for consistent purging project. Laying out the details of purging is particularly important when an outside force imposes it. A project imposed from the top may easily cause confusion and lead to inconsistent implementation in the bottom. Second, if the goal of purging is to democratize, then the purging project should be supplemented with a strategic co‐optation and DDR process. Those who are purged with their guns can easily mobilize and highjack the newborn democracy. Finally, purging alone might not respond to the needs of victims; therefore, it should be used as a part of holistic transitional justice project. When that is the case, the designers and implementers should be cognizant of its relationship between other mechanisms so no one mechanism impedes the functioning of others. This comparison should remind policymakers of the importance of sophisticated and careful reading of history and how overvalued superficial analogies can jeopardize a transitioning country's path in the search for peace and justice.141"
