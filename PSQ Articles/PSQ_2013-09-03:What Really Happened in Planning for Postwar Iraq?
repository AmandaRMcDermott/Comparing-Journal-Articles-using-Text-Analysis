"1","THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ON PLANNING for postwar Iraq is that the Pentagon did precious little of it, and arrogantly disregarded the extensive preparation done by the State Department.1 This narrative is at best incomplete, and at worst inaccurate. Important lessons from the mistakes of the period are buried by the easy explanation that the George W. Bush administration was incompetent.2 The real story of what happened is more interesting, and its lessons more useful, than the myth.         "
"2","The United States went to war with a plan to quickly stand up an “Iraqi Interim Authority” (IIA) that would be given immediate sovereignty over some areas of Iraqi life and a rolling transfer of authority over others. This plan was agreed to in a 10 March 2003 National Security Council (NSC) meeting, and General Jay Garner, the initial U.S. plenipotentiary in Iraq, began to implement it. When Garner's replacement, L. Paul Bremer, was selected and briefed, many in the U.S. government believed that he endorsed the IIA plan and would move it to completion. Bremer, though, harbored serious doubts about the wisdom of the concept, and abandoned it within hours of arriving in Iraq. He formalized a direct occupation, putting his Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in complete control of Iraq's politics and economy for a full year."
"3","The real story of the IIA and its abandonment, exposed here through new documentation and personal interviews with the chief planners at Defense, State, and the NSC staff, runs counter to the conventional wisdom on postwar planning.3"
"4","On the issue of a governance structure for postwar Iraq, there was substantial interagency debate over competing concepts and a decision reached by the President and the principals. What was missing was not a plan, but the implementation of it. The differing approaches of Garner and Bremer are at the heart of the matter. Garner stayed in close touch with Washington, supported the IIA concept, and moved smartly to implement it. Bremer relied on ambiguous verbal guidance received in a lunch meeting with the President more than the written work on the IIA, a concept about which he harbored serious reservations. He kept Washington at arm's length, and did what he thought best on the basis of his personal judgment."
"5","The episode illuminates the interplay of personality and process in policymaking. The personalities of Bush, who signed off on the IIA but was vague and insouciant with Bremer at a crucial moment; Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who vacillated on the issue of how much power to give Iraqis in the early stages of the postwar; Garner, who did as he was told; and Bremer, who did not, were crucial to the outcome."
"6","Process also played a role. Debates over the postwar within the administration were contentious and characterized by suggestions of bad faith between State and Defense. The principals had other pressing concerns — planning the invasion itself and seeking domestic and international support for it — and were only intermittently involved in the conceptual debates. Finally, the overturning of months of extensive interagency work in a lunch meeting between the president and his newly hired envoy shows that attention has to be paid to all stages of the policy process—debate, decision, and implementation—in order to ensure that what happens on the ground reflects what is decided in the abstract. Whatever the criticisms that can be leveled against formalized national security decision making—paper‐heavy, slow, stifling of creativity—one advantage of a careful process is that decisions are documented, and ambiguity is reduced."
"7","I am making a specific case about the quality of postwar planning: there was a plan for governance after Saddam Hussein, and it was different from the CPA/direct occupation approach that emerged. The evidence does not suggest that there was a detailed, day‐by‐day, ministry‐by‐ministry, unit‐by‐unit grand scheme for administering Iraq. As one insider from the intelligence community put it to me, it is one thing to set up an executive structure such as the IIA or, for that matter, the CPA. But whether that executive will have any control over the bureaucracy of the country or the situation on the ground more generally is quite another matter.4"
"8","Bush administration planners should not be entirely exculpated, then. While it is inaccurate to say that they had no plan whatsoever, it is reasonable to suggest that the implementation of the plan was very poor. As Lawrence Di Rita, a Rumsfeld aide who was seconded to Garner's team, told me in an interview, “If you are going to criticize us for anything, it should be for failing to carry through on our own policies” in postwar Iraq.5"
"9","The received wisdom on post‐invasion Iraq has been shaped by the accounts of journalists such as Bob Woodward, George Packer, Thomas Ricks, and James Fallows. These accounts, written without access to documentation now available and based largely on background briefings by State Department officials, accurately portrayed elements of what happened while propagating some myths that should be re‐examined. Doing so is especially important as many political scientists use instant histories as data sources against which to test their theories. As one historian said to another during a presentation by a political scientist, “What they don't understand is that if they get the facts a little wrong, they don't get the results a little wrong. They get them all wrong.”6"
"10","The first myth is that there was no planning for the postwar. At least in terms of basic concepts of governance, the planning was extensive. Models ranging from the post‐World War II structures in France, Germany, and Japan to the UN‐led operations of the 1990s to the recent Afghanistan process formed the basis, as explained below, for competing ideas within the State Department, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), as to what the United States should and should not do once the Saddam regime was gone. Interagency groups of a standing nature, such as the Deputies Committee (DC), and extraordinary, such as the NSC's Executive Steering Group (ESG) and the Pentagon‐based Organization for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), attempted to develop operational plans based upon this conceptual work. When General Jay Garner was hired to head ORHA, he understood his role to be integrating the existing plans. When he examined the preparatory work, he judged that “the plans were pretty good. I mean, the interagency [process] had done a pretty good job.”7"
"11","Pentagon planners did not prepare to fight a multiyear insurgency as they did not intend to stay in Iraq as an occupying force. Douglas Feith, the Under‐Secretary of Defense at the time, agrees entirely that the insurgency was not planned for. “But whose responsibility,” he asks, “is it to warn about the possibility that even after you overthrow the Baathists, they are going to be able to organize, finance, and control, an insurgency with foreign Jihadists?” Feith argues this is an intelligence failure, and intelligence is the province of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which Pentagon civilians believe had a miserable record during this period. In the first wave of Iraq literature, Feith points out,            "
"12","[I]t isn't called an intelligence failure, it is called a planning failure. Arguably it's both. And the reason it's both is that planning is based on intelligence … The CIA did not suggest that the Baathist regime would be able to function in any meaningful sense after it had been overthrown. Yet that turned out to be exactly the problem that we had.8"
"13","Secretary of State Colin Powell, according to his biographer Karen DeYoung, was “physically and psychologically far removed” from the project, having “larger problems on his mind.”9 Powell's deputy, Rich Armitage, characterized it as “a compendium of all the things that one would have to look at and that could go wrong” in a post‐Saddam Iraq. But “I wouldn't want to call it a plan. It would be unfair to call it a plan.”10 Marc Grossman, the senior State official after Powell and Armitage, told me in an interview that “I think it's sort of an urban legend that if only the Future of Iraq project would've been the foundation for US policy, that everything would've been fine. I don't think that's right. I don't think it is right to say that the State Department had every answer to every question, and the Defense Department had no answers to any questions.”11"
"14","The Iraqis who participated did not hold the project in high regard. Ali Allawi, who would later become Iraq's Defense Minister, felt that the effort was a            "
"15","[H]alf‐hearted and unreal attempt to tackle the issues that would confront the overseers of a country with a devastated economy and a dictatorial political culture. Most of the groups dealt with issues on which the participants had no up‐to‐date information, or any immediate experience. The real importance attached to the project was reflected in the State Department's allocation of a single basement office to act as the ‘control center’.12"
"16","What happened, then, to the reports produced by the Future of Iraq project? Feith reports that State did circulate the documents around the government, but “no State official ever presented them to the Deputies, Principals, or NSC as a State Department proposal or plan for postwar Iraq.”13 The one State official who did try to push the product forward was Thomas Warrick, a mid‐ranking officer who oversaw the project. When Warrick was invited to address the NSC's postwar planning body, the ESG, he found it difficult to reduce the 1,000 plus pages of the Future of Iraq project report into a useful briefing. Franklin C. Miller a senior NSC Director who oversaw the ESG, thought Warrick “did not give a particularly good overview of what was going on. He did not indicate that there was a fair amount of work going on—whatever its value—on reconstruction activities, postwar activities. And he never asked to come back and we never asked him to come back, because the discussion was more academic than on action‐focused activities,” which were the remit of the ESG.14"
"17","Ironically, the strongest proponent of a Future of Iraq product was Douglas Feith—precisely the official who is most often accused of discarding it. The Democratic Principles working group produced a 98‐page report on how a democratic transition might be fostered in Iraq.15 Feith found it to be “one of the better resources for administration officials working on the structure of a post‐Saddam government.”16"
"18","With these myths set aside, we are now in a position to consider the real story of planning for post‐Saddam Iraq."
"19","The U.S. government considered three concepts for the governance of post‐Saddam Iraq. The fundamental issue differentiating them was the extent of U.S. control over Iraqi affairs. Should this control be limited or extensive? Short‐term or long‐term? Exercised in close collaboration with Iraqis, with the international community, or with neither?17"
"20","The preference of some officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense was to declare an Iraqi provisional government prior to the invasion. This government would be composed of Iraqi exiles and opposition leaders resident in Washington, DC and in London, and be centered upon the Iraqi National Congress (INC) organization led by Ahmed Chalabi."
"21","This proposal had compelling advantages.18 First, it would avoid the taint of occupation, giving an Iraqi face to the postwar government. Second, a provisional government would draw upon Iraqis known to the U.S., credentialed anti‐Baathists with decades of immersion in Western democratic culture and a good understanding of the workings of Washington. The exiles had a sales pitch, describing themselves as “an Iraqi opposition with professional qualifications and leadership capabilities. It thinks differently than its counterparts in the rest of the Arab world and it is the first opposition inside an Arab or Muslim country to work so closely with Western powers.”19 Third, declaring a government ahead of time would seem to offer the prospect of repeating what, as of late 2002, looked like the successful “Karzai model” in Afghanistan.20"
"22","The provisional government model had obvious disadvantages, too. Chalabi's INC was distrusted among some government agencies, particularly the State Department and the CIA. Both thought that Chalabi, while initially impressive, was unreliable, if not fraudulent. Did the United States really want to turn over a country of Iraq's significance and resources to an organization about which significant doubts had been raised? Second, it was not at all clear that the Iraqi people would accept government by individuals who had not been resident in the country for several decades. If a government declared in exile found little or no support upon its return, it could not be effective. Third, overthrowing the regime and promising a democracy—U.S. war aims—sat uneasily with picking the post‐regime government ahead of time. This could hardly be seen as democratic."
"23","Iraqi exiles, though, insisted until the outbreak of war that the declaration in advance of a provisional government was the best option, and after the war they pushed for the transfer of sovereignty as rapidly as possible."
"24","The second concept debated was of an occupation—or at least international trusteeship—with Iraq administered by non‐Iraqis for an extended period. The strongest advocate of this concept was the State Department, which developed an outline plan for a Transitional Civil Authority (TCA).21 Ideally, such an authority would have a mandate from the United Nations and could provide leadership during a “multi‐year transitional period” in order to “build democratic institutions.”22 During the period of direct rule, Iraqi exiles would return to the country and establish political parties and movements that would compete with or be absorbed by similar parties formed by in‐country Iraqis. The danger of empowering untrustworthy exiles would be avoided. Additionally, the full resources, expertise, and legitimacy of the international community could be brought to bear.            "
"25","This concept also had significant drawbacks. It was against the wishes of the exile community, and almost certainly the majority of Iraqis within the country, who wanted self‐governance immediately and strongly opposed direct control by foreigners. It was not clear that the international community, given the strains on relations caused by the contentious debates over the war, could be induced to play a constructive role. Further, the approach risked enmeshing the United States in a morass of what, during the 2000 presidential campaign, Condoleezza Rice had termed “armed social work.”23"
"26","The third possibility was for direct rule by those who had overthrown the regime—the U.S. military. CENTCOM Commander General Tommy Franks could act as a unified source of civil and military authority, ruling by decree. The obvious analogy was to the post‐1945 occupation of Japan under General Douglas MacArthur. The Joint Staff of the armed forces proposed this in the fall of 2002, calling for a “three‐star general in charge of a staff of experts drawn from various U.S. government agencies.”24"
"27","Advantages to this model were that a sweeping program of civil and economic reform could be enacted rapidly and with coherence, while order was kept by U.S. forces, and the prestige of the victorious General was translated into post‐conflict legitimacy. There would be no power vacuum after the regime fell, and the conquering commander could take many of the hard but necessary decisions before handing off a freshly reformed country to an Iraqi government."
"28","There were, however, significant difficulties with this concept.25 The label of “occupation” would be unavoidable. Many in the U.S. government feared that, to Iraqis, military rule would seem analogous to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. The international community could not be expected to endorse an extended occupation with direct military control.            "
"29","Second, as with the TCA concept, the danger of being drawn into an extended period of nation building was clear. Third, General Franks had very little desire to be a modern‐day MacArthur, viewing this model as a remnant of a bygone era, counter to current doctrine on the role of U.S. military forces in post‐conflict situations. Consequently, many in the military did not want to play an extended role in postwar governance.26"
"30","In his memoirs, Franks discussed the advantages and disadvantages of his being the “MacArthur of Iraq,” but was clear that he did not want the job: “Civilian control of government has long been an American value. How to move Iraq forward using this distinctly American model was problematic. One thing was certain, however. [The postwar] would require civilian leadership.”27 Marc Grossman told me that, aside from the Joint Staff briefly raising the idea, this was “never really an option at all. No one was looking to be occupiers in that sense.”28"
"31","The Deputies Committee (DC), composed of the second‐ and third‐ranking officials of the agencies of national security, was the principle body that debated these conceptual approaches. The DC is subordinate in interagency decision making only to the Principals Committee (Cabinet officials of Secretary rank) and the NSC (the Principals Committee plus the president). The DC is commonly an arena in which much of U.S. foreign policy is decided, with only issues of prime importance, or where the DC becomes deadlocked, forwarded to the Principals Committee or the NSC for resolution."
"32","Prime protagonists from the Department of Defense were Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Under‐Secretary for Policy Douglas Feith. These officials preferred the provisional government approach. On the State Department side were Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage and Under‐Secretary Marc Grossman. They pushed the TCA concept."
"33","The DC began debating the basic conceptual issues in mid‐2002, settling into a routine of twice‐weekly meetings.29 Debates were contentious.30 State and the CIA viewed Defense Department proposals as barely disguised attempts to install Ahmed Chalabi as the leader of Iraq. Defense officials viewed State proposals for the TCA as based on a similarly narrow goal—to block the assumption of power by Iraqi exiles.31"
"34","Douglas Feith found State proposals—forwarded in two papers distributed by Rich Armitage in July 2002, to be insufficiently considered and driven by contradictory imperatives: “The papers showed State was torn between conflicting aims: wanting to allow the Iraqis to rule themselves, and wanting Americans to rule long enough to ensure that the externals [exiles] would not become the leadership.” This contradiction, Feith continues, “[W]ould impede the administration's efforts to prepare for post‐war Iraq.”32 In particular, Feith avers, the necessary preparatory work of training a force of Iraqi exiles to accompany the U.S. military into Iraq, fight in the overthrow of Saddam, and thereby both gain legitimacy among the populace and give sorely needed expertise in Iraqi culture to the Americans, was impeded by State's opposition. Even more importantly, Feith believes that the necessary coordinating work among the various parts of the fractious Iraqi exile opposition was delayed by State Department intransigence.33"
"35","Constructive debate in the DC, other protagonists assert, was prevented by the Pentagon. Knowing that a program to install the exiles would not make it through the interagency process, Pentagon officials sought to short‐circuit the process. Rumors abounded that secret work on postwar Iraq was being conducted inside the Pentagon.34"
"36","Franklin C. Miller, Senior Director for Iraq on the NSC staff, told me that “I had no visibility, and I have no idea to this moment what Feith and company were up to, I presumed they were meeting internally. One assumed that they were meeting internally on matters of what they deemed to be grand strategy.”35 This was indeed the case, and herein lay a problem. Miller's interagency Executive Steering Group was action‐oriented rather than focused on overall conceptual issues. Feith, meanwhile, was working at a conceptual level on what would become the IIA plan. The two groups—with their respective operational and conceptual competencies—did not properly connect.36"
"37","Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld did not think the DC should make decisions. Franklin Miller, the executive secretary of the DC during this period, told me that meetings often became “a bit of an academic exercise” as “Rumsfeld didn't want the deputies to decide anything.”37 Another senior participant agrees: “Mr. Rumsfeld said early in the administration—before September 11th – —that the Deputies Committee couldn't take any decisions. And when that happened, it condemned that level of government to being just talking.”38 Rumsfeld's apparent motivation here was to ensure that issues went up to the principals, where, with his acute reading of the President and strong relationship with the Vice President, he believed his strength lay.39"
"38","The results of the conceptual disagreement, the difficult relationships between some of the personalities involved, and the circumscription of the traditional DC role in policymaking, was that the principals did not have a clear recommendation from their deputies by the time they considered the question of governing postwar Iraq."
"39","Given this, the Principals Committee/NSC needed to reach a decisive conclusion on the concept for the postwar, resolving the competing approaches forwarded by the deputies and allowing the DC to move on to elaboration and implementation. The DC could then provide clear guidance to the military and civilian groups that would deploy to Iraq."
"40","The principals did reach two conclusions. First, they rejected the idea of declaring a provisional government in exile. Secretary of State Colin Powell was opposed on the grounds that the INC was unreliable and exiles would have no support. George Tenet of the CIA concurred—the agency's view was that the externals had no internal constituency. Secretary Rumsfeld did not support his number two (Wolfowitz) and number three (Feith) officials' preference for a provisional government. Under‐Secretary for Policy Douglas Feith had discussed the idea with the Secretary:            "
"41","Rumsfeld said the problem is that if you simply have a provisional government, even if you get the internals involved in it quickly, you would be putting an enormous amount of power and enormous resources, economic and military, in the hands of these people, and they may not prove themselves competent, they may not prove themselves honest, and they may not prove themselves politically successful. So he said the provisional government idea is not a good idea. Even though we had done something like a provisional government in Afghanistan, Rumsfeld said the difference between Iraq and Afghanistan is that Afghanistan didn't have the economic resources or the military resources that Iraq had.40"
"42","The second decision reached by the principals was that the Department of Defense would be the lead agency in the postwar. On 15 October 2002, Feith delivered a briefing to the NSC proposing that the U.S. presence in postwar Iraq be overseen by a military headquarters commanded by a three‐star general with a separate civil component, headed by a non‐military “Iraq coordinator.” Both would come under the overall command of CENTCOM and the Secretary of Defense.42 There was some debate over this, but the logic in favor of Pentagon control through CENTCOM was compelling. The Pentagon had the resources necessary for the postwar, and since commanding the postwar components would involve issuing orders to military personnel, the Secretary of Defense had to be in charge. Secretary Powell agreed: “State does not have the personnel, the capacity, or the size to deal with an immediate postwar situation in a foreign country that's eight thousand miles away from here.”43"
"43","Principals decision making was less crisp on the fundamental concept for postwar governance, once the provisional government‐in‐exile idea had been vetoed. As Rumsfeld later described it,            "
"44","In discussions of postwar Iraq, the toughest challenge was the tension between two different strategic approaches. The debate between them was legitimate, but it remained just that—a debate. It was never hashed out at the NSC and never finally resolved . . . the basic difference was between speed—how quickly we could turn over authority—and what was called legitimacy—exactly what political and constitutional processes needed to be in place prior to turning the reins over.44"
"45","Had “no nation‐building” been Bush's sole objective, he might very well have supported the provisional government‐in‐exile concept. But with “no nation‐building” competing with democratization as goals, he risked setting a target of creating democratic institutions without fully committing to the “armed social work” necessary to achieve them. The President's intellectual evolution on this issue, combined with the appalling security situation in Iraq, would eventually lead to his embrace in 2007 of an increased force size and a counter‐insurgency doctrine for the U.S. mission.45 As Marc Grossman told me in an interview, “Although people were fighting about this tactic and that tactic, part of the issue was there were these unresolved philosophical debates about nation‐building.”46"
"46","The Secretary of Defense was similarly conflicted. Rumsfeld did not want a U.S. occupation of Iraq. The demands of this would run counter to his goal of achieving a transformation of the armed forces toward a lighter, more‐technology/less‐manpower model. At the same time, as noted above, Rumsfeld had doubts about anointing the exiles as the government of Iraq. Rumsfeld was prone to indecision and vacillation. When combined with his desire for direct control over many policy areas, this created difficulties in the decision‐making process.47"
"47","Third, the principals each had other issues and concerns that took primacy over postwar planning. The President was consumed with the prewar diplomatic effort, as was the Secretary of State. Powell saw securing United Nations authorization for war as the basic building block for a happy postwar situation, and so did not get deeply involved in the internal debate on post‐Saddam governance. As late as 28 February 2003, Powell was circulating “an informative paper” from the State Department historian on the precedent for different postwar models.48 The urgency of the issue merited, by this time, far more than for‐your‐information circulations of historical surveys.         "
"48","Secretary Rumsfeld's prime concern was with the in‐depth process of “iterated planning” on the invasion plan. Rumsfeld was meeting with Franks weekly and spending much of his time seeking to shape the leanest, most‐efficient and ‐effective plan possible for overthrowing the Iraqi regime. As he put it apologetically to Jay Garner on 14 March, “I haven't given you the time I should have given you. Quite frankly, I just have been so engulfed in the war that I just didn't have time to focus on everything that you're doing. I tried to keep abreast of it, but I wasn't able to give it the time it needed.”49"
"49","These major objectives—securing a coalition and producing the optimal war plan—were more than deserving of the time of the most senior government officials. But they did take precedence over the issue of postwar governance. This overload at the principals' level demonstrated the folly of rendering the deputies' level impotent."
"50","The result was that official policy for postwar governance remained vague until very late in the game.50 An NSC document, “Iraq: Goals, Objectives, Strategies,” represented the codified policy. The document spoke of “an interim administration in Iraq that prepares for the transition to an elected Iraqi government as quickly as practicable.”51 Of course, without further specification, this interim administration could fit with any of the concepts discussed above. And the timetable of “as quickly as practicable” was similarly imprecise.         "
"51","The plan for postwar governance was not decided upon by the NSC until meetings in early March 2003, only days before the invasion of Iraq. After the President and Secretary Rumsfeld had decided against declaring a provisional government‐in‐exile, Douglas Feith had gone to work on an alternate approach.52 His proposal was an Iraqi Interim Authority that would share power with the coalition. This Authority would have immediate control over some areas of governance, such as the ministries of foreign affairs, justice, and agriculture. As the IIA broadened in representation, proved its competence, and the situation stabilized, it would take control over more and more ministries at a pace decided by the coalition until, in a relatively short period of time, it assumed control over the “power ministries” [the armed forces and the interior ministry] and became a fully‐fledged sovereign government.53"
"52","The IIA, then, incorporated the preferences of the Pentagon and the Iraqi exiles for some sovereignty immediately, while also incorporating State's preference for a coalition‐run structure that would assist in developing non‐exile leadership. As Feith told me in an interview, he hoped to take the best elements of the Transitional Civil Authority and provisional government concepts, while avoiding the risks of both:            "
"53","It was not an all or nothing: it wasn't we run the whole country, as State had said, and it wasn't we turn everything over immediately, as the provisional government idea had said. This was: you [the Iraqis] will have a sovereign government from the beginning, or nearly the beginning, but you will not be totally sovereign in all areas right away. Instead, we will have a power sharing arrangement, and we will be transferring increasing amounts of authority to you as soon as we can and as soon as we satisfy ourselves that you are functioning well and honestly and with popular support.54"
"54","The small Organizing Committee would be dominated by the exiles, but ethnically broad and containing much of what became the political elite of post‐Saddam Iraq: Masud Barzani (Sunni Kurd); Ahmad Chalabi (Shia Arab); Jalal Talebani (Sunni Kurd); Muhammed Baqr al‐Hakim (Shia Arab); Adnan Pachachi (Sunni Arab); and Ayad Allawi (Shia Arab)."
"55","The Leadership Council (the group that would exercise executive powers over a gradually increasing number of ministries) was to be comprised of the Organizing Committee plus one Iraqi leader from each province (18 total, either internal or external) and, to ensure full ethnic representation, one individual each of Assyrian, Chaldean, Yezidi, and Turkoman origin.55 Interestingly, in light of State Department criticism over the Pentagon favoring externals, the procedures would ensure a majority of so‐called internal Iraqis at each stage except the first.         "
"56","The IIA would slot into a coalition structure under a unified forces commander (initially General Franks). U.S. forces would be concerned primarily with removing the remnants of the Hussein regime, searching for and securing weapons of mass destruction, and undertaking stability and security operations. Under Franks would be the newly created Organization for Relief and Humanitarian Affairs, led by Lieutenant General Jay Garner, responsible for humanitarian operations and initial civil governance. As the situation stabilized, the plan was to replace Garner with two presidential envoys—a civil administrator with skills in diplomacy, and the liaison to the Iraqi opposition, Zalmay Khalilzad, who would knit together coalition and IIA activities and be the President's representative to the IIA. Over several months, the balance of power between the coalition and the IIA would shift toward the IIA until, in the later stages, it blossomed into a fully‐fledged Iraqi government exercising sovereignty over all aspects of national life."
"57","The concept was discussed in two preparatory NSC meetings on 1 March and 7 March, and agreed to in an NSC meeting on 10 March.56 This was now the official plan for the postwar. A 15 March New York Times story contained an accurate summary of the policy:            "
"58","President Bush has approved a plan to create an “Iraqi Interim Authority,” made up of Iraqis from all of the country's major tribal, ethnic and religious groups, immediately after Saddam Hussein is deposed from power, senior administration officials said today. Officials said the interim authority would receive what they called “a rolling transfer of authority” over daily Iraqi life.57"
"59","Further, the prospect of some power immediately—with more to come—would keep the exile community, devastated at not having a provisional government declared in advance, with a stake in the game. Whatever the faults of the exiles, without them the prospect of extended direct rule became inevitable. At this time, the exiles were the only apparent exit strategy."
"60","Finally, the staggered handover of power would test what had heretofore been a matter of speculation: could the exiles govern in a competent manner and attract the support of the Iraqi people? The Pentagon, Rumsfeld's vacillations aside, believed that they could, State and the CIA thought not. As the former U.S. Ambassador to the UN John Bolton put it to me:            "
"61","One thing that's certain is that you do not encourage the political maturation of a people by making political decisions for them. You encourage maturation by making them make their own decisions. So, would it be artificial, in a sense, to put people in positions of authority who had not been in Iraq? Sure. But the issue is not whether we put them into those positions on day one, but whether on about day thirty they are still there.59"
"62","With the decision on postwar structure made, attention turned to implementation. The purpose of ORHA, created in December 2002, was to integrate the planning that had been done by various interagency groups, and later to deploy to Iraq, render immediate humanitarian aid, and stand up the IIA. Douglas Feith, who helped draft the presidential order establishing ORHA, explained to me in an interview that            "
"63","[F]or a period, [CENTCOM commander General] Franks was going to be responsible for Iraq. He was the commander, and if you are the commander and you overthrow the government, you are the government. He was going to be responsible. But it was clear that a lot of the things that needed to be done were civilian functions. So the purpose of ORHA was to create a civilian team that comprised the civilians in Washington who had actually done the plans that CENTCOM was going to be implementing in the days after Saddam's overthrow. And since CENTCOM was going to be responsible, but you were going to need civilians to draw on their own plans and to implement them, we created ORHA so that we were giving the civilian module to the CENTCOM commander for his use in fulfilling those responsibilities.60"
"64","Jay Garner was called by Feith and asked to serve as ORHA head. His job description, as he recalls it, was to “coordinate the plans, then hand it off [after the initial post‐conflict phase] to a presidential appointee.” The central task before the war was not planning per se, but integration of plans: “What had happened [wa]s the planning, I guess most of it started in October 2002, but they were all done in the vertical stovepipes of those agencies … integration of those plans had not occurred up to that point.”61"
"65","For six weeks after being called by Feith, Garner read himself in on the planning, held briefing sessions, and sought to staff ORHA with personnel from the various agencies. PowerPoint slides from meetings of ORHA personnel, plus a “unified mission plan” drafted by Garner, give a sense of ORHA's priorities. What is clear is that ORHA leaders assumed they were working within a framework of liberation rather than occupation. “Coalition forces,” Garner's mission plan stated, “must be seen as a liberating force—a force for good—whose prime purpose is to empower the Iraqi people to shape their own future. There must be no perception of an occupying force.” An occupation and heavy‐handed military presence would “exacerbate anti‐US feelings” and increase the “chances of a backlash/intifada.”62 ORHA would not need to act as a governing authority, an ORHA planner wrote, because “The expectations derived from policy set in Washington were that the establishment and devolution of authority to an Iraqi entity would proceed quickly.”63"
"66","Secretary Rumsfeld wrote to the President and the other principals on 1 April 2003 indicating the importance of moving forward with the IIA: “We have to get moving on this …. This is now a matter of operational importance. It is not too much to say that time can cost lives.”64 With a similar sense of urgency, Garner began to aggressively implement the IIA plan immediately upon arrival in Baghdad. He met with the core leadership group of Iraqi externals on the night of 14 April in the Southern city of Nasiriyah. There, an anxious Ahmad Chalabi told Garner it was vital that he and other members of the Iraqi opposition be transported to Baghdad as quickly as possible in order to prevent the emergence of a power vacuum.65 Chalabi later claimed Garner promised him “a provisional government in Iraq in four weeks.”66"
"67","On 21 April, Garner traveled to the northern Kurdish region to meet with Jalal Talebani and Marzoud Barzani—two Kurdish leaders with whom he had worked closely in the aftermath of the first Gulf war. Garner said to them “I can't let you guys set up an interim government, but what I can do is let you put together a leadership group that becomes the face of leadership for the Iraqi people. If that works, we can transition that into an interim government. But it will be under U.S. authority, a coalition authority,”—essentially the IIA concept. Talabani said, “That's what we want anyhow.”67 The two Kurds explained to Garner that they were willing to move forward to an IIA with the initial core being Allawi, Pachachi, Jaafari, Chalabi, Hakim, and themselves. The Iraqis asked Lawrence Di Rita to get direct confirmation from Rumsfeld that this core group would receive U.S. support. Rumsfeld confirmed that this was so.68"
"68","On 28 April, a follow up to Nasiriyah, with over 300 prominent Iraqis—and a two‐thirds majority of internals—took place in Baghdad. This meeting advanced the IIA concept substantially, and was characterized by a spirit of cooperation among the previously fractious Iraqi leaders. A timetable for the establishment of a transitional government was established, with agreement to hold a conference in northern Iraq within a month to determine its membership and leadership structure—president, prime minister, or executive council.69 A week later, Garner held a press conference in which he was brimming with optimism               "
"69","Five opposition leaders have begun having meetings and are going to bring in leaders from the inside of Iraq and see if that can't form a nucleus of leadership as we enter into June. Next week, or by the second weekend in May, you'll see the beginning of a nucleus of a temporary Iraqi government, a government with an Iraqi face on it that is totally dealing with the coalition.70"
"70","[H]opeful. People were optimistic, and it was a time when optimism was not in short supply. You could move around the city pretty easily, there wasn't the level of violence that would come later, it was a different environment. Which validated the need to do this quickly, because eventually there was going to be a challenging period. Everybody knew that.71"
"71","Jay was moving out on that exactly as he was directed to. We were having regular videoconferences back to the interagency basically every night or every other night, and we were getting guidance… it was not like we were making this stuff up, we had Zal and Ryan—two future Ambassadors to Iraq—who were driving this thing. This was not like Jay and me and five other people figuring it out on our own.72"
"72","Contrary to later reports that Garner was fired as the situation spiraled out of control, it had always been the intention to replace Garner with a diplomat once the IIA process had become established. The timeline for deploying Garner's replacement was indeed brought forward, but this was a measure of the success Garner had had in his meetings with Iraqi leaders. Lawrence Di Rita told me that “it was happening fast. And so if the politics was coming together, we had to get the politics team out there …. The IIA was coming together, we had the conferences, and there was the clear desire by the Iraqis to get us out of the way, or at least have us play our proper role.”75"
"73","Several options were considered for Garner's replacement. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz suggested himself. Rumsfeld mused on the possibility of taking direct charge. In early May 2003, Ambassador L. Paul (“Jerry”) Bremer III was contacted. Bremer had over 20 years service in the State Department, serving in special assistant or executive assistant positions for six Secretaries of State. During the 1980s, he had been Ambassador to the Netherlands, and then Ambassador at Large for Counter‐Terrorism. He then worked out of government at Henry Kissinger's consulting firm, and at the time he was contacted, was chairman and CEO of Marsh Crisis Consulting.76"
"74","Bremer was considered acceptable to both State and Defense, a factor which weighed in his favor.77 Lawrence Wilkerson, Chief of Staff to Colin Powell, recalls that “we all knew that Jerry was a workaholic, talented, mostly tending towards diplomacy … and Powell thought whew, my God, I can work with Jerry.”78 In the media, Bremer's appointment was portrayed as a victory for the State Department over Defense.79 But Rumsfeld was also impressed, as he wrote in a memo to Chief of Staff Andy Card: “I had a good talk with him. I like him. I think he is the man.”80"
"75","The idea was for Bremer to be a civil administrator, making decisions on the ground and overseeing those aspects of Iraqi governance not transferred to the Iraqi Interim Authority, while Zalmay Khalilzad would act as liaison to the new IIA. Both would be presidential envoys, subordinate to Tommy Franks's replacement as head of CENTCOM."
"76","After Bremer agreed to take the job, there was a frantic period of only 10 days in which to bring him up to speed. Much of that time was spent at the Pentagon, where Bremer was briefed on the specifics of the IIA mechanism, Garner's progress in implementing it, and the underlying spirit of transferring ministries to full Iraqi control as soon as possible. Bremer was attentive and seemed, to Douglas Feith, to have “received it all most collegially. As far as we knew, he agreed with the policy and intended to put the IIA into practice.”81"
"77","Feith was mistaken. When Bremer was first contacted, he explained to his wife that he was being “considered for the job of running the occupation of Iraq.”82 Bremer did not want to replace Garner, and asked that the role be elevated in stature. He was allowed to replace Franks as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, a job that reported directly to Rumsfeld.83 This was a significant change, as it split the civil and military chain of command for U.S. operations in Iraq. Franks' replacement, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, would set up his own headquarters in Iraq and control the coalition armed forces but would not be the ultimate U.S. authority in the country on non‐military matters.         "
"78","Bremer insisted that he be the President's sole envoy, and that Zalmay Khalilzad's deployment be cancelled. “I put it very directly to the president: you can't have two presidential envoys running around Iraq.” The President agreed to this over lunch (a consequential dining encounter, as explained below), leaving Khalilzad stunned: “We had cleared both announcements, with Bremer to run things and me to convene the loya jirga [a meeting of Iraqis to finalize the composition of the IIA], both as presidential envoys. We were just playing with a few final words. Then the game plan suddenly changed: we would run the country ourselves.”84 In fairness to Bremer, the lunch with Bush was not the first time he had made this argument: he stressed it during his first meeting with Rumsfeld on 24 April, and Rumsfeld recorded his agreement in a memo to Chief of Staff Andy Card.85"
"79","Bremer, by his own admission an expert neither in Iraqi politics and society nor postwar reconstruction generally, turned out to have strong views on how both should proceed. Perhaps as a result of his State Department career, Bremer was leery of handing over power to the Iraqis too soon and was keen to establish a comprehensive constitutional and political structure, and hold elections, before doing so. He forwarded a RAND Corporation study on postwar governance to Secretary Rumsfeld with his summary of its lessons: “[s]taying a long time does not guarantee success. Leaving early assures failure.” Bremer quoted with approval a line in the study that “No effort at democratization has taken hold in less than five years.”86"
"80","When he heard on his car radio that Garner expected an Iraqi Interim Authority to be ready to go by 15 May, he “almost drove off the George Washington Parkway.” Bremer concluded that “it would take careful work to disabuse both the Iraqi and American proponents of this reckless fantasy.”87 Bremer's “reckless fantasy” was, at that point, the postwar plan of the U.S. government.         "
"81","U.S. policy now became dangerously ambiguous. Bremer did not return to Feith or his other briefers to seek clarification of the IIA concept or to ask for a reconsideration. Instead, he talked directly to the President in a one‐on‐one lunch meeting on 6 May. Bremer said to the President that it would take time for Iraq to attain a “stable political structure.”88 According to Bremer, the President responded that he was “fully committed to bringing representative government to Iraq … we'll stay until the job is done.” Further, Bremer asserted that he should be able to exercise broad authority in responding to what would be a very fluid situation. Bush agreed, and told Bremer to “get over there, and give us your recommendations.”89"
"82","After the lunch, the President ushered Bremer into a meeting with the principals saying, “I don't know whether we need this meeting after all. Jerry and I have just had it.” This was music to the Ambassador's ears: “His message was clear. I was neither Rumsfeld's man nor Powell's man. I was the President's man.”90 Bremer took these presidential remarks—clubbable, insouciant, and vague—as indicating that the IIA was no longer set policy, but instead one option that he could follow once he got to Iraq, based upon his personal reading of the situation.         "
"83","On arrival in Baghdad on 11 May, Bremer hit the brakes hard on Garner's work with Iraqi leaders. Garner had scheduled him to meet the core leadership group the day after his arrival. As Garner recounts it, Bremer said, “I'm not sure that meeting will ever take place.” Garner responded that “you've got to speak to these people,” and Bremer ended the conversation with “I told you I'm not sure that meeting will ever take place. And if it does take place, I don't think it's going to occur when you said it would.”91 Bremer “wanted to signal to the Iraqi political leaders that I was not in a hurry to see them … I wanted to show everybody that I, not Jay, was now in charge.”92"
"84","On 16 May, Bremer saw the Iraqis, but his message was not encouraging: “You people don't represent this country,” he informed them, “and you're now going to have to broaden yourselves if you want to be considered the basis of a transitional government.”93 The Iraqis “squirmed” a little in their seats, but Bremer was “exerting the authority President Bush had given me, ‘putting down the hammer.”’94 Garner interpreted Bremer as saying to these Iraqis “You're not the government; we're the government. You're not needed and you can go home. And the next morning they all left Baghdad.”95"
"85","Ali Allawi later wrote that Bremer's arrival “came as a thunderbolt out of the blue to the assembled leaders in Baghdad, and was greeted with indignation by most of the main political figures. Uncertainty reigned, while there was dark talk about the imposition of a colonial regime. Many Iraqi leaders felt that the USA had been duplicitous in its negotiations.”96 Lawrence Di Rita, who had been at the center of Garner's efforts to stand up the IIA, roomed with Bremer during the Ambassador's first days in Iraq. “What was obvious to me from the start was this was a guy who knows he has a lot of authority, and fully intends to exercise it.”97"
"86","Bremer created not an Iraqi Interim Authority, but an “Iraqi Governing Council” (IGC). According to Douglas Feith, Bremer downplayed the magnitude of the policy shift in his reporting to Washington: His IGC would “begin a process that ‘leads to representative government.’ He did not explain, however, that it would have no independent power and would be subordinate to him on all matters …. My office, which wrote the IIA plan, therefore interpreted Bremer's statements as consistent [with it]. We recommended that Rumsfeld approve Bremer's approach. He did so.”98"
"87","The IGC would exercise not direct control over certain ministries with a sequential, quick handover of others, but would have only a limited consultative and advisory role. To govern the country, Bremer turned the Coalition Provisional Authority into a full‐blown executive/administrative body, ruling by decree over all aspects of civil governance. His own role, then, became akin to that of MacArthur in Japan: “My new assignment did combine some of the vice regal responsibilities of [] MacArthur,” he told an aide, but “I'd settle for MacArthur's problems. Conditions weren't this complicated for him.”99"
"88","In an interview with The Washington Post, Bremer was forthright as to how he saw his role: “As long as we're here, we are the occupying power. It's a very ugly word, but it's true.” Slowing down the process of forming an Iraqi government was in line with the MacArthur precedent: “We are actually, in most areas, going faster than was the case in Germany and Japan … talking about when elections might be held and starting the constitutional process.”100 A senior official who served at the time told me that as a result, Bremer ended up pursuing exactly the course that had been least favored during interagency planning: “CPA kind of becomes MacArthur. CPA becomes the thing that nobody wanted.”101"
"89","L. Paul Bremer, in his memoir and interviews, has not acknowledged the IIA policy by name, nor has he referred to the underlying governance concept: that an Iraqi government would have sovereignty over a limited number of ministries at first, and take sequential control over others as the parallel coalition structure divested itself of them. Bremer has, though, spoken about why he halted Jay Garner's work with Iraqi leaders."
"90","Bremer interpreted the policy of rapidly standing up a semi‐sovereign Interim Iraqi Authority as being essentially identical to the provisional government idea discussed and rejected by the interagency process. In justifying abandoning the IIA, Bremer deployed the obvious arguments against not that concept, but against a full provisional government:            "
"91","There was no way there was going to be an early Iraqi government. It simply was not possible. Anybody who thought it was possible obviously wasn't sitting here on the ground looking at a city on fire, with a difficult security situation; a country with no experience in democratic elections for 50 years. There was not about to be a provisional government. This was obvious to anybody with eyes.102"
"92","He further believes that in the 8 May Principals committee meeting following that lunch, he received instructions from the cabinet that authorized his approach. His memoir reproduced his notes of the meeting. According to Bremer, the President said an Iraqi government was “not going to happen overnight, despite what exile leaders hope or even believe.” Powell told him to “get a representative group …. We should let Iraqi leaders emerge”; the Vice President said, “We need a strategy on the ground for the postwar situation we actually have and not the one we wish we had.”104 At the same meeting, Rumsfeld, who saw each side of every argument to a chronic degree, expressed his view that it would be a mistake to anoint the exiles.105"
"93","Douglas Feith acknowledges that there was some ambiguity in the guidance Bremer received on this crucial occasion. Zalmay Khalilzad had been asked by Rumsfeld to circulate a paper reflecting Rumsfeld's worries that the IIA was moving forward too quickly. Feith's memoir notes that “Khalilzad's paper reopened basic questions” about the timetable for the IIA and the extent of its powers. Combined with the President's remarks beforehand, Feith concedes, “It is perhaps understandable that Bremer later felt free to treat the IIA not as a presidentially approved plan but as a mere policy option.”106"
"94","Moreover, Rumsfeld's written instructions to Bremer contained more than a little ambiguity on the issue. In his memoir, Rumsfeld highlights the following passage:            "
"95","In staffing ministries and positioning Iraqis in ways that will increase their influence, the Coalition will work to have acceptable Iraqis involved as early as possible, so Iraqi voices can explain the goals and direction to the Iraqi people. Only if Iraqis are seen as being engaged in, responsible for, and explaining and leading their fellow citizens will broad public support develop that is essential for security.107"
"96","If Bremer had said, “I knew what I knew, I heard this, I considered it ambiguous, but I think I interpreted it right,” I would have no disagreement with him. But instead, what he said is “I got completely clear guidance.” And he didn't. What he did was he basically get fuzzy guidance that he chose to interpret as—amazingly enough—completely in favor of what he was predisposed to do. And that's my objection to Bremer—claiming that things were clear that were not clear. What I think he should have done is recognize that there were ambiguities and he should have sought clarification, instead of going with it, and running with it, and saying “I have got clear guidance from the President.” He should have gone back to Rumsfeld and said “things are not that clear on this point and that point, and I'd like guidance,” and he didn't do that.109"
"97","Third, Bremer felt that issues of legitimacy and broad representation, including having a fully elected government in place before basic constitutional questions were settled, were vital. Empowering an IIA quickly, Bremer felt, would deprive the United States of the opportunity to direct this process. Lawrence Di Rita explained that            "
"98","[W]hat we [Garner's team] were focused on was how fast can we do this and how credible will it be. But it was a legitimate debate. Jerry came in, and concluded that legitimacy was important, and that's going to slow us down. Our view was it just has to be good enough. They have to figure it out, it just has to be good enough to get them off to a start. They need basically to map a process that they can then sell to their own people, about how they are going to create a government. As opposed to us creating a process for them. And what eventually ended up happening was Jerry felt that it was the CPA's responsibility to map that process out. The IIA concept was find the right people, and they will create a process.110"
"99","To the first point, readers of Bremer's memoir are indeed struck by the Ambassador's determination to, in his words, put on his “desert boots … to start kicking some butt.”111 The analogies foremost in his mind were those of the occupations of Germany and Japan.112 Rumsfeld later read these sections of the memoir with interest: “I had no idea that he would see himself this way. It certainly was not a mindset that was conducive to working with proud and wary Iraqis or with the large American military contingent in the country.”113"
"100","The core of the problem, according to Feith, was that Bremer was from outside the government and had not been involved in the prewar planning debates:            "
"101","He came in with various ideas, thoughts and preconceptions that effectively set aside all of the administration's months‐long debate. So we really didn't have a meeting of the minds. Had he been part of that debate for all those months, and if he saw the urgency of putting the Iraqis in charge of their own affairs, and saw the dangers we believed would result from setting ourselves up as an occupying force, he might have adopted a different approach. When the President said “do it as quickly as possible,” Bremer might have understood that that meant quickly! Instead, he came into his job unfamiliar with that debate, and he heard “as quickly as possible” from the President, and his inclination was to do whatever he wanted to do anyway, and have as much autonomy as possible, and not have a boss. So he interpreted “as quickly as possible” as “do whatever you want.”114"
"102","The key issue concerning post‐Saddam governance in Iraq is not, as is commonly stated, why was there no postwar planning? As Feith put it to me, there was no plan for the problems that arose during the CPA occupation, because “we weren't planning to run an occupation.”116 Instead, the question is why did the United States government fail to implement the planning it had conducted and, specifically, bring into being the Iraqi Interim Authority endorsed by the President? As is often the case in foreign policy, this was a result of the interplay of personality and process at the top levels of government.         "
"103","The President, of course, could insist upon any plan he wished. His conflicting beliefs—no nation‐building combined with a commitment to the democratization of Iraq—did not offer a clear roadmap for choice as concepts were presented to him. At a crucial moment, his approach to interpersonal relations—not pushing Bremer and seeking to bolster the Ambassador's confidence at the critical 8 May lunch—gave Bremer a sense of having the Commander‐in‐Chief's backing to decide the policy on his own once he arrived in Iraq. As Rumsfeld put it, “Bush, at least in my presence, never wavered in his desire to turn power over to the Iraqis as quickly as possible. Then again, he never firmly resisted the State Department's efforts to slow the timeline either. This ambiguity may have been just enough for Bremer to decide he had Bush's support for delay.”117"
"104","Similarly, Rumsfeld's assumptions were important. As with the President, the Secretary of Defense held contradictory beliefs about the issue of postwar governance. He abhorred the prospect of the United States engaging in nation‐building, but was also uneasy about setting up a provisional government of exiles. His style of decision making was a factor: Rumsfeld refused to give the Deputies Committee authority to decide and implement policy, reserving decisions for the principals. However, when the decision was addressed at the principals' level, he vacillated on the issue of a quick transfer of sovereignty, with his most‐skeptical contributions to the idea coming at precisely the point at which Bremer was being briefed that a quick transfer was U.S. policy. Soon after Bremer began work in Iraq, Rumsfeld returned to advocating a rapid transition.118"
"105","Although Rumsfeld's memoir presents him as being consistently and decisively in favor of a rapid transition, there is evidence that he was less than constant on the issue.119 Condoleezza Rice found Rumsfeld's vacillations to be a major part of the problem: “Did Don want Jerry to have all executive, legislative, and judicial functions or not? … Defense wouldn't or couldn't reconcile Doug Feith's Iraqi Interim Authority and Jerry's CPA within its own building.”120"
"106","Indeed, Rumsfeld himself acknowledges that his style caused difficulties: “Contrary to popular perception, I was not inclined to issue direct, detailed, not‐to‐be‐questioned orders to those who work for me. I have found that people at senior levels generally do better when given broad guidelines and the leeway to exercise their judgment as changing circumstances arise. In Bremer's case, he had too much leeway.”121"
"107","In these ambiguous circumstances, the personal approach of the agent of the government—L. Paul Bremer—would go a long way to determining what happened on the ground. Jay Garner had agreed with the policy and moved smartly toward its implementation. But Bremer turned out to have strong beliefs on key questions of post‐conflict governance. Returning exiles, he believed, were inherently illegitimate and unrepresentative of Iraqis. Further, Bremer believed that an occupying power should exert a strong guiding hand on constitution making, which itself should precede elections. His model was not Afghanistan—which was the implicit precedent for the IIA—but rather General Douglas MacArthur's total and lengthy control of Japanese politics after the Second World War. Bremer's beliefs were matched by a hard‐charging, take‐control executive style that led him to seek the maximum autonomy from both the interagency process in Washington and the Iraqi leaders who believed they were weeks away from forming a sovereign government."
"108","Personalities and beliefs, then, are a necessary part of the explanation for why the U.S. government failed to implement its plan for postwar Iraq. But they are not sufficient. The decision‐making process also mattered. As noted above, the emasculation of the Deputies Committee made it difficult for that body to play its usual central role in policy formulation and implementation; this added to the burden on an already‐stretched principals committee. However, the crucial interaction with Ambassador Bremer came not in any regular interagency forum, but in a private lunch with the President. Lawrence Di Rita stressed to me how important this was:            "
"109","My impression is that Jerry relied on his personal relationship with the President, and I don't doubt the President said the things that Jerry says that he says: use your best judgment and those sorts of things. The history of foreign policy is written in part by those sorts of communications, so it's not shocking to me that a President's communication to an envoy, that envoy would see as guidance. But I doubt that the President would have intended that by virtue of a comment he was undoing policy decisions that had been taken by the apparatus of the government. But that appears to be what happened. In other words, we spent a lot of time—we the government—creating the IIA process, it's documented and promulgated through a written directive of the President. That's how things are supposed to work. Presidents shouldn't be placed in the position of being seen as giving separate guidance outside of an agency process.122"
"110","The National Security Act of 1947 created the National Security Council staff, based in the White House and headed by an individual of the President's choice not requiring Senate confirmation, precisely for the purpose of helping the President make, document, and enforce foreign policy decisions. Without wading into the debate on Condoleezza Rice's performance as National Security Adviser, the blunt fact is that in this case, ambiguous guidance delivered in ad hoc meetings replaced carefully documented deliberations involving the principals."
"111","Senior Bush administration officials stressed to me in interviews the problems inherent in this approach. As John Bolton put it, “Bremer's … got a very definite view of what he thinks his marching orders were, he highlights some ambiguities in Washington. Feith has a very definite view of what he thinks his marching orders were. And they are completely contradictory.”"
"112","The NSC process should have resolved these differences, Bolton continues:            "
"113","So, is it Feith's fault? Is it Bremer's fault? It's not their fault. They were senior officials, but below the cabinet, and certainly below the President. So if they are marching in different directions, you can't blame it on them, you have to blame it on somebody above them …. Now, you can't just blame Condi Rice for that—the buck stops on the President's desk. But I think those two books—the Bremer and the Feith book—show just how much of an ambiguity there was emanating from the White House.124"
"114","President Bush was not inclined to see Dr Rice as the leader in the interagency. President Bush wanted Dr Rice first and foremost to be his personal adviser. And so you had the makings of a bad situation, because President Bush would make decisions, but would not require agencies to carry them out. So there is no question but that the system can work, but it requires a President who is engaged, and who is prepared to push the agencies to do what he says.125"
"115","It does indeed seem odd, in retrospect, to have selected Bremer for this crucial role. He had been out of government for several years, and as James Dobbins notes, neither the President nor most of the principals had met him prior to his selection. As Ali Allawi put it, “The recruitment process for the leadership of a country of over 25 million people would not have passed muster with even the most indifferent of corporate headhunters.”126"
"116","While, then, the old charge of having conducted no postwar planning is no longer sustainable, this revision does not vindicate the Bush administration, which failed to properly brief and to vet the agent charged with implementing a crucial aspect of its key foreign policy initiative, and so found itself in the position of failing to implement its own policy decision. Getting the story straight by moving past the myths to an understanding of what really happened in postwar Iraq planning is only the first step in ensuring that future post‐conflict situations are more effectively managed."
