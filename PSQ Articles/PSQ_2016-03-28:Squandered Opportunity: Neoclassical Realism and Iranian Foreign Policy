"1","The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long‐standing ambition of becoming the dominant power in the Persian Gulf and an influential player in the Middle East. Yet as of 2015, Iran has largely failed to realize its regional ambitions. How exactly did Iran get to this point?"
"2","In Squandered Opportunity, Thomas Juneau offers a sophisticated analysis of Iranian foreign policy from 2001 to 2009. Juneau writes, “As a rising power faced with a window of opportunity and surrounded by hostile states—especially in Tehran's view, the hegemony‐seeking United States—Iran should behave like an offensive realist” (p. 2). Instead, the nature of Iranian economic and military capabilities, combined with the Islamic Republic's domestic pathologies, led Iran to pursue suboptimal foreign policies. Juneau develops a “strategic analysis variant” of neoclassical realism to explain the causes and consequences of Iranian policies in three key areas: its nuclear program, the conflict between the Shiite Arab majority and the Sunni Arab minority in Iraq, and the Arab–Israeli conflict.         "
"3","According to Juneau, Iran faced a favorable strategic environment following the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan (October 2001) and Iraq (March–April 2003), along with the inflow of hard currency resulting from higher oil prices. Iran failed to exploit this window, however, because of a mismatch between its capabilities and its intentions. Three domestic intervening variables—status aspirations; factional politics among hard‐liners, traditional conservatives, and moderates in the Iranian leadership; and regime identity (a composite of Shiite Islam, Persian nationalism, and rejection of U.S. hegemony)—filtered Iranian leaders' assessments of the international environment and narrowed the range of acceptable policy options."
"4","A significant portion of Iran's power arises from unconventional elements, such asymmetric military capabilities, the appeal of Iran's rejectionist model, and alliances with nonstate actors such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and various Shiite militias in Iraq. Meanwhile, Iranian “hard” power, namely, its economy and conventional military capabilities, have stagnated. Juneau contends that “because Tehran has maximized certain elements of power, such as unconventional military assets, at the expense of conventional ones, such as military power projection capabilities, it has tended to gradually box itself into a corner by accumulating a narrow band of power that restricts the influence it can achieve” (p. 55)."
"5","Squandered Opportunity is a welcome addition to the neoclassical realist literature and to the growing number of books on grand strategic adjustment by regional powers. The book's strongest parts are Juneau's analysis of the components of Iranian capabilities (pp. 55–80) and the interplay of perceived status immobility (pp. 81–86) and factional politics (pp. 92–103) in Iranian foreign policy debates.         "
"6","Nonetheless, the book has some weaknesses. For example, the size and the duration of the window of opportunity that Iran faced are unclear. I am not persuaded that Tehran's pursuit of latent nuclear capability is “suboptimal,” despite economic sanctions and the potential risk of Israeli or U.S. air strikes. Structural realists expect Iran to pursue a nuclear capability as a strategic deterrent against the United States and Israel, a point that Juneau acknowledges (pp. 180–181). Likewise, Iran's strategy of backing Iraqi Shiite Arab militia and political parties (notably the Hizb al‐Da'wa of former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al‐Maliki) was not necessarily suboptimal, which Juneau also acknowledges. In the concluding chapter, Juneau observes, “The Islamic Republic … favors tactics over strategy, preferring to make short‐term gains and punting down the road the acknowledgment the longer‐term costs are mounting” (p. 204). Ironically, one could make the same observation about the United States and Israel."
