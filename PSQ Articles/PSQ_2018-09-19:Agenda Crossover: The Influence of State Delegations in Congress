"1","“Academics spend too much time talking about parties and not enough time understanding states” (p. 1). This statement by a member of Congress highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between national legislators who represent the same state. These connections between members of state delegations increasingly have important policy and electoral consequences."
"2","In Agenda Crossover, Sarah A. Treul explores how the relationships among state delegations in Congress can help members represent their constituencies and win reelection. Each member of Congress constructs his or her own issue agenda, defined as a set of issues on which the member sponsors legislation in order to promote the good of the country, the member's political party, and the member's constituency. These issue agendas help legislators send signals about legislative priorities and establish a reputation with constituents, other members of Congress, and observers of the legislative process.         "
"3","State delegations aid legislators in deciding on which issues to focus their agendas. Members of state delegations assist each other in understanding their constituencies and can provide knowledge about what issues will aid in reelection."
"4","Yet because members of the House of Representatives and the Senate face different incentives when forming their issue agendas, members from the two chambers use their delegations in different ways. Ambitious members of the House who seek higher office look to the issue agendas of same‐state senators as a model for their own legislative priorities; by modeling their issue agendas on those of successful same‐party senators of their delegation, members of the House can set themselves up for a successful future run for the Senate. In turn, senators use representatives for knowledge about the varying wishes of constituents across the state. Specifically, senators use same‐state representatives as legislative scouts who can determine what issues are important and increase their general election vote in the next election."
"5","Although Agenda Crossover draws attention to underappreciated dynamics among members of state delegations across party and chamber lines, the book leaves the reader with two unanswered questions. First, it is unclear whether the patterns in issue agendas that Treul observes are actually a result of state delegation interactions specifically or whether they are a result of legislators who serve similar constituencies. If one examined the issue agendas from a group of representatives and senators from districts and states with similar partisan, demographic, and economic makeups, would one find similar results? Put another way, the reader is left wondering whether there is something unique about state delegations aside from a shared constituency.         "
"6","Second, Treul's compelling theoretical story about senators using members of the House as legislative scouts eclipses her explanation about how members of the House use same‐state senators. A richer development of how representatives interact with each other and members of the Senate would provide even more insight into relationships between members of a state delegation and, ultimately, further our understanding of the legislative process."
"7","Overall, Agenda Crossover is a unique book that encourages the reader the think about how legislators work together across party and chamber lines to advance specific issue agendas. Institutional and legislative scholars will find that the book pushes them to evaluate the influence that state delegations have on representation. Put simply, Treul's research has broad implications for congressional research.         "
