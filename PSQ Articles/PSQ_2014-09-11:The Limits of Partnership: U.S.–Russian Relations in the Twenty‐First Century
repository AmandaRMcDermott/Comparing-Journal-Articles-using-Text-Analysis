"1","U.S. relations with Russia remain tense and difficult to understand. Since the end of the Cold War, the two nations have made several attempts to put their relations on a stable footing, each time discovering major differences in perceptions, worldviews, and interests. The two countries contribute greatly to shaping the world from Europe to Eurasia and the Middle East. Yet, despite the significance of these two nations, there are few studies available that systematically assess the nature and dynamics of their relationships."
"2","Angela Stent's book seeks to fill this gap. The author identifies several cycles in U.S.–Russia relations, from George H.W. Bush's attempt to strengthen ties with Russian leadership to Bill Clinton's engagement with Boris Yeltsin to George W. Bush's relations with Vladimir Putin and, finally, to Barak Obama's ties with Dmitri Medvedev. Each time, expectations were high on both sides, and each time, the relationships soured and ended at a low point."
"3","According to the book, what accounts for these cycles of rise and decline is the U.S. and Russia's different worldviews, unrealistic expectations, and wrong perceptions of each other's intentions. While Moscow wanted to build a strategic partnership with the United States on principles of sovereignty and equality, Washington aimed at having Russia as a junior partner supportive of America's global values and interests. The Kremlin insisted on the legitimacy of its interests and principles even from a position of weakness, but the White House failed to acknowledge those interests and principles to the extent that Russia expected. Each time, Stent argues, the United States either did not understand Russia's claims to equality and respect or found those claims to be unreasonable."
"4","On the recommendations side, the book cautions against unrealistic expectations and advocates building a selective or limited partnership with Russia. Stent recognizes the importance of the countries' relations and acknowledges that Russia will remain essential for addressing vital issues, including nuclear proliferation and arms control, and regional stability in Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East. However, she finds it impossible to move beyond the limited partnership, given the two countries' differences in political systems, perceptions, and worldviews."
"5","The book is based on interviews with American and Russian officials and experts and the author's long experience of closely observing the two countries' relations, including as a policy maker and participant in expert forums. The book's strengths include clarity of presentation, attention to important details, knowledge of specific relevant contexts, and logical organization of material. It is written for pundits, policymakers, and the general public, rather than for academics."
"6","The latter may be disappointed to see no serious effort to review existing academic sources on U.S. and Russian foreign relations, to address alternative approaches, or sharpen the book's theory through a rigorous research design. The four cases/cycles of U.S.–Russian relations are treated descriptively and without any effort to draw comparative observations for studying other countries and international relations in general. Beyond occasional references to realists and critics of Realpolitik, there is no analysis of different schools and approaches to the two countries' relations."
"7","The criticism notwithstanding, this is a solid and balanced narrative of the two countries' relations. The book will be suitable for graduate courses on U.S. and Russian foreign relations."
