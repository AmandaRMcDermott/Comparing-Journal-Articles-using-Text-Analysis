"1","This book is a recent addition to the growing literature on cyberwar, cyberconflict, and cyberdeterrence. Its major claim is that it seeks to provide “a distinctive strategic vision for cyberdeterrence to restrain foreign‐based cyberattacks,” contrasting a “traditional, narrow, direct deterrence (such as Cold War nuclear deterrence) . . . with a broader, more inclusive cyberdeterrence designed to alter the cyberattacker's decision calculus” through “a fluid, integrated mix of strategies that is sensitive to differing circumstances” (p. 1)."
"2","A worthy goal indeed. But Optimizing Cyberdeterrence was published in 2017, and the idea that nuclear deterrence is a poor model for cyberdeterrence is pretty old. Indeed, the author quotes a 2010 article by former deputy secretary of defense William Lynn that says, “Cold War deterrence models of assured retaliation do not apply to cyberspace” (p. 4). So that cannot be the book's primary contribution.         "
"3","Is it new to talk about “a more inclusive cyberdeterrence designed to alter the cyberattacker's decision calculus” through a “fluid, integrated mix of strategies that is sensitive to differing circumstances”? No, M. Elaine Bunn in 2007 took note of a George W. Bush administration shift “from a one‐size‐fits‐all notion of deterrence toward more adaptable approaches [that is, tailored deterrence] suitable for advanced military competitors, regional weapons of mass destruction states, as well as nonstate terrorist networks” (“Can Deterrence be Tailored?,” Strategic Forum, no 225 [January 2007]). She further noted that tailoring was necessary with respect to specific actors and specific situations, specific capabilities, and specific communications. So the idea that a mix of strategies that is sensitive to differing circumstances is not new either.         "
"4","Perhaps the contribution is some specific mix of strategies that will improve cyberdeterrence. Here, Optimizing Cyberdeterrence is a bit more promising—Chapter 6 is devoted to connecting specific sets of circumstances to different cyberdeterrence strategies that are likely to be most effective under those circumstances. The problem, though, is that in the author's rendition, the sets of circumstances overlap as do the preferred strategies. For example, he contrasts circumstances in which private and public initiatives are most vital to circumstances in which broad inclusive cyberdeterrence is most vital. But the latter may well include the former, and thus the distinction between these two strategies is muddied.         "
"5","The book does have significant value in its historical case studies of cyberattack. Each of the dozen cases included covers the description, attribution, and security impact of each and how it might have been prevented. Even better, each of the cases is indeed a consequential one and worthy of such analysis. Nevertheless, the book is disappointing at a number of levels."
"6","The author seems to buy an all‐too‐common notion that cyberdeterrence is something that happens exclusively in cyberspace, as though the computer and communications systems in question are separate from the rest of the physical world. He takes at face value a variety of common claims about cyberspace—that cyberattacks are indiscriminate or will redound to the detriment of the attacker (p. 59), that attribution is highly problematic (pp. 55–56), that the U.S. government sacrifices the security of global communications infrastructure to maximize capacity of intelligence to track and undermine adversaries (p. 41), and that rudimentary protections are insufficient to prevent cyberattack (p. 47). All of these claims contain elements of truth, but they must be qualified in any serious discussion of cyberdeterrence, and such nuance is absent from the author's treatment. To the extent that the book's audience is policymakers, its silence on organizational or legal matters is troublesome—the differences among military, law enforcement, and intelligence interests in cyberdeterrence of foreign cyberattacks are deep and profound, and they constrain what and how policy can change."
"7","Lastly, the book is curiously immodest. Its intended audience is both experts and novices interested in “understanding the security opportunities, limitations, and tradeoffs surrounding foreign cyberdeterrence,” and the book claims to offer “specific feasible solutions” with the needs of practitioners specifically in mind. Alas, the “specific feasible solutions” are presented as lists of things that nations should be doing instead of what they are doing now. That is a useful first step, but the book stumbles on the second step, as it says virtually nothing about how any of these things are to be accomplished. The introduction quite properly notes “the wisdom of humility and caution regarding anyone's recommended proposed policy improvements,” and yet the book “does not allow this tentativeness to interfere with [the book's] quest to improve concerted, coherent, well‐integrated cyberdeterrence” (pp. 10–11). It is almost as if the book were written to contain its own promotional material."
"8","As for a more useful treatment of the topic, readers might instead consult Joseph S. Nye Jr.'s article “Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace” (International Security 41 [Winter 2016–2017]: 44–71), which in this reviewer's opinion represents the current state‐of‐the‐art thinking about cyberdeterrence and presents a number of excellent points of departure for future research. (In fairness, Nye's article appeared in print after it would have been possible to make changes in the book manuscript.)         "
