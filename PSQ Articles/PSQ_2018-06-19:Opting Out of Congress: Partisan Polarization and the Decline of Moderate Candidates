"1","For the past decade, political scientists have raised concerns about the partisan polarization that has gripped our Congress. While we know what has happened, we still know little about why polarization has increased and persisted. Many researchers have focused on election laws, such as those that pertain to campaign finance, primary elections, and the drawing of congressional districts. Yet, as Danielle M. Thomsen notes in Opting Out of Congress, it seems unlikely that changes in election laws have had more than a minor effect on polarization. Thomsen trains her attention, instead, on the supply of candidates. Moderates no longer want to run for Congress, and those who are in Congress do not want to stay. Their decisions have a snowball effect—the fewer moderates there are in Congress, the less appealing Congress becomes for centrists.         "
"2","Thomsen makes her case by presenting a theory of “party fit.” The value of legislative offices varies according to one's ideological conformity to the rest of the party. Party fit determines whether one can achieve policy goals, advance within the chamber, and simply enjoy the experience of serving in Congress. Thomsen quotes many current and former legislators reminiscing about the past and bemoaning the present. All of these comments serve to support the more quantitative explorations of the book."
"3","Most theories about candidate emergence, congressional retirement, and political ambition say little about ideology. Thus, Thomsen is forced to be creative in her data gathering. It is hard to know why people retire or choose not to run. For instance, moderates often represent more competitive districts, and they also may have more attractive opportunities outside of Congress. Despite the data limitations, all of the information Thomsen has gathered supports her basic point."
"4","One of the book's most intriguing chapters concerns women legislators. Particularly within the Republican Party, many of the most prominent centrists have been women. The hollowing out of the political center has created far more of a gender imbalance among Republican than among Democrats. This is important not only for reasons of gender equity but also because many students of gender and politics have contended that women have different legislative styles and political concerns. Although Thomsen's book is about the House of Representatives, not the Senate, one is reminded here of the role that moderate women of both parties have played in trying to broker bipartisan compromises over the past few years."
"5","Like most studies of polarization, Opting Out of Congress shows that the Republican Party is more to blame than Democrats. Part of the problem for both parties, however, is the lack of a clear understanding of what moderation is and why it should be valued. Political scientists tend to associate moderation with a lack of principles or, worse, with ignorance of how things are “supposed” to fit together. As the cliché goes, there's “nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.” Thomsen's book might profitably be paired with recent theoretical justifications of moderation such as Aurelian Craiutu's Faces of Moderation.         "
"6","Opting Out of Congress is essential reading for those who want a fresh look at understanding why moderate voices are so absent from our politics today. In order to solve the problems Thomsen has identified, we must do more to understand what moderation is and how we (even those of us who are not inclined toward centrism ourselves) can reward moderates who enter politics.
