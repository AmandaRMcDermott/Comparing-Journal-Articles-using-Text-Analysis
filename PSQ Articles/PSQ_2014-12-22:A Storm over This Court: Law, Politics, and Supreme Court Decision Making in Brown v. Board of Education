"1","At this 60th Anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, Jeffrey D. Hockett offers us a new interpretation of the dilemmas, debates, and deliberations that members of the Court engaged in on their way to this decision. Hockett challenges conceptualizations of the decision in Brown as emerging purely from any one set of motives and that it can be analyzed through only one theoretical or methodological lens. Instead, he argues through painstaking review of the discussions between the justices about the case and early drafts of opinions that different justices were swayed by different arguments, took into account different considerations, and made different compromises. In short: There was no “one” road to Brown v. Board—there were potentially as many paths as there were justices.         "
"2","Did the justices, as Bork argues in The Tempting of America: The Seduction of the Law, act on their own personal beliefs in Brown? Was Brown, as he claims, the beginning of judicial activism and the signal of a new Court, untethered to judicial prudence? Or did they act to defend the honor of the Court, seeing that public opinion was moving in the direction of racial integration and that this was the correct way to go regardless of their personal views? Did they, instead, act in accord with what their best understanding of the law allowed, clarifying a meaning, if not the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment for a modern world? Or, as critical race theorists have argued, were they more cynically looking to the larger political context, seeing their decision as something that spoke to the larger climate of the Cold War period, and in this way answering critics abroad and a President who desired to counter those critiques? Yes, says Hockett: they were doing all of these things. In any one decision, different members of the Court are acting on different motives and understandings of the law and the social context. No one theory of judicial decision making can illuminate this Supreme Court decision, as no one theory can probably explain any decision. When we insist on one interpretation of a decision, we do so for our own desire for theoretical elegance, but in the process, we lose a deeper understanding of the Supreme Court and how it functions.

"3","Chief Justice Earl Warren famously believed that Brown needed to be a unanimous decision. He argued, probably correctly, that any split decision would be undermined at the first opportunity and would never hold the authority to guide the tremendous action required to end school desegregation. A Supreme Court decision that was not followed would undermine the authority of the Court, and ultimately harm the entire American system of government. Big compromises were required in order to achieve this unanimity, and it is through the study of the deliberations and the compromises they produced that we can better understand the process of Supreme Court decision making. Hockett helps us see Brown through the eyes of the justices writing, discussing, and debating segregation in 1954, rather than through our modern eyes. Yes, ideas about racial segregation were indeed changing, but even among these nine justices, attitudes and beliefs were complicated and nuanced, and complex forces and ideas were at work in this decision.         "
"4","Hockett highlights how each of several theories of Supreme Court decision making—such as instrumentalism, attitudinalism, institutionalism—offers insights into Brown, but no one theory can explain the entire decision. In making his analysis, he provides a thoughtful and well‐researched study for students of the Supreme Court as well as for those interested in the history of the Brown decision and its aftermath.
