"1","In Japan, “3.11” was quickly declared a galvanizing crisis. The compound disaster of earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown, many held, would mark an indelible dividing line, reshape the country's political institutions, and define its historical epoch. Has that happened? No comprehensive answer is possible, but Richard Samuels provides an expert interim report on how Japan's “political entrepreneurs,” “elites,” and “chattering classes” (pp. x–xi), interpreted 3.11 and sought to translate its ostensible lessons into national policy. While this is not a work of ground‐level reportage or a study of regional reconstruction, it is clearly the product of a deep sympathy for the disaster's immediate victims and Japan as a whole."
"2","Samuels begins by describing the institutional responses that followed when “sudden devastation” was added to the “slow devastation” (p. x) wrought by years of economic downturn. Next, he presents his own analytical framework, and moves on to review the consequences of four of Japan's major earthquakes in modern times, other major disasters elsewhere, and the mixed evidence for the transformative potential of “disaster diplomacy.”"
"3","Samuels focuses on three major policy areas: security, energy, and local government. Japan's post‐disaster discourse, he argues, was structured around four motifs: change itself; the quality (or lack) of leadership; community; and risk or vulnerability. The result was the generation by stakeholders of a set of three “prescriptive narratives” (p. 26) deployed to justify or gain support for the particular course to be taken. The first called for the national leadership to “put it in gear”—to accelerate energetically out of dysfunction and stasis in a new direction. The second urged it to “stay the course,” while the third sought to leap “back to the future” of a simpler, innocent Japan. The real‐time interplay of policy areas, rhetorical tropes, and course prescriptions makes for a complex account, but it does help us to understand both the obvious and non‐obvious consequences of a no‐less‐complex event."
"4","Overall, Samuels finds, advocates of “staying the course” have predominated: their argument that 3.11 was a “black swan,” a case of the “unimaginable” (p. 123), has been sufficiently convincing that “change,” albeit sometimes of considerable significance, has tended to be incremental. In the security domain, “putting it in gear” would break (too far?) to the right, with an expanded military engaging actual enemies. So even though Japan's Self‐Defense Forces and the U.S.–Japan security alliance emerged from 3.11 with historically high levels of public support, this has not yet translated into higher budgets, let alone constitutional change. (Samuels was writing, however, prior to the July 2013 election that returned Abe Shinzō and his party to power.) In energy matters, by contrast, “putting it in gear” would tend left, away from the collusive “nuclear village” (p. 118) formed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and its government allies and toward renewable energy and local control. Hopes for such change remain very strong, but at the national level, they have not materialized. On the other hand, in local governance (which can tie more readily into energy than security policy), Samuels recognizes longstanding trends toward “horizontal solidarity” (p. 196) and political creativity, so that “staying the course” means continuing dynamism. Here, perhaps, and in the activities of civil society at many levels, is evidence of a real impetus toward greater transparency and democratic participation, toward a revival that would incorporate elements of his otherwise noncompetitive “simple life” narrative. Overall, as Samuels puts it, even after 3.11, “normal politics never gave way to crisis politics” (p. 199). Surely the point is not to hope for the next “unimaginable” crisis, but to redefine “normal” while there is still time."
