"1","In responding to Richard Neustadt's Presidential Power and the generation of scholarship on the presidency that followed its publication in 1960, students of what might be termed the “new paradigm” in the presidency studies literature sought to emphasize the tools that are at the president's disposal that allow for the exercise of unilateral executive power. Although works in this vein exhibit a considerable degree of nuance, the main takeaway is clear: the president often holds a significant first‐mover advantage over the coordinate departments and can act to implement policy “with the stroke of a pen.”         "
"2","Michelle Belco and Brandon Rottinghaus seek to qualify this view to some extent in their new book. Instead of treating executive orders and proclamations as undifferentiated units that only offer evidence of presidents pursuing their own policy goals, as is done in much of the literature on presidential power, Belco and Rottinghaus make the crucial distinction between orders that see the president taking on more of an administrative role (routine orders) and those in which the chief executive acts as an independent (command orders). In normative terms, much is at stake here, as the dominant theoretical understanding of executive unilateralism leaves little room for power sharing with Congress. Consequently, worries of an imperial presidency loom large in this arena."
"3","The evidence presented in this book supports a slightly different take on presidents’ use of both executive orders and proclamations. While Belco and Rottinghaus do not fundamentally challenge the view that presidents can, at times, issue orders in the pursuit of their own agenda, they argue that presidents also act as administrators by executing the laws that Congress passes in ways that are consistent with a system of shared powers."
"4","Using content analysis of unilateral action by the president—primarily over the period from 1974 to 2009—Belco and Rottinghaus show that routine orders are commonplace, as are orders that are issued in support of actions taken by Congress. Looking across six administrations, they also find that presidents issue more executive orders that implement the laws passed by the legislature in their role as administrators than they do those that adapt or augment the will of Congress. Taken together, the picture that emerges from this investigation is one in which presidents both complement the work of the legislative branch and, at times, exercise command. Belco and Rottinghaus also test a number of hypotheses relating to the conditions under which presidents function as administrators rather than as wholly independent actors. Often, the findings that emerge from these tests run counter to expectation and help develop a perspective on the unilateral president that sees the office taking a back seat to Congress far more often than neoinstitutionalist perspectives would seem to suggest."
"5","In challenging the view that unilateral action always entails the furtherance of the chief executive's policy preferences at the expense of other actors, Belco and Rottinghaus have set forth an ambitious agenda for the field. The content of executive orders and proclamations matter, and it is no longer acceptable to treat them all as if they were solely reflections of the president's agenda. With the rise of methods for extracting usable data from bodies of text, however, the tools now exist that make it possible to go beyond the gross distinction between routine and command orders, and I fully expect future work in this area to do just that. This is not to minimize the contribution of the current work, as Belco and Rottinghaus's excellent new book is a giant leap in the right direction for the literature on presidential power."
