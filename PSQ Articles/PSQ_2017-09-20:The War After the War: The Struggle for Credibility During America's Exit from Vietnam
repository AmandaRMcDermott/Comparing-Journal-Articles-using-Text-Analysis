"1","One of the most enduring historiographical debates surrounding the American war in Vietnam is the question of whether Richard Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, hoped for merely a “decent interval” between the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam and the collapse of the Saigon government or whether the two men hoped to continue a “permanent war” to prop up the Saigon regime indefinitely after the signing of a faulty peace agreement. The two arguments are best put forth in Jeffrey Kimball's Nixon's Vietnam War and Larry Berman's No Peace, No Honor, respectively, as well as in the subsequent exchanges between the two authors in the pages of Passport, the newsletter of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. Kimball contends that from as early as 1970, Nixon and Kissinger's goal was to build up the South Vietnamese military in the hope that Saigon's anticommunist regime might survive at least long enough after a U.S. withdrawal to prevent blame being placed at Nixon and Kissinger's feet. Berman, on the other hand, argues that Nixon and Kissinger anticipated the cease‐fire would not hold and hoped to achieve a permanent stalemate by responding to future North Vietnamese offensives with American airpower and other forms of support for Nguyen Van Thieu's regime. Watergate put an end to these plans.         "
"2","Johannes Kadura has waded into this debate with an important new book on America's exit from Vietnam. Focusing on the period between the signing of the Paris Agreements on Ending the War in January 1973 and the fall of Saigon in April 1975, he argues that Nixon and Kissinger simultaneously pursued a Plan A—an “equilibrium strategy”—to uphold the Saigon regime and a Plan B—an “insurance policy”—to downplay the significance of the loss of South Vietnam should Plan A fail. Kadura argues that scholars have misinterpreted Nixon and Kissinger's use of “decent interval.” Rather than describing the phase between a U.S. withdrawal and the inevitable collapse of Saigon, they conceived of it as the period during which the United States could pressure—with both carrots and sticks—North Vietnam to hold off from renewing its attacks on the South, eventually achieving a permanent equilibrium on the battlefield. However, this “equilibrium strategy” fell apart between April and June 1973. As the Watergate revelations unfolded, Nixon demonstrated an unwillingness to respond to Hanoi's cease‐fire violations, and Congress soon began placing restrictions on the White House's ability to re‐intervene in the conflict. With Nixon distracted by Watergate, Kissinger therefore began focusing on the “insurance policy” to limit the domestic and international costs of losing South Vietnam. This included improving relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to diminish the significance of Southeast Asia, blaming Congress for curbing the administration's ability to defend South Vietnam, and demonstrating the United States’ continued commitment to its allies. With these goals in mind, Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, and Kissinger continued to press Congress for aid to South Vietnam in the spring of 1975 despite believing that Saigon would soon fall regardless. Kadura concludes that Nixon, Kissinger, and Ford adopted a sophisticated strategy for dealing with the new complexities of the international environment in the 1970s, one that softened the blow of U.S. defeat in Vietnam, but their approach to foreign policymaking was nonetheless widely rejected after 1976."
"3","Although Kadura's efforts to distinguish his argument from those of Kimball and Berman are at times rather tortuous, his book is a useful intervention in the debates about the end of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. By focusing on the years after 1973, his work reveals that histories of the post‐Paris period are overdetermined, and he makes a convincing case that the outcome in Indochina was not determined by the Paris Agreement but by the events that followed. It will be a valuable addition to classrooms and the bookshelves of foreign policy scholars alike."
