"1","Undoubtedly, one of the most pressing issues of our time is the tension between the claims for equality by the gay rights movement and the pushback by religious communities that gay rights demands impinge on religious freedom. In recent years, this tension has been thrust into the public square. In 2015, in the wake of Obergefell v. Hodges, the historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made same‐sex marriage the law of the land in the United States, Kentucky notary public Kim Davis was sent to jail for refusing to sign same‐sex marriage certificates. She argued that signing the certificates would violate sincerely held religious views. Other “celebrated” conscientious objectors of the culture war over same‐sex marriage include bakers, photographers, and florists being fined by state officials for refusing to offer their wedding services to same‐sex couples.         "
"2","Typical of most edited collections, there is no unifying theme in this book binding the various chapters together, other than the book's overall subject matter. The closest thing one can find to a unifying theme is a sentence in the introduction by the editors that notes, “The contributors to this volume offer an array of different perspectives, reflecting their different expertise and prior moral and philosophical commitments. Nevertheless, they tend to converge around a forecast in which society—for better or worse depending on which author you ask—increasingly moves away from a Christian sexual morality and toward a diminished tolerance of religious freedom” (p. 11).         "
"3","Nonetheless, the book offers the most comprehensive overview to date of how religious communities in liberal democracies are being impacted by gay rights. One chapter describes how attempts by British courts to root out antigay discrimination have instead resulted in discrimination against religious people. Another chapter laments that the notion of “religious freedom” has been reduced to the very impoverished view of “freedom to worship” (p. 7). Yet another chapter decries how the “asymmetry” of the accommodations made to legalize same‐sex marriage in many liberal democracies have cast religious observers as “outsiders to be accommodated” (p. 9)."
"4","These analyses pointedly challenge the argument by gay rights activists that gay rights do not come at the expense of anyone's rights and freedoms. Less apparent is how these analyses show how convincing the victory of the gay rights movement has been. Indeed, a lot can be said for religious freedom demands being the effective terms of surrender of the religious community in its long and bitter battle against gay rights. Among those making that argument are the most extreme elements of the anti–gay rights movement. They regard the accommodations sought by religious freedom advocates, such as sparing a church from being forced to conduct a same‐sex marriage ceremony, as an outright abdication of the role of religious authorities to police and promote morality."
"5","Regrettably, the book offers very little in the way of proposals for how the conflict between religious freedom and gay rights might be solved, other than leaving the issue to the courts. This might reflect the absence of gay voices in the text; the bulk of the contributors are religious and legal scholars. The result is something of a one‐way conversation about religious freedom and gay rights. Clearly, direct dialogue between the religious and the gay communities will be needed for any sensible compromise to ensue. The recent synod by the Vatican “welcoming homosexual people,” and recognizing that homosexual unions can often constitute a “precious support in the life of the partners,” is a very promising start."
