"1","It is always refreshing to read a book that makes a passionate argument about the political‐economic problems facing the nation. The Middle Class Fights Back is such a book. Brian D'Agostino presents a lucid progressive critique of American government and the economy. He asserts that the middle class is experiencing declining job opportunities, wage stagnation, debt, and an unfair tax system. The degeneration of the middle class is due to state capitalism that works for the richest 1 percent of the population at the expense of the 99 percent, the rest of America. Accordingly, he fully supports the Occupy Wall Street Movement and fundamental changes in the economy. He traces the nation's financial problems, in part, to the high cost of the national security state, which he refers to as a “National Security Scam.” For him, military leaders and their supporters exaggerate the threat to national security and waste taxpayer money. However, he does not embrace a neo‐isolationist view of foreign policy but rather supports a more‐selective use of the military. D'Agostino's second chapter, titled “The Attack on Wages and Benefits,” takes on neo‐liberalism and American corporate leaders. These leaders have moved jobs abroad in search of cheap labor, and in the process, have accelerated the deindustrialization of America. In chapter 3, he opposes a public school reform movement that advocates high stakes testing, anti‐ unionism, and teacher evaluations based on student test scores. Chapter 4, titled “The Attack on Government,” refutes claims by conservative pundits and politicians that debt is solely related to profligate government spending. There is also the problem of inadequate tax revenues. These same conservatives who are against income redistribution support a tax system that favors the rich. In the remaining chapters, 5–8, he advocates a set of policy prescriptions that range from what he calls a “green New Deal” to worker‐managed enterprises based on Spain's Mondragon Cooperative Corporation. He also proposes a national referendum on progressive policy proposals. “I support an exercise of national direct democracy that would put the policy and institutional reform agenda in this book to a vote of all eligible citizens in a national referendum” (pp. 163–164).         "
"2","In sum, this book is a sweeping indictment of the national economy and its leadership. For D'Agostino, the current situation is so grim that it requires a middle‐class revolution to reverse the economic trends. In the Preface, he states that his purpose is to provide a “tool kit for leaders and ordinary people who want to participate in that revolution” (p. xviii). Obviously, many of D'Agostino's fellow progressives will applaud his characterization of the national crisis. However, the shortcoming of this very passionate narrative is its failure to fully engage the politics of national policymaking. As I read the chapters, I kept asking myself how these proposals could navigate the maze of Congress. Could they escape amendments, loopholes, add‐ons, and waivers? On reflection, it is clear that D'Agostino underestimates both the skills of those who disagree with him and their commitment to maintaining the status quo. Even if his national referendum idea could be legislated, mobilizing the middle class would require a civic engagement campaign unprecedented in American history. D'Agostino assumes that the middle class would vote its self‐interest. However, voting behavior research suggests that this is not always the case. That said, this is a readable book that explains the broad outlines of the progressives' critique and solutions for the national economic crisis. Hence, it is recommended for an undergraduate class in the politics of social movements."
