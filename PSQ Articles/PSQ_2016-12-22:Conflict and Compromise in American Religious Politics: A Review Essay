"1","IS COMPROMISE POSSIBLE WHEN IT COMES to religious politics? The answer often appears to be no. Nearly every day seems to offer more evidence of the unbridgeable divisions in this country that are being created by religious difference. Just consider the events in the few weeks prior to the time when I finished this review. In North Carolina, state officials moved to stop local governments from issuing nondiscrimination ordinances. In Mississippi, a new religious liberty law was adopted that allows medical professionals and wedding‐related businesses to deny their services to couples based on their religious beliefs. And in South Dakota, the governor vetoed a law that required transgender students to use the school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their sex at birth."
"2","When events like these are taken into account, it is not surprising that some scholars have forecast an American politics marked by increasing and unending religious conflict. For example, in his influential book Culture Wars, James Davison Hunter famously argued that American society was being split into two opposing camps based on differing perspectives on the ultimate source of moral authority. On the one side, you have the orthodox, individuals who are committed to the idea of universal, eternal moral truth. On the other, you have the progressives, those who instead believe that morality is more relative and shaped by the time in which we live. When people cannot even agree on basic moral standards, what hope is there for a peaceful politics?         "
"3","But maybe all is not lost. Two excellent recent contributions, Mark A. Smith's Secular Faith: How Culture Has Trumped Religion in American Politics and Neil J. Young's We Gather Together: The Religious Right and the Problem of Interfaith Politics, allow us to reflect more deeply on the question of compromise in religious politics.1 In their own ways, both books deal with religious conflict. While Smith concerns himself with the policy conflicts that separate the religious from the less than religious, Young explores the policy conflicts that separate members of one religion from the members of the others. Encouragingly, each author concludes that people of different religious and moral beliefs can get along, even if it is often far from easy to do so.         "
"4","Of the two, Smith's argument is more provocative. Smith attempts to prove that religious beliefs more often evolve to accommodate changing cultural norms rather than the other way around. In a series of well‐chosen case studies, Smith shows how Christians have rethought the ways in which they read and interpret religious texts and, in doing so, have thereby lessened the potential for cultural conflict."
"5","Smith's chapter on divorce is a good illustration of how these processes have played out over time. Divorce is a moral question, it undermines the structure of the traditional family, and it unequivocally violates biblical prohibitions. In Mark 10:7–9, Jesus says, “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” There is not a lot of ambiguity to be found in a passage like this. Why is it, then, that no one seems to be fighting for stricter divorce laws these days? The last push for a constitutional amendment regarding divorce was nearly 100 years ago."
"6","Smith's answer is simple. As divorce became more common in American society—indeed, according to best estimates, roughly 40 percent of marriages today end in divorce (p. 79)—religious leaders faced a choice. As Smith writes, “Clergy could either change their rules on remarriage after divorce or else risk alienating growing numbers of their actual and prospective members” (p. 74)."
"7","It turns out, that was not much of a choice at all. Protestants thus found new ways of understanding biblical messages. The New Testament passages came to be seen as an ideal, like turning the other cheek, rather than literal commands. Other theologians expansively interpreted the passages, carving out an exception for divorce on the grounds of infidelity (e.g., Matthew 19:9). Now, infidelity might be thought to include emotional abuse and other behaviors that undermine the trust of a loving relationship. For Catholics, divorcés are still forbidden by canon law from receiving the Eucharist, but even still, the church nonetheless bowed to the reality of secular life by permitting divorce and remarriage through an annulment process."
"8","With all the major religious traditions relaxing their teachings, Smith convincingly claims that divorce ceased to be a political issue. Religious leaders instead began to treat divorce as a private matter, not a public one. An example would be the rise of Promise Keepers, a Christian men's ministry that filled football stadiums across the country in the 1990s with its calls to strengthen marriage. Attendees at Promise Keepers events pledged to make changes in their own lives rather than promising to lobby for changes from their government. In other chapters, Smith exposes similar interconnections between cultural, religious, and policy changes on the issues of slavery, homosexuality, abortion, and women's rights."
"9","Secular Faith is an interesting read. I especially applaud Smith for his creative uses of data. In the chapter on divorce, for example, Smith includes an analysis of the e‐mail alerts sent by the Family Research Council between 2006 and 2007, finding that only 8 of 1,366 items focused on divorce (p. 84). This is unique proof for his claim that organizations like the Family Research Council are not pressing for a legislative response to rising divorce rates. In the chapter on homosexuality, Smith proves that there has been a growing debate among Christians about the Bible's position on homosexuality by charting the rapid increase in the number of books published on homosexuality in Christian thought (pp. 120–122). Again, this is a unique way of showing how Christians are rethinking scripture in light of changing values.         "
"10","Still, a fair assessment of this evidence leads me to question whether Smith might be a little too certain in dismissing fears of religious conflict. For one, the faiths that are gaining adherents in today's religious marketplace are the most demanding ones—exactly the kinds of faiths that are most likely to resist accommodating to secular trends. According to data collected by Roger Finke and Rodney Stark in their 2005 book The Churching of America, 1776–2005, between 1940 and 2000, the market shares of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the Word, the Mormon Church, and the Jehovah's Witnesses grew 2,375 percent, 157 percent, and 200 percent, respectively. Other demographic analyses point to similar developments. For example, Orthodox Jews, as opposed to the other more secular Jewish movements, are making up an increasingly large portion of the American Jewish community. Of course, if these trends continue, it could mean more conflict between religion and society, not less.         "
"11","To his credit, Smith is aware of this possibility. But he only considers it briefly at the end of the book (pp. 217–218). And his counter—that these growing churches are merely “selectively strict”—is a little too convenient, and a little too unsatisfying."
"12","Second, Smith also seems to overstate the extent to which religious leaders have embraced secular values. In one troublesome section, Smith tries to make the claim that Christian conservatives have moderated their political rhetoric on homosexuality (pp. 128–132). Yet Smith's evidence for this point is all anecdotal—the language found on a section of the National Organization for Marriage's website, an answer that Sarah Palin gave in 2008, and so on. The problem with this type of evidence is one can just as easily find plenty of examples that suggest otherwise. I immediately think of all the advocates for the aforementioned bathroom bills who said that such laws were needed to protect women and children from sexual predators and pedophiles. The association of transgender individuals with sex offenders is hard to miss in that kind of logic. Nor is that language representative of modern values. At another point, Smith even tries to describe James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, as a feminist (p. 201). This is not to say that Smith is wrong per se. Certainly religious leaders have changed their views. I only mean to raise the possibility that attitudes have not evolved as fast as Smith implies.         "
"13","While Smith is the more thought‐provoking of the two books, Young's We Gather Together might make the more lasting contribution to the field. We Gather Together is an impressive piece of scholarship, a book that has the potential to dramatically reshape our understanding of the history of the religious right. Young's book is unlike any other history of Christian activism that I have read. If a reader is looking for a meaningful discussion of the role that evangelicals played in Ronald Reagan's electoral victory in 1980, they will have to look elsewhere; that subject is covered in just a single sentence. What the reader will find, however, is nearly 10 pages of commentary on The God Makers, a 58‐minute anti‐Mormon film produced by evangelical converts in 1982 (pp. 192–201). Where Young devotes his attention says a lot about the argument he is trying to make.         "
"14","Young seeks to study the political alliances between three religious groups: evangelicals, Catholics and Mormons. In doing so, he wants to complicate the standard narrative of the Christian right's formation. Typically, scholars emphasize the success that certain figures and organizations had in convincing members of different faiths to set aside their theological objections in order to work together in common cause for a shared political agenda. Nothing could be further from the truth, Young argues. Young explains that the real history of interfaith politics is marked as much by competition as it is by cooperation."
"15","It is not hard to accept the premise that the religious right is a tenuous alliance. Where Young excels, however, is in his careful detailing of just how tenuous that alliance actually is. Knowing how broadly unpopular the U.S. Supreme Court's decision disallowing school prayer was, we might think that interfaith efforts to amend the Constitution to reverse the decision were unusually productive. But Young explains that the prayer alliance was “short‐lived” and “merely symbolic” because the three religious traditions could not decide on an amendment they all could back for fear that such a provision might expose their kids to one of the other faith's prayers or language (pp. 68–78). We might think that Phyllis Schlafly's STOP ERA group was a great ecumenical success. But Young explains that this was a “false vision” because divisions remained at the grassroots level, where state chapters tended to reflect local religious demographics, and because many fundamentalist Protestant women formed their own organizations rather than join one led by a Catholic (pp. 155–157). And we might think that, frustrated as they were by Reagan's failure to deliver on his promises to the Christian right, evangelicals enthusiastically embraced the candidacy of religious broadcaster Pat Robertson in 1988. But Young explains that Robertson's identity as a charismatic Christian, a strain viewed with skepticism by evangelicals and fundamentalists, was such a burden on him that Jerry Falwell preferred to endorse George H.W. Bush over his fellow preacher (pp. 241–242). As a result of Young's meticulous accounting, I have been forced to view all these events in a new light."
"16","I would not go as far as to call We Gather Together perfect. For one, as a political scientist, I feel Young assumes a bit too much theological knowledge on the part of his readers. More of an introduction to topics such as “death of God” theology (pp. 78–86) would have been appreciated.         "
"17","My larger concern about Young's book is that he more or less entirely skips over the presidency of George W. Bush. In fact, Bush is only mentioned on four pages in total. After a relatively short chapter on the 1990s, one mostly focusing on the Christian Coalition, the narrative jarringly leaps ahead to the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney (perhaps, one suspects, in a subtle attempt to rectify the relative lack of attention the book pays to the Mormon church). However, skipping over Bush is a particularly problematic decision for a book about interfaith politics. This is because other scholars have already documented the extensive collaboration that existed among religious traditionalists who fought for a constitutional amendment banning same‐sex marriage. I have in mind, for instance, David Campbell and Carin Robinson's essay in The Politics of Same‐Sex Marriage. This type of interfaith lobbying was more extensive than other previous attempts, even drawing some Orthodox Jews, black Protestants, and Muslims into the fold. Thus, one wonders how a conscious exploration of these linkages might have altered Young's interpretations.         "
"18","Still, all that being said, We Gather Together influenced my understanding of the history of the religious right as much as any book, well, ever.         "
"19","But to return to the question that opened this review, is compromise possible when it comes to religious politics? Based on a careful reading of these two books, maybe the most accurate answer is . . . kind of?         "
"20","Compromise is kind of possible because Smith's research suggests that Christians and atheists have more in common than they know. Yet, at the same time, emerging religious groups are more doctrinal, and Smith likely overstates the strength of his overall evidence to begin with."
"21","Compromise is also only kind of possible because Young's research shows that members of different faiths typically struggle to put aside theological disagreements and work together. Yet interfaith alliances do still occur, and maybe Young would have unearthed even more proof of this point had he paid more attention to the events of the Bush presidency."
"22","Ultimately, a small statistic in Smith's book left a deep impact on me. Smith notes that there are now more than 33,000 different Protestant denominations in America (p. 21). 33,000. Now add to that incredible religious diversity a certainty of belief so high that some people would rather die than receive medical treatment that would violate their religious beliefs. Add to that certainty a breadth of belief so wide that fewer than half of Americans think evolution is the best explanation for the origins of human life on Earth. In a country with such diversity, with such certainty, with such widespread faith, religious conflict is inevitable. And yet, as Smith shows, sometimes this conflict diminishes over time. And yet, as Young shows, sometimes the faithful do overcome their divisions. As always, things are better than they might seem."
