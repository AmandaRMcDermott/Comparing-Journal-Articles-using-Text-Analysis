"1","This thoughtful and thoroughly researched examination of Plessy v. Ferguson makes a worthy contribution to the literature on a case that shaped race relations in America. In 1892, Homer A. Plessy, a 30‐year‐old New Orleans shoemaker, was arrested after refusing to leave a railroad car reserved for white passengers. Plessy was acting on a plan to orchestrate a test case to challenge New Orleans's “separate car law,” which required racial segregation on public transportation. Plessy, a light‐complexioned Creole who appeared to be white, agreed to execute the plan.         "
"2","In the ensuing proceedings, Plessy's lawyers argued that the law violated the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution because it treated African Americans differently and less favorably than similarly situated whites. In 1896, the Supreme Court ruled that the law did not violate the Constitution, because it required equal, although separate, facilities for blacks."
"3","Plessy legitimated a regime of white supremacy that was established in the post‐Reconstruction era. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were essentially nullified in the South. African Americans were disenfranchised, confined to substandard housing in segregated neighborhoods, and excluded from all but the lowest‐paying, least‐desirable occupations. Segregated facilities were always separate but never equal."
"4","In the 1930s, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) embarked on a long‐range, carefully orchestrated campaign that would challenge segregation in the courts. Under the NAACP's “equalization strategy,” cases were filed arguing that segregated schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by Plessy based on the glaring resource disparities between black and white schools. The NAACP lawyers calculated that segregation would eventually collapse because Southern states could not afford black and white schools that were actually equal. After a series of cases that evolved from those seeking equalization to a direct challenge to segregation itself, the NAACP's efforts climaxed with the victory in the 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The Court held that segregation is inherently unequal.         "
"5","Hoffer describes the post‐Reconstruction context in which Plessy v. Ferguson arose. He explains how the legal challenge was mounted by an organization of mixed‐race Creoles. He identifies the many flaws and contradictions in the majority's opinion. This analysis shows that Plessy was not as much a product of Constitutional interpretation as it was a disingenuous justification for white supremacy.         "
"6","Hoffer includes a detailed examination of the arguments Plessy's lawyers made in their Supreme Court briefs. He compliments their skills and criticizes some of their strategies. Hoffer contends that Plessy's lawyers should have argued that racial categories did not exist in reality. Had they done so and succeeded, race would not have been a legitimate basis for governmental policies. This and other suggestions that different tactics might have achieved a better outcome seem too optimistic. Racial distinctions were (and are) arbitrary, as Plessy's physical appearance demonstrated. This was why Plessy's lawyers argued that racial categories were vague and arbitrary, but that was as far as they could have gone."
"7","Scientific evidence has proven that all humans belong to the same hominid subspecies. The racial categories included in the U.S. Census reflect a sociocultural definition of race that does not define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. However, the determination that racial groups are genetically indistinguishable is a relatively recent phenomenon. When Plessy was decided, the consensus among scientists was that races were genetically distinct and the white race was superior to all others. This was an article of faith in the nineteenth century and much of the twentieth. Given these circumstances it would have been pointless to argue in 1896 that there was no such thing as race. That said, this is a book worth reading."
