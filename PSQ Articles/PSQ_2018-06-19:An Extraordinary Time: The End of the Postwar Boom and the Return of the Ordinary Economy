"1","The French call the three decades of prosperity after the end of the Second World War Les Trente Glorieuses. This period was glorious for the already wealthy first world, the communist second world, and even for the developing countries in the third world. Prosperity was broadly shared as well, with an ever‐growing welfare state and low or declining inequality. This golden age was brought to a crashing halt in the mid‐1970s, with the turning point corresponding roughly to the year 1973. Oil prices spiked, causing runaway inflation and requiring major economic readjustments across the globe. Exchange rates that had been fixed and stable became flexible and volatile. Manufacturing went global, leading to the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs in the United States and Europe. Inequality rose and the growth of median income stagnated. The developing world's debt binge turned into a crisis when Paul Volcker hiked interest rates to combat the inflation problem. Governments changed their policies to try to combat this crisis, but ultimately were unsuccessful at returning their nations to the golden age of the Wirtschaftswunder.         "
"2","An Extraordinary Time is an economic history of the postwar golden age that ended in 1973 and the responses to the breakdown of this system in the 1970s and 1980s. The author provides an overview of not only of wealthy industrialized countries but also Latin America and parts of Asia in the decades after World War II. There are some careless errors: the Swedish Riksbank was the first central bank, not the Bank of England. There are some lazy views on French statism as continuous back to Louis XV, ignoring the liberalism in the French Republic through the 1930s. But overall, this is an engaging read that moves briskly despite the dry topic. Marc Levinson has a real talent for making complex economic issues accessible to the lay reader. An Extraordinary Time takes on the right questions, but is not intended to be a profound study. This book should whet the appetite of the interested reader to dig more deeply into these topics. The questions raised by the disaster of 1973 hold the key to the great economic problems of our day.         "
"3","The word “neoliberalism” is not found anywhere in the text, which is a major shortcoming of An Extraordinary Time. The movement toward a lighter touch for government and policies following rules rather than discretion can be seen in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden in the 1970s. Even François Mitterrand liberalized the French economy after his disastrous nationalizations. Framing the book through the lens of the neoliberal era that followed the dirigiste policies of the postwar period would have helped structure the text. As it stands, Levinson asserts that the policies governments enacted to deal with the post‐1973 world were unsuccessful, as the golden age did not return.         "
"4","However, there were successes in terms of monetary policy. Once Volcker abandoned monetarism in the mid‐1980s, there was a period of low and stable inflation and stable growth in gross domestic product called the “Great Moderation.” On the other hand, neoliberal policies, including privatization and deregulation, were not successful at returning growth rates to their previously high levels. Rising inequality was largely ignored."
"5","Another omission of the book is the neglect of China almost entirely. China also made its own move toward neoliberalism with the policies of Deng Xiaoping, leading to rapid economic growth and millions lifted out of poverty. This experience stands in sharp contrast to most of the rest of the world, but these extraordinary impacts were much more significant for mankind than anything that happened in the countries considered in An Extraordinary Time.
