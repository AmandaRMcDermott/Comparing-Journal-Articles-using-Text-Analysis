"1","How were the Great Society programs and policies designed so that they attracted bipartisan majorities? Why and how did the Great Society programs withstand the electoral and popular backlash that soon engulfed them? This book persuasively locates the answers in the politicking that took place in congressional committees and in how liberal Democrats and Republicans in Congress, working closely with the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, timed their legislative moves."
"2","Zelizer hardly neglects civil rights and Black Power protest, unexpected and dramatic events, shifts in the public mood, the backdrop of Vietnam, the explosion of black unrest in northern cities, and what public opinion surveys told Congress and the president about what the American people wanted—and what they did not want. Also, Zelizer provides a marvelous portrait of Lyndon Baines Johnson as a visionary, cunning, and fanatically hardworking president determined to make the most of his unexpected opportunities. We see just how racially conservative, economically anxious, and fiscally prudent America really was then—and thus we grasp, as Johnson did, the sheer exceptionalism of the Great Society opening. LBJ was racing against a clock—he knew every minute of his working day that reversal and challenge were certain. Indeed, one of the great surprises of the book is Zelizer's demonstration that Johnson's escalation of the Vietnam War was, more than we knew, meant to protect the Great Society by embellishing Johnson's credentials as an anticommunist hawk. This was “dirty hands” reformist leadership on a grand scale."
"3","But the real surprise of the book is how it is both panoramic and clearly and steadily focused on the nuts and bolts of the congressional story. Seniority, the Rules Committee, the filibuster, the now‐forgotten 21‐day rule, the discharge petition, the policy obsessions of long‐serving members of Congress, deception and bluffing in bargaining between congressional leaders, the attunement of members of Congress to their constituencies, the subtle allocation of credit and blame in the framing of committee and floor votes, the way members of Congress bargained with LBJ's agents and LBJ himself, the unusual relaxation of budget discipline during Johnson's presidency, the symbolism of tax and spending cuts and the numbers associated with them: these arcane elements of the Madisonian system truly constituted the Great Society, certainly far more than we previously understood. The many years that Zelizer spent in entrepreneurially establishing congressional history as a significant subfield have paid extremely rich dividends. His gift for succinct characterization, his eye for telling detail, his excellent ear for the voices of his principals, and the superb photos all make for an enormously rewarding reading experience. More than that, the book is obviously definitive in everything that it treats; new insights await any expert reader.         "
"4","Zelizer's rich tale has been widely discussed as a tonic for our present discontents about presidential leadership and congressional performance. Presidents cannot do anything without Congress—and what they can do depends on the precise size of the supportive coalition on Capitol Hill. The American political system's default setting is very grudging incrementalism. These institutionalist lessons of the book are certainly well taken. Yet Zelizer clearly shows that the Great Society's endurance depended on bipartisanship and on very rapid and very effective implementation of its policies (with the exception of the fair housing legislation—which was left to subsequent presidents to strengthen). All of this means that we are currently living through a real‐time test of whether enduring policy change can happen without these ingredients. Time will tell—and with luck, the standard account of the Barack Obama years will be as lucid and instructive as this account of the Johnson years.         "
