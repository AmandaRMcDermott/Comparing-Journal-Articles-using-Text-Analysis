"1","Conventional analyses of peacekeeping have been very myopic, focusing on only one aspect of operations and often on only one goal, specifically, preventing the recurrence of violent conflict. Furthermore, concentration has been on macro‐level factors (for example, disputant characteristics or major power interests) in studies by scholars or on military elements in studies by practitioners. The advent of complex peacebuilding missions would seem to have forced a change in those orientations, but this has been infrequently the case."
"2","Séverine Autesserre broke this mold with her award‐winning first book, The Trouble with the Congo, a compelling account of how local factors and actors affect peace operation outcomes. The present book continues this, this time focusing on the actors that plan and carry out missions, which the author labels “Peaceland,” a variation of the moniker “Aidland,” to signify the special values, narratives, habits, and practices that are associated with foreign personnel carrying out duties in operations. Although the author acknowledges some good results from Peaceland activities, this is primarily a book about failures and problems. The central argument is that a significant portion, although not all, of the blame can be attributed to the mismatch between local needs and external actor orientations.         "
"3","What makes this an exceptional book are its unique approach and its well‐documented and insightful conclusions. First, the research is a product of extensive ethnographic research in the Congo (the focus of the author's first book). This is supplemented by fieldwork in five other territories, and the author also draws on personal experiences in three other countries. She also does an excellent job of integrating a variety of others' studies in drawing conclusions. Second, the decision to concentrate on personnel on the ground represents a breakthrough in peacebuilding research. There have been other works on the clashing cultures of the local and international (most notably, Lise Howard's UN Peacekeeping in Civil Wars), but these have focused more on the United Nations machinery rather than those implementing plans on site. This analysis drills down to see how macro‐level forces play out at the micro level.         "
"4","A unique research design and focus are only valuable if they produce new insights, and this book delivers. In Part I, Autesserre provides an excellent analysis of the pathologies of Peaceland and how they are mismatched with local needs; this is done along the dimensions of information gathering, expertise, and the dominant narratives employed. The illustration of how these pathologies play out in the Congo is convincing. Part II shows how the boundaries between local and external forces are constructed and maintained, as well as some consequences of such contradictions. The broad diagnoses of the problems and their sources offered here are well written, explained in detailed, nicely illustrated, and therefore persuasive. If there is a limitation, the specification of what constitutes success privileges perception over objectivity."
"5","For the scholarly community, this book, along with its predecessor, is essential reading for understanding the micro‐level approach and the importance of local factors in peacebuilding. Policymakers will find multiple ideas in the author's list of recommendations in the concluding chapter; these are not merely a string of “should” statements but specific ideas about how to overcome the problems noted in the book. Indeed, many of these ideas have applicability to a range of international interventions, especially those concerning humanitarian assistance. The bottom line is that this work is at the top of the heap in the recent plethora of new books on peace operations."
