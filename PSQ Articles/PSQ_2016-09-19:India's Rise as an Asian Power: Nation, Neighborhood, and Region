"1","Why do some powers rise while others languish? Does India have what it takes to ascend to the ranks of the world's great powers? Sandy Gordon has an implicit answer to the first question that leads to an equivocal answer to the second. India can rise if it places its internal affairs in order and if it can transform the hostile politics of its neighborhood."
"2","Gordon is certainly correct that India has internal problems. For those who possess a utopian image of India from Thomas Friedman columns, Gordon's work is a helpful corrective. Poor governance encourages corruption and facilitates criminality. Gordon, with experience in Australia's Federal Police, rightly emphasizes India's archaic policing and underresourced judicial institutions. He points to hopeful signs that transparency initiatives will enable accountability and unleash a virtuous circle of better governance (p. 168). If reform takes hold, India can “harden” itself against the transnational threats of terrorism and crime (p. 181)."
"3","Additionally, his assessment that instability in South Asia harms India, as migrants, terrorists, and criminals take advantage of India's long and porous borders, is no doubt true. He abundantly catalogs discrete cases of each of these phenomena. Like most regional hegemons, New Delhi has been tempted to use its power to secure favorable outcomes in its neighbors. Like the United States in Latin America and the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, such interventions have brought with them widespread resentment in India's neighbors at New Delhi's activist policy. Gordon favors a more altruistic regional policy, like that advocated by former Indian prime minister I.K. Gujral (p. 182). Only after India consolidates its position in South Asia, Gordon argues, can it secure its status as a global power (p. xxiii)."
"4","Is Gordon's governance‐ and region‐first grand strategy the correct one for India? The principal weakness of Gordon's account is that his implicit theory of rising powers is unproven, and too often he compares India with developed countries rather than its contemporary (or historical) peers. Ashutosh Varshney suggested in his 2014 book Battles Half Won: India's Improbable Democracy that corruption is endemic in countries experiencing rapid growth. India and China's corruption challenges are not vastly different from those experienced by the United States during the Gilded Age. If the analogy is valid, rising wealth may well lead to greater popular demands for good governance, and the situation would resolve itself. Similarly, comparisons with India's contemporary peer, China, also calm fears about Indian institutions. Any list of corruption scandals in New Delhi can be compared with a similarly long list of such affairs in China. In fact, India's governance challenge in the years ahead may be substantially less difficult than China's because the latter state is likely to face increasing demands for representative governance. Likewise, China's troubles with its Asian neighbors are as severe as India's within the subcontinent. If India is trapped by regional squabbles, China will be as well.         "
"5","Any state—especially a developing state—will have many problems. This truism is supersized when a country is as large as India. Fareed Zakaria hinted at the beginning of a research program when he sought to understand why some wealthy states become great powers and others do not (see From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America's World Role). In the contemporary world, the rising powers are still becoming wealthy at the same time as they attempt to become great. Ascertaining which factors will determine the extent of their rise is of enormous predictive importance. Gordon has asked the right question, even if his answer is ultimately unsatisfying.         "
