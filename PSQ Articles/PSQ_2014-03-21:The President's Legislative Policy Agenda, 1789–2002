"1","Article II of the United States Constitution gives to the President the power to recommend to the consideration of Congress “such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” From George Washington on, presidents have used that provision to propose a legislative policy agenda for Congress. In The President's Legislative Policy Agenda, 1789–2002, Fordham political scientist Jeffrey E. Cohen offers an exhaustive examination and analysis of the evolution and dynamics of the President's legislative agenda.         "
"2","Cohen is particularly interested in the calculations that go into the President's decisions about whether and how to promote a piece of legislation that he wants to recommend. Why, Cohen asks, does the President seemingly so often propose bills that have little chance of enactment? What have trends been over time? Does the type of issue matter? And what sort of difference does divided government and partisan polarization make to the President's agenda?"
"3","Many previous studies have examined presidential success on roll call votes in terms of position‐taking—how often does the President's position prevail when he makes it known? This book looks instead at the important subset of bills that the President himself has positively proposed—the President's legislative policy agenda or, since 1949, the “President's program.”"
"4","Cohen's analysis illuminates a number of results. In some cases, those results should not surprise, although they are important in confirming tendencies that have long been suspected. For example, Cohen concludes that there is strong supporting evidence for the “two presidencies” thesis—the President's foreign policy program does have greater success in Congress than does his domestic program. At the same time, it is the President's domestic program, particularly in the social welfare policy area, that has been responsible for the vast bulk of the expanded size of the President's overall agenda since World War II. Indeed, Cohen remarks that “To a degree, modern presidents are social welfare presidents” (pp. 185–186)."
"5","Other conclusions will be more surprising to some readers. A stronger presidency since Franklin Roosevelt has translated into (among other things) greater success with Congress by modern presidents than by traditional presidents. Concerns about gridlock may have been valid at junctures since 1945, but the predominant picture is one that might more easily lead to a concern that the President has grown too strong and Congress too pliant. As well, the main effect of divided government is to reduce the size of the President's agenda and to moderate that agenda; he still gets a significant proportion of what he asks for, but he asks for fewer, and different, things."
"6","The theoretical centerpiece of The President's Legislative Policy Agenda is Cohen's “theory of congressional anticipations.” According to this theory, presidents “read the congressional environment for clues concerning the likely action that Congress will take on their legislative proposals” (p. 256). They then adjust their plans accordingly, shelving some proposals, modifying others, and acquiring more resources to continue pushing still others when prospects for congressional success seem to dim. Again, this is not a radically‐unexpected result, but it is a confirmation of presidential strategic thinking and a useful link between elements of the literature on presidential agendas and congressional action.         "
"7","One shortcoming is that the book takes as a starting point that the proposal power “breached the strict wall of separation between the president and Congress,” transforming the chief executive into a “participant in the legislative process” (p. 13). In reality, the veto is at least as important in those terms, and the Framers never desired an absolute separation between the branches (as Madison explains in The Federalist 51). Nevertheless, Cohen has done a considerable service to the study of presidential‐congressional relations."
