"1","Almost two thirds of legal immigrants to the United States qualify as relatives of U.S. citizens or existing permanent resident aliens. As Catherine Lee observes in Fictive Kinship, “family appears to be a firmly entrenched, privileged category in American immigration policy” (p. 101). Across the political spectrum, there has been broad agreement for the last half century that family unification is a core objective of immigration policy. This study asks important questions about an understudied but central element of the country's immigration story.         "
"2","Lee traces the history of family‐based immigration. In the late‐nineteenth century, immigration authorities presumed the wives of Chinese laborers to be excludable as prostitutes, though wives of the merchant class were allowed entry. Japanese wives were admitted under a bilateral treaty regime, notwithstanding concerns that their “fecundity” would crowd out white farmers in the American West. Congress did not enact a generally applicable preference for family members until the National Origins Act of 1924, which adopted backward‐looking quotas at the same time that it allowed wives and children of eligible immigrants to enter without limit. When this regime proved inadequate to facilitate the admission of foreign women marrying U.S. service members during World War II, ad hoc “war brides” measures accounted for almost a quarter of legal immigration in the post‐war period."
"3","The 1965 Hart‐Celler Act abandoned the quota system and erected family‐based preferences as one pillar of the legal immigration regime (the others being skills‐based and humanitarian admissions). That system prevails today, generously qualifying family members for admission amidst otherwise formidable barriers. Spouses, minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens are subject to no quotas. Others are eligible for quota‐capped preferences, which can result in significant wait times."
"4","To the extent that the regime has been contested, it has been at the margins. The preference for siblings of U.S. citizens has been in the legislative crosshairs as a probable victim of a comprehensive immigration reform package. But the sibling category suffers chronically lengthy backlogs; the United States is now issuing visas to those for whom petitions were filed in 2001 (in the case of siblings from high‐immigration countries, the wait can be as long as 24 years). Beyond siblings, as Lee notes, the strange bedfellows of immigrant advocates, family values conservatives, and business interests afford political protection for family‐based preferences even as immigration otherwise results in sharp polarization."
"5","Fictive Kinship deploys family in the context of immigration policy as a mirror on the construction of family more broadly. But the “ideation” of family in immigration politics has been conservative, as Lee acknowledges (p. 122). That limits the study's utility, insofar as legislators, policymakers, and advocates have had little incentive to contest the existing approach at its core. Categories with illuminating arcs are omitted here, including children born out of wedlock and foreign orphans adopted by U.S. citizens. Future research might address how non‐citizens process the exclusion of extended family members, more valued in non‐Western cultures but ignored in the U.S. immigrant preference regime, and those of most immigrant‐receiving states. Immigrants to the United States are known to circumvent limitations on family‐based preferences through employment‐based and non‐immigrant admissions (a strategy also among same‐sex partners until their recent inclusion in the category of “spouse” for immigration law purposes). Such promising research avenues lend themselves more to sociological and empirical methods than to legislative surveys. Fictive Kinship supplies a critical treatment of the politics of family immigration on which to build.         "
