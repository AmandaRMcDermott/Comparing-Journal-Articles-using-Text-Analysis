"1","The twin issues of illegal immigration and drug smuggling have dominated discussions about American border security for almost two decades. Hoping to offer historical perspective on these debates, Peter Andreas argues that the United States has never been able to prevent goods or people from entering the country. In Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America, Andreas describes the ways that smuggling and policing smuggling have been intertwined with American history from the American Revolution to the war on drugs. This history shows, Andreas contends, that “smuggling—and attempts to police it—have made and remade America” (p. x).         "
"2","One of the strongest sections of what is an anecdotal rather than a comprehensive book focuses on smuggling during the early Republic. Central to the U.S. ability to compete economically with Europe, and in Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton's view, to maintain independence, was Americans' rapid adoption of industrial technology. Though he overemphasizes the role that the theft of British intellectual property played in American industrialization, Andreas makes clear that technology obtained through illicit means played some role in aiding economic growth. At the same time, however, an American government desperate to protect American sovereignty and stimulate domestic manufacturers used the same tactics of state control over shipping that they openly resented Britain for employing. Benefitting from breaking British law to obtain technology, it was the American government's own aggressive customs bureau that protected nascent industries. In the twentieth century, Andreas finds even more direct evidence that policing smuggling led to an enhanced state. As is clear from his sections on Prohibition, the war on drugs, and illegal immigration, the only tangible result of efforts to stymie smuggling has been ever‐more‐aggressive and invasive policing strategies, particularly when the goal has been to enforce moral purity."
"3","Andreas offers an impressive catalog of the ways that illicit trade is bound up with some of the most‐important incidents in American history. Where Smuggler Nation falls short is in Andreas's inability to develop a coherent typology of smuggling and smugglers. Andreas defines smuggling simply, as “a clandestine economic practice that we can simply define as bringing in or taking out from one jurisdiction to another without authorization” (p. x). While this decision allows him to bring together a wide range of vignettes across more than 300 years of American history, his unwillingness to distinguish between kinds of smuggling prevents him from truly uncovering how “illicit flows … defined and shaped the nation” (p. 2) and leaves the reader to erroneously conclude that all smugglers were motivated by the same impulse.         "
"4","Take for example his conflation of modern drug‐running and American attempts to evade British trade laws in the eighteenth century. In Andreas's telling, both of these kinds of smuggling were driven by naked self‐interest. But were they the same? Surely New York merchants profited by dodging customs officials and trading directly with French Caribbean ports in the 1730s. However, if one examines the numerous pamphlets they produced in these same years (which Andreas does not), it is clear that their smuggling was motivated as much by their longstanding conviction that free trade would be best for their colony and the larger empire as it was by their own pocketbooks."
"5","By treating all smuggling the same, Andreas leaves the role of ideology unexplored and thus misses the chance to explain something fundamental about how Americans have imagined themselves and their nation. In the end, the only thread that ties Andreas's smugglers together is their pursuit of profit; I hope there is more that made America."
