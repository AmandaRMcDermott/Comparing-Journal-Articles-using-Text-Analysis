"1","As Robert P. Saldin explains in his important new book, in 2009, the decades‐long policy challenge of establishing a system for addressing Americans’ long‐term care needs received a strong push that would eventually link its fate to the Barack Obama administration's signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Almost as soon as it made it across the legislative finish line, however, the Community Living Assistance and Services and Supports (CLASS) Act was abandoned as unworkable. It was, as Saldin persuasively argues, both an unlikely victory and a predictable retreat."
"2","CLASS's passage was unlikely in large part because of the history that preceded it. Given the many failed attempts at establishing a long‐term care program—first as part of Medicare but also during the failed Bill Clinton–era health care reforms—long‐term care was seen by most policymakers as prohibitively expensive and politically volatile. Among the vexing problems at long‐term care's core were questions of means testing and universality, mandatory and nonmandatory enrollment and funding, and the relationship between services for seniors and those for the disabled. According to Saldin, the politics of long‐term care converges—unproductively—with the politics of budgeting, and especially budgetary forecasting. This politics is also problematized by a culture that struggles with mortality and morbidity, ideological differences about the nature of social programs, structural paradoxes in congressional rules, and misaligned policymaker incentives."
"3","There are at least two distinctly profitable ways of reading (and teaching) Saldin's book. First, the book's focus on the minutiae of the legislative process—the role of committees, budgetary forecasting, the reconciliation process, and parliamentary rulings, for example—make the book useful for teaching congressional procedure in a way that standard approaches rarely capture. Saldin makes clear that even if one can point to something such as normal process and order, the utility of doing so is likely to obscure the more important fact that congressional processes have long been and may increasingly be characterized in the future as exceptional. One must study individual cases in addition to looking for general principles and dynamics."
"4","Second, Saldin's book is essential reading for those seeking to understand the historical and procedural contexts within which health care policy, in particular, is made. Primarily, of course, When Bad Policy Makes Good Politics helps readers to appreciate the challenges of advancing solutions in the policy domain of long‐term care, which are themselves fascinating, complex, and likely largely unknown to readers. The book also adds depth to our understanding of the ACA's passage, contributing to our knowledge of that history. Saldin's book should find broad readership among those interested in both the intricacies and intrigues of Congress, as well as health care more generally.         "
"5","When policymakers return to the question of long‐term care—and they will, because they must, especially in an aging United States—Saldin's book should be one of their first stops. The next attempt at long‐term care will undoubtedly be similarly constrained by the decades of failed attempts that proceeded it. Saldin's book shows that it is possible that policy learning has resulted from those attempts. To avoid the same pitfalls, future policy efforts will likely need to be part of a much larger legislative development—such as the arrival of a single‐payer, Medicare or Medicaid “for all” program—if it is to be politically and financially workable. Saldin's analysis makes clear that a commitment to long‐term care requires preceding without illusions that such a program can be erected on the cheap. Major changes in long‐term care will ultimately require prioritizing the issue itself."
