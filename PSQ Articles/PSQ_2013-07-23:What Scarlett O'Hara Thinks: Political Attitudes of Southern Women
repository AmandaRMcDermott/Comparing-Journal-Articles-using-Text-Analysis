"1","VOLUMES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE political influence of the South and the increasingly important role of women in U.S. politics. Richard Nixon's “Southern Strategy” placed the rise of the Republican South in the center of electoral politics, a position the South has retained now for over 40 years. The increasing ties between women and the Democratic Party emerged later and pulled electoral politics in the opposite direction. Women started to favor the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates as early as the 1970s. Further, since 1992, the Democratic candidate would have been elected to the White House in every single election if only women had voted. Individually, gender, racial, and regional differences have become defining features of the U.S. political system, specifically partisan electoral politics. However these factors are typically analyzed separately, ignoring the reinforcing and cross‐pressures that regional, racial, and gender identities bring to bear on political attitudes, and potentially erasing the presence of and limiting the power of white Southern women in politics."
"2","There is reason to believe that Southern white women exhibit unique political behaviors, making it difficult to neatly fit them into the currently constructed categories of women, whites, or Southerners. Several scholars have noticed that the experience of Southern realignment has had a differential impact on the partisan attachments of Southern white women.1 Additionally, Southern white women tend to be less prejudiced toward blacks than are their male counterparts,2 a potentially important difference, given the significance of racial attitudes and policies in Southern partisanship. These findings raise an important question: Do Southern white women speak in a unique political voice?         "
"3","Using the theoretical lens of intersectionality, I examine how the confluence of gender, region, and race shapes political attitudes and public opinion. I draw on the National Election Studies conducted between 1990 and 2004 to examine the differences between Southern white women, Southern white men, non‐Southern white women, and non‐Southern white men. Differences in attitudes and opinions across five different topic areas are analyzed: political orientations; the size and scope of government (including compassion issues); defense and foreign policy; social issues; and equal roles for men and women and racial attitudes. This article goes beyond the existing research on Southern exceptionalism (or its decline)3 by examining when Southerners hold different attitudes and, specifically, who holds those attitudes. The results suggest that Southern white women speak in a unique political voice shaped by regional, racial, and gender identities.         "
"4","The theoretical underpinning of this article rests on the idea that gender is a social construction that varies across regions and race. Judith Lorber explains how society has constructed the connection between the categories masculinity, femininity, men, and women: “We see two discrete sexes and two distinguishable genders because our society is built on two classes of people, women and men. Once the gender category is given, the attributes of the person are also gendered: Whatever a woman is has to be female; whatever a man is has to be male.”4 There is nothing natural or biological about gender; rather, a complex web of interactions between social, economic, political, and psychological forces produces the meaning and significance of gender. The meanings of masculinity, femininity, male, and female are a result of society constructing or attaching specific meanings to them. Moreover, the meanings attributed to these categories change over time. Thus, the meaning of gender is situated by its history, and can only be understood when considered in its appropriate political, social, and economic context. 5"
"5","The central implication is that the meanings of being a man or woman is not fixed, but rather varies in its construction. The social construction of gender is theorized to operate in society in many different ways: as an institution6, as seriality7, as performance8, and as a process.9 In this project, gender is a category of analysis.10 It is with this idea in mind that we would anticipate that the unique social and political context of the South would produce variation in gender identity that would influence the political attitudes of women and men.         "
"6","In addition to conceptualizing gender as a social constructed category, we also must recognize that the other categories (race and region) are also socially constructed. The meanings underlying Southern political identity and racial categories have resulted from a historical process that has shaped the content of these labels. To better understand how each of these socially constructed categories intersects with the other, I employ the theory of intersectionality."
"7","When studying the political behavior of social groups in the United States, we typically examine one group at a time: women, blacks, Southerners, the religious, etc. Such analyses fail to recognize that social identities are fluid and intersect with one another on multiple axes. In studying gender, if we treat women and men as our categories of analysis, we fail to recognize how other social identities intersect to shape an individual's gendered experiences. Intersectional theory provides us with a framework that helps illuminate how multiple social identities can intersect to create unique political contexts that shape the experiences of individuals."
"8","Intersectionality was originally developed as a tool of black feminists to understand how the multiple systems of gender, race, and class oppression intersected to shape their political, social, and economic experiences.11 Scholars then extended the theory of intersectionality to understand oppression from heterosexism.12 The confluence of multiple social identities possessed by an individual creates unique contexts that shape the experiences of that individual and their understanding of those experiences. I contend that the intersection of gender, racial, and regional identities is often overlooked in the study of politics.            "
"9","Why is the intersectionality framework useful for studying politics? Looking only at a single identity is problematic because it assumes that politics are neutral in every other way than across that particular identity. Jane Junn and Nadia Brown explain: “Underlying this perspective is the assumption that individuals have equal agency. Inferential models estimated with the data belie this bias: one more year of education or one more mobilization request will increase political participation among people regardless of particularities of their social and political context.”13 However, we know that the political system is not a neutral player; instead, it creates and reinforces gender and other social hierarchies.14 Thus, grouping all women together as a whole could erase potentially important differences across other identities.            "
"10","One of the most important identities that can interact with gender is that of geographical region, mainly that of Southern political identity. Once again, existing analyses of the political attitudes and opinions of the South have often been carried out in isolation, singled out as being different from the rest of the nation with a dummy variable. Treating regional identity in such a way reproduces many of the problems initially identified with the study of gender. Studying only the South or doing so with a single dummy variable fails to advance our understanding of the context shaping political attitudes. Additionally, it treats Southerners as a monolithic group, ignoring the raced, classed, and gendered experiences of individuals living in the South."
"11","The framework of intersectionality may be particularly helpful in understanding how gender and region work to shape distinct political attitudes. The traditional political culture of the South is partially defined by paternalism and the desire to maintain existing social hierarchies.15 We can see this reflected by the more‐traditional roles for Southern women.16 Daniel Elazar notes that the political culture of the region will shape individuals' orientation toward politics and government.17 As a result of the paternalistic component of Southern political culture, we could expect that Southern men and women develop distinct orientations and attitudes about government. Looking at how gender and region intersect can help us understand why the behavior and attitudes of men and women are distinct.            "
"12","While intersectionality is a very helpful framework for thinking about how multiple identities converge to shape political attitudes, it provides minimal guidance in constructing expectations about how attitudes may vary across groups. The theory of intersectionalty suggests that identities converge in unique ways and warns against treating identities in a purely additive fashion, but does not articulate explicit expectations about how identities intersect. Thus, we can expect that identities could complement each other, resulting in larger differences across groups, or contradict each other, causing the differences in attitudes between groups to shrink. Moreover, identities might converge in unique ways for different attitudes or across issue domains. First, I outline the research design and data used for the analysis. Then in the sections below, I briefly review the existing literature on gender differences and regional differences for each issue domain."
"13","The American National Election Studies conducted between 1990 and 2004 are pooled and then divided into sub‐samples by race, gender, and region to create four categories for analysis: Southern white women, Southern white men, non‐Southern white women, and non‐Southern white men. Southern white women serve as the reference category in the analysis that follows for two reasons. First, the behavior of Southern white women is the central focus of this project. Second, employing Southern white women as the comparison category avoids reinforcing social hierarchies; the category of Southern white women has the greatest potential to be seen as the “other,” placing it at the center of analysis works to disrupt existing social hierarchies."
"14","As discussed above, theoretically, the multiple different socially constructed categories of race intersect with regional and gender identities. However, for the purposes of answering the research questions outlined in this paper and speaking to the existing literature, the analysis focuses on white respondents. This does not mitigate the important way in which multiple different racial and ethnic categories like black or Hispanic may intersect with other political identities. Acknowledging white as a racial category moves us away from constructions of race that treat African Americans as the only group of individuals with racial identities or as “others.”"
"15","Since the focus of this project is examining the political attitudes of Southern white women as a unique group, comparisons are limited by focusing on the South compared to the non‐South. The process of Southern realignment has had a profound impact in shaping national politics and has highlighted the importance of understanding Southern political culture. Clearly, grouping many political regions outside of the South together overlooks how these areas may also have unique political identities; however, an examination of each would take us beyond the scope of this article."
"16","Difference‐of‐means tests are preformed to assess the differences between Southern white women, Southern white men, non‐Southern white women, and non‐Southern white men. Thirty‐three different questions covering five topic areas are examined. The research question motivating this project asks what are the similarities and differences in the political attitudes of Southern white women, Southern white men, and non‐Southern white men and women. As a result, the basic difference‐of‐means test without additional explanatory variables is the appropriate method for answering this research question. Too often in social science research, we overlook these simplistic yet informative tools and go directly to more complex multivariate methods. In this case, these more complex methods would be inappropriate for answering the question posed in this article."
"17","Each of the 33 questions was recoded to reflect liberal and conservative responses. Variable identification and recoding information can be found in the Appendix. Recoding the questions in this manner accomplishes two tasks. First, the questions have different numbers of response categories, making comparisons across questions more difficult. For example, party identification and ideology each have seven categories, the question measuring interest in politics has four different categories, and the question measuring political efficacy is on a scale from 1 to 100. Recoding these questions into dummy variables places everything on the same scale, making comparisons across questions more intuitive. Second, recoding the questions in this manner also provides us with a better understanding of the distribution of attitudes. As we know, the same average can be reached with many different distributions. Using a 7‐point scale, we can obtain the same mean value, for example 4, if all of the individuals are clustered around the middle point or if half of the respondents are at 7 on the scale and half of the respondents are at 1 on the scale. Recoding the questions in this way allows us to detect differences among those who hold attitudes without having the middle categories cloud our interpretation."
"18","Pooling the National Election Studies over multiple years has many advantages. First, it provides robust estimates that will not be influenced by a single election. Each election in the United States represents a different set of salient issues and personalities that could prime responses in particular ways. Using data from multiple elections smooths out idiosyncrasies associated with a single election. Second, it provides a large enough sample size and increased efficiency to carry out the analysis. Examining the intersections of social identities in survey data creates a problem with small sub‐samples because of the multiple ways in which the data are divided. Specifically, while there may be an adequate number of individuals who live in the South or are women in any given survey to conduct rigorous analysis, sub‐dividing the sample into finer categories causes the size of the sample to decline to a point where statistical analysis becomes difficult. For example, only 103 respondents in the 2004 ANES were Southern white women. However, pooling the data together increases the sample size to the point where statistical analysis can be conducted. Continuing the previous example, the sub‐sample size for Southern white women is increased to 1,302 by pooling the data across the multiple surveys."
"19","The larger sample size increases the amount of information and subsequently the efficiency of the estimates. Some observers argue that the increased sample size can lead to the statistical significance of small differences and substantively unimportant differences. The smallest difference that is significant in this analysis is approximately 3.5 points, and the average statistically significant difference is about 10 points. These differences are of similar magnitudes to differences regularly observed as politically and substantively important."
"20","Pooling the data together assumes the data‐generating process that produces the attitudes has remained relatively constant over the 14 years of the study; otherwise, the relationship between variables could be misrepresented. Several robustness checks were preformed to test the empirical validity of this assumption. The details about these tests and their results are available upon request. All results remain consistent with those reported in the manuscript."
"21","Finally, a considerable amount of research has pointed to the emergence of a “New South” that has been shaped largely by migration into the South from natives of the North. Robustness checks were preformed that compared native and non‐native Southern men and native and non‐native Southern women. Overall, there were no consistent differences or patterns between native and non‐native Southerners. If anything can be said about the influence of the changing Southern demographics, it is that newcomers to the South make the South look a little more like the rest of the country. The influence of non‐native Southerners on Southern political attitudes is probably limited, because migrants to the South are not a homogenous group and lack a coherent political identity.18"
"22","The intersection of gender, race, and region is examined for five different political orientations: party identification, ideology, interest in politics, political efficacy, and how complicated individuals perceive politics to be. Since at least the 1980s, the political behavior of women as a group has become increasingly scrutinized. This examination stems largely from women's greater propensity to vote for Democratic candidates at all levels of elected office. However, differences in vote choice largely result from differences in ideology and partisan attachments between women and men.19 The gender gap in partisan identification was a precursor to the gender gap in vote choice;20 women are more likely to identify with the Democratic Party, while men have been more likely to identify with the Republican Party.21 Additionally, women also have tended to place themselves more on the liberal end of the ideological scale.22"
"23","While the overall trend in partisan identification for women has resulted in increasing support for the Democratic Party, the process of Southern realignment has represented the erosion of support for the Democratic Party in the South. Starting in the 1950s, partisan attachments have slowly shifted toward the Republican Party.23 Since then, the South has tended to primarily cast its votes for Republican candidates for the presidency and Congress.24 More recently, individual‐level party identification has also become primarily Republican in the South.25 This rise in Republican Party identification in the South aligns its partisan disposition with the more conservative ideology already found in the South.26"
"24","Some evidence suggests that the process of Southern realignment had less of an effect on Southern women's Democratic attachments than it did on men's partisan attachments. When examining shifts in party attachments over the decades, Warren Miller finds that Southern white women still retained their Democratic partisanship at a greater rate than their male counterparts.27 Similar results have been found at the aggregate level, where levels of Southern white women's Democratic macropartisanship are higher than those of Southern white men's macropartisanship.28"
"25","The importance of the gender gap in partisanship highlights the increasing prominence of women in the U.S. political system. However, the gender differences in other forms of political orientations illustrate how women still lag behind men in their psychological engagement with politics.29 Compared to men, women tend to express less interest in politics, are less likely to feel efficacious about government, express less support in the belief that government listens to people like them, and are less likely to feel that people like them have a say in government. Additionally, more women than men feel that government is too complicated for people like them to understand, a finding that has changed little over time.30 Southern women also have been perceived to lag behind women in the rest of the country in terms of elite and mass political participation. Andrew Fullerton and Michael Stern find that Southern women had lower levels of political engagement between 1956 and 1980, which contributed also to Southern women's lower levels of voter registration and turnout.31"
"26","Frequencies for party identification, ideological identification, interest in politics, political efficacy, and perceived complexity of government are reported in Table 1 for Southern white women, Southern white men, non‐Southern white women, and non‐Southern white men. Difference‐of‐means tests are reported using Southern white women as the baseline for comparison. Overall, the results suggest that Southern white women have a distinct orientation toward politics shaped by their gender, race, and geographical region.         "
"27","Southern white women differ from both non‐Southern white women and Southern white men, but only when we examine the Democratic identifiers. About 45 percent of Southern white women identify with the Democratic Party, which is significantly lower than non‐Southern white women (49 percent). On the other hand, Southern white women's identification with the Democratic Party is much higher than the 35 percent of Southern white men who identify with the Democratic Party. Southern white women identify with the Democratic Party at approximately the same rate as non‐Southern white men. In terms of Republican Party identification, Southern white women are significantly less likely to identify as a Republican (43 percent) than either Southern white men (53 percent) or non‐Southern white men (47 percent). There is not a significant difference in Republican identification between non‐Southern white women (40 percent) and Southern white women."
"28","Geographical region appears to play a fundamental role in shaping liberal ideological identification, with no significant difference between Southern white women (16 percent) and Southern white men (16 percent). However, significant differences exist between Southern white women and both men and women outside of the South (20 percent and 22 percent, respectively). At the same time, women in the South do not adopt the conservative label at the same rate as men in the South and non‐Southern white men; with only 32 percent of Southern white women identifying as conservatives compared to 44 percent of Southern white men and 48 percent non‐Southern white men. There is no significant difference between Southern white men and non‐Southern white men in their level of conservative identification. Southern women's level of identification is statistically indistinguishable from the 29 percent of non‐Southern white women who identify as conservatives."
"29","We see more significant differences based on gender than on region for psychological orientations toward politics. Women, regardless of the political region, are more likely to report being not very interested in politics (41 percent of Southern white women, 39 percent of non‐Southern white women) compared to men in both the non‐South (26 percent) and South (26 percent). On the other side of the coin, women are less likely to report that they are very interested in politics (59 percent of Southern white women, 61 percent of non‐Southern white women) than men (74 percent for both Southern and non‐Southern white men). A similar pattern is found for perceptions about how complicated government is: women are more likely than men to perceive government as too complicated, while men are more likely than women to perceive government as not too complicated. There are no significant differences observed along regional lines for these questions. Furthermore, there were no significant differences found for feelings of political efficacy across any of the categories."
"30","The political orientations and psychological attachment to politics is clearly shaped by both gender and region. The appearance that gender plays a more important role for these particular attitudes is probably a result of both constructions of gender identity and Southern identity complementing each other when it comes to an individual's psychological orientation toward politics. As previously discussed, politics has been constructed as a male domain, resulting in women's lower psychological attachment and involvement in politics. The paternalistic elements of Southern political culture seem to reinforce these tendencies for women in the South."
"31","Men and women tend to hold different attitudes toward the size and scope of government.32 Specifically, women tend to hold positions labeled as more compassionate and provide higher levels of support for governmental policies targeted at the less fortunate in society.33 These findings have held up to the test of time and represent enduring differences between men's and women's political attitudes.         "
"32","Very little attention has been paid to how geographical region could also shape the political attitudes of women on the role of government. Two competing scenarios could be at work and serve to uniquely shape Southern women's attitudes toward the size and scope of government. Conservative values in the South have been largely tied to rhetoric that views larger government as bad. Greater support for limited government in the South would not be surprising, given the tense historical relationship between residents of the South and federal government intervention. Thus, Southern women may endorse more limited government than non‐Southern women. On the other hand, the combination of more traditional gender roles and religiosity could result in Southern women taking more liberal positions on the size and scope of government than Southern males. If women's more compassionate policy positions are a result of gender role socialization, we would expect that Southern women would be more compassionate than women in other regions."
"33","Eleven different questions on the size and scope of government are examined. These include a series of questions on federal spending regarding welfare, the poor, food stamps, childcare, individuals with AIDS, education, the environment, and social security, as well as questions about government involvement with health care, government‐guaranteed jobs and standard of living, and increased government services. Each question was recoded into two separate variables; the first measure reflects “pro” responses to the question, reflecting a liberal position, and the second measure reflects “con” responses, reflecting the conservative position. Table 2 reports the levels of support for and against these various policy areas for Southern white women, Southern white men, non‐Southern white women, and non‐Southern white men.         "
"34","Overall, the results tell a story about the importance of gender in terms of shaping men's and women's attitudes about the scope of government. Women, regardless of geographical region, were more likely to take liberal policy positions and less likely to take conservative policy positions than men when it came to questions about compassion for the less fortunate in society or the size of government. In only four instances did Southern white women differ statistically from non‐Southern white women. In one case, Southern women took a more liberal policy stance than non‐Southern women, and in the other three cases, Southern women were more likely to take conservative policy stances compared to non‐Southern women. Specifically, compared to non‐Southern white women, Southern white women were more likely to support increased federal spending on education and decreased spending on food stamps, government‐funded health insurance, and government services."
"35","All told, a greater number of differences are observed between Southern women and men both in and outside of the South. There are 12 significant differences between Southern white women and Southern white men. In all cases, Southern white women expressed more liberal policy positions or were less likely to express conservative policy positions regarding the size and scope of government. Twelve additional differences were observed between Southern white women and non‐Southern white men. In all instances, Southern women took more liberal positions than non‐Southern men."
"36","In addition to the size and scope of government, the willingness to use force internationally has been one of the largest and most long‐standing policy differences between men and women.34 Further, these differences have shaped gender differences in presidential approval35 and influenced the gender gap in the 1980 presidential election.36"
"37","The extant literature on gender differences regarding the military and foreign policy should result in women taking more liberal policy positions across this issue domain. However, this scholarship ignores the role that regional attachments could play in shaping these attitudes. If gender role socialization serves as the basis of gender differences in this policy domain, then the more conservative gender role attitudes found in the South37 might make Southern white women more pacific than the rest of the population in their stances on war. On the other hand, extant research has documented many ways in which Southerners hold distinct views about foreign policy and the military that could result in Southern women demonstrating more conservative attitudes than non‐Southern women. Historically, the South took more of an isolationist stance on foreign policy compared to the Eastern portions of the United States.38 Moreover, the culture of honor found in the South leads Southerners to estimate that there is a higher probability of war breaking out, to believe that diplomacy will be less likely to deter war, and to be more likely to tolerate the escalation of conflicts.39"
"38","Six different policy questions were examined that ask about foreign policy, defense spending, use of military force, fear of both conventional and nuclear war, and foreign aid spending. Each question was recoded into two variables, one reflecting affirmative responses and the other reflecting negative responses. Levels of support for and against these topics are reported in Table 3 for Southern white women, Southern white men, non‐Southern white women, and non‐Southern white men. Once again, Southern white women serve as our comparison category.         "
"39","In terms of military, defense, and foreign policy, the results suggest that region and gender intersect to produce a unique set of attitudes held by Southern white women. Southern white women tended to be more supportive of an isolationist foreign policy (25 percent) than men in both the South (20 percent) and non‐South (21 percent). Southern white women's attitudes on supporting isolationism (26 percent) are statistically indistinguishable from the attitudes of non‐Southern white women. The same pattern holds when we examine those opposed to an isolationist position. Southern white women have attitudes similar to those of non‐Southern white women (72 percent each), and they are less likely than Southern white men (79 percent) and non‐Southern white men (78 percent) to state that they disagree with the idea that the United States would be better off if we were unconcerned with the rest of the world."
"40","Southern women's attitudes regarding decreasing or increasing defense spending appear to be a function of competing tensions between gender and region. Southern women are approximately 8 percentage points less likely than Southern white men to support increases in defense spending (32 percent vs. 39 percent). However, Southern white women are approximately 10 percentage points more likely than non‐Southern white women (21 percent) to support an increase in defense spending. Thus, with non‐Southern women and Southern men at the extremes with respect to favoring increased military spending, Southern women find themselves in the middle ground with non‐Southern men."
"41","The long‐standing difference between men and women on the use of military force appears to be primarily a function of the attitudes of non‐Southern women. Twenty‐six percent of Southern women expressed a willingness to use military force aboard. This level is indistinguishable from that of Southern men (29 percent) and non‐Southern men (24 percent) but significantly higher than the percentage of non‐Southern women willing to use force overseas (20 percent). The opposite pattern is found for opposition to the use of force abroad: non‐Southern women voice the strongest opposition to the use of military force when compared to the rest of the population. The idea that women have a larger emotional reaction to the threat of war holds for conventional warfare but not for nuclear war. Southern women are more likely than Southern men and non‐Southern men to worry about the potential of conventional warfare (24 percent vs. 15 percent vs. 16 percent). Southern women worry about conventional war at approximately the same rate as non‐Southern women (22 percent). When it comes to nuclear war, Southern women still behave most similarly to non‐Southern women (40 percent and 41 percent, respectively), but tend to be less worried about nuclear war than men (51 percent for Southern men and 53 percent for non‐Southern men). Finally, the results generally support the idea that individuals in the United States do not support increased spending for foreign aid. This result holds equally across region and gender. The only significant difference is that non‐Southern men are more likely to support decreasing foreign aid compared to Southern women (59 percent vs. 52 percent)."
"42","Broadly speaking, women tend to be more conservative when it comes to social and moral issues than are men. Women tend to be less supportive of behavior and policies that run counter to traditional norms, such as casual sex and drug use.40 Additionally, women are more supportive of socially conservative polices like school prayer.41 Perhaps one of the more‐intriguing findings is the lack of gender differences in terms of support for abortion, given its framing as a women's issue. Women's higher levels of religious identification account for much of why women hold more socially conservative positions than men.42 However, women's socially conservative inclinations are not present when looking at policies regarding homosexuality.43 M.E. Kite and B.E. Whitely suggest that men's conservative stance, driven by their fear of homosexuality, is largely responsible for the gender differences observed in this topic area.44"
"43","Moral and social issues are the central focus of the culture wars in the United States between red states and blue states.45 Furthermore, geographical regions play a large role in the culture war debates, with the South being on the conservative side. If the culture war argument is correct, then we would expect to see the most similarities within regions and the greatest differences across regions.         "
"44","Seven different questions on social and moral issues are examined. The first three questions concern homosexuality in U. S. society: laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination, homosexuals serving in the military, and the rights of homosexuals to adopt. The next question asks about when abortion should be legal. The final two questions represent broader issues of societal breakdown and moral values. Questions are broken down into two new variables reflecting liberal and conservative responses. Levels of support for and against these policies are given in Table 4.         "
"45","Fifty‐nine percent of Southern white women support laws to protect homosexuals against discrimination, compared to 52 percent of Southern white men; this 7 percentage point difference is statistically significant at the 0.07 level. At the 0.05 level of significance, Southern white women's attitudes are indistinguishable from those of both Southern white men and non‐Southern white men (58 percent). Southern white men were significantly less likely to support laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination compared to non‐Southern white women (72 percent). When asked about homosexuals serving in the military, Southern white women provide significantly fewer liberal responses than non‐Southern white women. However, Southern white women are more liberal than Southern white men and non‐Southern white men in their support for homosexuals serving in the military. The pattern breaks down slightly when examining support for homosexuals being able to adopt children. Southern white women are still less liberal than non‐Southern white women and more liberal than Southern white men, but are statistically indistinguishable from non‐Southern white men. Region plays a fundamental role in shaping attitudes toward abortion. Southern white women and Southern white men are less likely to be pro‐choice and more likely to give pro‐life responses than are non‐Southern white men and women."
"46","The final two questions explored in Table 4 tap general feelings about traditional morals and values. In almost all cases, Southern women took a more socially conservative or traditional stance than any other group. Seventy‐two percent of Southern white women endorse the statement that newer lifestyles are leading to societal breakdown, which is similar to non‐Southern white women (69 percent). However, Southern white women were significantly more likely to agree with the statement than either Southern white men (66 percent) or non‐Southern white men (66 percent). Southern white women are actually the group least likely to disagree with that statement and are significantly less likely than Southern and non‐Southern white men. Southern white women, once again, are less likely to endorse the liberal statement that morals should reflect a changing world, agreeing at a rate of only 31 percent, which is significantly lower than any of the other groups.         "
"47","In sum, region plays a fundamental role in shaping the behavior of both men and women when it comes to moral and social issues. In many cases, Southern women's opinions tended to be closer to Southern men's than to non‐Southern women. However, Southern women's attitudes on social issues most closely resemble those of non‐Southern white men. These results suggest that Southern women's opinions are probably a function of their gender pulling them in one direction, and political context, identified by geographical region, pulling them ideologically in the other direction."
"48","While many observers would automatically assume that women are more likely than men to support women's rights, the existing literature is quick to point out that this assumption is wrong. Few gender differences exist on women's rights issues, with men and women equally supporting governmental policies that promote women's equality.46 Susan Howell and Christine Day, though, find that women are more supportive of feminism than men, a function they link to women's more‐egalitarian beliefs, education, and location in the workforce.47 Women's rights are one of the few areas in which the attitudes of Southern women have previously been examined. Tom Rice and Diane Coates find that Southern women's and men's attitudes about women's equal roles in society, including in the workplace and politics, have grown more egalitarian and more similar to non‐Southerners over time.48 However, Southerners still felt that employed women made poor mothers. Given these findings, we expect to find similarities between women and men and similarities between Southerners and non‐Southerners.         "
"49","Racial politics in the United States underlies many of the political divisions between the South and the rest of the country.49 Racial policies have changed substantially over the past 60 years in the South, largely as a result of legal mandates prohibiting discrimination and segregation. Despite these changes, overt racism appears to be more prevalent in the South than in the rest of the nation and is largely reflective of a “Southern culture” rather than demographic differences.50 Given that Southern culture would affect both men and women in the South, we may see larger differences between regions than gender. However, women tend to hold more liberal racial attitudes than men largely because of their more egalitarian and compassionate views.51 If compassion serves as a base for racial attitudes, then Southern white women may hold more racially liberal attitudes than Southern white men. As reported in the section on the size and scope of government, Southern white women appear to hold more compassionate attitudes and support a larger government than Southern white men. The results would be consistent with James Kuklinski, Michael Cobb, and Martin Gilens's finding that Southern white women are less likely to express feelings of anger about a black family moving into their neighborhood than Southern white men.52 They suggest that gender differences in racial attitudes stem from white men fearing the interaction of white women with blacks.

"50","Only one question about women's rights has been consistently asked over time, the seven‐point equal roles scale. The differences in level of support are reported in Table 5. There is a considerable amount of similarity across region and gender in terms of support for equal roles. The one difference is that non‐Southern white men (73.5 percent) are more likely than Southern white women (68.6 percent) to endorse the statement of equal roles between men and women.         "
"51","The results for racial attitudes and policy are reported at the bottom of Table 5. Two questions touch on racial policy preferences: aid to blacks and affirmative action. Three questions tap general racial attitudes by asking respondents to agree or disagree that historical conditions make it difficult for blacks, blacks should not receive special favors, and blacks must try harder. Each question was recoded into two separate measures reflecting more liberal and more conservative positions. Southern culture appears to dominate the results on racial attitudes. Specifically, there are no significant differences between Southern white women and Southern white men, but both non‐Southern white women and men take more progressive stances than Southern white women.

"52","According to the theory of intersectionality, the confluence of social identities produces a unique context that shapes an individual's experiences and their interpretation of those experiences. In turn, this could result in differences in attitudes and opinions. In order to understand those experiences and the political impact of them, we cannot study social identities in isolation. This conclusion is confirmed by the analysis discussed above. Southern white women speak in a distinctive political voice shaped by both their regional identities and their gender identities across all five different topic areas examined. One aspect of this distinctive political voice is the mix of liberal and conservative policy positions. Southern white women not only identify with the Democratic Party at higher levels than do Southern white men, but they also tend to support the traditional Democratic Party's desire for more government represented by higher levels of support for spending on a variety of issues. However, this perspective is limited to the size and scope of government. Southern white women embrace a more‐conservative policy position on the “newer” social issues that have come to dominate our discussion of party politics. Additionally, Southern white women retain more conservative positions on racial issues. These findings illustrate that when we study gender differences, we need to account for regional differences, and when studying regional politics, we cannot forget that individuals within regions of the United States are gendered as well."
"53","Notably, the analysis presented here indicates that region, race, and gender also fail to interact in an additive fashion. If they did interact, we would expect Southern white women to be most like non‐Southern white men, pulled to a more moderate, middle ground between the more conservative stances attributed to Southerners and the more liberal positions occupied by women. However, this is completely contrary to the findings when looking across the topics analyzed above. Southern white women are actually least like non‐Southern white men, with 39 statistically significant differences across all the policy categories analyzed. Furthermore, Southern white women's attitudes are distinct from the attitudes of Southern white men (31 statistically significant differences) and non‐Southern white women (27 statistically significant differences). This analysis demonstrates the inability to construct a simple hierarchy between gender, race, and region in attitude formation."
"54","The results presented here highlight that there is not a single perspective that reflects women or individuals from the South. Rather, gender, race, and region intersect to create a unique constellation of political attitudes. This raises interesting implications for politicians and political strategists as they work to capture either the “women's vote” or the “Southern vote.” The results above suggest that strategies that are successful at attracting women voters in Michigan might not work in Alabama. Furthermore, tactics used to appeal to Southern voters might be effective on only a portion of the population if they fail to take gender into account."
"55","The racial category of white serves as the focus of the discussion and analysis presented in this manuscript. In empirical research, race is often constructed as a binary category, white or other, suggesting a singular orientation toward politics based on this racial category. However, this research highlights the way in which other identities, gender, and region intersect within a single racial category to produce wide variation in political attitudes. Clearly, further research is warranted on how the multiple constructed categories of race intersect with a host of other political identities to gain a more complete understanding of how social identities influence attitudes and behaviors."
"56","This article provides us with a basic understanding of the similarities and differences in the attitudes of Southern white women, Southern white men, non‐Southern white women, and non‐Southern white men. Given these findings, further research is warranted on two fronts to understand these differences. First, what are the sources of these differences? Second, how do variations in attitudes translate into differences in political behavior across these respective social groups? Greater understanding of these differences will provide further insight into both the party coalitions resulting from Southern realignment as well as the gender gap in vote choice and partisanship.53"
