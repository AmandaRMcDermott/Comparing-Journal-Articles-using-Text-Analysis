"1","THE WAR IS OVER, but a broad understanding of the American experience in Iraq remains elusive. After taking the country by force in 2003, the United States disbanded the Iraqi military, dismantled its bureaucracy, transformed its legal system, and replaced its leadership from top to bottom. The result was a brutal and multi‐headed insurgency, ongoing terrorism, economic stagnation, crumbling infrastructure, rampant criminality, sectarian and ethnic polarization, and low‐grade civil war. Why was Iraq so difficult to govern in the aftermath of the American invasion of 2003, and why did political life fall apart so fully and so quickly? Why did Iraq's new political leaders have such trouble reasserting themselves, and why did a reversal of downward trends begin in 2008? Will an independent Iraq hold together in the future, and what are the implications for American engagement in the region and beyond?"
"2","Answers to these questions will help to explain why U.S. involvement in Iraq itself was puzzling in seemingly contradictory ways. On the one hand, Iraq's insurgency and near collapse between mid‐2003 and late 2007 surprised the George W. Bush administration and its supporters, confounding predictions of an easy military victory and a smooth transition to democracy. The initial war was won in about six weeks, but the peace was lost soon thereafter. The human toll alone was enormous, with over 4,400 American dead and 32,000 wounded, in addition to more than 100,000 documented Iraqi civilian deaths from 2003 to 2011.1 Eventual improvements in Iraqi security and stability, on the other hand, surprised war critics, who were unable to explain the apparent success of “the surge” or the significant drop in attacks and casualties. Iraq did not spiral fully out of control, and it did begin to edge toward recovery. In this sense, pro‐war optimists and anti‐war pessimists alike seemed confounded by the long train of events, inasmuch as neither diagnosed correctly the underlying nature of the problem or understood the logic of potential solutions.         "
"3","This article uses insights from institutional and ideational theory to explain the early failures, later successes, and ongoing dilemmas of the American engagement in Iraq. I claim that the same ideas that led to the war also determined the shape of the peace, or lack thereof, in subsequent years. I argue that most of the pathologies in Iraqi political life since 2003, from sectarian mobilization to insurgent violence, are best understood as consequences of state weakness and failure. I contend, moreover, that Iraq's violence and insecurity reflected externally driven state failure more than internally resurgent ethnic and sectarian cleavages, as the conventional wisdom has asserted. Unlike accounts that treat social division as natural and deep‐rooted, I focus on the international ideas, actions, and inactions that shaped domestic political outcomes in fundamental and underappreciated ways. The coercion and near collapse of the Iraqi “second image” by the American‐led “third” had exceptional consequences that demand full and careful consideration.2"
"4","In the Iraqi case, international actors, led by the United States, were largely responsible for an array of dramatic and sweeping domestic failures. The short, regime‐ending war in March and April 2003 was directed at Saddam Hussein and his military, but the postwar dismantling of the Iraqi state presumed the relative insignificance of state power and authority. This was both by design, in the Bush administration's decision to eliminate instruments of oppression like the Iraqi military, and by ideologically prompted inattention, in the discarding of working‐level Ba'athist bureaucrats, police, and other instruments of organized authority. The United States had trouble restoring security and stability because it had precipitated the virtual collapse of the Iraqi state by undermining its coercive, administrative, legal, and extractive institutions. Without minimally functioning state institutions, domestic governance became all but impossible until new thinking and associated state‐building policies came to the fore."
"5","The underlying problem of forced state failure led to a host of difficulties long after Saddam Hussein and his regime had been deposed. As a direct consequence of the condition, most Iraqis turned for protection to mobilized sectarian and ethnic militias, the largest and most‐salient domestic social aggregates available for military or defensive use. This turn made it much harder for American authorities and, in time, the Iraqi government to reconstitute a viable national state and work toward a reconciled national community. The United States achieved a measure of stability in late 2007 by making an assortment of local, decentralized political–military deals with various armed groups in Iraq. It bought the peace for a time by shifting the calculus of Sunni insurgents and cultivating the support of tribesmen from the Awakening movement. These deals were temporary, however, and were no substitute for long‐term efforts by the Iraqi government to rebuild a fragile state."
"6","While a great many Iraqis have reason to be profoundly skeptical about the Iraqi state, reversing state failure at the national level is essential to achieving more lasting security, stability, and peace. No other governance structure, whether locally or globally oriented, is likely to suffice, and therein lies the dilemma. Iraq today needs a triple transition: a rebuilt state to hold political life together and solve collective problems, substantial democratic development to prevent oppression and defend rights, and the advance of regional peace to keep systemic pressures from driving everything else apart. And it needs all of this at essentially the same time. This is a tall order—indeed, the work of a generation. Half‐measures in any crucial domain, along with the tension between domestic and international imperatives, may undermine the entire project."
"7","The article proceeds as follows. In the first part, having summarized the argument's application to Iraq, I elaborate the conceptual and political origins of the idea of state failure, discuss its internal dynamics, and highlight the externally imposed variety that has become prominent in the past two decades. In the second part, I use the notion of state failure to reframe and illuminate the problem as it has unfolded in Iraq. To do so, I describe briefly the rise, fall, and partial return of the Iraqi state, emphasizing international and ideational factors while teasing out how the war led to state failure by eliminating administrative capabilities, institutional legitimacy, and the security apparatus. Finally, I conclude with a brief discussion of policy implications for the United States, including ongoing debates over Iraq and, by extension, Afghanistan. I note the close connections between state failure and international security, but stress the ways in which security on all levels requires careful attention to the domestic consequences of international actions."
"8","The notion of state failure rose to prominence with the end of the Cold War, the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the collapse of Yugoslavia two decades ago. The idea originated in economic scholarship on bureaucratic rent‐seeking and corruption in the 1970s, contrasted with the more‐established concept of market failure.3 Applied to the political domain in the early 1990s, it acquired a broader, more–varied, and contested usage. Most contemporary theorists have come to use the term to describe a state's inability to perform a range of vital state activities, especially in the areas of security, administration, and territorial control. It is a structural political condition, making it inherently difficult to remedy. Disagreement exists as to whether it describes specific areas of state dysfunction or if it should be reserved for wholesale, systemic institutional failure. Partly in response, analysts have developed allied concepts and alternative formulations to distinguish state failure from state weakness, fragility, crisis, collapse, death, and other political deficiencies.4"
"9","Paradoxically, just when the problem of state failure made its way onto the world stage, the state as a unified set of institutions seemed to make its way off. In the globalizing era of the 1990s, the state became conspicuous in its absence—theoretically, empirically, and normatively. Having brought the state “back in” in the 1980s, comparative theorists retreated from considering it a single entity, while policymakers lamented its declining regulative capacity, pundits declared its demise, and critics scorned its contributions to achieving socially desirable objectives.5 Accompanying the ascendance of the United States as the world's only superpower was a heightened sense that a liberal, American‐style, low‐profile, domestically minimalist state had won the day. This vision informed many of the leading theoretical perspectives in the discipline, including various forms of new institutionalism and the move toward finding the “microfoundations” of political choice.6 While realists and some liberal institutionalists in international relations (IR) theory continued to abide by the fictional but useful notion of the state as unitary actor, comparativists tended to unbundle and disaggregate it, while highlighting its historical specificity as an institutional form.7"
"10","At the same time, diminished interest in the state as a whole was accompanied by rising domestic‐level violence in a number of places worldwide. Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in the late 1980s was followed by a modest, post‐Cold War American retrenchment from some of its global commitments. The reduction in resources available to client and peripheral states came at a time of lessening international attention to domestic conflict. The shift was most pronounced in the ethnic and sectarian upheavals of post‐colonial Asia and Africa.8 Rwanda's assiduously constructed ethnic divide exploded in 1994, eliciting studied indifference by the United States.9 Neighboring Zaire's war‐induced state collapse led to unprecedented regional violence shortly thereafter in circumstances that the United States and the Soviet Union would not have permitted in earlier decades. The Middle East, for its part, had several cases of state failure and distorted development in which external factors played pivotal roles, including in Yemen (reduced labor remittances), Lebanon (Palestinian migration; Israeli and Syrian intervention), Sudan (British colonial impact), and Iraq (American involvement). Not by coincidence, the United States and other powerful international actors distanced themselves from these same hapless states.         "
"11","While rising globalization and the end of the Cold War were hailed in the United States, state weakness and sporadic failure gradually became critical policy concerns. In the transformed political lexicon of the time, “failed states” replaced “rogue states.” The latter formulation was a political pejorative of the 1990s, with little conceptual content despite its effectiveness in isolating American adversaries like Libya, Iran, and Syria. Fears about state failure, in contrast, reflected a trend in diminished state institutional capacity along multiple dimensions: state authorities in a range of places struggled to control territory and monopolize force in facing ethnic and nationalist insurgencies; state bureaucratic capacity fell in tandem with reduced revenue from taxes and the smaller‐is‐better ideological orientation of neoliberalism; and state subsidies to promote economic well‐being and equity in the developing world shrank due to internationally mandated structural adjustment. In this sense, globalization's systemic economic pressure combined with heightened attention to the weakened and fragmented nature of state authority throughout the world.10"
"12","After September 11, pseudo‐scientific indices and rankings tracked state failure in its various forms and degrees.11 Echoing the rising prominence of the concept in policy circles, the U.S. Defense Department made doctrinal and organizational changes to facilitate military operations in environments of state failure and what came to be called “ungoverned territories,” spaces, or areas.12 A narrative emerged depicting Afghanistan's predicament as an unfortunate legacy of benign American neglect after the Soviet withdrawal, rather than deeper, historically rooted problems.13 The September 11 plot was said to have been hatched by an opportunistic al Qaeda, which took advantage of Afghan weakness and social division.14 A primordial view of ethnic, religious, and nationalist conflict framed the political travails of Afghanistan, Somalia, and elsewhere as that of weak governments unable to keep a lid on naturally rising internal tensions.15 The direct roles of international systemic influences and external actors like the United States were minimized or ignored.16"
"13","While recognizing that state failure is not insulated from the international political currents of the day, theorists have tended to approach its etiology from the standpoint of domestic internal causes, with Robert Bates defining state failure as a kind of “implosion” and a loss of control over key aspects of domestic governance.17 They have put domestic politics at the center, consistent with a prevailing, Weberian‐inspired assumption that states fail when they lose their monopoly on the legitimate use of violence in a territory.18 In so doing, they have emphasized the ways in which state institutions underperform, atrophy, and collapse under the weight of domestic conflict. Echoing the term's economic origins, some of these accounts privilege conflicts over natural resources or environmental scarcity and degradation, problems that make it difficult for weak or fragile states to function effectively compared with better endowed states.19 Others emphasize internal governance problems associated with ethnic conflict, democratization, or a local propensity for insurgency, whether in response to prior grievances or driven by greed and the struggle for power, all of which prompt or accelerate state institutional collapse.20 While varying in emphasis, theorists have noted that domestic conflict challenges the state in three particular areas—legitimacy, security, and administration—creating conditions that make failure more likely.         "
"14","A focus on weakened legitimacy highlights the abusive nature of the state and treats societal violence as a reaction to state deficiency in accommodating key social actors and meeting basic societal needs. Political violence is conceptualized as a response to systemic injustice, widespread corruption, or relative deprivation. The principal remedy includes the creation of democratic institutions at the state level and the growth of civil society, the assumption being that the state has to be redesigned to better serve society and reacquire internal legitimacy. International actors, according to this view, are most significant in their capacity to enhance state legitimacy by training locals to apply international standards and practices, enlisting international institutions to provide development assistance, and strengthening civil society. They also can promote democracy on the ground by their support for non‐violent groups and national reconciliation. In so doing, international actors may help to strengthen state legitimacy, though they cannot assure it (Table 1).         "
"15","An emphasis on the problem of security, in turn, reflects the directly detrimental impact of domestic political violence. Even if states fail in other activities, such as economic management or political representation, the control over violence and the provision of physical security figure prominently in many accounts. In this sense, localized violence is conceptualized as a central cause of state failure, especially when it occurs between ethnic groups, including in the high‐profile cases of sub‐Saharan Africa.21 Rather than addressing the underlying reasons for social upheaval, attention to security often treats domestic violence as inherent to certain communities, revealing primordial and essentialist views of the violence‐proneness of these societies. The implicit assumption is that hostility among social groups is long‐standing and deeply engrained, with tension being natural to particular contexts. State failure is deemed largely inevitable in these cases, though the precise point at which internal tensions lead to state failure typically is either unspecified or stipulated after the fact. International actors are seen as a potential remedy to security problems, bolstering local police and military forces or intervening more fully if necessary to create stability, which is presumed to be a prerequisite for effective rule.22"
"16","A third and sometimes overlooked domestic‐level focus is state administration, highlighting the deficiency of national institutions more than the persistence of unregulated violence. Conceptually, analyzing administrative failure presupposes a disaggregated view of the state, parsed into its various ministries, agencies, regulatory structures, and bureaucratic entities, each with its respective rules, personnel, and physical infrastructure. Not an abstract, reified entity, the state is considered a set of formal and informal institutions with some degree of structural capacity to implement core government policies. To remedy administrative failure is to rebuild the state apparatus in all its dimensions. International actors, from this perspective, are viewed as potential contributors to national administrative capacity by undertaking training and reconstruction efforts in the state domain."
"17","In general, state failure is most likely when the problems of legitimacy, security, and administration compound one another. Problems in a single area are unlikely to bring about a failure of the whole. Weak legitimacy does not necessarily lead to state collapse, even if leaders govern unresponsively or are pressured from within or without to liberalize or democratize. Poor security provision does not automatically induce failure, even if a state is unable to prevent political violence, insurgency, or crime. Administrative deficiency alone is not fatal, even if a state is incapable of implementing key policies. Together, however, when serious problems of legitimacy, security, and administration are evident simultaneously, failure is much more likely. As with other complex social phenomena, there are multiple specific paths to the same outcome. But in general, when legitimacy, security, and administration deteriorate in any substantial combination, state prospects become grim."
"18","The variable paths and dimensions of failure notwithstanding, international actors typically have been conceptualized as benign or even benevolent potential solutions to state‐level shortcomings rather than as problems in themselves, or causally prior sources of the difficulties states face. Despite an extensive body of research on the international sources of domestic politics, little direct and explicit attention has been paid to the external origins of many instances of state failure.23 This inattention may reflect differences in the subfields, with IR scholars privileging international variables and comparativists assuming the primacy of internal causes. It also may emanate from subtle or implicit assumptions about the inevitability of failure for states embedded in particular cultural and regional contexts. Even if external factors play a role, analysts frequently deem them less important to states internally primed for problems.         "
"19","An emphasis on external international factors, in contrast, mirrors the long‐established work of theorists in other areas of state activity, who have conceptualized the international level of analysis as more than an incidental trigger or a secondary influence on domestic actors.24 In a globalizing world, where international and domestic politics are increasingly connected, external factors inevitably shape the likelihood of state failure. At least some of the political, social, and economic indicators of a state's domestic vulnerability are sometimes externally derived. International pressures work through the same domestic mechanisms of failure explored by comparative theorists: legitimacy, security, and administration. But in many instances, the fundamental impetus originates beyond state borders. Just as international actors have supported and affirmed the sovereign rights of state authorities since Westphalia, they also have played noteworthy roles in bringing about state failure in some cases. These cases have risen to prominence in recent years, particularly as failed states have become entangled in international conflict.         "
"20","In all such cases, international actors create or exacerbate domestic problems of state legitimacy, security, and administration. External actors may compromise a state's legitimacy by reducing the state's capacity to provide collective goods or meet the needs of major social groups. This can occur regardless of regime type or historical period. European colonial powers, for example, undermined post‐colonial state legitimacy decades ago by cultivating social divisions that made later governance more difficult. External actors may weaken domestic security by limiting the state's capacity to exercise authority in the face of social upheaval. While occupation provides an extreme example, foreign military assistance to one side in an internal conflict may perpetuate political violence. Finally, external actors may undermine domestic administration by weakening state capacity to implement its policies more generally. State administrative capacity may even atrophy or remain undeveloped under the influence of international economic relations that inhibit institutional change.25"
"21","Many of these possibilities are evident in the most‐prominent contemporary cases of state failure, even if the dominant accounts of their various pathologies remain centered on domestic‐level problems. Close attention to the Iraqi case illuminates the example and demonstrates the logic and significance of forced state failure (Figure 1).         "
"22","State failure matters because some things, once broken, cannot easily be fixed. Once the Iraqi state fell like Humpty‐Dumpty off the wall—pushed, in fact, by American intervention—it shattered into many pieces and could not be put back together without years of effort and exceptional human and material cost. This simple insight, echoed in a ninteenth‐century English nursery rhyme, speaks volumes about the problems that Iraq and the United States have experienced since 2003. Externally induced state failure has no rapid, low‐cost remedy because states are easier to break than to make, even for the dominant actor in a unipolar world.26 And until the Iraqi state is reconstituted, there can be no stability, no democracy, no lasting end to civil unrest, and no regional peace.27"
"23","Admittedly, Iraqi state failure is less evident today than it was five years ago. Iraq has remained one country, despite an extraordinary invasion by the world's only superpower, followed by several years of destructive upheaval. It has all the trappings of juridical statehood, even if the empirical reality is less evident. It has an increasingly assertive and confident government, a weak but growing military and police force, a carefully written constitution, a national anthem, and a flag. It has held more than one round of reasonably democratic elections. It has near‐universal international recognition, with diplomats in dozens of countries and a seat at the United Nations. And it has a population of over thirty million people, most of whom retain a sense of shared identity, or at least a shared history that leads them to continue to identify themselves as Iraqis. Even its long‐suffering Kurdish population has not made a serious recent bid for independence; the most frequent and recurring calls for partitioning Iraq have come from outside the country.28"
"24","These important markers of a common political space and nascent institutions notwithstanding, no remotely well‐functioning state exists in Iraq today, much less a consolidated democratic regime with institutionalized mechanisms to govern responsively and accountably. This is the central political challenge facing the Baghdad government, and it is likely to remain so for some time. Both external intervention and internal conflict have led to the deterioration of everything from the country's formal institutions of law, coercion, and administration to any lasting sense of security and national unity. Iraq remains gripped by a simmering, sometimes latent civil conflict, verging at times on civil war—by definition, a struggle over who will be at the helm of the political organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force in the territory. Iraq's current conflict is not like the American Civil War, which evokes images of the Blue and the Gray fighting formal, set‐piece battles. Its upheaval is a twenty‐first‐century affair, with more than two sides, substantial international involvement, extended duration, and civilians suffering most of the casualties.29"
"25","Decisive international involvement has marked every phase of the creation, rise, fall, and ongoing reconstitution of the Iraqi state. Iraq's early, modestly developed state bureaucracy was created in the 1920s by British colonial powers, who enlisted Sunni Arab officials from the former Ottoman imperial provinces of Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra.30 The early state was led by an artificial monarchy established and imposed by Britain. Iraq had no prior monarchy or national‐scale political organization, even if the Land between the Two Rivers was one of the oldest settled communities in the world.31 A small nationalist faction of military officers ended the monarchy in a bloody coup in 1958, ushering in a decade of political instability until the Ba'athists took decisive control in 1968.32 The Ba'athists in subsequent years had access to dramatically rising external oil rents, especially after 1973, and built a modernizing state apparatus. The regime did not transform the social landscape entirely, choosing instead to maintain, co‐opt, and even promote traditional social structures like clans, tribes, and tribal confederations, while tapping into Iraq's ancient Mesopotamian history to cultivate a unique national identity.33 It did use the state, however, to create an exceptionally oppressive “Republic of Fear.”34"
"26","Under Saddam's direct rule beginning in 1979, state institutional development began to peak, though the Iraqi leader took actions that precipitated an international response that led eventually to state failure. Most significantly, Saddam launched invasions of neighboring Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990. While profoundly costly in many ways, both wars created opportunities for the consolidation of state power, the growth of the security apparatus, and the elimination of domestic adversaries.35 From 1991 to 2003, in turn, the Iraqi state was subject to severe UN‐authorized sanctions and international isolation. These circumstances provided a mechanism and rationale for further consolidation of state power and the weakening of social forces in opposition to Saddam's rule. In this sense, throughout Saddam's twenty‐four‐year rule, Iraq experienced an internationally driven double movement: the growth of state security institutions via war and perceived or invoked foreign threats, and the paring down of most other state and societal institutions by the intense international pressures of war and economic isolation. This double movement distorted the shape of the Iraqi state and led to a downward spiral of sanctions, seclusion, and institutional weakness.36 It also gave Saddam an incentive to create some ambiguity regarding his regime's possession of weapons of mass destruction. This ambiguity facilitated and even helped to inspire the Bush administration's drive to war in Iraq by March 2003.37"
"27","The Iraq war itself was launched in 2003 because key officials in the Bush administration saw it as a necessary and appropriate response to the threats and opportunities facing the United States after September 11.38 The war and subsequent occupation damaged the Iraqi state in three ways. First, it nearly destroyed the administrative capacity of the state, requiring the occupation authorities to rebuild in this area while contending with the other major consequences of the war. Second, the wartime and postwar dismantling of the Iraqi military and security services crippled the state's capacity to control violence and maintain order, creating an absolute dependence on foreign military power. Finally, the war undermined state legitimacy, producing a high level of political uncertainty and insecurity, which led to ethnic and sectarian mobilization and conflict.            "
"28","American military forces began Operation Iraqi Freedom with a vaunted “shock and awe” campaign designed to decapitate the regime while striking a crippling blow at the state itself.39 Aside from efforts to kill the Iraqi president and smash the regime and its military power, American forces attacked a wide range of public facilities and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, electrical transformers, and communications. By its conclusion, the campaign had targeted most government ministries and devastated the institutional apparatus of state decision making.40 While the Ministry of Oil complex in northeast Baghdad's Mustansiriya neighborhood was spared, few other physical or bureaucratic manifestations of the Iraqi state escaped the opening phases of the war.41 A further blow to the administrative infrastructure was struck by Iraqis themselves, who ransacked and looted almost all the remaining ministries after the regime's collapse in April 2003.42 Reflecting the ideological predisposition of the war's planners, U.S. forces reportedly had no clear instructions from Central Command, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, or the White House to contend with such an eventuality, and the Pentagon's newly established Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance proved unable to manage stabilizing efforts.43 In a few short months, the administrative capacity of the Iraqi state was in ruins, disabling subsequent efforts to devise and implement new policies and return power to Iraqi nationals.44"
"29","If the war itself damaged the Iraqi state, the postwar American occupation authorities were even more systematic in ridding Iraq of state administrative authority and transforming its institutional landscape. Most famously, L. Paul Bremer's Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) eliminated or acquiesced to the removal of the upper tier of the bureaucracy that Saddam and the Ba'athists had built.45 With Order No. 1 of 16 May 2003, the CPA expelled tens of thousands of Ba'ath Party members from government service, even if it left in place various mid‐range functionaries and street‐level bureaucrats.46 In the months that followed, the CPA overturned the state's law‐making apparatus, substituting over 100 administrative decrees and creating eventually a transitional administrative law, which was replaced by a new constitution in 2005.47 Not confining itself to the political domain, the CPA made plans to liberalize the economy by slashing subsidies on food and energy, promoting foreign direct investment, and introducing international banking.48 Its Office of Private Sector Development prepared to privatize or close most of the country's 189 state‐owned enterprises, targeting over 100,000 Iraqi employees for firing or forced retirement.49 Given the larger context of the invasion and the unraveling of organized authority, these measures opened to contestation the most basic questions of political life, all but collapsing the Iraqi state as an organization and undermining the Iraqi nation as a community.               "
"30","No available evidence suggests that the Bush administration anticipated or desired the turmoil and destruction that its actions brought to Iraq. The administration leaned hard on the regime and brought down the state in the process, not as a core political objective so much as a byproduct of the strategy informing its entire approach to the matter. Because Saddam's regime was wholly and irredeemably authoritarian, the White House considered a change in personnel at the very top insufficiently transformative. The Ba'athists had to be displaced, even at the risk of what was expected to be minor, temporary instability. This was an easy argument to make—no one could defend the regime—but it created an immediate, practical dilemma, the resolution of which rested on a more distant, unstated assumption. The dilemma was evident in deciding where to draw the line in winnowing out former regime members and political cadres who also had bureaucratic, technical, or military experience needed in a post‐Saddam Iraq. The unstated assumption, shared by the war's authors, was a deeply Manichean sense of political life: a clearly demarcated world of good and evil. This animating idea, which was at the heart of the drive to invade Iraq in the first place, made it seem appropriate to take an aggressive approach to purging former regime members. Just as ideational and ideological considerations were paramount in the run‐up to the war, they also shaped choices in its aftermath.50"
"31","In this fundamental sense, state failure in Iraq was a logical culmination of the Bush administration's ideologically minimalist vision of the role and necessity of the state in political life. It was not a simple error or oversight, so much as a natural implication of the administration's presumptive commitment to first principles devaluing the state.51 This vision started from the premise that transforming Iraqi politics required disassembling many of its major political institutions, or at least not making their reconstitution a priority, as evidenced by the CPA's acute staffing shortage and inexperienced personnel.52 The guiding assumption was that eliminating the specific institutional mechanisms of authoritarian rule—everything from courts and jails to the Baath Party, security services, and officer corps—would suffice to ensure freedom and democratic development. Iraqis themselves, from this point of view, were expected to reconfigure political authority in congenial, democratic forms, aided at most by modest and neutral technical expertise from temporary occupiers.53 Building new state structures like an array of public institutions to channel political activism and influence behavior figured little in such a plan because the administration, with its small‐state, private‐sector orientation, tended to view government activity as problem, more than solution.54"
"32","The most obvious security effect of the invasion was the persistence and subsequent growth of domestic political violence in its chaotic aftermath. This can be traced partly to the CPA's “dissolution” of the military and security forces under Order No. 2 of 23 May 2003, which sent home hundreds of thousands of trained soldiers and officers.55 Elements of the state apparatus eliminated by this order included the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Information, the Ministry of State for Military Affairs, the Iraqi Intelligence Service, and all subsidiary military, paramilitary, and intelligence organizations. The order also included the Revolutionary Command Council, the National Assembly, and the Revolutionary, Special and National Security Courts. Accordingly, this eliminated Iraq's state coercive apparatus without replacing it fully and immediately with either U.S. occupation forces, a comparable international contingent, or revamped and repurposed Iraqi forces. Without a capable mechanism to provide security, rein in the most implacable militants, oust foreign agitators, and assure the rule of law, little could be done to prevent an almost immediate deterioration after the regime's collapse in late April 2003. Untold numbers of individuals from the various state institutions shifted from potential supporters to determined opponents of a post‐Saddam Iraq, forming the heart of the insurgency and launching the civil war that developed in subsequent months. American forces proved unable to stem the violence (Table 2).56"
"33","Eventually, three changes in American strategy, each with significant ideational origins and state‐related implications, began to improve security conditions in Iraq. First, building on the Anbar Awakening of tribal leaders who had become disillusioned with the insurgency, the United States started co‐opting tens of thousands of Sunni tribesmen—some of them former insurgents—incorporating them into a network of “Iraqi security volunteers” in September 2006.57 With their hiring and training, substantial military elements flipped from erstwhile American adversaries to at least temporary allies, providing local security and keeping the peace. Second, American counterinsurgency (COIN) doctrine underwent a rapid but extensive reexamination, shifting from an “enemy‐centric” to a “population‐centric” doctrine.58 With this new approach, American counterinsurgents sought, among other things, to strengthen Iraqi government legitimacy by protecting average Iraqis while engaging in what amounted to state‐building. Finally, a January 2007 U.S. initiative referred to commonly as “the surge” led to the deployment of approximately 30,000 additional American troops to Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq.59 Driven partly by domestic political pressure from the 2006 congressional midterm elections and manifest failings in the American effort, the surge was designed to bring greater stability to the country by reinforcing key sites in and around the capital.               "
"34","The combined results surprised many observers, with a dramatic reduction in civilian and military casualties throughout Iraq by early 2008, as U.S. troops augmented growing Iraqi security forces, cultivated the support of newly recruited security volunteers, and sought to win the “hearts and minds” of the Iraqi population through better COIN techniques.60 Political violence also may have declined because U.S. military power repressed insurgents, local and national Iraqi forces deterred them, and ethnic and sectarian conflict already had separated populations sufficiently.61 Regardless, domestic developments like the Anbar Awakening joined U.S. and Iraqi government efforts to reverse the momentum on the ground. 2008 proved to be a watershed in the war, as the Iraqi army and police made progress toward reasserting the state's role in providing security and stability, however tenuous and fragile.               "
"35","Finally, forced state failure in Iraq had immediate consequences for domestic social relations, most notably in the ethnic and sectarian tensions that emerged after the insurgency developed in mid‐2003. Rising violence and unchecked lawlessness in the war's immediate aftermath endangered average Iraqis, who could not turn to state authorities or an international presence for protection. Many responded by calling on extended families and social connections, especially those with whom they shared ethnic or sectarian bonds. Following “self‐help” strategies, they retreated into the ethnic and sectarian dimensions of their identities, because this was the most reliable and readily available means of self‐defense.62 With a diminished local source of security and an undersized international contingent, Iraqis mobilized in ways consistent with a distorted and atrophied civil society that had experienced years of state oppression and internationally mandated deprivation.               "
"36","Ethnic and sectarian identities acquired heightened importance because of the structurally induced political uncertainty created by state failure. Mobilization along such lines—even for defensive purposes—led to an “ethnic security dilemma” also found in earlier cases of state failure, most notably in the former Yugoslavia.63 As individuals and groups joined others with whom they had social commonalities, they became more powerful and potentially threatening to other groups, who responded accordingly. At least some Iraqis joined militias out of fear, and when such fears and other grievances led to counter‐grievances, political violence resulted. This happened not because it was inherent in Iraqi ethnic or sectarian differences, but because there was no larger organized authority or political power to prevent minor conflicts from becoming major ones, to minimize the settling of old scores, or to keep domestic and international opportunists from raising the pressure to build their own support. In the absence of capable, nationally organized political authority, people found other sources of protection.64"
"37","Never politically monolithic, even under Ba'athist rule, Iraqi Shiite mobilization and activism took various forms, with the population divided among several political factions and associated militias. These groups were organized by leaders with ties to the clerical establishment, exile groups, political movements based in Iran, and the underground opposition. The Sunnis, for their part, were most disadvantaged by Saddam Hussein's removal and contributed to a variety of insurgent groups. Having lost control of the state, the Sunni minority sought to regain it while defending itself from much‐feared retribution for decades of dominance in national politics. The Kurds, finally, strengthened their existing political and military organizations in the north under the long‐standing factions led by Jalal Talibani and Massoud Barzani. The Kurdish political position vis‐à‐vis the state was distinctive for many reasons, including the de facto autonomy of the Kurdish north under the Kurdistan Regional Government and an ethno‐nationalism that for years had put most Kurds at odds with their Arab co‐religionists of either sectarian identity."
"38","While Iraqi forced state failure led to domestic upheaval, this was not an inevitable result of the diversity of Iraq's political community. Many countries, after all, are more diverse than Iraq in ethnic and racial terms, more divided in popular political aspirations, more artificial in their borders, more impoverished in human and natural resources, and more heterogeneous in their sectarian divisions. Open and sustained political violence is uncommon in most of these places—the United States among them—because they have functioning state institutions and, in the best cases, democratic regimes that enhance state legitimacy and channel social grievances toward non‐violent resolution most of the time, however imperfectly. To make a direct causal connection between Iraqi social diversity and domestic political violence is to ignore the institutional and international contexts that are at the heart of politics in Iraq and beyond."
"39","With externally induced state failure leading to ethnic and sectarian violence, moreover, political reconciliation was not a productive solution to the problem. Calls for reconciliation revealed a false diagnosis of Iraq's key difficulties, which were institutional as much as communal. After 2003, it was not that Iraqis could never get along with each other; it was that they could get not along without mechanisms to minimize fear and vulnerability in a profoundly uncertain political environment. This was especially true because postwar Iraq was primed for a disastrous outbreak of violence, given the extent to which fear had pervaded Saddam's Iraq after nearly two decades of continuous war, sanctions, social deprivation, and political oppression. Without Saddam's regime—Iraq's Leviathan in the worst sense—it should not have been surprising that the country flew apart in the war's aftermath."
"40","American actions in Iraq, like its larger approach to conflict resolution in the Middle East, reflected the assumption that improved human relations—trust and reconciliation between contending social groups—were critical sources of political stability and progress.65 Rarely mentioned by the President and his advisers, the Iraqi state was expected to play a relatively minor role, helping primarily to solve basic collective problems, facilitate individual political and economic initiatives, and implement decisions reached largely outside its confines.66 Treating politics like a garden to be tended may work in the American context, but only because the United States is sufficiently powerful to prevent international adversaries from intervening directly in its national political life. American institutions have not always been successful in mediating political troubles, most notably in the American Civil War, the bloodiest episode—foreign or domestic—in U.S. history. When foreign threats have posed grave challenges to the United States, whether during the Cold War or the war on terror, domestic institutional change has been rapid, significant, and enduring. It defies all reason to expect Iraqis to interact freely and peaceably in a weakly institutionalized environment, with an open struggle for political primacy, ethnic and sectarian mobilization, foreign interference and occupation, and a post‐authoritarian legacy of violence and mistrust.               "
"41","The conventional view of what went wrong in Iraq is simple and reasonable. It holds that if the United States had only deployed more troops in 2003, positioned them better, maintained border control, kept the Iraqi military and Ba'athist bureaucrats engaged—if it had invaded Iraq with enough troops and a careful postwar plan that it implemented properly—the insurgency and civil war could have been avoided. A host of government officials, security experts, journalists, and military leaders have made this claim, some even before the war was launched.67 It is hard to contest, because it captures a critical aspect of the tragedy of the Iraq war—a war of choice but also a war of poor choices.         "
"42","This view is shortsighted, however, because what went wrong in Iraq was not simply poor planning and implementation, and to frame it as such is to miss the point.68 In fact, the Bush administration was never likely to have launched and conducted the war in ways conducive to a significantly better outcome. Most of the high‐ranking officials in the administration were so ideologically predisposed to ridding Iraq of state authority—not just Saddam's noxious regime—that it is hard to imagine the war having achieved any other result. Deploying half a million U.S. troops, keeping Ba'athists in positions of authority, maintaining the Iraqi military, and forgoing democratization would have contradicted the fundamental ideational impetus to the war. Such actions also would have been politically difficult, if not impossible. In this regard, the very decision to go to war with a purpose and a plan that made sense to the administration contained the seeds of Iraqi state failure, with all the attendant consequences. The same thinking that caused the war also precluded a decent peace in the ensuing years.69"
"43","This is not to say that another administration, differently oriented, could have invaded the country and deposed Saddam easily and without damage to the Iraqi state. With the regime deeply implicated in state institutions on all levels, more U.S. troops and sensible planning from the outset might have reduced some of the spectacular violence and upheaval, but success still would have required a wholesale restructuring of the Iraqi state—a deeply unpalatable project for any external actor under most circumstances. Iraq is therefore a cautionary tale with wider implications, because even if the Bush administration had not been predisposed to dismantling the Iraqi state, it would have had a hard time achieving anything worth the cost. For this reason, the war itself should not be viewed as badly conducted so much as badly conceived. It was a fool's errand from the start, not because Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction—another conventional critique—but because military power is a blunt instrument in the pursuit of political change."
"44","Regardless of the inherent difficulties, the conventional view is also deficient in that few analysts frame the Iraq war and its troubles explicitly in terms of externally induced state failure, preferring simpler formulations—flawed planning and military deployments—to account for the initial failures and later successes of the American initiative. This approach tells only the obvious part of the story, skipping the causally prior ideational dimension that explains these errors. The ideas dominant in American thinking about the war led observers to emphasize variables that were significant but not always fundamental (ethnic and sectarian cleavage), while nearly ignoring other variables that were paramount (state institutions). The result was akin to a socially shared cognitive bias that privileged one set of ready‐made, easily recognizable factors over all others. It promoted a kind of seeing and not seeing, or political hallucination and myopia."
"45","Direct attention to state failure provides a superior analytical key, because a broad‐gauged emphasis on the state is markedly better than a narrow focus on troop numbers, “the surge,” or any other one‐dimensional explanation for Iraq's myriad problems over the years. It captures the multifaceted and complex nature of the challenge in a single, well‐established concept. It speaks prescriptively to the ongoing importance of rebuilding state institutions in the present and future. And it avoids the conceptual and policy confusion that has accompanied references to “nation building,” rather than to what really has been happening in the reconfiguration of Iraqi political institutions. This might seem like a minor semantic distinction, but the persistent misidentification of Iraq's troubles as social and communal rather than political and institutional had major and deadly consequences for the country and its occupiers."
"46","Accordingly, a focus on forced state failure offers both general and Iraq‐specific lessons for efforts to rebuild state institutions and authority. In broadest terms, the analysis supports the claim that once a state is knocked over, setting it right again is no small task—not just a matter of holding elections, establishing a government, making sound policy choices, or having enough troops, either initially or eventually. State‐building typically is a long historical process, best conducted by those with permanent stakes on the ground. Successful state builders tend to have extended time horizons, as well as the resources, commitments, insights, political support, and status not available to outsiders. European state formation, after all, occurred over centuries, just as the American experience was drawn out, included a costly Civil War, and occurred under relatively benign international conditions. State and nation building in postcolonial contexts rarely goes smoothly in either its institutional or communal dimensions, much less in responding to calls for democracy.70"
"47","State‐building after external intervention is especially difficult, because even the most aggressively forced state failure does not mean the elimination—erased existence—of all institutional history. Earlier institutional choices and conditions can have an ongoing influence on later events.71 Institutions live on in revamped organizations, collective and individual memories, bureaucratic norms and work routines, and state workers’ training and established procedures. Like a demolished house, the building material is present, to be reassembled or swept away by future builders, though never entirely. Institutional change, in this sense, does not occur in a political vacuum. People fight about it. People are fighting not just to win the political game; they are fighting over the very rules of the game.72"
"48","Equally broadly, American involvement in Iraq suggests that international powers usually are too distant, in various ways, to correct all the many domestic failures of state legitimacy, security, and administration induced in the course of a major intervention. An external power might be able to undermine state legitimacy, but it cannot restore it at will. The much‐publicized restoration of Iraqi sovereignty in June 2004 ignored the reality that sovereignty is as much about legitimate domestic authority as it is about international recognition.73 An external power might also be able to eliminate state military power and a domestic security apparatus, but doing so opens up a Pandora's box of trouble and puts the external power in a poor position to rebuild what it has destroyed or displaced. Likewise, an external power might be able to remove the state administration, but this creates an immediate need to take charge of administrative functions and serve as a surrogate state until such capacity can be rebuilt. Restoring this capacity is like repairing a sinking ship at sea, where everyone wants to be captain.         "
"49","Explicit attention to the dilemmas created by forced state failure also can illuminate American‐led international involvement elsewhere, including Afghanistan. It tells us that if the prospects for success in Iraq are uncertain, they are all but nonexistent in Afghanistan. Unlike Iraq, Afghanistan is not actually a failed state, externally induced or otherwise, never having had a fully articulated national state, much less experienced forced state failure. For a complex array of historical reasons, its governance has remained relatively localized and traditional, with no effective national‐scale political party or organization extending throughout the land, and no successful effort to transform the social and political landscape by modern state‐builders. As a result, the ongoing struggle between the U.S.‐led International Security Assistance Force and a resurgent Taliban is unlikely to end with a satisfactory outcome for the United States, which cannot remain engaged for remotely as long as the state‐building process requires. An emphasis on the deep shortcomings of the Afghan state itself—not only its erratic leadership, corruption problems, or the country's tribal social structures—would illuminate the American dilemma in South Asia, as the drumbeat of withdrawal from Afghanistan grows louder in anticipation of an end to the ISAF mission in 2014."
"50","Equally significant are the lessons of Iraqi state failure for political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa, where attention to state‐level pathologies and their international connections is essential. In the upheaval of the Arab Spring, for example, events in Libya and Yemen unfolded very differently from those in Egypt and Tunisia, not only because Muammar el‐Qaddafi differed from Hosni Mubarak but because Libyan and Egyptian state institutions differed fundamentally. To the south, Sudan's division into two countries, ending an ill‐conceived colonial project, remains commonly mischaracterized as a product of ethnic and sectarian tensions rather than state failure. Syria has been an object lesson in what vicious and desperate state leaders still can do with the acquiescence of powerful international actors and in full view of a divided international community. In Lebanon, Hezbollah continues to operate as a rump‐state within a virtual non‐state with limited prospects, given the extent of international involvement. More broadly, state‐level deficiencies explain why there still are pirates off the coast of Somalia, warlords in Afghanistan, and persistently powerful tribes in Libya, Yemen, and beyond.74 To address all these issues, American policymakers need to make clearer connections between the international actions and conditions that promote state failure and the resulting political blowback that often comes back to haunt the world.         "
"51","Having withdrawn from Iraq, the challenge for the United States today is to remain sufficiently engaged to avoid a profoundly compromised outcome that harms the interests of all concerned. A great deal is still uncertain, for it remains to be seen whether Iraq will yield mixed success or will become a sharper failure. While the administration of Barack Obama is not responsible for the original invasion, it must be attentive to how the entire episode affects perceptions of American leadership, both globally and in the Middle East. As it stands, the failure to negotiate a deal for U.S. troop immunity in 2011 transformed the drawdown into a complete pullout, further diminishing America's capacity to support and stabilize an independent Iraq. This problem is especially acute at a time when U.S. leadership in the region is becoming increasingly irrelevant to everything from the Arab–Israeli conflict to democratization initiatives."
"52","Ultimately, the heart of the dilemma is that Iraq needs a triple transition—a rebuilt state, lasting movement toward democracy, and regional peace—but the prospects for each are slight, and all three are interconnected. A reconstituted Iraqi state is under way, though it was not achieved before the American departure. Iraqi democracy, for its part, is likely to remain tenuous, not due to any cultural incompatibility with democratic governance, but because democratic regimes presuppose coherent state institutions, which are essential to the rule of law. Finally, the movement toward regional peace is bleaker than it has been for two decades, with renewed Arab–Israeli tension, a frozen Palestinian–Israeli peace process, a game‐changing Iranian nuclear initiative, sinking Turkish–Israeli relations, and peripheral pressures from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Lebanon, and Sudan. Locally driven democratic initiatives across the region bode well for the future, but it is hard to imagine the toughest cases—Syria, Libya, Yemen—achieving successful transitions without significant further turmoil and loss of life."
"53","This is the real dilemma created by forced state failure in Iraq. Not only are state, regime, and regional transformations in all three areas unlikely, but the dynamics of domestic and international change are potentially at odds with each other. One cannot achieve Iraqi democracy without rebuilding the Iraqi state, though external actors may overwhelm or distort the internal necessities of state building. Regional peace would purchase extraordinary goodwill on the Iraq front, but its absence makes an Iraqi solution much more difficult by encouraging foreign powers to meddle in Iraq. At a minimum, the Iraq experience has made it clearer than ever that domestic political change is not easily accomplished through international military intervention. The hubris of great powers seeking to remake the world is almost as old as Iraq itself; the consequences will endure."
