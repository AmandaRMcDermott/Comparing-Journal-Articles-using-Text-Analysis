"1","When studying public opinion regarding immigration, scholars tend to focus on the effect of partisanship or ideology on Americans' policy preferences. Rarely do political scientists consider factors like race or ethnicity as anything other than a simple control variable in the analysis. In The Politics of Belonging, however, Natalie Masuoka and Jane Junn move the study of racial identity to center‐stage by arguing that the distinct historical experiences of America's largest racial groups—whites, African Americans, Latinos, and Asians—shape important differences in their attitudes toward immigration.         "
"2","But The Politics of Belonging is much more than a book about immigration; instead, it is a study of intergroup relations and the effects of the perceived racial hierarchy in American society. In concert with existing research, Masuoka and Junn provide evidence that despite their differences, the public widely recognizes and agrees upon the rank ordering of racial groups along the status hierarchy, which they liken to a tilted diamond shape. They find that white Americans rank highest in group status because of their ties to the country's “Founders” (for example, see Huntington, 2004), while African Americans anchor the bottom of the hierarchy because of past injustices of slavery and segregation. Asians are theorized to be located above Latinos because they have historically enjoyed better economic and educational prospects. Most importantly, the “racial hierarchy creates incentives and costs for adopting politically salient identities” (p. 26), and these identities are defined by the idea of a “linked fate” to the group, as well as traits that characterize the boundaries of what it means to be a “true” American.         "
"3","The implication of what Masuoka and Junn call the racial prism of group identity (RPGI) model is that immigration attitudes are largely a reflection of self‐interest: lower‐status minorities recognize their relative disadvantage in society, and thus endorse attributes of national identity associated with their own group, as well as supporting permissive immigration policies. For example, African Americans are more likely to characterize a true American as one who is born in the United States, and is a Christian, whereas Asians deemphasize these attributes in favor of more‐porous boundaries that do not lead to their exclusion. Thus, opinion on immigration policy is an expression of racial belonging in the United States because these identities represent the opportunities or constraints that each respective group experiences."
"4","A real strength of the book is the authors' multi‐method approach, which includes the analysis of historical immigration trends, nationally representative survey datasets containing large subsamples of racial and ethnic minorities, and an original experiment. As with any large research project, there are times when the data do not perfectly conform to the authors' expectations; yet, on the whole, the results do support the overarching theory. One methodological concern about the book is the authors' heavy reliance upon comparative relational analysis, which involves estimating separate regression models for each racial subgroup. Although this method may reveal the factors operative for each subgroup, the reader is left to wonder whether these effects differ significantly across racial groups. In other words, a careful test of the RPGI theory would be an interaction among racial identity and other predictors of interest (for example, linked fate, American boundaries, etc.), which is not presented in the text. Despite this issue, The Politics of Belonging is a must‐read and makes an important contribution to the study of race relations and immigration in America.         "
