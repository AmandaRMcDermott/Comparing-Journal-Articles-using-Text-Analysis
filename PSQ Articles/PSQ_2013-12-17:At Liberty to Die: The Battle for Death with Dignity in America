"1","In his recently published book, Howard Ball does a superb job of documenting and explaining the key legal principles that frame the right‐to‐die debate in the United States. At Liberty to Die: The Battle for Death with Dignity in America illustrates clearly that jurisprudential matters are Ball's strong suit, and he plays his cards well, touching on all the key court cases while also covering the battles to enact right‐to‐die legislation in several states. The writing is crisp; the key points of disagreement are clearly laid out, the coverage is both balanced and comprehensive, and the context of the legal maneuvering provided by Ball throughout make his book an interesting as well as an educational read.         "
"2","Ball's work is less persuasive with regard to its premise that “American transplants…terminally ill people crossing state lines to enter those states that allow medical assistance” represent some kind of potentially important underground movement that is likely to reshape the right‐to‐die debate in some fundamental way. The fact of the matter is that very few people take advantage of assisted suicide, even in the two states where the right to such assistance is a settled legal question. In Oregon, where the practice of physician assisted suicide has been tracked since the Death with Dignity Act went into effect in 1999, the number of assisted suicides has never accounted for more than 5/10 of 1 percent of all deaths in that state (http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year15.pdf). As Ball points out, it is easy enough to establish residency in Oregon, yet evidence that Oregon has or will become a popular “fly and die” state is scant at best.         "
"3","This brings us to a second weakness in the book. Ball suggests throughout that assisted suicide is the only legitimate option for many dying patients who wish to ease their suffering and hasten their death. But even in Belgium and The Netherlands, where the assisted suicide laws are much more lenient than anywhere else in the world and where even physician‐administered euthanasia has been legal and openly available for many years, the rates of hastened death are less than 2 percent of total deaths. If actively hastening death were some kind of panacea, one would certainly expect it to be more widely practiced where it is readily accessible."
"4","A third weakness in the book has to do with the treatment of end‐of‐life care. Ball suggests throughout the book that palliative care is often provided by caregivers as a sort of back‐door means of providing assisted suicide. While it must be acknowledged that some caregivers may intend to hasten death by pushing dosages of drugs beyond what is medically necessary to manage intractable symptoms, the evidence suggests that this practice is as rare as it is unnecessary. In fact, if compassionate care is provided through aggressive symptom management, there is no real need for caregivers to push dosages even further to the point where deaths are purposely hastened. More generally, while it is true that aggressive symptom management can depress a patient's vital signs in ways that might hasten death, there is also plenty of evidence to suggest that good symptom management, even if the patient must be completely sedated, does not hasten death (seeMaltoni, et al., 2009, “Palliative Sedation Therapy Does Not Hasten Death: Results from a Prospective Multicenter Study.”"
"5","Finally, for those who are determined to take the timing of death into their own hands, there remains an option that the book fails to address: forgoing the intake of fluids. The medical literature is replete with evidence that charts the benefits of dying in this way, and historically, people have almost always died with dehydration as at least a contributing factor. Symptoms associated with forgoing fluids at the end of life, if there are any, are generally easily managed, and this option also has the benefit of being entirely legal, ethically sound, medically common, and (unlike assisted suicide) available to everyone, regardless of location, infirmity, or physical ability."
"6","In the end, physician‐assisted suicide may still be the one and only acceptable option for a very few patients who are seeking a death with dignity. For them, and all those who believe that to be the case, and for all the rest of us who wonder why assisted suicide is not legal in more places today, Ball's work is a helpful, well‐written, and engaging treatment of the arguments on both sides of the issue. The book is well worth reading and owning as a reference on that basis."
