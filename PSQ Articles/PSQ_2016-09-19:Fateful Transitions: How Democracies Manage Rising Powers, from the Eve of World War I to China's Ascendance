"1","Are democratic states better at ensuring peaceful relations between themselves amid large shifts in the distribution of power than nondemocracies? Although the democratic peace research program is well established, its arguments have been only loosely applied to cases of great power rise and decline. Daniel M. Kliman's provocative new book, Fateful Transitions, seeks to fill the gap.         "
"2","Kliman's thesis is straightforward: yes, rising and declining democracies can more readily ensure peaceful, cooperative relations between themselves than when rising states are nondemocratic because rising democracies can more readily reassure other states over their future behavior. In this telling, rising democracies can successfully convey information about their often benign intentions and, even when intentions are not benign, provide access opportunities for declining democracies to shape their long‐term ambitions. Conversely, the closed nature of nondemocratic societies, their opaque decision making, and the absence of domestic checks and balances means that rising nondemocracies are less able to convey information or allow decliners to modify their intentions; the resulting uncertainty primes the system for competition."
"3","Kliman's work is a valuable contribution to the literature on the strategic choices of rising and declining great powers. The book is especially attractive for crisply laying out the state of the literature and showing what democratic peace arguments bring to the table. The case studies are also models of brevity and structured analysis. The theory itself, meanwhile, continues a shift in the literature giving rising states some agency in their fates: instead of understanding how states address their own decline or attempt to manage the rise of other great powers, the work's focus on the interaction of rising and declining states’ choices helps bring the rising state back in."
"4","One wonders, however, about some of the claims and logic. First, the project looks only at the response of declining democracies to rising states, an odd methodological choice. At a minimum, this approach raises the possibility that what matters is not the regime types of risers and decliners but that decliners generally fear the future, seek reassurance, and—under certain conditions—focus on risers’ regime type. Theoretically, what matters, then, is not that both rising and declining states are democracies but that declining states seek reassurance in an uncertain world. Regime type might be one way to provide reassurance, but it is far from the only option.         "
"5","Relatedly, the project's effort to explain why certain rising–declining state interactions were excluded from study is less than satisfying. At a minimum, excluding cases in which democracies enjoyed less than fully cooperative relations—such as the United States and Japan in the 1980s or the United States and the United Kingdom in the early 1800s—risks biasing the results. Again, this suggests that regime type may not be as influential as the study has it."
"6","Equally important, some of the theoretical assumptions strike the reader as potentially suspect. For example, if the open nature of democracies helps declining states influence a riser's intentions, then nondemocracies should be able to do the same. Presumably, this competition for influence in the riser would nullify democratic signaling and access advantages and render regime‐based reassurance problematic. Likewise, it is striking that declining democracies (per Kliman's analysis) never engage in hardline behaviors toward rising democracies. In fact, not only have declining democracies sometimes engaged in competitive behaviors from early in their declines, but also these behaviors—such as British efforts against the United States before 1898—have occasionally been directed at rising democracies. Again, regime type hardly seems deterministic."
"7","Still, none of this detracts from the value of the work. Kliman's book is an important contribution that should be of particular relevance for analysts seeking to address the rise of China, India, and other emerging powers today."
