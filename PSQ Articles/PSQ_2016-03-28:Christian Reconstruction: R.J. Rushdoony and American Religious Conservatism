"1","R.J. Rushdoony's ideas have circulated far more widely than his name. Outside of conservative evangelicals, few Americans could identify Rushdoony, but he left a massive intellectual legacy that influenced the Christian right, homeschoolers, libertarians, and the Tea Party. With Michael J. McVicar's recent study, Rushdoony finally has the intellectual biography he deserves."
"2","The son of Armenian immigrants, Rushdoony worked tirelessly as a missionary, minister, speaker, and author. He left behind mountains of correspondence with Christians around the United States, and McVicar gained unprecedented access to his archives. McVicar used this access to Rushdoony's library to construct a complex and compelling portrait of one of the most important—and least well known—American evangelicals of the twentieth century."
"3","Ordained in 1944, Rushdoony began his career as a missionary on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation in Owyhee, Nevada. After eight years on the reservation, he took a ministerial appointment in Northern California and later worked briefly at a conservative think tank, the Center for American Studies. In 1965, Rushdoony got his big break when conservative women activists in the Los Angeles suburbs offered him a salary to teach weekly Bible study classes, leaving much of the week free for Rushdoony to read and write. He created a nonprofit organization, the Chalcedon Foundation, and began disseminating his ideas in the organization's newsletter, the Chalcedon Report. He argued that the secular nation‐state of the twentieth century posited the nonexistence of God. Absent God, Rushdoony believed there could be no law. The task before American Christians, then, was reconstruction of a Christian state governed by biblical law.         "
"4","Rushdoony's theocratic program, alongside his belief that God demanded fidelity to even the harshest aspects of the Mosaic law (such as capital punishment for non‐Christians and homosexuals), created a rift between him and the evangelical mainstream. Christianity Today editor Carl Henry rejected his contributions to the magazine, which had been cofounded by evangelical bellwether Billy Graham. Rushdoony believed that evangelicals such as Henry and Graham had compromised Christianity in a bid for social relevance. Rushdoony shunned their “big tent” evangelicalism and outlined his vision of a theocratic state governed by biblical law in scores of publications during the 1960s and 1970s. He argued that homeschooling was essential in training free men and women who could carry out God's law after the state's inevitable collapse.         "
"5","Rushdoony's intellect and knack for simplifying complexities attracted conservative evangelicals to his project. He testified in court cases around the nation on behalf of homeschoolers. He underlined the importance of patriarchal family structures, in which “dominion men” could carry out the work of reconstruction while their wives served as “helpmeets” who reared the next generation. His influence radiated from Southern California throughout the country, shaping groups from Ron Paul libertarians to “Quiverfull” homeschooling families."
"6","McVicar's unwavering focus on Rushdoony and reconstruction enables him to tell a tight yet nuanced tale. The portrait of Rushdoony that emerges honors his complexities; he was both a doting father and an uncompromising intellectual whose doctrinal commitments led to total estrangement from his son‐in‐law and fellow reconstructionist, Gary North. Rushdoony's unwillingness to compromise with other evangelicals and political conservatives helps explain his relative obscurity, even as his antistatist ideas continue to resonate among homeschoolers and libertarians. This is a superb biography featuring remarkable research and erudite, readable prose. Its subject should become increasingly prominent in future studies of twentieth‐century evangelicals and conservatism."
