"1","Campaign retrospectives are a now ubiquitous consequence of elections both momentous and unexciting, as Ed Kilgore notes in the preface to this concise volume. From Theodore H. White's The Making of the President 1960 to Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's Double Down: Game Change 2012, these books traditionally follow presidential elections and focus on the personalities and events that animated the campaign. Kilgore breaks that mold by writing a campaign retrospective of a midterm election, that of 2014. His aim is to provide “a clear understanding of the dynamics of the 2014 elections that transcends . . . the episodic reporting and analysis of political journalists” (p. x), ultimately explaining what happened and why. In five short chapters, Kilgore reviews the fundamentals that shaped the 2014 midterm elections, the primary contests, the general election campaign, the results, and the implications of the 2014 midterms for the future of American politics.         "
"2","After a brief preface, Kilgore discusses the fundamentals and the narrative in which the 2014 midterm was fought. Although he does not cite scholarly work, Kilgore rightly reviews several fundamentals noted by political scientists to affect election outcomes, including differential turnout rates between presidential and midterm election years, the state of the economy, the nature of the seats each party has to defend, and presidential job approval. And although he notes in the preface that he believes the results in 2014 were “almost entirely explainable by a set of ‘fundamental’ factors” (p. xi), he goes on in the first chapter to recount the major themes, or media “narratives,” that dominated press coverage."
"3","Chapter 2 (“The Primaries”) and Chapter 3 (“The General Election Campaign”) continue to be dominated by Kilgore's attention to narratives. His discussion of the primaries comprises reviews of the interesting primary contests during the summer of 2014, most of which involve battles between establishment and Tea Party Republicans. In Chapter 3, Kilgore briefly reviews a few fundamentals (presidential job approval, economic conditions) before returning to narratives. He recounts broad themes in the media's coverage of the 2014 midterm and then provides state‐by‐state reviews of notable Senate and gubernatorial contests."
"4","In the fifth chapter, Kilgore summarizes the results, noting the expected pickup of seats by the Republican Party and the turning of the metaphor from “wave” to “tsunami” as Republicans gained 9 seats in the Senate, 12 in the House, 2 governorships, and 11 state legislative chambers. He argues that the GOP slightly overperformed in 2014, a result of it being a second midterm for the presidential incumbent, an advantageous landscape for Republicans, and negative public opinion toward the economy and the president. Kilgore discusses the implications of these results in the final chapter. While he asserts that “we are not in an era where one election necessarily follows from the previous one” (p. 77), he does note that the results of the 2014 midterms will have an impact on 2016. For one, trends in turnout that aided Republicans in 2014 will swing and likely provide an advantage to Democrats in 2016. Additionally, the landscape of 2016 will also aid Democrats, as Republican victories in 2010 and 2014 will force them to defend marginal seats against a likely more Democratic electorate. After speculating on likely 2016 presidential contenders (he gets nearly all of them, only failing to predict Donald Trump), Kilgore concludes by discussing the challenges the parties face heading into 2016 and the possibility that technological change (especially the rise of social media) will further affect the way campaigns are conducted."
"5","Kilgore's volume is a nice addition to the collection of campaign retrospectives, if only because it focuses on a midterm election cycle and provides a succinct retelling of many important stories—both national and state/district specific—from the 2014 campaign. While it is not as useful in a scholarly context—it contains no original data analysis, and virtually none of the citations are from scholarly sources—it is well researched and written and would be a good source for anyone needing a summary of the key races and outcomes of 2014."
