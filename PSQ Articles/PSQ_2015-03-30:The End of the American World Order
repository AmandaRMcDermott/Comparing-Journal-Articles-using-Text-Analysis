"1","Amitav Acharya is the current president of the International Studies Association. As such, his new book, The End of the American World Order, is a timely publication in terms of the two central arguments it lays out.         "
"2","The first theme is a call for a non‐Western approach to the study of international relations (IR), one that takes into account the importance of nontraditional actors, institutions, and processes from the “emerging powers” in the process of global governance. This pluralistic conception of IR is a long‐standing hallmark of Acharya's work."
"3","The second theme is that the routine processes and debates associated with hegemonic decline in the conventional IR literature fail to grasp the current dynamics of change in the global system. Acharya implies that discussions about shifts in the polarity of power are essentially sterile. He explicitly states that those who favor the view that the system of values, rules, and institutions America has set up will be sustained—even as it relatively declines—are errant. In sum, he argues that what he terms the “American World Order” is drawing to a close. As he definitively states, “The age of global dominance by any single power as the world has previously experienced under Britain, then America, is over” (p. 4)."
"4","In characterizing the successor to simple “polarities,” Acharya relies on a less theoretically elegant but more populist metaphor of the “multiplex cinema.” In this formulation, several producers concurrently cast varied actors in different films with contrasting plots as they stage their own shows. In applying the metaphor, the multiplex world he describes is “diversified and decentralized, with the involvement of established and emerging powers, states, global and regional bodies, and transnational non‐state actors” (pp. 7–8). More concretely, this complex world has “a decentered architecture of order management, featuring old and new powers, with a greater role for regional governance” (p. 8). This latter feature—regional governance—becomes the fulcrum of Acharya's broad‐ranging analysis, echoing and developing several of his prior, accomplished works that were cast in a narrower Asian context."
"5","In this emergent world, Acharya suggests we focus on four attributes: the distribution of power, the institutions and linkages within and between regions, the forms and quality of leadership (one that emphasizes the significance of legitimacy, inclusiveness, and innovative ideas), and a recognition that all global orders are transient. Traditional Western (disproportionately American) analysis dwells on the first of these, and thus it is, by implication, incomplete, static, and increasingly irrelevant to a dynamically evolving system. At 118 pages of text (plus notes, references, and an index), one virtue of the book is that it is pithy and discursive, if, at times, argumentative. Divided into six chapters, Acharya devotes the first of them to characterizing his multiplex metaphor in a relatively brief introduction. Two subsequent chapters then assail the conventional debates that focus disproportionately on polarity and the “myths of liberal hegemony.” These two chapters are informative in synthesizing a variety of common debates and effective in systematically critiquing their conventional, if often distinct, approaches. Particularly impressive is a section in the third chapter devoted to outlining and then debunking the five key myths of the “American‐led hegemonic order” (pp. 37–44), although this discussion would have benefited from greater empirical depth. While Acharya offers a multitude of examples, these are often superficial and would have benefited from elaboration to buttress his overall critique. That chapter's section entitled “Co‐opting China,” for example, neatly outlines the debates about China's purported status as a “revisionist” state. In assessing the potential for conflict between Chinese domestic values and those universalistic (that is, American) ones espoused in the current global system, Acharya concludes that “China, while it might accept and benefit from the current international economic structure, would be far less likely to conform to the politics and principles of the current liberal hegemonic order when organizing its own domestic politics and international relations” (p. 47). This conclusion flies in the face of the evidence presented by Rosemary Foot and Andrew Walters in their systematic study of U.S. and Chinese adoption of international norms, China, the United States and Global Order, and thus minimally needs elaboration.         "
"6","The last three chapters, making up the second half of the book, are the most engaging—yet each is frustrating in its own way. The fourth chapter explains why emerging powers are incapable of replacing the traditional powers in global governance. It feels, at times, more a digression from, rather than a substantiation of, Acharya's central argument. The fifth chapter returns to his central theme of innovative and plural regionalism that—in contrast to “a singular, traditional notion of universality”—“speaks to a pluralist conception of global order” (pp. 81–82). Acharya argues that this would strengthen global institutions but insufficiently explains how or why.         "
"7","Finally, in the sixth chapter, Acharya offers the reader two possible scenarios for the future: a collaborative global concert of great powers that share responsibility (a traditional European conception) and a regional world model that is more inclusive of emerging powers. While he spends more time on the latter than the former, the book would have benefited from an elaboration of what the dynamics, institutions, and processes of this emergent structure would look like in practice."
"8","Acharya has offered us a challenging vision of the future. Like most interesting work, this book raises more questions than it answers. We need to consider what questions a global research program built around this novel approach would address, what the appropriate methods should be in studying the relationship between regional and global institutions, and under what conditions scholars should focus on specific actors and processes rather than others. I hope that these will be some of the questions that Acharya chooses to engage in future work."
