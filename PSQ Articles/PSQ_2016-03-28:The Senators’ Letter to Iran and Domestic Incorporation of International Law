"1","IN MARCH 2015, AS NEGOTIATORS were nearing agreement on a general framework for what would eventually become a more detailed deal to restrict Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions, Oklahoma Republican senator Tom Cotton and 46 of his Republican colleagues issued an open letter to Iran's leaders. The Cotton Letter (which is set forth in full as an appendix) warned that an agreement signed by President Barack Obama without the consent of the Senate or approval by Congress as a whole would be a mere “executive agreement,” revocable by a future president “with the stroke of a pen and” subject to modification by “future Congresses . . . at any time.”1"
"2","In May 2015, compromise legislation was enacted requiring that any final agreement could be rejected by further congressional action.2 A final agreement between Iran and the so‐called P5+1—the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany—was reached in July 2015.3 Although the House of Representatives voted to reject the agreement, its opponents failed to muster the necessary Senate votes to do the same, and thus the agreement went into effect even without a presidential veto of a bill rejecting it.4 Thus, subsequent events appeared to render the Cotton Letter little more than a footnote in the long, tangled relations between the United States and Iran.         "
"3","Yet the Cotton Letter raised important and lingering questions about whether and how norms that bind the United States as a matter of international law become effective domestically. Although the Cotton Letter espoused a problematic view of the relation between international law and domestic law, it nonetheless rested on an unstated premise that is true but often overlooked—namely, that the interests of foreign sovereigns can be affected by the particular mechanism by which international agreements and other international obligations become effective in the domestic law of the United States."
"4","Foreign sovereigns considering entering into agreements with the United States have reason to care about two measures of the strength of those agreements. First, some kinds of agreements automatically become domestically effective. Second, some kinds of agreements are “stickier” than others; that is, they are more difficult, as a matter of domestic law, for the United States to undo. This article uses the Cotton Letter to frame a discussion of the general relation between international and domestic law and to explore how different kinds of agreements fare along the two dimensions of strength, even as it acknowledges the substantial role of politics in the multidimensional struggle over international relations."
"5","The form of the Cotton Letter was controversial. Some commentators even suggested that it was criminal, a violation of the Logan Act,5 a 1799 law that forbids citizens of the United States from corresponding with a foreign government or its agents “without authority of the United States.”6 The proposed criminal prosecution under a dormant statute of dubious constitutionality for what was essentially an editorial was no doubt an overreaction. Nonetheless, the Cotton Letter raised important questions about the extent to which Congress may legitimately play a role in the conduct of diplomacy.         "
"6","Even if framed in the timeless constitutional language of separation of powers, those questions inevitably have a political dimension, for while the Constitution has some bearing on foreign policy, as Mariah Zeisberg observes, “constitutional politics . . . determines the allocation of war authority in practice.”7 How to constrain Iran's capacity to acquire nuclear weapons was and remains an intensely political question. Thus, coming just one week after a speech to Congress by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemning the expected outline of the framework agreement,8 the Cotton Letter appeared to be part of a wider effort by some in Congress to undermine the executive branch's conduct of diplomacy with Iran.         "
"7","Nor can the political character of the Cotton Letter be understood solely in terms of foreign policy. Although some Democrats would eventually come to oppose the Iran agreement, all 47 senators who signed the Cotton Letter were Republicans. The letter's partisan character was thus unmistakable and fit into a broader picture of President Obama's second term, especially following the 2014 midterm elections. Frustrated by what Democrats regarded as intransigent opposition from the Republicans in Congress, the president sought to act unilaterally on a variety of issues, including not only foreign affairs but also environmental regulation,9 health insurance,10 and immigration.11 These actions and others, in turn, prompted claims that President Obama had overstepped the bounds of permissible unilateral executive action.12 Although the partisan valence of this debate about the scope of congressional and presidential authority reflects the fact that Republicans controlled Congress while Democrats held the presidency, the larger themes transcend current political fault lines. After all, during the Richard M. Nixon administration—indeed, as recently as the George W. Bush administration—Democrats were accusing Republicans of supporting an imperial presidency.13"
"8","The very fact of the senators' letter thus raised questions about the relation between Congress and the president. Meanwhile, the content of the letter raised questions about the relation between U.S. law and international agreements. On the same day that the 47 senators made their letter public, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded that the letter reflected a basic misunderstanding of international law and its relation to U.S. domestic law. He stated that executive agreements signed by a president in fact create binding obligations under international law, regardless of how or whether they are implemented domestically. According to Zarif, “the conduct of inter‐state relations is governed by international law, and not by US domestic law” because “governments represent the entirety of their respective states . . . and may not invoke their internal law as justification for failure to perform their international obligations.”14"
"9","Vice President Joe Biden made much the same point on that same day, pointing out that since the earliest days of the Republic, presidents have entered into binding international agreements that were not subject to approval or disapproval by Congress. “Under Presidents of both parties,” Biden explained, “such major shifts in American foreign policy as diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic of China, the resolution of the Iran hostage crisis, and the conclusion of the Vietnam War were all conducted without congressional approval.”15"
"10","Zarif and Biden were correct in general, but they may have been mistaken in their application of general principles to the particular deal between the P5+1 and Iran. It appears to be a nonbinding agreement—a “gentlemen's agreement” that does not even create binding obligations under international law, much less under the domestic law of the United States.16 I say “may” and “appears” for several reasons. First, although a U.S. State Department spokesperson characterized the negotiations as aiming toward a nonbinding deal,17 the agreement itself, which is labeled a “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” does not specify whether it is intended to be formally binding or not. Second, as Kal Raustiala aptly summarizes the scholarly consensus, “the distinction between legally binding and nonbinding agreements is not sharply demarcated [so] that there is in fact a spectrum of legality.”18 Third, and most important, even assuming that the agreement was nonbinding on its own, a subsequent United Nations Security Council resolution endorsed the Plan of Action and included measures, such as the termination of certain sanctions against Iran, that do have the force of law.19"
"11","Nor was the Security Council resolution a fortuitous afterthought. Including all five permanent members in the negotiating group ensured that any agreement reached would not be subject to a veto in the Security Council, and the Plan of Action expressly contemplated Security Council endorsement.20 Accordingly, even if Zarif and Biden were technically in error in characterizing the anticipated agreement as binding under international law before the Security Council endorsed it, they were correct to see the agreement as destined to become effectively binding.         "
"12","In any event, the Cotton Letter did not warn that the agreement would be by its terms nonbinding as a matter of international law. Instead, the 47 senators seemed to make a very different point. They appeared to assume that, as a matter of international law, congressional participation is necessary to create binding international obligations on the United States. Yet such an assumption would clearly be erroneous, as Zarif and Biden noted. Did the Cotton Letter make the fundamental error of confusing the standards for making international and domestic law?"
"13","The letter can be read to make that error, but that is not the only possible reading of it, and certainly not the most charitable reading. The Cotton Letter might be better read to reflect a dualist rather than a monist understanding of international law. As one commentator has explained,            "
"14","The monist view is that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order, international law is automatically incorporated into each nation's legal system, and international law is supreme over domestic law. . . . By contrast, the dualist view is that international and domestic law are distinct, each nation determines for itself when and to what extent international law is incorporated into its legal system.21"
"15","As explained more fully below, there is very good evidence for the proposition that modern U.S. law rests on dualist assumptions.22 Moreover, given the Republican Party's emphasis on American exceptionalism23 and its broad skepticism toward international law and international institutions,24 it would be natural for Republican senators to understand international law and domestic law as distinct.         "
"16","If one reads the Cotton Letter as distinguishing between international legal obligations that are incorporated into domestic law and those that are not, then it does not make the blunder that Foreign Minister Zarif and Vice President Biden thought it did. Instead, the senators could have been saying something like the following: even though a sole executive agreement can bind the United States as a matter of international law, for domestic purposes, it would be very easy for a future president or Congress to override such an agreement, and for that reason the leaders of Iran should insist on congressional participation if they want an agreement that will have long‐lasting domestic effect in the United States.         "
"17","Putting aside the arguably mistaken assumption that the agreement was meant to be internationally binding without Security Council endorsement, why would the senators think that the leaders of Iran would care about how easy or difficult it would be for a future administration or Congress to eliminate the domestic effect of an executive agreement? Should not foreign sovereigns be concerned only with the intersovereign, that is, the international dimensions of the agreement?         "
"18","The short answer is no, because the ease or difficulty of domestic violation of an international agreement lifting sanctions has important practical consequences. The Iran agreement calls for the lifting of nuclear‐related sanctions imposed by executive orders and also commits the United States “to seek such legislative action as may be appropriate to terminate” sanctions that cannot be lifted solely through executive action.25 Those changes do not occur automatically, and even if the United States implements them, so far as domestic law is concerned, the Cotton Letter is correct: Congress or a later administration could reinstate prior sanctions or impose new ones. Iran's only remedies, if any, would be through international mechanisms, but those mechanisms might be ineffective against a president or Congress willing to continue sanctions in place domestically despite an executive agreement creating an international obligation to lift them.         "
"19","Yet focusing on what the 47 senators said an executive agreement could not do overlooks what they also said could be accomplished by a treaty or a congressional‐executive agreement. An international agreement adopted through either of those mechanisms, they strongly implied, would bind future administrations and future Congresses.         "
"20","As a formal matter, that implicit claim is partly right. In the usual course, a president cannot unilaterally withdraw from the domestically operative aspects of a congressional‐executive agreement achieved through the Article I, § 7 process for lawmaking, for the simple reason that a president cannot unilaterally repeal a statute. However, the claim is also partly wrong. A president can withdraw from a treaty that expressly permits that option, and there is some authority for presidential power to terminate a treaty even absent such express permission.26 Further, Congress itself can use the ordinary Article I, § 7 lawmaking process to modify or repeal either a treaty or a congressional‐executive agreement. Most dramatically, a non‐self‐executing treaty would not ever be fully effective domestically without implementing legislation. (I say “fully” because even a non‐self‐executing treaty that has not been implemented by legislation could have some domestic effect; for example, courts will construe unclear statutes to avoid conflicting with treaties.27)          "
"21","Still, if the Cotton Letter implicitly overstated the absolute domestic effect and “stickiness” of treaties and congressional‐executive agreements, it nonetheless made a sound comparative point. As a practical matter, different kinds of international agreements may have different domestic effects."
"22","That comparative point indicates an important functional limit of the monist/dualist dichotomy. In the United States, as elsewhere, domestic law ultimately controls the domestic effect, if any, of international agreements and other aspects of international law. Yet, as the Cotton Letter strongly implied, particular mechanisms within U.S. law—especially congressional participation in the formation of international agreements—can make the domestic incorporation of international agreements effectively more automatic and stickier than a simple‐minded version of dualism might suggest.         "
"23","Just as some prominent scholars of international law have attempted to shift focus from (the lack of) enforcement to questions of when, why, and to what extent countries comply with international law,28 so, too, it is perhaps time to move past the question of dualism versus monism per se and ask how, even in a basically dualist legal system like the United States, various legal forms make the incorporation of international law into domestic law more or less effective and more or less sticky.         "
"24","The claim that different forms of international obligation differ in regard to how readily they are incorporated into domestic law and in how sticky they are once incorporated presupposes that U.S. law is basically dualist. If it were strictly monist—if international law were automatically incorporated into U.S. law and necessarily trumped contrary provisions of domestic law—then there would be no point in comparing and contrasting different sorts of international law norms. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish the basically dualist character of U.S. law before turning to explain the operation of different mechanisms by which international norms are contingently incorporated into domestic law.         "
"25","Numerous examples might be cited in support of the conclusion that U.S. domestic law rarely gives automatic effect to international obligations. As one influential scholar has noted, a variety of authoritative texts and lines of decision govern the domestic effect, if any, that international legal obligations have in the United States.29 Three relatively recent controversies yielded the leading contemporary U.S. Supreme Court opinions establishing the general reluctance of U.S. law to treat international obligations as giving rise to direct domestic enforcement. Perhaps it might have been possible at an earlier point in U.S. history to mount a persuasive argument for monism, but these recent cases provide a clearly dualist picture of the current legal landscape.         "
"26","Sanchez‐Llamas v. Oregon30arose out of international opposition to the death penalty. Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations is a multilateral treaty that obligates government officials in a signatory country, upon arresting foreign nationals of another signatory country, to permit them to consult with consular officials of their home country. The states of Oregon and Virginia sought to execute defendants who, the Supreme Court assumed, had been denied their rights under the Vienna Convention. However, the state courts had found that any rights the defendants possessed under the Vienna Convention had been waived by the defendants' failure to assert those rights in a timely manner.            "
"27","Despite decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) holding that the Vienna Convention did not permit U.S. states to penalize a procedural default under such circumstances,31 the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the convictions and death sentences. According to the majority opinion of Chief Justice John Roberts in Sanchez‐Llamas, while the ICJ's interpretation of the treaty was entitled to “respectful consideration,” the ultimate meaning of the treaty was a matter of U.S. law to be determined by the Supreme Court carrying out its duty under Marbury v. Madison to “say what the law is”32—even though, at the time of the ICJ rulings, the United States had ratified the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention, acknowledging the ICJ's jurisdiction to resolve particular disputes arising under it. (The United States prospectively withdrew from the Optional Protocol before the final ruling in Sanchez‐Llamas, but that withdrawal played no role in the Supreme Court's decision.33)             "
"28","The Sanchez‐Llamas Court began by noting that decisions of the ICJ are not even binding in subsequent cases before the ICJ itself.34 However, the Court did not rest its willingness to disregard the ICJ's interpretation of the Vienna Convention in favor of its own interpretation on the narrow ground that the parties were different. The chief justice wrote more broadly and, crucially for current purposes, in a dualist key: “The ICJ's principal purpose is to arbitrate particular disputes between national governments. . . . While each member of the United Nations has agreed to comply with decisions of the ICJ in any case to which it is a party, the Charter's procedure for noncompliance—referral to the Security Council by the aggrieved state—contemplates quintessentially international remedies.”35 In other words, treaties are literally inter‐national law, that is, law between nations. The Supreme Court, again with Chief Justice Roberts writing for the majority, reaffirmed that principle two years later in another Vienna Convention case, stressing that “not all international law obligations automatically constitute binding federal law enforceable in United States courts.”36"
"29","To be sure, the Supreme Court recognized the possibility that a treaty could be directly operative as a matter of domestic law. A so‐called self‐executing treaty has that effect, the Court acknowledged in Sanchez‐Llamas.37 But even in so acknowledging, the justices displayed a dualist understanding of international law. Whether a treaty is self‐executing, and thus directly incorporated into domestic law, is partly a question of what the treaty means—which necessarily involves some consideration of what the foreign counterparties would expect it to mean—but also partly a question of whether the relevant political actors in the United States (the Senate and the president) intended the treaty to be domestically operative absent implementing legislation. The very acknowledgment of the possibility of non‐self‐executing treaties is inconsistent with strong monism, and the effective presumption in favor of non‐self‐execution displayed in Sanchez‐Llamas is indicative of strong dualism.            "
"30","Sosa v. Alvarez‐Machain38 was one of three Supreme Court cases concerning the apprehension in Mexico by U.S. law enforcement officials of Mexican nationals suspected of participating in the torture and murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent.39 Alvarez‐Machain argued, among other things, that as an “alien,” his abduction amounted to a “tort . . . committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States,” thus entitling him to recompense from his abductors under the Alien Tort Statute,40 a federal statutory provision dating to the first Judiciary Act, passed in 1789. In particular, Alvarez‐Machain contended that his kidnapping violated customary international law and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a signatory.            "
"31","The Supreme Court's disposition of the Sosa case was unanimous, but the majority opinion by Justice David Souter was cobbled together from partial agreements with some justices who would have allowed less room for domestic litigation based on international law norms (in a partial concurrence by Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas) and two justices who raised other, somewhat technical points (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer). In a portion of the majority opinion that was unanimous, the Court arguably gestured in the direction of monism. Recounting the history of the early Republic and relying on William Blackstone, Justice Souter concluded that the first Congress likely thought that domestic “common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time.”41 In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, common law was seen as found by judges, not made by them, and concomitantly, interpersonal obligations arising under international law were automatically cognizable domestically. Thus, the Court concluded that even though the Alien Tort Statute is only a grant of jurisdiction, an alien may sue under it without the need for a further act of Congress creating a cause of action. The common law provides the cause of action.            "
"32","Justice Souter's historical account of the role played by international law in creating causes of action in U.S. courts has been called into serious question.42 But even accepting that account as true, it would be a mistake to read Sosa as endorsing present‐day monism. At most, Justice Souter appears to be saying that the Congress that adopted the Alien Tort Statute labored under monist premises. In two respects, the Sosa opinion makes clear that the modern view is dualist. First, even in a portion of the opinion that was too monist for the three concurring conservatives, Justice Souter rejected Alvarez‐Machain's ICCPR claim because the ICCPR is not self‐executing.43 As noted in the discussion of the Sanchez‐Llamas case, the very idea of a non‐self‐executing treaty rests on dualist premises.            "
"33","Second, although Justice Souter affirmed a role for federal courts in recognizing causes of action for violations of international law, he invoked principles of U.S. domestic law to define and limit that role. Moreover, he allowed that Congress has the power to override the courts by expanding or contracting the range of international law violations that give rise to civil liability.44 Put simply, even the most internationalist Justices in Sosa treated the questions before the Court as whether and to what extent U.S. law creates liability for the violation of international law. The issues were framed in a fundamentally dualist way: Whether, to what extent, and through which institutions should the U.S. choose to incorporate international law? Regardless of the answer, the very question reflects dualism.            "
"34","Even when international law is incorporated into domestic U.S. law, U.S. constitutional law provides the priority rules among conflicting obligations. Bond v. United States45 illustrates how those rules may give priority to domestic law over international law. In Bond, the Supreme Court construed the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act, a federal statute that, as its name suggests, gave domestic effect to a non‐self‐executing multilateral treaty that the United States had earlier ratified.46 By the terms of its broad language, the act appeared to apply to the facts of the case: a woman placed a “toxic chemical” on the property of an erstwhile friend in order to punish the latter for her part in a love triangle. Three justices of the Supreme Court thought the conclusion unavoidable that Carol Anne Bond's actions violated the statute but then went on to say that as a consequence, the statute was unconstitutional because it exceeded the powers of Congress.47 They saw a conflict between the Constitution and a federal statute purporting to implement a valid treaty, and they made clear that in such a conflict, the Constitution prevails.            "
"35","Meanwhile, the other six justices also took a dualist view. Worried that “interpreting the statute's expansive language” to cover Bond's conduct would “intrude[ ] on the police power of the States,” the majority construed that language narrowly.48 That narrow construction does not necessarily violate international law, because it is possible that the best reading of the convention also does not cover Bond's conduct. But the structure of the Court's opinion makes clear that the justices would construe the statute narrowly in order to avoid violating a domestic constitutional norm of federalism, even if in doing so they read the domestic Implementation Act more narrowly than the convention it ostensibly implements. In other words, for all nine justices in Bond, domestic constitutional concerns took ultimate priority over compliance with an international obligation. Dualism reigns in the Supreme Court.            "
"36","Perhaps, however, the substantial body of Supreme Court case law resting on dualist premises is mistaken. After all, if monism is ultimately correct, then a nation‐state has no authority to violate international law in its domestic law (or otherwise). Monism posits the supremacy of international legal norms over domestic ones in instances of conflict."
"37","On its face, the strongly monist view appears difficult to reconcile with the entire Westphalian legal order we still inhabit, in which sovereign nation‐states, through their agreements and their practices, are the source of international legal norms rather than their object. But this objection may be too strong. Certainly there is nothing illogical in accepting that the agreements and practices of sovereign nation‐states gave rise to international law but that international law now binds them—much in the way that the sovereign People of the United States created the Constitution and the laws consistent with it but are now subject to those laws. Westphalian monism is thus at least a conceptual possibility."
"38","However, even if monism is correct in some deep sense, there is no realistic likelihood that the United States would adjust its practices to conform. The Constitution, not international law, is treated as supreme in the United States."
"39","Still, one could make an argument for monism that accepts the Constitution's priority. At least in one respect, the very text of the Constitution could be said to be monist. By its terms, the supremacy clause of Article VI puts treaties on equal footing with domestic federal law: the Constitution, laws “made in pursuance thereof,” and “all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States” are deemed “the supreme Law of the Land.” It can thus be argued that the whole doctrine of non‐self‐executing treaties is misguided, and indeed, Carlos Vázquez has made just this point. Given the text and history of the supremacy clause, Vázquez contends that courts ought to regard treaties as presumptively operative in domestic courts, with the presumption only rebuttable by clear text in the treaty itself.49 Under this approach, treaties would be automatically incorporated into domestic law unless international law itself, that is, the express terms of the treaty, makes clear that the treaty gives rise to no domestically enforceable obligations. The supremacy clause, as Vázquez would read it, thus appears to be monist—making one very important category of international law, treaties, automatically part of domestic law. Indeed, dissenting from one of the Vienna Convention cases, three justices noted that in the early Republic, self‐execution was regarded as the norm in treaty interpretation.50"
"40","As a textual matter, there is much to recommend reading the supremacy clause to render treaties presumptively self‐executing. After all, treaties by their nature create intersovereign obligations. By making a valid treaty “the supreme Law of the Land,” the supremacy clause would appear to add something to a treaty's intersovereign character. Focusing on “the Land,” it appears that the something added is incorporation into domestic law. Thus, Vázquez and the justices who follow his lead make a powerful point."
"41","Vázquez's argument might even lead to the conclusion that U.S. law is pervasively monist (although he does not address the dualism/monism question). In this view, treaties would be automatically part of U.S. law simply by virtue of the supremacy clause. Meanwhile, customary international law would also be automatically part of U.S. law. “International law is part of our law,” the Supreme Court pronounced in 1900, and it “must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their determination.”51 Just as one might think that Sanchez‐Llamas is wrong in presuming treaties to be non‐self‐executing, so one might think that Sosa is wrong in treating the incorporation of customary international law into U.S. law as a matter to be determined by U.S. judges applying U.S. standards.            "
"42","Whatever one might make of these sorts of claims, at most, they show that at some earlier point in U.S. history, it would have been possible to argue for a monist understanding of the U.S. Constitution and U.S. law more generally. Rightly or wrongly, the modern case law quite clearly reflects dualist rather than monist premises, and there is no indication that the courts will abandon these premises. Accordingly, any realistic description of the contemporary relationship between U.S. law and international law must work from dualist premises."
"43","Although U.S. law ultimately controls the domestic effect of all international law, the way in which international law becomes binding on the United States may affect how readily it becomes incorporated domestically and how easy or difficult it will be for political actors to undo the domestic incorporation of international law norms. Whether or not the 47 senators intended to make that point, the Cotton Letter is best understood as conveying this particular insight."
"44","As noted above, the Obama administration ultimately concluded what is probably best characterized as a nonbinding agreement with Iran, at least if one sets aside the subsequent Security Council endorsement. In general, an international agreement that is not even binding as a matter of international law will not become binding as a matter of domestic law either. But even where it does—where, for example, Congress adopts legislation giving domestic effect to a nonbinding international agreement—we would not have an instance of domestic law incorporating international law because, by definition, the nonbinding agreement did not create any international legal obligations. Accordingly, to avoid confusion in addressing the question of how different sorts of international legal obligations do or do not become binding domestically, the remaining discussion will set aside the type of agreement that was ultimately reached with Iran: a nonbinding agreement. That is ironic, to be sure, but the Cotton Letter raises issues that transcend its immediate context.         "
"45","It will be useful to distinguish among five types of international legal obligations, considered here roughly in descending order of strength. The types are congressional‐executive agreements, customary international law, self‐executing treaties, executive agreements, and non‐self‐executing treaties. The hierarchy is only a rough one because strength implicates at least two different questions. First, how likely is it that the international norm will be enforceable as a matter of U.S. domestic law? Second, international remedies aside, how difficult is it for the United States to withdraw from or violate the obligation as a matter of domestic law?"
"46","By its terms, the Constitution authorizes only one form of congressional participation in the formation of an international agreement: a treaty. However, since at least the middle of the twentieth century, it has been accepted that the president may, alternatively, negotiate an international agreement that is then submitted to Congress acting as a whole rather than to a supermajority of the Senate.52 The result is a so‐called congressional‐executive agreement. Precedents for congressional‐executive agreements date back to the earliest days of the Republic.53"
"47","Consider an important example. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is among the most consequential modern congressional‐executive agreements. It was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush and, after Bill Clinton became president, approved by both houses of Congress, but by a less than two‐thirds majority in the Senate. Thus, NAFTA's bindingness as an international agreement depends on the validity of the congressional‐executive agreement process. In an important 1995 article, Bruce Ackerman and David Golove argued that treaties had been the exclusive means of creating binding international agreements for much of U.S. history but that the American people informally amended the Constitution in the middle of the twentieth century to allow for congressional‐executive agreements as an alternative.54"
"48","In an equally important 1995 article, Laurence Tribe pushed back on the Ackerman/Golove thesis. He agreed with their assessment of the early period but resisted their conclusion that events of the twentieth century were sufficient to overcome the text and structure of the Constitution, which, Tribe argued, implied that the treaty process is the exclusive means by which the United States may enter major international agreements with congressional participation.55"
"49","It is not clear who had the better of this argument. Ackerman and Golove were correct that, as a matter of positive law, the United States and foreign sovereigns accept that the United States may validly enter into binding international agreements by opting for the congressional‐agreement process rather than the treaty process. Yet Tribe obviously understood that to be true. His argument was that the best understanding of the Constitution would reject the view that Congress and the president have complete discretion to substitute a congressional‐executive agreement for the treaty process."
"50","Later, John Yoo advanced an intermediate view that he claimed was grounded in executive branch practice. Yoo maintained that the congressional‐executive agreement is legitimate for some but not all kinds of international commitments. With Ackerman and Golove, he rejected categorical treaty exclusivity. But with Tribe, he also rejected the view that congressional‐executive agreements are completely interchangeable with treaties.56"
"51","For present purposes, it is unnecessary to adjudicate among these positions because the present question is not whether the United States may be bound by a congressional‐executive agreement as a matter of international law. The present question is whether a congressional‐executive agreement binds the United States as a matter of domestic law. The answer to that question is plainly yes, at least for one prominent kind of congressional‐executive agreement."
"52","Where the president negotiates an agreement with a foreign sovereign and Congress consents to it by enacting an ordinary statute, as Congress in fact did in the NAFTA Implementation Act,57 the statute is binding domestically, so long as it is not otherwise unconstitutional. NAFTA is domestically binding because it clearly falls within the power of Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.”58 Once adopted by the president and Congress through the Article I, § 7 lawmaking process, a congressional‐executive agreement has the same domestic force as any other statute. It is also just as sticky as any other statute, requiring either another statute (or, as will be discussed below, a treaty) to supersede it. Accordingly, Oona Hathaway argues that treaties are archaic and that, going forward, the United States can and should undertake all international obligations formerly undertaken via treaty only through congressional‐executive agreements.59 Whether or not one agrees with Hathaway's prescription, her diagnosis is correct. A foreign sovereign seeking a binding commitment from the United States cannot do better than to obtain a congressional‐executive agreement where the action by Congress is a statute within its enumerated powers.            "
"53","Obligations under international law arise either by express agreement of sovereigns that bind the agreeing sovereigns or by “a general and consistent practice of states followed by them from a sense of legal obligation.”60 Obligations of the latter sort constitute customary international law (CIL). Because they do not require any formal act of agreement, the United States can become bound by CIL norms simply through its own practices in conjunction with the practices of other sovereigns. The practices of the United States, and not simply the overwhelming majority of sovereigns, may be necessary for a CIL norm to bind the United States because so‐called persistent objectors are not bound by a CIL norm, at least so long as the objection arose and persisted before the norm crystallized into the status of CIL.61 Accordingly, the conduct of the world community and the United States as a whole, rather than any particular combination of U.S. institutional actors, determines whether a CIL norm binds the United States.            "
"54","However, as noted in the earlier discussion of the Sosa case, a CIL norm may be binding on the United States without giving rise to judicial enforcement within domestic courts. For the latter to occur requires the courts to recognize the CIL norm as satisfying the stringent criteria set out in Sosa under the Alien Tort Statute. (It is at least theoretically possible that a CIL norm could become domestically operative in a non–Alien Tort Statute context without satisfying the Sosa criteria, but no modern cases implement CIL norms outside of the statute.) If the courts so recognize a CIL norm as judicially enforceable, it has the status of federal common law—that is, freestanding judge‐made law not traceable to any authoritative text. Despite continuing controversy over the legitimacy of federal common law in general and questions about how exactly the Sosa opinion fits with other examples of federal common law,62 there can be little doubt that per Sosa, a judicial decision to treat a CIL norm as enforceable in domestic courts is, in fact, federal common law.            "
"55","Although courts make common law in the first instance, legislatures have the power to enact statutes displacing common law rules. Accordingly, Congress can enact laws that grant domestic judicial remedies or other remedies for violations of CIL. More to the present point, Congress can also enact a law overturning a judicial decision that held that some CIL norm was judicially enforceable. Because federal common law has the same level of authority as a statute, a president acting alone may not displace it. By directing the conduct of the United States, presidents have some power to prevent a norm from rising to CIL status or to prevent a norm from binding the United States, but once a norm has risen to that level and either has been recognized by the courts and not superseded by Congress or has been recognized by statute, a domestically enforceable CIL norm is just as sticky domestically as a congressional‐executive agreement. Like a statute, a domestically enforceable CIL norm can be superseded by a statute (or, although this would be highly unlikely for CIL, a treaty) but not by unilateral presidential action."
"56","Once the Senate gives its consent (by a two‐thirds vote in accordance with Article II, Section 2) and the president ratifies a self‐executing treaty, it is automatically incorporated into domestic law. Indeed, that is simply what it means for a treaty to be self‐executing. An appendix to a dissent in one of the Vienna Convention cases lists 29 Supreme Court cases construing treaties as self‐executing. Most of them involve a variety of property rights and economic rights.63 Because a self‐executing treaty becomes effective domestically upon ratification, it provides strong protection for a foreign sovereign.            "
"57","However, even if self‐executing, a treaty may not be as sticky as either a congressional‐executive agreement or CIL. To be sure, a casual reader of the Constitution might think that in order for the United States to unmake a treaty, the president should have to obtain the consent of two‐thirds of the Senate. After all, the Constitution is silent on how a treaty is unmade, and so it would seem reasonable that the same process that is required for treaty making is required for treaty unmaking, much in the way that it takes a statute to repeal a statute. This view about unmaking treaties was taken by a number of the leading Framers, including Alexander Hamilton64 and John Jay,65 as well as by Justice Joseph Story speaking for the Supreme Court.66"
"58","However, from the beginning there were dissenters. Thomas Jefferson thought that an ordinary statute could nullify a treaty,67 and eventually his view prevailed. Thus, modern case law places a treaty at the same level of authority as a statute. As between two mutually inconsistent statutes, the later‐in‐time one prevails, and so, too, as between a self‐executing treaty and a statute, the later‐in‐time enactment prevails.68 Thus, an ordinary statute can displace, or, from the perspective of international law, place the United States in breach of, a treaty. Just like a congressional‐executive agreement or CIL norm that has been incorporated into domestic U.S. law, the domestic effect of a self‐executing treaty can be undone either by another treaty or by an act of Congress in accordance with Article I, § 7.            "
"59","But any kind of treaty (including a self‐executing one) may be less sticky than either of those other forms of international obligation in an important respect. Whereas a president cannot unilaterally override the statutory dimensions of a congressional‐executive agreement or domestically incorporated CIL, substantial authority indicates that a president can unilaterally terminate a treaty.69 Presidential termination might violate international law if not authorized by the treaty itself or by mutual consent of the counterparties,70 but there is at least some support for the view that under U.S. law, a president retains the discretion to terminate a treaty unilaterally, and that, upon such termination, the treaty loses its domestic effect.71"
"60","The Cotton Letter warned Iran about the limited effect of an executive agreement (sometimes called a “sole executive agreement”)—that is, an agreement by which the president creates an internationally binding obligation without congressional participation. A president may make an executive agreement based on his powers under Article II, through a delegation of power from Congress or, in the case of a delegation by a treaty, from the Senate, or through a combination of the president's own powers and delegated powers.72"
"61","Notably, the Cotton Letter did not state that a sole executive agreement cannot be legally binding. To use the influential language of Justice Robert Jackson's concurrence in the Steel Seizure Case, the senators did not contend that an agreement along the lines that were then being negotiated would contradict the will of Congress and thus fall within a zone in which the president's “power is at its lowest ebb.”73On the contrary, the Cotton Letter acknowledged that through a combination of his own powers and those delegated to him, President Obama could make an executive agreement. As noted above, their letter is best read to accept that such an agreement would bind the United States as a matter of international law.            "
"62","Moreover, although the Cotton Letter indicated that an executive agreement would not be as sticky as international agreements secured with congressional participation, it did not state that an executive agreement would lack force domestically. And with good reason. The Steel Seizure framework applies to domestic no less than to foreign affairs. An executive agreement that falls within the combined scope of the president's Article II powers and his delegated powers could thus have domestic effect or be accompanied by an executive order or other executive action with domestic effect."
"63","Past U.S.–Iran relations provide a dramatic illustration. The 1981 executive agreement and accompanying executive orders concluding the hostage crisis had the substantial domestic effect of terminating litigation pending in the U.S. courts and transferring jurisdiction over those disputes to arbitration before the newly created Iran‐United States Claims Tribunal. These measures were then upheld by the Supreme Court against a separation‐of‐powers challenge.74"
"64","The Cotton Letter is correct that the domestic effect of an executive agreement can be undone by a subsequent executive order by a future president. Indeed, it can also be undone by an executive order of the same president. Just as a later‐in‐time statute supersedes an earlier‐in‐time statute (or treaty), so a later‐in‐time executive action supersedes an earlier‐in‐time executive action, at least as a matter of domestic law. (The president's power to revise or withdraw from an executive agreement for international law purposes may depend on the subject matter of the agreement.75)             "
"65","To reiterate, as Foreign Minister Zarif and Vice President Biden noted, such a “stroke of a pen” could put the United States in breach of a binding executive agreement, and thus subject to international remedies. But the internationally unlawful pen stroke would nonetheless be effective as a matter of domestic law, and foreign sovereigns often have reason to care about whether an agreement with the United States will be and remain in force domestically."
"66","The Cotton Letter is also correct that, so far as domestic implementation is concerned, a “future Congress could modify the terms of [an executive] agreement at any time.” This statement, however, is misleading, insofar as it suggests that the domestic effect of an executive agreement is more susceptible to being overridden by Congress than the domestic effect of an international agreement secured with congressional participation. As we have seen, so far as direct domestic impact goes, all international agreements, indeed, all international obligations, may be superseded by an act of Congress.            "
"67","The Cotton Letter did not distinguish between self‐executing and non‐self‐executing treaties. Yet they are critically different. Absent implementing legislation, a non‐self‐executing treaty has no direct domestic effect. Moreover, in the modern era, absent treaty language and a ratification process that accepts a treaty as self‐executing, the courts will regard a treaty as non‐self‐executing.76 Accordingly, a treaty could actually provide a foreign sovereign with less assurance of domestic implementation than an executive agreement, at least when the executive agreement either by its terms has domestic effect or is accompanied by a domestically effective executive order.            "
"68","To be sure, as noted above, there is some doubt about the president's unilateral power to nullify a treaty. In that sense, any treaty may be stickier, as against presidential revision, than an executive agreement. However, because a non‐self‐executing treaty has no direct domestic effect on its own, what ends up sticking is essentially nothing. Thus, if the point of the Cotton Letter was to alert the Iranian government about the practical pitfalls of proceeding by executive agreement rather than by treaty, its lumping together of non‐self‐executing treaties with self‐executing treaties and congressional‐executive agreements was highly misleading."
"69","It is tempting to view the Cotton Letter simply as a political document. Certainly its partisan import is undeniable. Signed exclusively by Republicans, the Cotton Letter aimed to derail a major foreign policy goal of a Democratic president, partial rapprochement with Iran."
"70","The Cotton Letter can also be viewed through an institutional lens. It was an effort by much of the Senate to assert congressional relevance in foreign policy. Whereas most discussions of the clash between Congress and the president over war making involve the efficacy of congressional tools for restraining the president's practical ability to commit the nation to war, here Senate Republicans sought to upend presidential policy that they regarded as insufficiently bellicose. Despite that inversion, the Cotton Letter can be fitted into a familiar frame of unsuccessful attempts by Congress to return to an earlier constitutional order in which foreign policy, including with respect to war, was a domain of shared responsibility between the political branches of the federal government. Such attempts are almost invariably unsuccessful because, at least since the beginning of the Cold War, conditions have favored presidential primacy in foreign affairs. Whether that advantage is the product of the post–World War II order—as Stephen Griffin forcefully argues—or, as in the more conventional narrative that Griffin rejects, the end result of “a power struggle between the executive and legislative branches that began in the early republic,”77 is less important for present purposes than the plaintive nature of the congressional effort.         "
"71","Against this backdrop of politics and interbranch competition, it may appear unduly formalistic to use the Cotton Letter as the occasion to parse the strength and stickiness of different means by which binding norms of international law may become incorporated into domestic U.S. law. But that appearance is false. The forms matter, not because they transcend politics but because the choice of forms is one important means by which political struggles among factions in Congress and the president are played out. For example, a president with sufficient support in Congress may seek to entrench an agreement with a foreign sovereign in a congressional‐executive agreement or a self‐executing treaty, whereas a president in conflict with Congress may use a sole executive agreement."
"72","As a hegemon, the United States can sometimes flout international law, but given the independent judiciary, it will often be more difficult to flout domestic law. Accordingly, a foreign sovereign interested in securing legally binding commitments from the United States has reason to care about whether and how permanently those commitments are translated into domestic law. And because the differences among the forms of international obligation lead to differences in both how readily they become domestically operative and how sticky they are, foreign sovereigns also have reason to be concerned about the forms their commitments from the United States take. Despite its other flaws, the Cotton Letter was correct in assuming that much.78"
