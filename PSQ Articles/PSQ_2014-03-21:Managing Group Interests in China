"1","MONOPOLISTIC INDUSTRIES IN CHINA have been criticized heavily in recent years for their unrestrained pursuit of interests at the expense of the public or other parties.1 Such criticisms are not unfounded, as exemplified by the Chinese oil industry. In China, the China National Petroleum Corporation and the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, together with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, have monopolized the oil supply in the country.2 In 2006, China had approximately 660 privately owned oil wholesale enterprises and 45,060 privately owned gas stations. However, by early 2008, two thirds of the wholesale enterprises and one third of the gas stations were closed, and another 10,000 gas stations lost money. This situation was a result of a monopoly of the oil industry by state‐owned companies. When oil prices were high, the China National Petroleum Corporation and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation refused to provide oil to privately owned companies. The national government agencies repeatedly urged the two companies to provide oil to private businesses. The premier and vice premiers also gave 14 instructions to require them to provide oil. But all of these were largely ignored by the two companies.3"
"2","This incident is not an isolated one. Pei has documented the similar behavior of other industries that enjoy market monopoly in China. The existence of monopolistic industries can be attributed to the fact that “the introduction of new entrants, even state‐affiliated, would likely produce an organizational shock to the existing patronage system and threaten the CCP's ability to allocate critical resources.”4 In post‐communist countries, some temporary winners of the reform are found to be an important force in resisting further reforms. “Instead of forming a constituency in support of advancing reforms, short‐term winners have often sought to stall the economy in a partial reform equilibrium [italics original] that generates concentrated rents for themselves, while imposing high costs on the rest of the society.”5 Similarly, monopolistic industries and their patrons are at least partly responsible for “China's trapped transition.”6"
"3","The practices of these powerful groups in China seem to suggest that the regime is not different from other non‐democracies that can be “simply the rule of the rich.”7 But this is only part of the story, because the Chinese government has also accommodated the interests of weak groups, such as farmers and workers. In 2004, the Chinese central government decided to abolish the agricultural tax within five years to alleviate farmers' financial burdens. This goal was achieved earlier than anticipated, in 2006, bringing an end to land‐based taxation in rural China that had been in place for thousands of years. In the long history of China, rulers or emperors would occasionally grant temporary tax breaks to farmers, but taxes would be eventually re‐instituted. The 2004 move of the central government was not a temporary measure; the abolition was legalized by the National People's Congress.         "
"4","An examination of the political rationale behind the state's efforts in accommodating the interests of the weak is important to understanding state–citizen relations and the resilience of China's regime.8 China appears to be a puzzling case. Despite its many problems, including rampant corruption, rising inequality, and the slow pace or lack of substantial political reform, the regime still enjoys a rather high level of political trust among its population.9 Such trust implies that the people still see the regime as acceptable. One reason is that some people have benefited from the system while others believe that the system accommodates their basic needs.10 Moreover, if the system allows the people to pursue their interests, they may accept the system and tolerate some of the problems. Martin Whyte finds that inequality does not seem to have bred strong anger among the Chinese population. He concludes that “convincing Chinese citizens that the current social order is fair may depend more on such measures as improving the legal system and giving ordinary citizens opportunities to influence the people and policies that govern their lives than it does on government redistributions from the rich to the poor or reduction of the national Gini coefficient”11 [i.e. income gap].         "
"5","This article explains how the political system creates political space for political participation by focusing on the ways in which social groups, whether organized or not, pursue interests in China. With resourceful or powerful groups better positioned to pursue their interests, how can weak groups have their problems addressed? Or, what determines the power of a group in pursuing group‐specific interests? This article shows that both powerful and weak groups are able to pursue their interests in China because they have access to different sources of power or leverage. The ability of social groups to pursue group‐specific interests is determined not only by their connections to the policymaking body but also by their non‐institutionalized power and, more importantly, by the state's policy priorities. The presence of different sources of power expands the space for political participation in China. When disadvantaged groups have opportunities to pursue their interests, the regime's legitimacy, and consequently its resilience, can be enhanced.12"
"6","In democracies like the United States, the political structure enables potential interest groups to come forward and represent interests. The essence of politics lies in the controversy and conflict derived from activities of interest groups. Thus, diversity of interests is recognized and accommodated in policymaking. Decision making sometimes involves competition among different groups. Pluralism due to interest groups' representation serves as the “balance wheel” in the political system.13 Problems of the interest group approach notwithstanding (for example, the pluralist–elitist debate), the “group basis of politics” remains a useful tool in analyzing the political process.14"
"7","Authoritarian regimes are also subjected to conflicting interests of the different organized and unorganized groups. For example, a number of studies suggest that communist regimes are not monolithic. Instead, communist regimes are a “conglomeration of interests,”15 and groups are considered inevitable in communist regimes. Each group has its own values and interests, as well as its own sharp internal differences, and all are undeniably involved in conflict with other groups. Therefore, “[t]here can be no doubt that Communist society, in spite of its monolithic appearance and the claims of homogeneity made by its supporters, is, in fact, as complex and stratified as any other.”16"
"8","In the former Soviet Union, for instance, the Party was regarded as an arena in which various elites made their demands known to one another, articulated their special interests, and imposed their desires as the unified will of the entire society. Hence, Ploss suggests in his discussion of policymaking in the former Soviet Union that there is “a genuinely oligarchic procedure for policymaking and its most outstanding feature is conflict.”17 As Vernon Aspaturian also writes, “The decision makers must give greater consideration in the calculation of policy to factors affecting the internal stability of the regime. They will show greater sensitivity to the effects of decisions on the vested interests of the various elites in [the] Soviet Union.”18"
"9","As far as the power of the groups in authoritarian regimes is concerned, much discussion has been focused on the mutual dependence relationship between the government and a particular group. Such mutual dependence involves an exchange relationship that has elements of patrimonialism. The essential feature of patrimonial regimes is that key figures in the government and certain actors in society exchange resources in return for economic or political support.19 This relationship affects government behavior. According to Thomas Pepinsky, in authoritarian regimes, supporters are groups that benefit from existing policies, favor the reproduction of the political and allocation regime, and voluntarily bestow upon political leaders financial, coercive, and/or ideological resources. The support coalitions of authoritarian regimes have a direct and significant influence on the government's policy choices.20"
"10","Similarly, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson stress that non‐democracy can be “simply the rule of the rich” generally because the rich have more recourse and political clout in rule making, thus forming “a close association between what nondemocratic regimes do and what the rich want.”21 Resourceful groups seem to be powerful in most societies. Jeffry Frieden finds that the inability of dictatorships in Brazil and Argentina to meet the demands from powerful groups in the business community became a crucial catalyst that led to these countries' downfall.22 In the former Soviet Union, the Party was also more supportive of certain groups: “The social groups in soviet society perceive their interests differently and the communist party articulates the will and interests of the people in accordance with rigid hierarchical priorities, with the power elite and elite intelligentsia at the top and the collective–farm peasantry at the bottom.”23"
"11","Mutual dependence or an exchange relationship can explain why a particular resourceful group may receive strong support or protection from the government. However, approaches based on an exchange relationship cannot explain why some groups that lack political and economic resources are able to successfully pursue their interests or obtain policy benefits. Explanations stressing the exchange relationship do not pay adequate attention to the state's autonomy. An autonomous state has an independent agenda consisting of policy priorities that are not controlled by powerful groups."
"12","In China, conflicting interests among different groups have become common, although some groups may be unorganized. Terms such as “interest groups” or “special interest groups” have been used frequently to describe how certain powerful groups pursue their interests at the expense of other parties or the public.24 The media's use of the terms “interest groups” and “special interest groups” often explicitly or implicitly distinguishes the said groups from other groups that lack organizational networks, political connections, and resources. Group interest is a useful analytical tool in understanding Chinese politics because government policies influence people as a group. For instance, agricultural policies tend to influence farmers as a whole. Social groups in China can be based on occupation (for example, occupational groups), type of business, or shared concerns or interests.25"
"13","As elsewhere, the power of a social group in China is determined by its influence in policymaking. Despite the non‐democratic system in China, consensus building remains an important characteristic in decision making. Earlier research suggests that “fragmented authoritarianism” is an important mode of decision making in China, which means pertinent parties are involved in the process, and bargaining and compromise become normal.26 But “fragmented authoritarianism” has not captured the impact of new social changes on the decision‐making process. New social changes in China require an understanding of the policy‐making process by examining the interactive dynamics between decision makers and external actors in areas that directly affect the latter's interests.         "
"14","In a new social environment, the political process in China has become more inclusive and flexible, although the inclusiveness and flexibility remain conditional and contingent on issues. As Andrew Mertha suggests, in China, the political process “has become somewhat less authoritarian: it has seen the sphere of political conflict increase, allowing actors hitherto relegated to being passive recipients of policy outputs to become influential players within the policy process.”27 Therefore, new social changes have brought new actors into the decision‐making process, as exemplified by the lobbying activities of businesses.28 Specifically, social demands have become important sources not only of policy input but also of pressure on state authorities or policymakers.29 However, not all groups benefit equally from the opening of political space or inclusiveness, and some groups are better positioned than others in terms of interaction with state authorities.         "
"15","On the other hand, although the state authority feels the need or pressure to make the decision‐making process inclusive and flexible, it still assumes significant autonomy. An autonomous state has its own policy agenda and priorities. The state's policy priorities dictate its propensity to accept or reject certain proposals. Its policy priorities also explain why even non‐political changes are sometimes difficult to introduce and why certain actors feel powerless in seeking policy adjustment. But policy priorities also help explain why the state sometimes grants policy benefits to politically weak groups. The state's autonomy implies that the degree of inclusiveness in policymaking varies across issues, with some decisions more exclusively made than others. Hence, the state's inclusiveness and flexibility in policymaking are not flabby, but conditional."
"16","Based on these considerations, this article suggests three sets of factors that significantly influence group power: the group's connections with the decision‐making body, its ability to generate non‐institutionalized pressure on the state authority, and the state's policy priorities. A group's connections with policy‐making authorities indicate its institutionalized access to the state authority. The non‐institutionalized power of a group is manifested through the external pressure that it wields when pursuing its interests. This article pays more attention to the state's policy priorities because these priorities determine the cost of policy adjustment. By stressing the state's policy priorities, this approach can help in understanding why certain powerful groups fail to protect their privileges and why other weak and unorganized groups may successfully pursue their interests."
"17","The most effective way to protect the interests of a group is to move its issues into the agenda and draft policies favorable to this group, or to exclude certain issues from the agenda and prevent the making of unfavorable policies. In China and elsewhere, having patrons, representatives, or agents in the decision‐making body helps a group influence policymaking. Agenda‐setting and policy content can be directly influenced by the presence of such supporters. Some groups have strong links to decision‐making bodies because they are historically well‐connected to state authorities or because they control strategically important resources, thus gaining patrons in the government."
"18","Not many groups have such patrons or representatives in decision‐making bodies. However, a group may still have a relatively strong influence if it has allies or sympathetic supporters in the policymaking body. If decision makers share the same policy preferences or hold interests that are aligned with a certain group, then there can be a coalition between the decision makers and that group.30 Decision makers may also be sympathetic to a group's demands and lend support to these, especially when doing so will not harm the decision makers' interests. A group's influence is affected not only by the number of its supporters in the decision‐making body but also by the preference of the players who assume key positions in the body.            "
"19","It is now common for groups to influence policymaking through existing or newly established connections with the decision‐making authority. For example, lobbying has become common in China, especially in the business sector. As regulations and laws have become determinants of industry, “all types of companies—state‐owned and private, Chinese and foreign—have become active in every stage of the policy process, from setting the agenda to identifying policy options and shaping regulatory implementation.”31 However, without pre‐existing connections with the decision‐making body, these companies or groups may encounter serious difficulty. Scott Kennedy shows that Chinese decision‐making authorities prefer to accommodate the interests of large businesses over small ones: “While small firms are occasionally aided by associations, one economic factor, in particular, size, has decisively shaped companies' relative ability to influence public policy.”32 In other words, small firms face more difficulties than do large firms in pursuing their interests, despite their associations with the policymaking body.            "
"20","A second factor affecting a group's ability to pursue its interests is the non‐institutionalized pressure it can exert on the government. Strong non‐institutionalized pressure can move a group's issue into the government's agenda or render this as an ad hoc priority requiring urgent action. The strength of this pressure depends on the group's ability to disrupt social, economic, or even political order in the society. Frances Piven and Richard Cloward suggest that the power of the poor lies in their ability to create institutional disruptions that threaten social or economic operations.33 Strikes, noncooperation, and social protests or social movements can generate such pressure. Social movements are “an important source of countervailing group power” in democracies “when movement espouses goals that attract large segments of the middle class.”34 Social protests can also cause non‐negligible pressure on authoritarian governments. Acemoglu and Robinson suggest that non‐democracies face “revolution constraints”: “an important issue in nondemocracies is to ensure that no group is unhappy enough to attempt to overthrow the regime or take other political or economic actions detrimental to the utility of the group in power.”35 In China, popular contention has contributed to policy implementation and policy adjustment,36 also leading the party‐state to view “building a harmonious society” as a top priority.            "
"21","Another form of non‐institutionalized pressure is public opinion. Even an authoritarian state needs to pay attention to public opinion in order to protect its legitimacy and to have a better chance of surviving crises.37 Strong support from the public strengthens a group's bargaining power. In other communist systems, the development of public opinion favorable to “the general interest” is considered the major safeguard of a correct distinction between “lawful” and “selfish” group interests.38 The proliferation of media agencies and the availability of new information technologies have created unprecedented opportunities for Chinese citizens to receive information and exchange views. Media is perhaps the most powerful social force in China today.39"
"22","As Theda Skocpol suggests, the state is not merely an arena in which conflicts over social and economic interests are battled. Instead, the state can be considered an autonomous structure, that is, “a structure with logic and interests of its own that are not necessarily equivalent to, or fused with, the interests of the dominant class in society or the full set of member groups in the polity.”40 Dietrich Rueschemeyer, Evelyn Stephens, and John Stephens also suggest that the structure, strength, and autonomy of the state apparatus and its interrelations with civil society, as well as the effect of transnational power relations, can influence both the balance of class power and state–society relations.41"
"23","An important implication of the state's autonomy is that the state authority has its own agenda or policy priorities that can be different from the needs of powerful groups or free from the control of any social group. The state's policy priorities have a significant effect on a group's pursuit of its interests. The lack of changes in policy priorities may benefit certain groups that have enjoyed the status quo. However, when policy priorities are challenged or when new priorities arise, changes in the government's issue agenda will occur. Thus, opportunities may arise for groups that have been disadvantaged by former policies. If the demands of disadvantaged groups are positively connected to the new agenda or to new policy priorities, their interests are likely to be accommodated. The state's autonomy also indicates that if powerful groups threaten the political or economic foundations of the state, the choice for the state becomes easy: to prevent the threat from occurring and to curb the influence of these groups."
"24","The state's policy priorities are especially important in understanding how weak actors pursue their interests in nondemocracies, in which they lack institutionalized channels, such as elections, to voice their group preferences. Moreover, these groups are politically weak precisely because they often lack strong supporters or allies in the decision‐making circle. Therefore, a shift in the state's policy priorities may create opportunities for these groups."
"25","Given their varied connections with the state authority responsible for policy making, groups exhibit different behavioral patterns. Groups that are better connected to state authorities tend to use and expand their connections to move their issues into the government's agenda and influence policymaking. These groups may also strengthen their influence by advocating their policy preferences through the media. Such examples include housing developers using the media to justify high housing prices. But disruptive action is normally not their choice. In contrast, groups that are not well connected to the state authority will need to establish connections or resort to non‐institutionalized power. Disorganized groups have to rely more on non‐institutionalized power. Both weak and powerful groups can increase their bargaining power if their issues are connected to state priorities in a positive way, and vice versa."
"26","These different sources of power shed light on the politics of policymaking and group activities in China. The privileges of certain groups, such as in monopolized industries, can be retained for a long time because of their strong links to policymakers. Vetoing proposals that threaten these privileges is relatively easy for their patrons or their supporters in policymaking bodies. Precisely because of the veto points in consensus building, weak groups face difficulties in competing against powerful groups. When weak groups do obtain favorable policies, it is often because their needs happen to match the state's policy priorities, sometimes in addition to having the support of their allies in the government and in society."
"27","This section presents two cases to demonstrate how groups of different institutionalized power pursue interests in China. The first case is the National Grid Company's manipulation of the national policy. This case shows how a well‐positioned group may abuse its power in the decision‐making body, creating policies at the expense of other groups that lack direct influence. An explanation for choosing this case is necessary. Groups' pursuit of interests does not necessarily result in zero‐sum games between these groups and other parties. In some democracies like the United States, the competition among interest groups can aid policymaking.42 In China, the lobbying of social groups may bring positive benefits to both policymaking and public interests.43 However, addressing how group activities may improve policymaking is not the aim of this article. Instead, it tries to examine how resourceful groups and weak groups pursue their group‐specific interests. This state company is selected because it illustrates how groups with strong connections exercise their influence in policymaking. In addition, a policy change that benefits the general public (for example, revision of certain laws) may result from the joint efforts of different parties, and assessing the role played by a particular group may be difficult. Hence, examining a group's pursuit of its group‐specific interests can better reveal its influence on the policymaking process.         "
"28","The second case concerns the abolition of peasants' financial burdens, revealing the difficulties and the opportunities faced by a weak group in pursuing its interests. Existing reports and research have shown the importance of non‐institutionalized power, such as media coverage and popular contention, in helping weak groups pursue their interests in China. The abolition of the custody and repatriation system in cities had much to do with the media's intensive coverage of the death of Sun Zhigang.44 Similarly, the central government's revision of the housing demolition policy in the early 2000s was partly caused by the widespread grievances and resistance of homeowners and the media's wide coverage of several suicide cases of homeowners. The government's efforts to hasten the establishment of welfare schemes in urban areas from the late 1990s to the early 2000 are directly linked to the widespread protests by laid‐off workers and unpaid retirees.45 But how weak groups without sufficient non‐institutionalized power are able to pursue their interests remains to be explored. Thus, this case is selected to show how the combination of conditions is sometimes required by these groups to advance their interests.         "
"29","The case of the National Electricity Corporation (NEC) achieving monopoly indicates the degree to which certain powerful groups can gain advantages through their connections with the decision‐making body. Before 1998, there were two grid systems that provided electricity to the Chinese countryside. One was managed by the NEC, which was reorganized in 2002, and the other was built and managed by local governments. By 1998, China had over 2,400 county‐level electricity bureaus or firms responsible for providing electricity to the countryside. In one third of these counties, the central government mainly owned the properties of the electricity enterprises. In the remaining two thirds, local governments and other local parties owned the properties. However, as acknowledged by a senior specialist involved in the subsequent remodeling project, the coexistence of the two systems was not what the NEC wanted. Rather, it wanted a monopoly.46"
"30","In June 1998, the central government began to remodel the rural grid to provide electricity to most peasants in the country. However, remodeling the rural grid was a process in which the NEC achieved monopoly by sacrificing the interests of local governments, local firms, and other local parties. During the 1990s, the NEC lobbied the central government agencies and central leaders to launch this remodeling project by arguing that it would bring many benefits to the country and its rural residents. The NEC's lobbying was considered to contribute to the central government's decision to start the project. More importantly, the leader of the NEC became one of the leaders of the national leading group of the grid remodeling project."
"31","The NEC leader who was part of the decision‐making body played an important role in shaping policy content. Membership in the leadership group enabled the company to pursue its interests in the name of accomplishing the central government's policy goal. An important policy that allowed the NEC to overcome resistant local governments was the so‐called “one province, one debtor,” indicating that in a province where the NEC provided the bulk of the electricity, only the NEC provincial branch could legally obtain bank loans for the remodeling project. Owing to the strong opposition and the appeal made by several provinces and cities, an exception to the policy was allowed in certain provinces. Thus, in provinces where two systems coexisted, both the NEC branch and the provincial‐level grid company could obtain bank loans."
"32","However, this policy amendment did not sufficiently counteract the NEC's ambitious plan. With so many bank loans under its control, the NEC proposed a “reform of ownership first, remodeling second” policy meant to strip assets from local governments. Given that the remodeling project was a political responsibility for local governments, most local governments hoped to obtain loans from the NEC and finish the remodeling to fulfill this responsibility. Against this background, the NEC branches took advantage of the local governments' weak position and began to control local property through various means, including undervaluation, fake investment, accumulation of shares of local property, and management of local property on behalf of local governments."
"33","In 2002, the NEC was broken up into five power‐generation group companies and two grid companies: the State Grid Corporation of China and the China Southern Power Grid. The China Southern Power Grid's business district covered five provinces,47 and the rest of China was allotted to the State Grid Corporation of China. By 2003, the remodeling of the rural grid was almost complete, with the two national companies gaining control over local enterprises at the great expense of local governments and other local parties.            "
"34","By 2006, approximately 1,200 of about 3,210 county‐ or city‐level electricity supply companies (37 percent) belonged either to the State Grid Corporation of China or the China Southern Power Grid, and 1,353 (or 42 percent) were either directly managed by these two companies or controlled through shareholding. Only 20.6 percent remained under the control of local governments or other local parties.48 Therefore, the grid remodeling project enabled these two companies to expand their control from one third to about 80 percent of the local electricity enterprises. Not surprisingly, local governments and local companies suffered tremendous losses.49 Some local electricity plants became unprofitable after losing their local grid system and being forced to use the grid system of—and submit to the pricing dictated by—the two companies.            "
"35","To some extent, the remodeling project hijacked the central government. Investment in the project eventually exceeded 300 billion yuan, despite the initial budget being set to 190 billion. Across the country, employees of the two companies benefited from the project. Their welfare improved dramatically, and many held property shares, some of which were obtained from local governments.50 Misappropriation, retention of allocated funds, reporting of fake projects, and corruption were later uncovered.            "
"36","This case demonstrates the degree to which certain groups in the decision‐making body may take advantage of their power. These national grid companies not only participated in the central government's decision making, but also assumed the responsibility of carrying out the project. Their advantage lay in the fact that they could present fait accompli, which made it difficult or costly for the central government to enact changes once the policy had been enforced.            "
"37","The central government grants a monopoly or tolerates the monopoly of certain state‐owned businesses for varying reasons. Some industries, such as oil, are considered strategically important to the regime, whereas others, such as telecommunications, are politically important. Pei points out the political rationale behind state support for monopolies in telecommunications and other industries. One reason is the telecommunications industry's direct effect on the regime's ability to control society. The other reason is that “the telecom sector is itself a huge patronage machine and a source of rent generation because it employs a large number of employees, invests massive capital, and collects monopoly rents. Direct control of this sector provides the regime the ability to reward and keep its supporters.”51"
"38","At the same time, these groups also have a strong incentive to protect their privileges by strengthening their political connections. This feature is not unique to China. Frieden explains why some Latin American businesses are eager to establish and strengthen connections with the government. These businesses are in sectors whose profitability depends on existing government policies, and the specificity of those assets depends directly on government actions. Hence, “sectors with more specific assets—higher entry barriers, less‐diversified portfolios—exert more pressure on policymakers and obtain more favorable policies.”52"
"39","Nevertheless, despite cases such as the grid remodeling project, underestimating the China state's autonomy would be inaccurate. The NEC was able to carry out the project because the central government believed it would benefit rural residents, although it did not anticipate the conflict between the company and local actors. In other words, the NEC's interests happened to match the central government's policy of addressing rural residents' lack of electricity. By the same token, when certain groups clearly threaten political or economic foundations, the choice of the party‐state becomes easy: curb the influence of these groups."
"40","One recent example is the central government's policy on real estate development. Local governments, housing developers, and banks are all powerful actors in China that have benefited tremendously from housing development and high housing prices. However, they are constrained by central government policies. On the other hand, the complaints and resentment of the weaker group—low‐income residents who cannot afford to buy homes—do not bear enough political weight to influence government policies, either. The central government's housing development policy is dictated by its attempts to balance economic development and economic bubbles."
"41","The worry over economic bubbles prompted the central government to enact measures to cool down the housing market in 2008. As a result, housing prices began to decline. However, because of the financial crisis that ensued, the central government became worried about economic growth and therefore relaxed its fiscal policy in 2009, resulting in a sharp increase in housing prices as well as provoking resentment in society. However, from mid‐2010, the government adopted a tightened fiscal policy and limited the number of apartments a household could buy in major cities because of its worry over the economic bubble. This action stabilized the market and housing prices.53 Some influential developers admitted in 2011 that, in the past, central government agencies would meet with developers to seek their opinions on the housing market, but this practice had ceased some time ago.54"
"42","Unlike the above case, the abolition of the agricultural tax represents a different way through which weak and unorganized groups can receive a positive policy response. From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, peasants' financial burdens, including taxes and various unauthorized fees, were among the major sources of widespread grievance and resistance in rural China.55 Between 1992 and 1996, at least 64 peasants died in confrontations during tax and fee collections.56 Although the central authority seemed aware that these financial burdens threatened social stability and damaged the legitimacy of its regime, reforms did not go smoothly. The initiation of local‐level reforms was opposed by some higher‐level authorities. At the central level, a lack of consensus among major leaders prolonged the acceptance of reforms initiated by local governments. Only in 2000 did the Chinese government formally endorse the tax‐for‐fee reform, which was initiated in Anhui province eight years previously.            "
"43","In Chinese agricultural areas, local cadres under heavy pressure to raise revenue had abused their power by collecting extra fees in addition to agricultural taxes, placing heavy financial burdens on the peasants. One way of reducing these financial burdens was to introduce the tax‐for‐fee reform. This reform limits the discretion of local officials in tax collection by allowing them to collect only an adjusted and unified tax, and not any extra fees.57"
"44","In 1992, a township in Anhui province started a tax‐for‐fee reform by unifying the tax rate into a flat fee (specifically, 30 yuan per mu of land) and outlawing the collection of any additional fees. This reform was undertaken despite opposition from the provincial People's Congress.58 The effect of the reform was immediate. Typically, organizing work teams was common among local governments to forcibly collect taxes and fees from reluctant peasant households. However, in the year the tax‐for‐fee reform was adopted, the township government took only 10 days to collect the tax, without the need for intervention by the militia or the police. However, because of political considerations, both township and county officials tried to maintain a low profile for the reform to avoid any risks.            "
"45","Taihe County, another county in the same district, adopted a safer approach to tax reform by submitting a reform plan to the provincial government for approval in 1993. When the provincial government agencies and the county leaders convened a meeting to discuss the plan, they were opposed by the provincial financial bureau that feared that the reform would decrease the revenue. Despite this opposition, the county party secretary and county magistrate both supported the reform, and the revised plan was eventually approved by the provincial government. The reform plan, which set a fixed amount for taxes to be paid by peasants, was implemented in 1994. However, the provincial governor intervened and ordered the reform to be stopped, perhaps because it contradicted the existing tax regulations. At this point, the provincial Party secretary intervened, and the reform continued. The effects were again immediate. It only took five days to collect all the taxes from 353,500 peasant households in the county, an impossible achievement under the old system. More importantly, the peasants' financial burdens were reduced by half. The year before the reform, about 500 peasants from Taihe county submitted 93 petitions regarding their financial burdens to the Party committees at different levels. In 1994, after the tax reform, not a single petition was submitted.59"
"46","Whereas the initiation of the reform encountered opposition, the lack of consensus among major central leaders delayed the central endorsement and thus the promotion of the reform. Despite this delay, Taihe's success had a positive effect on some neighboring counties. The reform was extended to more than 20 counties in Anhui and adopted in more than 50 counties in other provinces, including Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Guizhou, Shanxi, and Gansu."
"47","In 1995, a national conference on the experience of the tax‐for‐fee reform was held in the district to which Taihe belonged. Scholars and officials from central government agencies attended the conference, with all expressing support for the reform except for the officials from the Ministry of Finance. A report based on the meeting was then submitted to the central government. After reading the report, Jiang Chunyun, then vice premier, supported the reform and proposed a meeting to discuss the experiences with the reform. However, Zhu Rongji, another vice premier in charge of economic affairs, was more cautious and did not support convening the meeting. Despite widespread suffering among the peasants, the driving force for reform was not yet strong at the central level.60"
"48","Li Lanqing, another vice premier, went to inspect Henan province in 1996 and felt that local cadres had too much discretion in fee collection. Upon learning of a reform that combined fees and taxes and its popularity among peasants, he decided to visit Anhui. Li then became a supporter of the reform and, upon returning to Beijing, sent a letter and an investigation report to Premier Li Peng and all other vice premiers. The report, entitled “Suggestions on Alleviating Peasants' Financial Burdens,” was written by members of the National Political Consultative Conference, who had earlier conducted in‐depth investigations in Anhui and Hebei. Li Lanqing's letter was said to have been an important reason that tax reform received serious attention.61"
"49","Soon after Li's letter and the investigation report were disseminated, the central Rural Work Leadership Group put together an investigative team consisting of members from seven central government and party agencies and went to Hebei to conduct investigations. Still, there was a lack of strong consensus among the central leaders. Jiang Zemin then sent his secretary to Anhui. In December 1996, the central government issued a directive entitled “Decisions on Alleviating Peasants' Financial Burdens,” which lists measures to reduce peasants' burdens and states that exploration of the tax‐for‐fee reform could continue. This directive marked the first time that the central authority explicitly supported tax reform. However, the central authority remained cautious, deciding that it was still not the right time to promote tax reform. Some leaders were worried that the reform would affect too many fundamental economic and political issues, such as grain procurement and the entire financial system."
"50","When Zhu Rongji became the premier in March 1998, the State Council issued a directive entitled “Regulations on Grain Procurement.” This directive stipulated a series of measures intended to regulate the grain market, some of which contradicted the tax‐for‐fee reform measures carried out in a number of places. In particular, the directive suggested that grain procurement could only be carried out by the state grain system and not by non‐state agencies. However, many of the areas that adopted the tax‐for‐fee reform had abolished the grain procurement quota, implying that peasants could choose to sell grain to other parties as long as they paid their taxes.62 When local governments in these areas received this directive, they were puzzled and disappointed. Hebei's provincial leaders instructed the enforcement of the directive, and the tax reform was stopped in 37 of its counties and in over 60 counties in seven other provinces. However, in Anhui, the reform was not entirely stopped. The province's new governor sent a report to the State Council requesting that the reform be continued in its district of origin. Owing to his efforts, the tax‐for‐fee reform continued in some parts of Anhui.63"
"51","“Regulations on Grain Procurement,” which was questioned by some pro‐reform people, was a setback in the tax reform process. Because of the lack of consensus at the central level, Jiang Zemin intervened.64 In 1998, Jiang went to Anhui for an inspection and announced that the government should “reform and regulate the fee and tax system in rural China and explore the fundamental ways of alleviating peasants' financial burdens.”65 To some extent, Jiang's speech gave the final push for the tax‐for‐fee reform.66 The central government eventually decided to try the reform in Anhui province in 2000, extending it to 20 provinces in 2002 and then later to the whole country. Under the new tax scheme, peasants were expected to pay 8.4 percent of their income of the previous year as tax and were exempted from any other tax responsibility. After the tax reform, peasants' financial burdens across different provinces decreased by 24 percent to 60 percent.67"
"52","In 2004, the central government further decided to abolish the agricultural tax within five years. If the tax‐for‐fee reform was indeed successful in reducing the tax burden of the peasants, then why did the central government have to eventually abolish the agricultural tax? The reason is that the tax reform had serious limitations. Indeed, it had been long proposed that the government should abolish the agricultural tax. An official of the State Council reported in an interview that a prominent research officer of the State Council proposed abolishing rural taxes in the late 1990s to the central leaders, but it was not accepted.68 One reason for its rejection is the difficulty of gaining the central government's attention. From the late 1990s, central leaders spent much of their time on industrial restructuring and resolving the issue of laid‐off workers.               "
"53","A more important factor is the worry over the decrease in fiscal revenue. In theory, revenue from agricultural taxes only accounted for a small portion of the total amount of taxes collected. In 1996, it reached its highest level since 1991 at 5.35 percent of the total tax revenue, and in 2000 it accounted for only 3.7 percent of the total revenue.69 Therefore, the abolition of agricultural taxes should not have significantly affected the tax revenue of the government. However, this was only a part of the whole story. If all taxes and fees were abolished, many grassroots governments that relied on legal or illegal fees collected from peasants would not be able to sustain operations. Without subsidies, the economic foundation of rural governments would be destroyed. This consideration is an important reason for the central government's hesitation to reform the tax structure in rural China.70"
"54","Against this background, the central authority did not even have a consensus on whether the tax‐for‐fee reform should be carried out, not to mention tax abolition itself. The central government's eventual decision to abolish the tax stemmed from the limitations of the tax‐for‐fee reform that threatened several important national policy goals."
"55","One limitation of the reform was that it failed to alleviate the financial burdens of those farm households upon whom the government relied most for grain output. The tax‐for‐fee reform put families that relied on farming for most of their income at a disadvantage, at least relatively. Under the tax‐for‐fee system, tax was collected based on the amount of farmland a peasant household contracted as opposed to their family size. Therefore, peasant households with more land owed more taxes than those with less. The more land a household had, the poorer it could be if the grain price was low and the household did not have extra sources of income. For this reason, peasants in agricultural areas felt that they did not benefit much from the reform. According to a 2003 survey of about 2,100 peasant households in six provinces (Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Fujian, and Zhejiang), the average amount of taxes paid by peasant households in Anhui (312 yuan), Heilongjiang (483 yuan), Hunan (261 yuan), and Sichuan (237 yuan) after the tax‐for‐fee reform was still larger than that paid by their counterparts in Zhejiang province (130 yuan) or Fujian province (210 yuan), where the reform had not been introduced. Among the 319 households surveyed in Hunan province, 67 percent reported that their tax burden remained heavy even after the tax‐for‐fee reform.71"
"56","Another limitation of the tax reform is that it did not fully address the social grievances and conflicts in rural China. Deadly confrontations between peasants and local cadres continued despite the tax reform, with at least 30 peasants dying in tax collection–related violence between 2002 and 2003. Therefore, the threat to social stability remained. A close look into the places where deadly confrontations or suicides occurred reveals that a majority of these incidents took place in agricultural areas, including Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. According to the 2003 survey of 2,100 peasant households, households with more farmland tended to report that the tension between peasants and rural cadres did not decrease, and in some cases, was even heightened after the tax‐for‐fee reform. Out of the 319 households surveyed in Hunan province, 23 percent reported that the relationship between cadres and peasants improved after the reform, and 76 percent reported no change or worsened relations.72 Indeed, in several agricultural provinces (that is, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Henan), the deaths continued into 2004. The persistence of peasant resistance directly contradicted the government's goal of building a harmonious society.               "
"57","Moreover, the farming households benefiting poorly from the reform highlighted the increase in the urban–rural income gap. In 1997, the per capita income of urban residents was 2.47 times greater than that of rural residents; in 2003 it was 3.23 times greater.73 As agricultural income was already limited, additional taxes further reduced peasants' income. All these limitations were connected with the issue of peasants' incentives to farm. Consequently, China's grain output began to decline in 1999, despite the tax‐for‐fee reform.               "
"58","To strengthen peasants' incentives to farm, the central government began to subsidize peasant households, especially those in areas that produced the most grain. A directive issued by the central Party committee and the government in 2004 expanded efforts to help and subsidize farming households. This announcement marked the first time in the history of Communist China that the Party‐state issued a directive with the goal of increasing peasant income in the name of the central Party committee and the State Council. In 2004, the decline of grain output stopped. A member of the central Party committee's Financial and Economic Leadership Group admitted that the directive was “crucial to the increase in grain output and peasant income.”74 Once the central government became willing to subsidize the farming households most heavily taxed under the tax‐for‐fee system, the abolition of the agricultural tax would be politically and economically rewarding. With more sympathetic leaders like Wen Jiabao coming to power, the abolition of the agricultural tax was accomplished.               "
"59","The cases of tax reform and tax abolition point to both the difficulties and the possibilities of making policies that favor weak groups in China. Despite their vast number, peasants are a weak group in China. In the case of tax reform, their demands were overshadowed by worries over fiscal revenue on the part of certain central leaders and the financial department until a combination of factors eventually led the government to address the peasants' problems. The peasants did have some non‐institutionalized power, in the sense that they staged persistent resistance and received support from the media. Peasants also had sympathetic supporters in the decision‐making body, such as the vice premiers previously mentioned. However, in the end, the tax reform only became a reality through the support of Jiang Zemin. The eventual abolition of the agricultural tax was largely due to limitations in tax reform that threatened several important policy goals of the central government, particularly those of grain production."
"60","The presence of social groups with conflicting interests is common in any society, regardless of political system. In China, both the government and the public openly acknowledge conflicting group interests. By focusing on the factors affecting a group's ability, this article explains why both resourceful groups and weak groups in China have been able to pursue their respective interests. It finds that social groups may have access to different leverages or sources of power. A groups' ability is shaped by its connections with policymakers, its non‐institutionalized power, and the extent to which the group's demands align with state priorities. Depending on their access to these sources of power, weak groups can sometimes receive positive policy responses from the government."
"61","These factors that affect a group's pursuit of interests have important implications for understanding state–society interaction and political development in China. The state's independent policy agenda determines that changes in certain areas are understandably slow. Moreover, groups that are well‐connected to the decision‐making body are historically more likely to enjoy long‐term privileges because their political connections cannot be easily eliminated. In China, these groups are usually state‐owned businesses enjoying a market monopoly granted by state policies. These businesses are better organized because they are few in number. As elsewhere, better‐organized economic sectors tend to have more success in obtaining favorable policies.75 This is the major reason that the reform of some economic sectors (for example, telecommunication and banking) has been slow or absent. The persistence of certain groups can be detrimental to a country's socioeconomic development.76"
"62","Nevertheless, because of the rise of social forces, both the government and powerful groups in China increasingly face pressure when pursuing their interests at the expense of the public or other parties. Non‐institutionalized pressure generated by the media, new information technologies, and/or popular contention has become an important force that the government cannot afford to ignore. Issues generating severe non‐institutionalized pressure are often very pressing and require the government to take action with little delay. Timely response can avoid or reduce the undesirable consequences of the issue in question."
"63","An even conditionally responsive state may shore up legitimacy. Legitimacy indicates how much trust the people have in the system or the rulers. Regimes with high levels of political trust tend to receive more political support and enjoy political stability. Therefore, legitimacy helps maintain stability. As David Easton suggests, “A belief in legitimacy is necessary for the maintenance of support, at least for political systems that persist for any appreciable length of time,” because legitimacy is a “belief in the right of authorities to rule and members to obey.”77 William Gamson also writes that “the existing trust orientation toward authorities … affects the means of influence a group will use.”78 Thus, people who believe in a regime's legitimacy are less likely to take dramatic modes of action to overthrow it. In China, the government's responsiveness to social grievances is an effort of legitimacy building. By creating political space for the large numbers of weak people to pursue their legitimate interests, the regime can have its “revolutionary constraints” alleviated.79"
"64","Hence, as long as the Party‐state's concern about legitimacy remains, there is a possibility for the weak to successfully pursue their interests. This offers insight into the regime resilience in China. The longevity of China's Communist regime has given rise to a debate on the reasons for its resilience. For example, Andrew Nathan points out that the CCP has adopted a number of measures, including the establishment of institutions for political participation, to increase the degree of institutionalization within the CCP, which in turn enhances its resilience and ensures its political survival.80 However, opinions may differ. According to Pei, institutionalization is not the major reason behind the regime's resilience. “Instead, the principal reasons for the CCP's survival since Tiananmen have been robust economic performance and consistent political repression. Although it is true that the CCP may have improved its political tactics, its survival for the last two decades would have been unthinkable without these two critical factors.”81"
"65","Proving counterfactual propositions is always difficult, if not impossible. Indeed, economic development enables the Party‐state to use resources to address many social and economic problems. It may also be true that repression continues to be crucial to the CCP's regime survival. However, the findings of this article suggest that in state–citizen interaction, the regime may enhance its resilience and chances of political survival through legitimacy building. Legitimacy can be achieved through economic development,82 and it can also be achieved if the state becomes more responsive to social demands that do not threaten the regime. The state's responsiveness is an effective method of legitimacy building, especially when it does not involve high political or economic costs.         "
