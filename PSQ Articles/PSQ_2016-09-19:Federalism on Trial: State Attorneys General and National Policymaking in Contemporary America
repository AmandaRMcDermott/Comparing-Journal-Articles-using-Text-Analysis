"1","Paul Nolette has written a must‐read book for anyone who is interested in the role that state attorneys general (AGs) play in today's policy battles. AGs grabbed the national spotlight in the 1990s when they banded together to take on Big Tobacco. As Nolette shows in Federalism on Trial, the tobacco lawsuits were only the beginning. Drawing together rich materials on the interactions between Congress, administrative agencies, regulated parties, interest groups, and AGs, Nolette demonstrates how coordinated AG litigation has shaped policy on topics ranging from pharmaceutical pricing to climate change.         "
"2","Nolette explains that “[t]he backdrop for contemporary AG activism . . . has been two key developments . . . since the latter half of the twentieth century: the increased importance of both states and litigation in the process of policy implementation” (p. 200). As the term “activism” suggests, Nolette's perspective is decidedly critical, and his critique tracks the twin developments he highlights. Thus, part of it focuses on federalism, part of it on litigation."
"3","Nolette presents AG litigation as a perversion of federalism because AGs are seeking to expand or modify national policy rather than block it. For Nolette, “[t]his complicates the standard conception of intergovernmental conflict, which typically focuses on state efforts to protect their interests against a federal government encroaching on their prerogatives” (p. 2). But federalism today is not only (or even mostly) about the states resisting federal incursions into particular areas; it is about states shaping national policy from within “cooperative federalism” programs that enlist states in the implementation and enforcement of federal law. In a world in which few issues are off limits to the federal government and federal law often preempts states’ efforts to regulate on their own terms, state interests may be impaired by federal inaction as much as by federal action. States that want stronger regulation can push the feds to act, or they can take advantage of the tools that federal law gives them to adjust primary behavior themselves. That is precisely what Nolette shows AGs doing—and it is our modern federalism at work."
"4","Nolette's more substantial critique focuses on states’ use of litigation to shape policy. He argues that AG settlements often have the same practical effect as administrative regulations but lack the procedural and political safeguards that structure, and legitimize, the legislative and rulemaking processes. Although this critique is not new to Nolette, he gives it added heft with detailed examples of AGs using litigation to establish policies that had been considered and rejected by Congress and federal agencies.         "
"5","Of course, there is an alternative story, in which AGs are white knights offering citizens an escape from a regulatory status quo produced by capture and dysfunction rather than healthy democracy. Nolette's book is strongest where he addresses this possibility head‐on. He contends, for example, that AGs lack both expertise and incentives to consider the full consequences of their policy initiatives and that the litigations' focus on winners and losers undermines the potential for productive intersystemic dialogue. Many questions remain, however. Do AGs’ broad mandates protect them from capture, compared with specialized agencies? Are conflicts between AGs and other elected officials a problem for accountability (as Nolette suggests) or an example of accountability‐promoting checks and balances? How does AG litigation compare with programmatic litigation by private parties and attorneys? In future work, perhaps Nolette will expand his comparative institutional analysis to address these and other lingering questions."
