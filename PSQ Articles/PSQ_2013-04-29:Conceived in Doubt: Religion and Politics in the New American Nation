"1","“Was it a god, strangers, or some man who gave you your laws?” So asks the Athenian Stranger at the beginning of Plato's Laws. Amanda Porterfield wonders the same of her country's Founding, and she ruefully concludes that Americans answered “a god”—the God of the Bible. It did not have to be that way, in her view. In the 1790s, skepticism of religious authority gained momentum, reaching its peak with Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason in 1794 and 1795 (p. 14). The tide turned back around 1800, when “at the pivotal moment of religious and political formation in the United States, reaction against skepticism from both sides of the political divide secured a privileged place for religion in American society” (p. 5).         "
"2","There were two main causes. First and foremost, the “religious growth and organization” of evangelicals that “burst forward around 1800” “overwhelm[ed] any trend toward skepticism” (p. 6). Contrary to Nathan Hatch's 1989 The Democratization of Christianity, “evangelicalism” was not a democratizing force but an intellectually authoritarian movement that developed “techniques for managing doubt” by “making it a step in conversion that could be revisited to rekindle belief when trust in God faltered” (p. 13). As a result, “at the turn of the nineteenth century, aggressive defenders of religion blocked the critical inquiry into religion and politics that had developed in the 1790s” (p. 12).         "
"3","Liberal rationalists like Paine (and Thomas Jefferson) were also to blame. Their “naïve conceptions of reason” as “grounded in nature proved inadequate as a political philosophy, and the anticipation that natural reason would liberate mankind from political and religious tyranny proved overly optimistic” (p. 12), especially in light of “the violence of the French Revolution” (p. 31). “After the Revolution, partisan activists exploited rising tides of suspicion, and defenders of biblical revelation discredited nature and reason as sufficient guides in themselves” (p. 45)."
"4","There is much to learn from and argue with in this book. It invites deeper study of the political character of early evangelicalism and of the Founding relationship between liberal rationalism and Biblical revelation. But Porterfield leaves two vital questions incompletely answered. While she notes that Paine's rationalism required an almost‐“religious…faith in natural reason” (p. 38) that could make it fanatical (as it became in the French Revolution), she does not adequately explain why. The Age of Reason did not meet or refute Biblical revelation on its own grounds—the kind of personal experience emphasized by evangelicals (p. 125) of one's own radical insufficiency in the transcendently beautiful presence of a holy God of perfect justice. So Paine's rationalism attacked or dismissed (rather than engaged) the evangelical position, an attitude also sometimes evident in Porterfield's argument, especially her repeated claim that “the cultural shift from skepticism to religion” was “provoked by anxiety and cynicism” (p. 78) rather than, perhaps, also by modern skepticism's inability to satisfy the soul.         "
"5","Second, was there a viable alternative to Biblical authority or Paine's rationalism? Porterfield suggests the skepticism supposedly embodied by the ambitious Aaron Burr (p. 44), but she never demonstrates that such “open‐ended pursuit of ‘understanding’ and mental ‘improvement”’ (p. 45) could generate a teaching to guide American public life, unlike the more Xenophonic skepticism of the public‐spirited Benjamin Franklin, which was “respectful of Christian morality and mildly observant of Christian rituals” (p. 30)."
"6","Despite her title, Porterfield shows that America was conceived less in doubt and more in belief. It was, though, a particular kind of belief: the Founding generation's conviction that human beings could understand the self‐evident truths of the Declaration of Independence by enlightened study of Biblical revelation or by careful reflection on “the laws of nature and of nature's God” (or both). It is unfortunate that later ideologues and partisans tried to pull apart America's founding dedication to that proposition."
