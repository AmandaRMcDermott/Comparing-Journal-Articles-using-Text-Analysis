"1","THE 2014 MIDTERM ELECTIONS LEFT THE Republican Party in its strongest position on Capitol Hill since the 71st Congress (1929–1930). The Republicans gained a net 13 seats in the House of Representatives to augment the majority they have held since 2010, but their most important victories were in Senate contests, where they picked up 9 Democratic seats while losing none of their own to take majority control. Republicans entered the 114th Congress (2015–2016) with House and Senate majorities of 247–188 and 54–46, respectively.1 The election results are summarized in Table 1.         "
"2","The election that delivered the Republican victory replicated two well‐documented patterns in American electoral politics, one long standing, the other more recent. First, the electorate, in aggregate, once again treated the midterm as a referendum on the economy and the president's job performance, with predictable consequences. Second, the 2014 elections extended the trend toward increasingly partisan and nationalized congressional elections, centered on the president, that has become a hallmark of the new century. The combination cost the Democrats dearly, as Barack Obama's standing with the public in the fall of 2014 was near its lowest point in his presidency, and Democrats could not escape his shadow. With that shadow so dominant, the fact that both congressional parties and Congress itself were held in even lower regard than the president—suffering their lowest popular ratings in any election season on record—turned out to be inconsequential."
"3","In addition to providing evidence for these conclusions, this article extends through 2014 data documenting several crucial trends, initially identified in previous articles published in this journal and elsewhere, to confirm that the United States has entered an era of nationalized, polarized, party‐centered electoral politics quite different from the candidate‐centered electoral world of the 1970s and 1980s. Electoral processes have coevolved with partisan polarization in national politics in a mutually reinforcing spiral, and the 2014 iteration offers no prospect of relief from the intense partisan warfare that has characterized U.S. politics during most of the past three presidencies."
"4","Republican strategists sought to make the 2014 elections a referendum on the Obama administration, and they succeeded.2 But even without this effort, past electoral patterns suggest that they would have gained a comparable number of House seats and probably taken the Senate as well. The simplest referendum model posits that House seat swings between elections are a function of how many seats the president's party currently holds, how the economy is doing, and how highly the public rates the president's job performance.3 Estimates from a model using conventional measures of these variables predicted that Republicans would add about 12 seats to their House majority.4 Other forecasting models predicted Republican gains of 4 to 16 House seats (average, 14) and 5 to 8 Senate seats (average, 6).5 Republicans actually gained 13 seats, so the House models were spot‐on. The Senate models underestimated the Republican gains by several seats. The surprise was not so much that Republicans picked up 9 seats, however—the Cook Political Report rated 3 Democratic seats as leaning, likely, or safe Republican and another 7 as toss‐ups, so the Democrats' vulnerability was clear—but that several of these victories were by unexpectedly wide margins.6                     "
"5","The 2014 midterm, then, can be appropriately interpreted as a negative referendum on the current administration that reflected popular discontent with the president and an economy that, although growing, had yet to deliver perceptible improvement to the economic welfare of a large majority of ordinary Americans.7 As such, it takes its place among the other historic midterms in which voters took their frustrations out on the presidents' party,8 although Democratic losses in the House were limited because their 2010 “shellacking” had already cleared out most of their vulnerable seats (see Table 1).9 The processes through which the referendum registered were not, however, the same as they had been in the last century,10 but rather reflected the highly nationalized, party‐centered electoral environment that has emerged over the past two decades.         "
"6","President Obama won reelection in 2012 by reviving the strong support he had enjoyed early in his administration among ordinary Democrats and by getting his supporters to the polls.11 As Figure 1 shows, his overall job approval ratings were higher at the time of his reelection than at any other time after his first year in office.12 In the year following his reelection, his ratings fell from the low 50 s to the low 40 s and stayed at that level throughout 2014. Figure 2 shows that the attrition occurred equally among Democrats and independents, falling about 14 points between Obama's reelection and the midterm; his standing among Republicans fell very little because it was already near rock bottom.            "
"7","The decline in Obama's job approval is open to multiple explanations. Administrative problems (for example, with the Affordable Care Act rollout, problems in the Veterans Health Administration's medical services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's initial response to the Ebola threat) continually brought Obama's management into question. His cautious and hesitant responses to overseas challenges posed by the Syrian civil war, the rise of the “Islamic state,” and Russia's aggression in Ukraine drew criticism from both sides, with Republicans favoring more aggressive actions and Democrats unhappy about the prospect of revived military involvement in the Middle East. Thus, while Obama's post‐reelection job performance rating fell about 10 points (from 52 percent to 42 percent), his rating on handling terrorism dropped 17 points (from 59 to 42 percent), and on foreign policy, it dropped 14 points (from 49 percent to 35 percent).13 Improvements in the economy, which grew an average of 2.9 percent per quarter following Obama's reelection, with unemployment falling from 7.9 percent to 5.8 percent, did not help, as most Americans, experiencing stagnant wages and family incomes, did not think the economy was improving. Obama's approval rating on the economy was essentially flat at about 42 percent over the first two years of his second term.            "
"8","The decline in job approval ratings offered by two important components of Obama's reelection coalition was especially consequential for 2014. Figure 3 shows the rise in Obama's standing among Hispanics after his executive implementation of elements of the DREAM (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) Act prior to the 2012 election and its subsequent 22‐point drop thereafter, as deportations continued, immigration reform legislation stalled, and Obama delayed further executive action to protect undocumented residents until after the election in a vain attempt to shield vulnerable Senate Democrats representing red states from the inevitable backlash it would provoke. His standing also declined more among the youngest citizens than among older age cohorts (see Figure 4), dropping 14 points from its post‐reelection peak to settle below 50 percent during the election year. Latinos and younger Americans still held Obama in higher regard than did the rest of the citizenry, but by significantly smaller margins than they did two years earlier.            "
"9","Declining enthusiasm for President Obama among minority and younger voters, who have a lower propensity to vote to begin with,14 made it impossible for Democrats to reassemble their successful 2012 coalition for 2014. According to the national exit poll data reported in Table 2, the 2014 electorate looked much more like the 2010 electorate than the one that reelected Obama. It was older (65 percent were 45 or older, compared to 55 percent in 2012) and whiter (75 percent compared to 72 percent), and the young and minority voters who did turn out were more Republican in their leanings as well. It was, in short, a more Republican electorate (Table 3), and this is what mattered most. According to the exit polls, compared to 2012, the proportion of Republicans was up 3 percentage points, and the proportion of Democrats was down by the same amount. Party loyalty was very high among partisans on both sides in both elections, so this shift was sufficient to account for most of the drop between 2012 and 2014 in both the share of votes cast nationally for Democratic House candidates (−3.7 points) and the average two‐party vote for the Democrat in districts contested in both elections (−3.5 points). Republicans won not by expanding their appeal across party lines but by mobilizing their partisans more effectively, a task made easier by the Republican base's profound antipathy to the president and eagerness to express it at the polls.15                           "
"10","Republicans benefited from higher turnout in the hotly contested Senate elections as well. In every competitive state defended by Democrats for which comparative exit poll data are available,16 the electorates were less Democratic and more Republican in 2014 than in 2008, when a Democrat had won the seat, and by an average of about 2.4 percentage points. Party loyalty among Democrats was actually higher in 2014 than it had been in 2008 in these states (on average, 93 percent of Democrats reported voting for their party's candidate, compared with 91 percent in 2008); however, Republican loyalty rose much more, from an average of 85 percent in 2008 to 93 percent in 2014, and independents also moved toward the Republicans in nearly all of these states. In both the competitive states and overall in Senate races, the Republican vote averaged about 7 points higher than it had been in 2008.            "
"11","The high levels of party loyalty reported in the 2014 House and Senate exit polls are typical of recent elections.17 The increase in party‐line voting over the past two decades is but one sign of the growing partisan coherence observable in national elections that, by several measures, reached a new postwar high in the 2014 midterm. Figure 5, which displays the standard deviations of the Democratic House vote swing from the prior election in stable districts for elections going back to 1946,18 reveals the extraordinary degree to which the House elections were nationalized in 2014. The smaller the standard deviation, the more uniform the swing across districts, and thus the more nationalized the election. The 2014 midterm swing was, by a clear margin, the most uniform for the entire postwar period, with at standard deviation (4.3 points) less than half the size of its average for the 1970s and 1980s.

"14","Figure 6 displays another measure of electoral coherence that also highlights the degree to which President Obama was a focus for nationalizing electoral politics in 2014. The correlation between Obama's share of the vote in the House district in 2012 and the Democrat's share in 2014 was .94, just shy of the record for elections going back to 1952 set in 2012 (.95); for Senate elections, the state‐level correlation was .88, the highest yet observed. Figure 7 highlights the remarkable extent to which the Senate election results in 2014 echoed the 2012 presidential vote. With the exception of Maine's Republican senator Susan Collins, the 2014 results are tightly aligned with Obama's 2012 vote; indeed, without Collins, the correlation between the two grows to .95. The figure also underlines the Republican advantage in the set of states contested in 2014: seven states defended by Democrats had gone to Mitt Romney in 2012, and they lost all of them. They also lost two states—Colorado and Iowa—that Obama had won by a narrow margin. The Democratic candidates in these states ran significantly behind what would have been predicted from Obama's 2012 vote, confirming observers' accounts of major flaws in their campaigns.19 In contrast to 2010 and 2012,20 Republican operatives and donors made a concerted and successful effort to prevent the nomination extreme ideologues or otherwise weird Senate candidates in winnable states in 2014 and so were able to take full advantage of the favorable partisan landscape.21                     "

"16","Note: For midterm elections, the Senate [House] vote is correlated with the presidential vote in the state [district] two years earlier.                     "
"17","Figure 7 also raises questions about the impact of the huge sums spent in the competitive Senate races. Total spending on the 2014 Senate campaigns exceeded $1 billion, with nearly half spent by parties and outside groups rather than by the candidates' campaigns. As always, spending was concentrated in the tightest contests—the nine rated “toss‐ups” by the Cook Political Report are listed in Table 4—which accounted for nearly 64 percent of total spending and 83 percent of money spent independently in 2014 Senate campaigns. In these nine states, independent expenditures made up an average of 58 percent of total spending. The North Carolina campaign was the most expensive Senate campaign ever, while Alaska set a new record for spending per eligible voter.            "
"18","What difference did all this money make? The statistical evidence suggests that the answer is “almost none.” With incumbency and the 2012 presidential vote in the state taken into account, candidate spending had a very modest effect on the vote, significant only for Republican candidates and adding only 1.3 percent to the variance explained by regressing the vote on these variables (the presidential vote and incumbency alone explain 82.7 percent of the variance). The estimated effects of outside spending were tiny and insignificant estimated either by themselves or in combination with the candidate spending variables.22 Before concluding that the frenzied activities of the parties and super PACs were a colossal waste of money, however, it is worth considering some other possibilities. First, it is obvious from the data in Table 4 that with spending totals so high, neither candidate enjoyed a decisive advantage. All of these candidates, with help from their outside backers, had more than adequate resources for getting their messages out; spending on both sides in these states went well beyond the point that marginal returns would be vanishingly small. Without a meaningful spending difference between the candidates, the effects of these campaigns, as measured by the amount spent, would cancel each other out even if they actually influenced some voters' decisions. If one side had not been so lavishly funded, its candidate might well have been swamped.            "
"19","Second, the statistical dominance of the 2012 Obama vote in accounting for the Senate results may be, at least in part, a product of these campaigns. Saturation advertising designed and financed by national organizations on the Republican side sought to tie every Democrat to Obama, thus making it impossible for those campaigning in red or purple states to carve out individual political identities, distinct from their party and its leader, that would have been better suited to local political conditions. Moreover, more than three‐fourths of the money spent independently by parties and other outside groups was devoted to attacking the other party's candidate, and amid the barrage of shrill negative propaganda from both sides, many voters may have simply tuned out and fallen back on their partisan priors. The high levels of party‐line voting reported in the exit polls are consistent with these speculations. So is the fact that the incumbency advantage in the 2014 Senate elections, measured in vote shares, was only 4.1 percentage points, well below the typical advantage enjoyed by Senate incumbents over the previous three decades.23                           "
"20","The nationalization of electoral politics sharply reduced the electoral advantages of incumbency in the 2014 House elections as well. The value, in vote shares, of House incumbency status has been declining irregularly since its peak in the mid‐1980s, and by 2012 it had reached its lowest point since the early 1960s, before the steep increase that inspired a generation of scholarly research on the phenomenon.24 The data in Figure 8 confirm that the 2012 result was no fluke. The figure shows trends in three measures of incumbency advantage in elections from 1952 through 2014: the “slurge,” which is the average of the “sophomore surge” and “retirement slump”;25 the Gelman‐King index; and a variant of the Gelman‐King index that allows estimates for years following apportionment.26 All three measures mark the same trends and, more important, reveal that the House incumbency advantage was unusually small in 2014, estimated to be worth only 2.6 to 3.6 percentage points, depending on the specific measure.            "
"21","The incumbency advantage's steep erosion is a direct consequence of the rise in party‐line voting, the decline in ticket splitting, and the strengthening of the connections between partisanship, opinions of the president, and voting decisions observed in recent elections. As the parties have become more polarized and the electorate better sorted into the appropriate party (according to their ideological and policy preferences), incumbents have found it increasingly difficult to attract support across party lines, and thus on average, they do only a few points better in elections than would nonincumbent candidates running under same party label.27                           "
"22","Partisan consistency at the district and state levels has also sharply reduced the incidence of split results, in which a party wins the congressional seat in a district that its presidential candidate loses. In 2012, only 26 of the 435 House districts delivered such split verdicts, the lowest by far in elections since 1952 (the previous low was 59 in 2004). Even after the Republican gains in 2014, only 31 House districts were represented by the party that lost the district presidential vote in the previous election, again, a record low for a midterm (the old record was 62 seats, set in 2002). Just as in 2012, House candidates found it exceedingly difficult to win districts that, according to their presidential vote, leaned even modestly toward the other party. Once common, such victories have grown quite rare. Figure 9 displays the proportion of Democratic and Republican House winners representing districts in which their party's presidential candidate ran 2 percentage points or more behind his national major‐party vote percentage in the current or, for midterms, previous election, in elections since 1952. Only 12 candidates won districts against the partisan grain in 2014, the same as in 2012. Table 5 shows the distribution of net changes between these elections. Democrats lost four of their Republican‐leaning districts; Republicans gained four Democratic‐leaning districts and five of the balanced districts.            "
"23","The data in Table 5 illustrate two other crucial points. First, the number of balanced districts is small, representing only about 7 percent of House districts, a proportion that has declined rather steadily from its high in the mid‐1980s of about 18 percent.28 Relatively few districts now encourage moderation by containing nearly equal numbers of Republican and Democratic voters. Second, a lot more districts lean Republican than lean Democratic, a consequence of the structural advantage the Republican Party derives from the more efficient distribution of its regular voters. Although Republican gerrymanders reinforced this advantage after the 2000 and 2010 censuses, it has existed for decades as a product of coalition demographics.29 Democrats win a disproportionate share of minority, single, young, secular, gay, and highly educated voters who are concentrated in urban districts that deliver lopsided Democratic majorities. Regular Republican voters are spread more evenly across suburbs, smaller cities, and rural areas, so fewer Republican votes are “wasted” in highly skewed districts. This imbalance was as great in the 1970s as it is today, but with the rise of party‐line voting and decline in ticket splitting, it has become much more consequential. Under the current configuration, Democrats would have to win all of the Democratic‐leaning and balanced districts plus eight Republican‐leaning districts to reach a majority in the House (218 seats). The party's prospects for winning control of the House any time soon are consequently remote, a point I will return to in the conclusion.            "
"24","The electoral dominance of partisanship in 2014 explains one of the curious aspects of the election. Obama may have been relatively unpopular, but Congress as whole and the congressional parties were even more so. In the three months leading up to the election, an average of only 14 percent of Americans approved of their Congress's performance, while 80 percent disapproved, the lowest rating ever for any comparable election‐year period. Average approval of the congressional parties and their leaders—30 percent for Democrats, 21 percent for Republicans—was also unusually low. Voters surveyed prior to the 2014 election reported the lowest support for reelecting either most members of Congress or their own representative for any midterm in which the question has been asked.30 Moreover, as we have seen, incumbency status cut relatively little ice with voters in 2014. Despite the public's widespread dissatisfaction with Congress, its leaders, and its members, 96 percent of the House incumbents (98 percent of Republicans, and 93 percent of Democrats) won reelection, with only 4 losing primaries and only 13 losing the general election. The stunning upset of Republican House majority leader Eric Cantor in his June primary in Virginia turned out to be an anomaly rather than a harbinger.            "
"25","In the end, then, the electorate's nearly universal disdain for Congress was inconsequential. With control of the Congress divided between the parties, each side could, and did, blame the other for its dysfunction. Voters were not particularly happy with their own congressional party and perhaps even its local candidate, but their opinions of the other party were much lower, so they had no reason to defect to the other side.31 As a result, House incumbents won reelection at a rate that was actually higher than the 94 percent average of the last three decades. Incumbents were as successful in winning reelection in 2014 as they had been in the 1970s and 1980s, when the incumbency advantage was at its peak (see Figure 8), not because they were incumbents but because a very large majority of them now represented districts where their party was locally dominant and they were protected by the high levels of party‐line voting that have become the norm. Of course, the same norm cost five Democratic Senate incumbents their jobs. Senators have also found it increasingly difficult to win states that lean toward the other party (measured as in Table 5); only Republican Susan Collins of Maine did so in 2014.32 After the 2014 election, 84 Senators represented states won by their presidential candidate in 2012, a new high for this measure of electoral coherence (Figure 10).            "
"26","Partisan sorting across districts and states has given the congressional parties increasingly disparate electoral bases. This is evident in the growing difference in the average presidential vote between constituencies won by Democrats and constituencies won by Republicans. This difference, which had reached a high point in both chambers after 2012, grew even wider after 2014.33 House Democrats in the 114th Congress represent districts in which Obama won an average of 67.4 percent of the vote, while the winning Republicans represent districts in which he won an average of only 40.9 percent, a difference of 26.5 percentage points. The average difference between the electoral bases of the House parties, measured in this way by the presidential vote, has been widening steadily since the 1980s, when it was about 10 points, and the gap for 2014 is the widest yet observed (Figure 11). The equivalent state‐level gap for senators elected in 2014 is also a new record; the average 2012 vote for Obama in states won by Democrats was 58.3 percent, compared with 41.6 percent in states won by Republicans, a difference of 16.7 points (Figure 12).

"
"31","This growing divergence of the House and Senate parties' electoral bases is a fundamental source of partisan polarization in Congress. Insofar as members are responsive to the voters who put them in office, they are bound to disagree on how to deal with the wide range of policy issues that, to a growing extent, divide partisans in the electorate.34 The widening ideological gap between the congressional parties, abundantly documented in analyses of roll call voting,35 thus reflects the increasing divergence of their electoral coalitions. But, in turn, party polarization in Congress encourages the electoral behavior that fuels this divergence.36 It makes perfect sense for voters to use strictly partisan criteria in choosing people to represent them in Congress in an era when the parties are further apart ideologically than at any time since the Civil War and more than 90 percent of floor votes on contested issues are cast along party lines.37 It is not surprising that the incumbency advantage, based on the personal vote, would be diminished in an era when, at least with regard to how they vote on the floor, partisan members appear to be interchangeable.            "
"32","The 2014 election offers little prospect of any respite from the fierce partisan conflict and policy gridlock that have prevailed in Washington since the 2010 election. Both chambers will be at least as polarized as they were in the 113th Congress. Six of the nine departing Senate Democrats were from the most moderate third of their party in the 113th Congress; only one of the incoming Republicans is likely to vote to the left of the Senate Republican median.38 The new Senate will thus probably be even more ideologically polarized than the old. The extraordinarily small number of House members who represent districts leaning to the other party did not change (Table 5), and so neither has the number of members needing to build records that might have some cross‐party appeal. “Moderate” will remain a nearly empty category in the 114th Congress.39                     "
"33","Demographic differences will continue to provide another line of cleavage splitting the congressional parties in the new Congress. Although Republicans made history by electing their first African American woman to the House (Mia Love of Utah) and the first black senator ever elected from the South (Tim Scott of South Carolina), the demographic differences between the congressional parties remain stark (Table 6). House Republicans are still overwhelmingly white, Christian, and male; 88 percent are all three, compared to only 38 percent of Democrats. A third of the House Democrats are women, and 39 percent are nonwhite. Ethnic differences in representation echo district patterns; the average House Republican elected in 2014 represents a district where three‐quarters of the population is white, while the average Democrat represents a district that is slightly more than half minority. Among senators, whites predominate in both parties. Although two Democratic women lost bids for reelection (Kay Hagen of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana) and two new Republican women were elected (Joni Ernst of Iowa and Shelley Moore Caputo of West Virginia), the Democratic caucus still includes a much larger proportion of women. As in the House, a majority of Senate Democrats are something other than white Christian men, whereas 84 percent of Republicans are all three. The cultural differences signified by these data arguably reinforce the more directly influential partisan and ideological divisions between the parties, raising additional obstacles to finding common ground.         "
"34","The 2014 election, then, did little to change the political dynamics that made the 113th Congress so contentious, unproductive, and unpopular. Republicans won control of both chambers, but by margins too small to shut down Senate filibusters or to override presidential vetoes without significant Democratic support, which is unlikely to be forthcoming considering the political makeup of the states and districts served by the remaining congressional Democrats. President Obama has two more years in office, armed with the veto to protect his legislative achievements—most particularly, the Affordable Care Act—and to block Republican initiatives he opposes. He also has the demonstrated capacity and will to use executive orders to pursue his own priorities. Immediately after the election, Obama signaled his willingness to fight by issuing an executive order protecting several million undocumented immigrants from deportation despite warnings by the Republican leaders of both chambers that this would “poison the well,” precluding cooperative legislative action on immigration and other issues.40 The action provoked predictably divergent partisan reactions in the public as well as in Congress.41 It also raised Obama's approval rating among Hispanics in a late November Gallup Poll to 68 percent, nearly 20 points higher than three weeks earlier (compare with Figure 3).42                     "
"35","The Republicans' response to the order underlined the challenge faced by Republican leaders in trying to manage coalitions that include a substantial contingent of Tea Party Republicans ready to take radical steps to stymie a president they detest both personally and politically. Burned by earlier experience, House Speaker John Boehner and soon‐to‐be Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell did not want to risk a government shutdown by using the budget to compel Obama to rescind the order, as some of their more zealous backbenchers had urged. Boehner instead provided an opportunity for his members to vent their anger with the president and cast a symbolic vote to overturn the order, just as they had in the previous two congresses with the more than 40 equally futile votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Such early signs suggest that politics in the 114th Congress will look very much like politics in the 113th. With few areas of potential agreement, little to lose from confronting Congress, and, based on his experience of the past six years, little reason to expect cooperation from Republicans on legislation not dictated by dire political necessity (such as the need to fund the government or raise the debt ceiling), Obama appears destined to remain the focus of polarized partisan warfare for the remainder of his presidency."
"36","Barring external shocks (by no means unimaginable), the most likely prospect is for stalemate and gridlock to prevail during 114th Congress, with all sides looking to 2016 for a way out. They may be disappointed. The Senate landscape for 2016 appears to favor the Democrats, with 24 of the 34 seats at stake defended by Republicans, including seven in states won by Obama in 2008 and 2012. But in only two of these states did Obama's major party vote share in 2012 exceed 53 percent, and none of the current incumbents looks particularly vulnerable as of this writing. To retake the Senate, Democrats would need plausible candidates, a strong showing by their presidential candidate and a repeat of the straight‐ticket party‐line voting observed in 2012."
"37","All of these things are possible, although none is guaranteed. Demography does favor the Democratic presidential candidate—likely to be Hillary Clinton, if the numerous polls taken in 2014 designating her as first choice for nominee of about two‐thirds of Democrats turn out to be prescient.43 Democrats enjoy disproportionate support from growing segments of the electorate: young people, singles (especially single women), social liberals, seculars, and ethnic minorities, including Latinos, the fastest‐growing category. The Republican coalition remains overwhelmingly white as well as older, married, religiously observant, and socially conservative, all shrinking segments of the electorate. Four years on, the coalition that reelected Obama should represent an even larger share of the electorate in 2016. However, as the 2014 election made very clear, that coalition is harder to mobilize, and its participation at the levels observed in 2008 and 2012 cannot be taken for granted. Moreover, presidential candidates attempting win a third consecutive term for their party have a poor track record in elections since 1948; only two of eight have succeeded.44 Thus, while national demographic trends favor a generic Democrat in 2016, a Democratic presidential victory is by no means a sure thing. Far closer to certainty is that national politics during the 114th Congress will bring another highly partisan and polarized electorate to the polls in 2016.         "
"38","Regardless of whether Democrats retake the Senate in 2016, if they retain the White House, another four years of divided government is virtually guaranteed. The Republicans' structural advantage gives them a lock on the House under all but the most extraordinary circumstances. It is difficult to imagine that Boehner and McConnell could allow their majorities to botch things so publicly and extravagantly that they provoke an election wave powerful enough to return the House to Democratic control in 2016. A more plausible, if still quite unlikely, scenario is for the Republicans to replay 1964 in 2016, nominating a presidential candidate so far to the right of the mainstream that the entire ticket gets swamped. The list of 20 or so prospective Republican nominees mentioned in the wake of the 2014 election includes several who fit this description, but none appears capable of withstanding the resources the party's establishment conservatives, eager to nominate a winner, would throw against any such candidate who seemed to be gaining traction. The best, if still remote, chance for the Democrats to retake the House would be to lose the presidential election in 2016 to a Republican who, heading a unified Republican government, then runs into so much trouble that his party is swept out of office in a midterm referendum comparable to, say, 2006.45 All of these outcomes remain improbable, so Republicans are likely to control the House for the remainder of the decade—and beyond if Democrats cannot erode the Republicans' structural advantage through redistricting after the 2020 census. The combination of Democrats' demographic advantage nationally and the Republican edge in House elections suggests that divided government will be the normal, if not invariable, state of affairs in the United States for the foreseeable future.
