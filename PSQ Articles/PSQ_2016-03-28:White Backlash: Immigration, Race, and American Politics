"1","For more than a decade, we have consistently heard that sweeping demographic changes will soon usher in an unbeatable Democratic majority. As Democratic‐leaning Latinos become an ever‐larger share of the American electorate, the GOP, which relies on votes from the aging and shrinking non‐Hispanic white population, is going to become uncompetitive in an increasing number of states. Yet this overwhelming Democratic advantage remains forever on the horizon. As I write this, Republicans control both chambers of Congress. A majority of states have Republican governors, and a majority of state legislatures have a Republican majority."
"2","Marisa Abrajano and Zoltan L. Hajnal provide an explanation for the GOP's surprising resilience. Many who argued that demographic trends favored the Democrats made a crucial mistake. They assumed that the white vote would remain closely divided while minorities swelled the ranks of the Democratic electoral coalition. This has not been the case. Whites have been moving steadily toward the GOP in recent elections. Mitt Romney won the largest share of the white vote since George H.W. Bush's 1988 landslide victory. Abrajano and Hajnal make a solid case that immigration is directly responsible for the white electorate's steady move to the right."
"3","White Backlash builds a compelling argument, using multiple methods and many sources of data, that the growing immigrant population is leading to high levels of white anxiety and altering whites' political preferences and behaviors. If group threat theory is correct, this is what we should expect. The surprise is the tremendous scale of the change. The authors show that living in a state with a large number of Latinos substantially increases the probability that a white person will identify as a conservative and as a Republican, actually vote Republican, and prefer more conservative policies—and not just conservative policies directly related to immigration.         "
"4","While Latinos and immigrants are not interchangeable categories, in this book, they are often treated as such. While this may seem an important error, the authors argue that in the eyes of many voters, most Latinos are immigrants (usually illegal immigrants) and most immigrants are Latinos. Further, the backlash against immigration is primarily driven by hostility toward Latinos—the authors show that whites have, on average, generally positive feelings toward Asians."
"5","While several studies have demonstrated that the local demographic context influences white attitudes, political or otherwise, White Backlash argues that the media also plays an important role. The authors found that, even in the generally liberal New York Times, a majority of stories regarding immigration were negative and that these negative stories correspond to aggregate shifts in partisanship.         "
"6","If Abrajano and Hajnal's findings are correct, they have important implications. First, they suggest that party identification is more flexible than many of us believed. Few scholars still argue that party identification is a fixed characteristic, unmoved by changing circumstances. However, the notion that a marginal change in state demographics can cause a significant shift in aggregate party identification and vote choice challenges many of our assumptions about political attitudes and behavior. Similarly, their findings indicate that many of us will need to rethink the importance of the media. While I have few complaints about their methodological choices, I will refrain from completely accepting their conclusions until I see additional studies that confirm their findings."
"7","Although White Backlash is not perfect, it deserves serious attention. It both defies much of our discipline's understanding of the electorate and raises important (and unsettling) questions about the future of racial polarization and American democracy.         "
