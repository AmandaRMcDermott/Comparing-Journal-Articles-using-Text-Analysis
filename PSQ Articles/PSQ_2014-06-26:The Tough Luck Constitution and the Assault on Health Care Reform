"1","The U.S. Constitution created rules about the distribution of powers within the national government. These rules proliferate opportunities to block legislation or its implementation. Except under the right rare circumstances, they inhibit the U.S. government from addressing major social evils—and one might say “tough luck” to the losers. Under recent circumstances, the rules make it difficult to conduct even routine business.         "
"2","Andrew Koppelman's book, however, is only tangentially about this type of “tough luck Constitution.” Koppelman focuses on how the Constitution was used in arguments about the powers of the national government to help those with the tough luck to be without health insurance. He analyses the arguments made for overturning the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in NFIB vs. Sebelius, the social theory from which those arguments were derived, and the reasoning used by Chief Justice John Roberts in his decision partly upholding and partly rejecting the legislation.         "
"3","Koppelman emphasizes the political opportunism that included Republican legislators reversing their previous positions about an individual mandate (p. 3). But he shows how arguments made in subsequent debate and litigation derived from principles of “tough luck libertarianism,” which says that preservation of liberty requires limits on government's power to redistribute income, even if preserving a small part of the income of some people leads to the death of others. He traces these ideas from the philosophy of Robert Nozick (pp. 9–12) through the philosophy and legal advocacy of Randy Barnett (pp. 80–90) and into the arguments made by the four Justices of the Supreme Court who voted to void the entire ACA."
"4","The book makes a strong case against the reasoning used to apply this worldview to the ACA litigation—ranging from the underlying problems with “originalism” (pp. 42–44) to the claim that the individual mandate involved regulating “inactivity,” or that to uphold the mandate would imply that the government could make people eat broccoli (pp. 96ff). He further shows flaws in the Chief Justice's reasoning about both the mandate and Medicaid aspects of the decision. In emphasizing constitutional interpretation, however, Koppelman undermines the book's title."
"5","What is the link between tough luck ideology and a “tough luck Constitution?” Some interpretations say, “tough luck,” and some do not. Perhaps “the fundamental original purpose of the Constitution is to permit the American people to seize control of their own fate” (p. 71). Yet, the view that the purpose was to preserve “rights” is hardly confined to political conservatives. Koppelman argues that federalism should not mean that the national government is disabled if states cannot address a problem, but the more‐fundamental question is what any government should do. He argues that the implications of the decision are dangerous, but also that simple measures would, logically, have overcome both the “inactivity” objection to the mandate (p. 77) and the “coercion” objection to the Medicaid expansion (p. 125). If so, then the Constitution is “tough luck” mainly because divided government prevents legislating the fixes. He asserts that “terrible arguments did carry the day, but the damage was relatively minimal” (p. 107), because the ACA is likely to be substantially implemented (pp. 137–143). Yet this raises two questions: whether there will really be no consequences in future decisions (which he suggests but does not show), and why a holding with few consequences is “tough luck.”"
"6","On balance, this book tries to do too much. The result is interesting, informative, but not entirely convincing."
