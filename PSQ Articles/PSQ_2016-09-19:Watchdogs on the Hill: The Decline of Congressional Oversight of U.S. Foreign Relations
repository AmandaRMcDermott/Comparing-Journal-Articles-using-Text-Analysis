"1","More than 200 years ago, James Madison proposed that ambition would check ambition in a system of checks and balances, in which no one branch of government would accumulate so much power as to dominate the other two. Linda L. Fowler, in Watchdogs on the Hill, appears to lament the lack of such ambition on the part of the legislative branch of our government. She presents evidence that the typical oversight activity (hearings) of two key Senate committees—Foreign Relations and Armed Services—has declined over time since the start of the Cold War. To say that this observation is disturbing is quite an understatement and somewhat alarming. It would, no doubt, be of some concern if these were committees on labor, education, or agriculture, but the committees Fowler is studying are two of the major national security oversight committees in the Senate. Certainly, in the capacity of either Commander in Chief of the armed forces or as the nation's chief diplomat, the president has a great deal of latitude in conducting the affairs of the state. Still, do we really want the president to use all of that latitude beyond both the public eye and the eyes of the legislature?         "
"2","Both Madison and John Stuart Mill advocated for the importance of the role of elected officials as educators of the public and expressed the importance of public discussion and debate for a healthy democracy. Fowler makes much the same point and uses the abdication of the legislature's responsibility to oversee and question the executive during the Iraq War as an example of an opportunity lost. To be sure, for part of the time period of her study (62 years in total), especially at the time of the Iraq War, the Senate experienced high levels of partisanship and polarization, and the majority at that time may have been less willing to conduct more vigorous oversight."
"3","Fowler also notes that in the later portion of her study, there was more turnover than usual, particularly during the post–September 11 era. More than a majority of the members of Congress, she states, were newcomers since the September 11 attacks. This is worthy of note she argues to demonstrate a junior class of legislators, perhaps lacking sufficient experience to challenge a president, especially a popular one conducting a war. This was a fear of both Madison and Alexander Hamilton, expressed in the Federalist Papers, as Fowler states, “Such superior knowledge and experience [of more senior members], they added, were especially important for conducting foreign affairs” (p. 181)."
"4","Watchdogs on the Hill is an important work and an important warning about a less publicized aspect of legislative dysfunction. Partisan polarization has brought Congress to a crawl, such that we now govern by the threat of filibuster and shutdown as opposed to cooperation and compromise. However, for Congress to abdicate its own ambition and to fail to conduct a more regularized and public oversight of the executive has grave consequences for the equilibrium brought about by what we think of as Madisonian principles of checks and balances. Those in our current political debate, who advocate for a unitary executive with much more far reaching power, especially in times of war or crisis, will win the debate easily if Congress does not even bother to show up.         "
"5","The one criticism I would make is the treatment of the methodology and results throughout the book. It may be simply a matter of choice, but I found the explanations and tables in the appendices far more understandable than the figures and explanations in the main text."
