"1","Public schools in the United States serve a critical democratic purpose, the creation of an informed and active citizenry. In her book No Citizen Left Behind, Meira Levinson, of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, argues that our schools, using evidence of significant disparities in civic knowledge and participation among different ethno‐racial groups, fail at this mission. In addressing this failure, Levinson makes a clear and compelling case for theoretically grounded yet practical reforms in civic education practices. She, in doing so, presents an ambitious agenda for how all students can receive an education that will prepare them for civic and political action.         "
"2","Levinson claims that educators must reconsider all school curricula, as well as how schools assess civic knowledge to create a civically empowering education. For example, because a child's race and social class effect their civic engagement, she puts forth the controversial claim of teaching a different version of U.S. history to different ethno‐racial groups with different civic experiences. While this argument might make some readers uncomfortable, Levinson anticipates potential criticisms of her approach by laying out a nuanced and compelling set of arguments."
"3","Levinson argues that civic educators can promote engagement by teaching civically empowering counternarratives, which include stories of marginalized peoples, such as those who took part in the civil rights movement, who have forced the United States to live up to its ideals of liberty, equality, and justice through civic action. Attempts by teachers to cultivate racial group consciousness and solidarity through such narratives may be challenged, however, by the fact that youth identity is fluid and contested. As the responses of Levinson's students show, educators must guard against essentializing students on the basis of their race."
"4","Aware that not all students will benefit from the same narrative of U.S. history, Levinson states that these narratives should be co‐constructed by teachers and students and informed by students' civic experiences. Therefore, students should not learn one single narrative of U.S. history. Levinson acknowledges that this type of civic engagement may be driven by self‐interest without the common civic memory that informs political engagement. However, this is an acceptable first step, since it “may be enough to help shrink the civic empowerment gap and set patterns of participation that will replicate themselves through future generations” (p. 127). She does not sufficiently explain how every citizen acting to maximize his or her own benefit will further the common good."
"5","Levinson also faces the challenge of defining good citizenship. Early in the book, she adopts a consensus view of what makes a good citizen, put forward in a report called The Civic Mission of Schools. This definition includes characteristics such as being tolerant and respectful of others, thinking critically about matters of public concern, and acting politically in a variety of ways. Excluded are several forms of critical resistance, such as an immigrant student who maintains transnational ties, or an African American student who views his academic success as a means of resisting stereotypes. These non‐traditional modes of civic action may serve to illuminate the ways in which youth exercise agency as a form of engagement.         "
"6","Levinson presents far‐reaching proposals and offers a sophisticated set of arguments for a civically empowering education in No Citizen Left Behind. Anyone concerned about the continued health of democracy and civic engagement in the United States should give her ideas serious consideration.         "
