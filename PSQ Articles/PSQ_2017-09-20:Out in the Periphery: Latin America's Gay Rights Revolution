"1","Latin American gays and lesbians have mobilized for the expansion of rights for half a century. The region's first organization, Argentina's Nuestro Mundo (Our World), was formed in 1967, two years prior to New York's Stonewall riots, the mythical birthplace of the gay rights movement in the United States. Yet political science attention to such mobilization was scant until very recently. Attention has increased significantly over the last decade, however, primarily as a result of the legalization of same‐sex marriage in several countries and the intense social and political debates it has sparked. The blindingly fast speed with which this phenomenon has unfolded, which Omar G. Encarnación very appropriately terms a “gay rights revolution,” has placed the region at the forefront of sexual rights globally. Indeed, seen as a veritable puzzle by casual observers, given widely held stereotypes about being a highly conservative region, same‐sex marriage today is a reality in countries in which more than 80 percent of Latin Americans live. The recent increase in scholarly attention has resulted in the publication of numerous journal articles and several book manuscripts, including Encarnación's excellent Out in the Periphery.         "
"2","The arguments presented in the book are not new: they have been previously advanced in several journal articles. Nevertheless, bringing together the ideas he has distilled over the last several years, Encarnación provides the reader with a very useful framework to explain the region's “gay rights revolution,” one that relies on international relations and comparative politics. His main argument is that explanations for the significant expansion of sexual rights in the region need the “decentering” of gay politics in Latin America. The author argues that while international influence in the spread of gay rights, through mechanisms such as policy diffusion, is undeniable, national contexts must be taken into account to understand policy change because they have mediated the scope and speed with which gay rights ideas have arrived in the region."
"3","In the book's first part, the author's focus is on the domestic factors that have made Latin America receptive a receptive environment to these ideas, such as increased “modernization,” the judicialization of politics, and the region's turn to the left at the beginning of the century. However, adding to the growing literature that underlines the importance of agency in gay rights expansion, the author highlights the key role activists have played in the process by crafting campaigns that are clearly grounded in local environments."
"4","In the second and third parts of the book, Encarnación presents analyses of two cases, Argentina and Brazil, and sets out to solve two apparent puzzles: why is Argentina, a country that, he argues, has been predominantly Catholic and has celebrated machismo, one of the region's leaders in gay rights expansion? And why has Brazil, historically known for its sexual freedom, lagged? Both explanations are found in a combination of variables, among which are the absence of a confessional party and smart advocacy in Argentina and the increased political influence of evangelical Christians in a fragmented party system with dysfunctional parliamentary rules."
"5","Out in the Periphery is a beautifully written book that makes a substantial contribution to the growing literature on gay rights in Latin America and in the world. By advancing a nuanced and carefully developed analysis, it will become essential reading for anyone who is interested in understanding one of the most fascinating revolutions in the region, thereby dispelling commonly held myths.
