"1","Amid shifts in the racial composition of the U.S. electorate, political scientists have devoted more attention to the prospects for interminority political coalitions. Vanessa C. Tyson's Twists of Fate highlights the conditions under which representatives of marginalized groups in the U.S. House of Representatives can influence the policymaking process. Tyson observes that members are often marginalized based on the racial and economic characteristics of their districts. Racial and class biases motivate microaggressive behaviors toward legislators from or representing marginalized groups and restricts their access to the resources and party status necessary to pursue their constituents’ substantive interests. Given these limitations, they increasingly rely upon multiracial alliances.         "
"2","One compelling topic raised in the book concerns the potential for minority representation to move beyond majority‐minority districts. Recent efforts in the state of Georgia to reduce the concentration of minorities in majority‐minority districts were intended to increase the number of competitive or influence districts. Relying upon a quantitative analysis of House members’ votes on civil rights legislation, Tyson discovers little evidence that a heightened minority presence in influence districts translates into greater substantive representation of minority interests. While the proportion of minority residents predicts support for civil rights legislation among representatives of majority‐minority districts, it does not do the same within influence districts. This evidence suggests high concentrations of minority voters are necessary in order for their representatives—both Democratic and Republican—to prioritize their substantive interests."
"3","Lastly, Tyson explores the conditions under which racial and ethnic minorities experience greater influence within the House of Representatives. Relying upon surveys and personal interviews, Tyson discovers that House members who are from or represent marginalized groups increasingly depend on cross‐racial alliances to exercise their political influence. These coalitions are rooted in members’ perceived linked fate with other minority groups, which stems from similar experiences of marginalization. Ultimately, Tyson concludes that these political alliances have aided representatives of marginalized groups to more effectively advocate on behalf of their constituents."
"4","Twists of Fate effectively illustrates the conditions under which members who are from or represent marginalized groups may gain political influence within the U.S House of Representatives; however, there were some weak points. For one, Tyson offers an informative but superfluous chapter on the history of voting discrimination in the United States (Chapter 3). Rather than review material frequently mined by previous works, greater attention could have been paid to topics mentioned elsewhere in the book. For instance, the discussion would have benefited from a more extensive analysis of legislators’ support for minority interests. While important, support for civil rights legislation is by no means the sole or necessarily most revealing indicator of interest. Moreover, additional case studies would have been helpful for illuminating some of the author's arguments. Tyson mentions the political conditions under which representatives of marginalized groups were more likely to enjoy greater influence (p. 47). However, the conditions are mentioned but are not elaborated.         "
"5","Despite these shortcomings, Twists of Fate offers a unique examination of minority coalition building at the elite level. Ultimately, the work reveals that the racial biases present in the mass public are often mimicked within elite institutions. In the face of such bias and with increasing minority representation, representatives of marginalized groups are increasingly relying upon multiracial political alliances to maximize their influence. It is unclear whether these alliances will hold as racial and ethnic demographics in the United States continue to shift.         "
