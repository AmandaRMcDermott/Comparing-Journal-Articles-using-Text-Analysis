"1","PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE THREATS to international security must include transboundary clashes over access to freshwater. Worries flow from the fact that water is the most vital element of life and civilization, one with no substitutes, and that fixed supply faces continuously increasing demand. By 2025, according to projections from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with “absolute” water scarcity, while two‐thirds of the world's population will experience “water stress” conditions. The situation could worsen thereafter.1 A 2012 U.S. intelligence assessment warned that water problems “will likely increase the risk of instability and state failure, exacerbate regional tensions, and distract countries from working with the United States on important policy objectives.”2 Another report worried that “water may become a more significant source of contention than energy or minerals out to 2030 at both the intrastate and interstate levels.”3"
"2","Attempts have been made to clarify the link between water scarcity and interstate conflict,4 with some seeing a significant potential for confrontations.5 Various quantitative studies have found a link between freshwater scarcity and conflict.6 Thomas Homer‐Dixon suggests that although shortages of nonrenewable resources infrequently produce conflict, surface water may be the exception.7 For others, transboundary water disputes are rare and typically resolved peacefully. Exceptional conflicts are of relatively low intensity,8 while scarcity reflects remediable failures of foresight and ingenuity.9 The problem with relying on past regularities is that trends that once displayed a linear logic may exhibit discontinuities in coming years, and demand–supply gaps that, short of a certain threshold, allow for interstate cooperation may no longer do so beyond that limit.         "
"3","Global population, estimated to grow from the current 7 billion to 9.6 billion by the middle of the twenty‐first century,10 may boost world water demand more than proportionately to the rate of population increase. Regions with high birth rates coincide with poorer regions, where water demand expands rapidly with added population. This is compounded by a high rate of urbanization in poorer societies,11 where water consumption is highest for urban dwellers.         "
"4","On the supply side, climate change may produce regionally decreased precipitation alongside elevated irrigation needs stemming from higher temperatures and increased rates of evapotranspiration.12 Countries that are dependent on surface water (as opposed to groundwater) could suffer disproportionally.13 Major river systems in Asia and the Indian subcontinent are fed by snowpack and glaciers from high mountains. With accelerated glacial melt, riverine ecosystems will be undermined, while short‐term flooding could result, converting to extreme water deficits once the glaciers disappear altogether.14 Even with stable precipitation, “a modest rise in temperature of about 2 to 4 degrees in mountainous regions can dramatically alter the precipitation mix by increasing the share falling as rain while decreasing the share falling as snow. This causes more flooding during the rainy season, shrinking snow/ice mass, and less snowmelt during the dry season.”15 At the same time, progressive depletion of the Earth's aquifers16 means that shrinking supplies of groundwater compound the problem of declining availability of surface water.         "
"5","If nonlinear effects of climate change drive water scarcity much beyond historical norms, bargaining among co‐riparians might leave less room for compromises.17 Downstream states may oppose upstream diversion and damming projects more forcefully. In a classical prisoner's dilemma situation, fears of unfair advantages accruing to the other side could lead states to renege on treaty obligations.18 Previously, imprecise treaty provisions allowed for some latitude in interpreting respective obligations, but disagreements papered over with imprecise language are less reconcilable with growing scarcity.         "
"6","Although the very useful Basins at Risk project revealed that conflicts over water are infrequent, that conclusion covers a wide range of water‐related issues, including navigation, flood control, and water quality.19 With growing scarcity, relative allocations of available water become the dominant issue. As Table 1 (based on data provided by the Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database) shows, issues involving quantitative water shares are most likely to produce conflict.20 Because infrastructural projects (usually dams) create added conflict potential, optimism takes a further battering.         "
"7","Supply–demand gaps need not portend disputes as long as they can be tackled domestically—for example, by finding additional water sources or by reducing wastage. Where gaps can be addressed only by actions affecting other countries, three outcomes are possible. The first is cooperative agreement on allocations, the second is an attempt to improve water access at the expense of co‐riparian(s), and the third is an unresolved situation in which conflict is avoided while cooperation seems unattainable—a situation of unstable stasis."
"8","A conceptual and theoretical framework within which to analyze potential water conflicts rests on a set of simple and intuitively plausible assumptions. The first is that a necessary condition for conflict is a demand–supply gap for the natural resource in question—an assumption developed early on by such theorists as Nazli Choucri and Robert North.21 The second assumption is that the likelihood of conflict increases the more essential the resource is and the fewer the existing substitutes are. The third assumption is that this likelihood is inversely proportionate to the presence of cooperative avenues to resolving resource‐based conflicts of interest.         "
"9","Because the supply of water is pretty much fixed, our focus must be on the demand side of the issue, and this involves a number of related considerations. The demand for water is determined largely by demographic and economic conditions: population growth and pace of urbanization in the first instance, the developing needs of industry and agriculture in the second. Further, demand depends in part on domestic efforts to manage consumption, either by reducing waste or by improving distribution. Where supply and demand cannot be brought into balance domestically, the ability to find internationally cooperative solutions to demand–supply problems ultimately determines the likelihood of conflict. With these assumptions and considerations in mind, a useful way of organizing further discussion is to focus, separately at first, on the domestic and international contexts."
"10","As population grows and the nature of economic activity changes, domestic measures such as conservation by city dwellers and transition to less water‐intensive crops and drip irrigation can help control the demand–supply gap. Hydraulic engineering (for example, via canals and water storage facilities) and desalination can, in some cases, boost supply. These tasks assume the ability of political authorities to identify and implement appropriate policies, an ability that is associated with good governance, the foundations of which include the state's institutional capacity, legitimacy and stability, and observance of the rule of law. While governance may narrow the gap between supply and demand, economic and demographic growth in the face of nonexpanding sources of freshwater can make the gap hard to bridge, no matter what measures government may undertake, especially if the water source must be shared with other countries. When that is the case, competing needs may discourage cooperative solutions to allocation problems, and outcomes depend substantially on international circumstances."
"11","Scholarship suggests that three features of the international context matter most to the outcomes of relative water scarcity: first, the overall tenor of relations among riparians; second, the existence or absence of an institutional context for water management; and third, the balance of power between them."
"12","Historically amicable relations make compromises more palatable and increase each side's confidence that the other will abide by its commitments. As has been pointed out, “Countries that cooperate in general also cooperated over water, and countries with overall unfriendly relations also are unfriendly over water issues.”22 In the presence of general discord, the outlook for water cooperation, or even stasis, dims.               "
"13","It would seem that resource rivalries are most conflict prone when either side expects it can get its way by force. Classical realists often argued that power parity between states discourages conflict23; others disagree.24 The water conflict literature has no settled views on the subject. While one study focused on the Middle East concludes that symmetric power encourages water cooperation,25 another study maintains that when a downstream country “fears that its upstream neighbor(s) will use water as a means of harmful leverage” and “also believes it has the military power to rectify the situation,” conflict is more likely.26 We believe that both large power disparities and near equality infrequently produce conflict. Moreover, power transition theory27 suggests that conflict is likely when the lagging party's capabilities are improving while it is unhappy with the status quo—as, for example, when it is deprived of fair access to shared resources. This we regard as the situation that makes freshwater conflicts especially probable.               "
"14","Institutions often deal with distributional issues,28 structuring joint decision making, stabilizing mutual expectations, and providing each party with information about others’ capabilities and intentions. For neoliberals, institutions help reduce uncertainty and transaction costs between states,29 whereas realists maintain that they simply reflect the realities of power relations.30 Examples of transboundary water cooperation facilitated by effective institutional settings are the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination of Central Asia (for the Amu Darya River), the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, and the Mekong River Commission. Upstream China opted out of the 1995 Mekong River Agreement that gave rise to the Mekong River Commission, but its engagement and cooperation with the four lower basin countries (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia) that are members of the organization has expanded in recent years, especially in the provision and exchange of hydrological data.31 It appears that “international resource conflict is most likely to occur where there exist both resource scarcity and insufficient institutional capacity to deal with that scarcity.”32"
"15","The impact of institutions cannot be considered in isolation of power balances, as an institution's structures generally reflect the relative power of its members33; when the balance changes, the once‐disadvantaged party may challenge that situation, by force if necessary.               "
"16","These, then, are the conditions that determine whether water rivalries encourage conflict, cooperation, or an uncomfortable stasis when domestic solutions to the demand–supply gap cannot be found. Because the starting point is relative scarcity, we begin by asking which nations stand to experience scarcity regarding shared water resources. Having established a theoretical framework within which to cast our analysis, we turn to the task of selecting the cases to be examined."
"17","Freshwater scarcity can be conceived in several ways.34 The “water stress index” defines scarcity in terms of a country's renewable annual freshwater per capita. While it is easy to calculate, it ignores differences in rates of water use. A better measure is the “criticality ratio,” which focuses directly on the proportion of annual water withdrawal relative to total (surface and groundwater) renewable water supply. This index is used by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in its report titled “Global Water Security,”35 which provides a map depicting countries’ levels of water scarcity. High water vulnerability is defined by a withdrawal ratio between 40 percent and 80 percent; extremely high vulnerability exists when the ratio exceeds 80 percent. Countries that fall into either of these two categories (high or medium criticality) are listed in Column B of Table 2. Because existing water insecurities have, so far, produced few conflicts, scarcity may have to increase further for this to occur. Our next step is to determine where water insecurities stand to worsen for countries that already face acute shortages. The ODNI report provides (in the form of a color‐coded map) estimates of relative scarcity to 2025. Changing scarcity is calculated as the ratio of projected water scarcity to present scarcity over the intervening period. The two most portentous categories are defined as “extremely” and “exceptionally” (Ext and Exc) more stressed; the countries affected are listed in Column C. To be included in our case selection, a state must show up in Column B and Column C. The affected countries are denoted with an X in Column D.         "
"18","Conflict potential normally assumes that nations share the freshwater source. Although both groundwater (that is, aquifers) and surface water (mainly rivers) furnish water, we focus on the latter, as groundwater accounts for just 30 percent of global reserves36 and, unlike rivers, has not been a source of much international contention or regulation. Finally, because dependence on shared rivers must be substantial, we only include countries for which the proportion of domestic consumption accounted for by shared rivers (the dependency ratio) is at least 25 percent, as computed by the FAO's AQUASTAT database. This ratio is shown in Column E. Column F reveals which nations the selected countries share rivers with.         "
"19","All conditions in Columns A–E are met by 11 countries (shown in bold in Column A), encompassing five major river basins. Two of these countries are not included in our final case selection, as surface water is not a major source of freshwater. Bahrain, while indicated in bold, is an archipelago of small islands in the southern Persian Gulf, with no rivers or lakes. Botswana, whose rivers run dry much of the year, relies on groundwater for two‐thirds of its water consumption.37 The main perennial river shared with another country—Namibia—becomes a swamp soon after entering Botswana. Other river basins (for example, the Mekong) may join the list in the future; at present, we have seven potentially conflictive country‐dyads extending across five river basins (Table 3).         "
"20","The Nile River, which is especially critical to Egypt and Sudan, forms at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile Rivers; it flows through 10 countries. Some 80 percent of Egypt's agricultural sector depends on irrigation from the Nile. Population grows at an annual rate of 1.8 percent,38 while rapid urbanization, and economic growth places further claims on scarce water. Coastal erosion and rising sea levels are expanding saltwater intrusion into the delta, a freshwater loss that is exacerbated by increased evaporation accompanying climbing temperatures.39"
"21","The Nile provides 77 percent of Sudan's water,40 increased demand for which will accompany expanding population, which is expected to reach 55 million (currently 35 million) by 2030.41 The urbanization rate is 2.54 percent.42 Agriculture accounts for 97 percent of the country's water use.43 Intensive agricultural techniques imply increased need for water‐intensive land reclamation.            "
"22","The Banias and Dan Rivers meet in Israel to become the Upper Jordan, discharging into the Sea of Galilee and emerging at its southern tip as the Lower Jordan. The Yarmouk is its largest tributary. The Jordan River is one of the most endangered river basins in the world, as the cumulative withdrawals of Syria, Jordan, and Israel have robbed the river of 95 percent of its historical flows over the last 50 years, while unregulated dumping of industrial effluents, raw sewage, and fishpond waste impair water quality.44"
"23","Water‐poor Jordan has little agricultural activity, relying principally on the service sector, which accounts for 67 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).45 Additional water demand comes from a burgeoning population and urbanization, with Amman alone growing by 86 percent between 1990 and 2008.46 The presence of 1.5 million Syrian refugees has exacerbated the strains on scarce water supplies from an earlier influx of Iraqis fleeing sectarian strife.47"
"24","Syria's population is rapidly growing, and the civil war will have an uncertain impact on the demand–supply balance. The exodus of conflict refugees has partially shifted the burden of water stress to neighboring countries, especially Jordan. Neglect and targeted destruction of water supply networks and infrastructure in areas of heavy fighting have diminished water consumption in Syria, especially in the agricultural sector.48 Israel's is a fast‐growing economy. Water demand, fueled by economic growth and an expanding population (currently growing at approximately 3 percent) could double by 2030.49"
"25","Rising in Turkey, the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq, where it joins the Tigris to form the Shatt al‐Arab waterway. The Tigris traverses the same countries, but little of it (0.2 percent) is in Syrian territory."
"26","Droughts in Iraq and Syria, including an especially devastating one in 2006 and 2007 that contributed to the catastrophic depletion of 144 cubic kilometers of freshwater within the basin,50 have underscored water vulnerability, as have Turkey's upstream water withdrawals through its Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP), an integrated hydrodevelopment scheme. Iraq's water demand follows population growth (2.3 percent), urbanization (3.1 percent), and a healthy GDP per capita growth rate,51 but GAP could reduce water flow to the country by as much as 80 percent.52 High salinity in the Shatt al‐Arab has led to widespread failure of even salt‐resistant crops, as Turkey's water diversions have sequestered water needed to purge the salt.            "
"27","A substantial portion of India's population, expected to surpass China's by 2050, currently lives in water‐stressed areas.53 According to a recent study,54 80 percent of India's population (comprising 1 billion people) faces severe water scarcity for at least one month every year. Goldman Sachs anticipates 7 percent economic growth rates in coming years.55 New demands are being placed on agricultural production, while land lost to urbanization and desertification requires expanded irrigation of remaining cultivable land. Water consumption is expected to grow to 1.5 trillion cubic meters by 2030, against a current supply of 740 billion cubic meters.            "
"28","According to the Asian Development Bank, Pakistan is one of the most water‐stressed countries worldwide, possessing only 30 days of stored water.56 Pakistan's per capita water availability of less than 1,500 cubic meters will probably drop below 1,000 cubic meters by 2035.57 Population growth is 3.1 percent, and nearly half the people will live in cities by 2025.58 Agriculture, centering on water‐intensive cotton production, absorbs 90 percent of water.59 Melting Himalayan glaciers have produced regular flash floods since 2010,60threatening long‐term water flow.            "
"29","The most important of the rivers shared by India and Bangladesh are the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, which flows from Tibet through India to merge with the Ganges in Bangladesh. Water demand is escalating in the entire region, whose main rivers originate in melting Himalayan glaciers."
"30","In Bangladesh, massive pollution limits the value of the Ganges for human consumption and irrigation. Annual growth rates of 1.5 percent will expand the population to 180 million people by 2030.61 Land is being steadily lost to urbanization and desertification.62"
"31","All of the foregoing countries face current water scarcity and a further deteriorating balance between freshwater demand and supply. The question is whether solutions to the problem can be found domestically, and if not, what international consequences are probable."
"32","The quality of governance in these nations holds little promise that water shortages will be resolved domestically. The World Bank's six governance indicators (Table 4)63 describe the situation. Except for Israel and Jordan, all of our cases are in the bottom quartile (in five cases, the bottom 10 percent) of the world's nations with regard to political stability; only two are in the upper half for government effectiveness or control of corruption. The average percentile rank on quality of governance places just two countries in the upper half of the distribution. In each case, the two favored nations are Israel and Jordan. Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and Sudan scrape the bottom of the distribution; India, Egypt, and Bangladesh fare badly, although not as catastrophically as those four countries.         "
"33","Israel enjoys an established democracy, efficient bureaucracy, and the best‐performing water sector in the region. Latent problems include a gulf between the orthodox and moderate segments of its population and the festering dissatisfaction of the Arab minority (some 20 percent of the population), as seen, for example, in October 2000, when widespread demonstrations broke out in Arab townships in solidarity with West Bank Palestinians. Israel has instituted state‐of‐the‐art drip irrigation, “rain harvesting,” and programs to reuse wastewater in agriculture."
"34","Since the 1960s, Mekorot, Israel's national water company, has operated desalination facilities in southern Israel.64 Larger desalination plants, incorporating reverse osmosis technology, include the 127 million cubic meter plant near Hadera, which has doubled Israel's desalination capacity. Desalination currently accounts for 50 percent of Israel's drinking water, a figure that is projected to increase to 70 percent by 2020,65 aided by increased reliance on natural gas to power the desalination plants, which has slashed production costs.66 Demand management includes hikes on urban water rates and distribution of water‐saving devices to households.67"
"35","Although the situation is less favorable in Jordan, it is better than elsewhere in the region. Occasional challenges to the monarchy have involved limited violence, and its record of political liberalization is respectable, albeit uneven.68 To quell Palestinian dissatisfaction, the regime is trying to link economic development and social conditions by improving the agricultural productivity of the Jordan River Valley, where many Palestinians have settled.         "
"36","On indicators most pertinent to water management, such as government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and even control of corruption, Jordan performs reasonably well. The government has urged farmers to switch from surface irrigation methods—with their high rates of evaporation—to sprinkler and localized irrigation methods."
"37","Things look grimmer for the four countries with the lowest governance scores. In Syria, poor water management has been a cause and an effect of the violence. The epicenter of the initially peaceful uprising against the regime was the southwestern city of Deraa, an area that witnessed massive crop failures and displacement of tens of thousands of farmers. Deraa became a gathering point for families forced to relocate from neighboring agricultural villages, and the government's feeble response to this crisis angered the drought‐stricken population.69 In Syria, conservation incentives are virtually nonexistent, surface irrigation prevails, and irrigation field efficiency is below 60 percent.70 Costs of irrigation and drainage networks are levied without reference to rates of water consumption.71 Little desalinated water is produced. Descent into quasi‐anarchy has further undermined water management prospects.         "
"38","Iraq's situation is equally worrisome: irrigation infrastructure has been damaged by chronic warfare and political instability, while water use efficiency at the farm level is poor.72 Corruption is rampant and sectarian hatreds endemic. Sunni militancy's threat has escalated with the takeover of swathes of Iraqi territory by the extremist Islamic State ISIS. Widening fissures between Sunni and Shia undermine prospects for a national consensus behind water management. ISIS has demonstrated a willingness to employ water resources and supply infrastructure as tools of warfare, as, for example, in early 2014, when it tampered with the flow of Fallujah Dam, depriving the Shia holy cities of Karbala and Najaf of water supplies while flooding the town of Abu Ghraib near Baghdad to repel an offensive by Iraqi security forces.73"
"39","In Sudan, “democratic and accountable governance suffers from marginalization of the peripheries, inequitable allocation of resources to states, weak institutional capacity, high levels of military expenditure, corruption, and a lack of accountability to its citizens.”74 It ranks as one of the world's most corrupt countries. Proposals for integrated water management have produced few practical measures on the side of either supply or demand.75"
"40","Pakistan, too, fares badly. Assaults from the Pakistani Taliban, extensive corruption, and pressures from Islamist militants undermine governance. Treated wastewater and desalination make up a small fraction of total water withdrawals. Pakistan's water woes include unsustainable groundwater pumping,76 massive discharge of sewage and industrial waste into freshwater bodies such as the Kabul River, and the loss of as much as one‐half of the water in irrigation networks from seepage and evaporation.77"
"41","Progress on conservation and demand management is sluggish, partly because of artificially low water charges that encourage wasteful water use.78 A few wealthy, politically connected large landowners have monopolized land and water resources, frustrating decades of land reform policies.79 Endemic corruption allows rent‐seeking interests to flourish at the expense of poor Pakistanis, as witnessed in the case of Karachi's “tanker mafia,” which appropriates water from illegal hydrants or poorer districts in the city and then sells the water back to inhabitants at exorbitant prices.80"
"42","India and Bangladesh are near the middle of the governance scale, with Bangladesh lagging behind India, where leadership transitions are generally peaceful and general governance indications appear respectable, despite occasional spasms of violence stemming from Hindu–Muslim (and less frequently Hindu–Sikh) animosities. Still, water management may not be benefiting much: desalination is almost nonexistent, while rates of groundwater exploitation exceed the safe yield of reserves.81 Although sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation have somewhat expanded, water‐intensive surface irrigation techniques remain widely practiced. Water tariff rates are too low to discourage wasteful water use or finance the upkeep of irrigation systems.82"
"43","In Bangladesh, periods of democracy have alternated with stretches of military rule, violence, bouts of Islamic militancy, strikes, and political assassinations. Islamic unrest in 2013 melded with worker protests against the government's failure to provide safe working conditions,83 nearly derailing the 2014 general elections. The country's two major political parties—the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party—routinely engage in dysfunctional quarrels. The strategy of supplementing surface water with groundwater reserves is unsustainable because groundwater reserves in some regions have been mined to the point of virtual depletion, while arsenic contamination is rampant.84 Groundwater overconsumption has also contributed to land subsidence and desertification; 25 percent of Bangladeshi land could either disappear or become uninhabitable by 2100.85"
"44","In Egypt, the post‐2011 political turmoil, the ouster of the Mohamed Morsi government, military repression, and growing societal polarization make it uncertain that a regime capable of ensuring the country's water future will emerge. Should political stability be achieved, enduring governance problems would have to be overcome, including bureaucratic unresponsiveness, lack of budgetary transparency, and overall corruption.86 In the past, conservation benefited from irrigation projects outside the Nile basin, increased crop intensities, and drought‐resistant and salt‐tolerant crops.87 But water tariffs needed to spur efficient water use have not been levied,88 while domestic turmoil and deflection of government resources to domestic security make it uncertain that measures undertaken before 2011 will continue to be energetically supported.         "
"45","Sudan's water management efforts have been modest. Only Port Sudan has adopted desalination. Groundwater abstraction is impeded by high pumping costs, limited recharge, and the lack of available infrastructural facilities near regions where aquifers are centered.89 The more accessible aquifers, such as the Gash and Nyala basins, have been dangerously overexploited.90"
"46","The reality is that few of the countries examined here are likely to take effective steps toward domestic water management. Accordingly, the gaze shifts to the international consequences of growing water scarcity, with a focus on three central international circumstances."
"47","The 1929 Nile Water Agreement giving Egypt a near monopoly on the river's waters was replaced in 1959 by the Nile Waters Treaty, which allocated approximately three‐quarters of the flow to Egypt and one‐quarter to Sudan. Upstream riparians were not consulted. Thus, the context was set for future tensions between Egypt and Sudan over respective water allocations (and also between these two countries and the upstream nations whose rights were not considered)."
"48","Relations between Egypt and Sudan have followed a zigzag course, often deteriorating during periods of regime change in either country. Occasional spats involve the Shalateen Triangle and Halayib, a Red Sea town on the Egyptian side of the border that both countries claim. In 1995, President Hosni Mubarak was the target of an assassination attempt while visiting Addis Ababa; he suspected that Sudan harbored the fugitives. Sudan has shared Egypt's interest in preserving privileges conferred by the Nile Water Treaty, but growing water demand, coupled with prolonged political instability in Egypt following the 2011 Arab Spring, and regional power shifts91 have diminished Egypt's value as an ally and altered its calculations.               "
"49","Ethiopia (not currently water stressed), whose Blue Nile contributes about 80 percent of the flow of the Nile proper, has undertaken to build its Grand Renaissance Dam across that river to meet electricity needs and provide power sales abroad. Egypt worries that this project will reduce its own share of water (which it reportedly desires to increase to 95 percent of the Nile flows,92 a demand that is surely a nonstarter), especially during the reservoir‐filling period, and complains that it violates existing agreements. The question is whether Egypt and Sudan will be drawn closer together by the Ethiopian challenge or whether Sudan will cast its lot with the challengers in an attempt to improve its water share at Egypt's expense.               "
"50","On one hand, Sudan joined Egypt in opposing the 2010 Cooperative Framework Agreement (Entebbe Agreement), a pact signed by six upstream countries that aims to redistribute Nile allocations in their favor and permits the construction of water storage infrastructure without consulting the downstream states.93 However, recent developments suggest that Sudan may be pivoting toward Ethiopia and the upstream states. For instance, Sudan broke ranks with Egypt when it unilaterally resumed its participation in the Nile Basin Initiative, which both states had shunned following the Entebbe Agreement's ratification.94 Hedging its bets, Egypt concluded an agreement with South Sudan in 2014 to revive the construction of a canal bypassing the Sudd Swamp in order to increase the flow of the White Nile (to which South Sudan contributes the greatest share).95"
"51","Upstream countries have promoted the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework as an alternative to the Nile Water Treaty. The framework states that a country's access to Nile water should reflect “[t]he contribution of each Basin state to the waters of the Nile River system” and “[t]he population dependent on the water resources in each Basin state.” This would favor Ethiopia, which contributes more than 80 percent of the Nile's waters and has a population of 94 million, at Egypt's (and Sudan's) expense.96"
"52","Should Sudan's water interests result in a decisive realignment of Nile riparians against the 1959 treaty, its relations with Egypt could break down. Khartoum supports the Grand Renaissance Dam, from which it hopes to acquire electricity imports and possible irrigation.97"
"53","A March 2015 general framework agreement (“declaration of principles”) concluded between Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia pledged to prioritize Egypt and Sudan in electricity purchases from Ethiopia, limit the reservoir‐filling period and the dam's storage capacity, provide compensation for damages, and commission an international firm to investigate the dam's downstream impact.98,99 A subsequent dispute concerning the modalities of the proposed impact study prompted further negotiations and the signing of a new agreement in December 2015.100 However, Ethiopia's reservations concerning Egypt's proposal to increase the number of outlets at the dam to permit greater downstream water flow provokes doubt that all outstanding issues have been resolved.101"
"54","Sudan's inferior military position (Table 5) could discourage it from challenging Egypt by force, but because Egypt is the Nile's final downstream nation, military power is partially offset by its hydrological vulnerability, while domestic political problems may reduce Cairo's ability to devote its coercive power to foreign threats. Sudan could estimate that this is a good time to question Egypt's claims on the Nile.               "
"55","In 1953, Israel began constructing its National Water Carrier, a vast hydrological engineering system completed in 1964, which extracts water from the Sea of Galilee, directing it out of Jordan for consumption in Israel at the expense of other countries’ water supplies. As the carrier neared completion, Syria undertook to construct a canal from the Banias to the Yarmouk to divert water from the former before it reached the Sea of Galilee in Israel. Lebanon also started work on a canal to divert waters from the Hasbani to the Banias. Israel responded with artillery and airstrikes in 1965 and 1966, ultimately seizing the entire Jordan River headwaters in the 1967 war. Later, it blew up Jordan's East Ghor Canal, its main irrigation artery for the east bank of the Jordan River, claiming that it was diverting excessive water."
"56","The Golan Heights is perched over the Banias, part of the Jordan headwaters, enabling Israel to prevent Syria and Jordan from diverting these headwaters. For Syria, the Golan's return is a precondition for improved relations with Israel. Other issues inflame Israeli–Syrian relations, including Syria's alliance with Iran and support for Hezbollah. Syria and Jordan's relations suffered from the latter's 1994 peace with Israel and from the fault line pitting the Syrian–Iranian Shia/Alawite front against Sunni‐dominated Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. Nevertheless, the two agreed in 1987 to jointly construct the Maqarin Dam along the Jordan–Syria border, to impound the winter floodwaters of the Yarmouk for use during the long dry season, and to harness the river's hydroelectric potential. Despite the 1994 peace treaty, Jordan's position as a state with a regime sitting atop a tenuously loyal Palestinian majority limits its possible cooperation with Israel."
"57","Jordan and Syria have clashed over Syria's construction of storage dams and wells on the upper reaches of the Yarmouk (a Jordan tributary), reducing its flow by approximately 30 percent.102 One attempt at cooperation was the Maqarin Dam agreement, giving Jordan 75 percent of the impounded floodwaters, while Syria would receive the hydropower generated by the dam.103 However, Syria's unilateral water diversions at the Yarmouk's headwaters may not leave enough water to fill the dam's reservoir, while Jordan has seen its share of water drop to approximately 10 percent of the total flow of both rivers.               "
"58","No institutional water cooperation exists between Israel and Syria, except for very patchy adherence to the unratified Johnston Plan, granting 52 percent of the basin's waters to Israel, 36 percent to Jordan, 9 percent to Syria, and 3 percent to Lebanon.104 Water‐related cooperation between Jordan and Israel is governed by the 1994 Peace Treaty and accompanying Water Annex, providing for water transfers affording each country sufficient water access during periods of peak demand.105 The treaty commits Israel to providing Jordan with 50 million cubic meters of water per year and specifies mechanisms for cooperative management and joint development of shared water resources.106Israel would help Jordan with its desalination technology.               "
"59","Israel's enforcement of severe restrictions on groundwater use in the West Bank, which it captured in the 1967 war and has occupied since, has made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to drill new agricultural wells or repair existing ones.107 Palestinian water consumption in the West Bank hovers between 20 and 30 cubic meters a year, one of the lowest figures in the world.108 In contrast, Jewish‐only settlements there consume four times more water per capita as Palestinian communities and need not obtain permits for well construction or rehabilitation.109 Israel and the Palestinian National Authority have formally cooperated on water resources since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, although without producing more equitable water allocations. A final determination of Palestinian water rights was reserved for final status negotiations,110 which have yet to materialize because of repeated cycles of violence. Palestinians have no recognized rights to the Jordan River.               "
"60","Repeated victories over Arab nations have created a presumption of Israel's regional invincibility, a presumption that is supported by traditional military indicators (see Table 6). At the same time, Syria may be able to enlist Hezbollah's help in a conflict, while the victory of the Bashar al‐Assad regime in the Syrian civil war, albeit not in the offing, could reinforce the regional Shia coalition, reconfiguring the local power balance, especially if Iran manages to acquire nuclear weapons. The ever‐shifting battlefield dynamics in the Syrian civil war defy reliable predictions of which forces, if any, will prevail. However, the recent boost that the Assad regime received from Russia's military intervention on its behalf is bound to enhance its staying power and fortify the Syria–Hezbollah–Iran alliance in the short to medium term.               "
"61","The Syrian and Iraqi Baathist regimes competed for leadership of the Arab world. Syria sided with Iran in its war against Iraq and joined the coalition to oust Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. The fissures were also evident in the militarized crisis in 1975 over upstream Syrian and Turkish dam projects that sharply curtailed the inflow of the Euphrates into Iraq and brought Syria and Iraq to the brink of war.111 With Saddam Hussein's overthrow, however, sectarian interests drew the Nouri al‐Maliki and Assad regimes closer together. Iraq opened its airspace to Iranian aircraft transporting war material to the Syrian government and allowed Shia militants to enter Syria to support Assad loyalists. The two countries have occasionally coordinated their riparian interests. In the run‐up to Turkey's 1990 filling of the Ataturk Dam, which reduced the downstream flow of the Euphrates, they established a unified front,112 demanding that Turkey halve the reservoir‐filling period and securing an Arab League resolution that censured Turkey's actions.113"
"62","Unilateral upstream moves by Turkey are compounded by the absence of a comprehensive water‐sharing agreement for the three Euphrates basin states.114 Iraq and Syria chafe at Turkish reluctance to accept a regime that would limit Turkey's water withdrawals. The sole agreement regulating water allocation between Turkey and Syria is a 1987 protocol guaranteeing Syria a minimum flow of 500 cubic meters per second from the Euphrates, in exchange for Syria suppressing PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) attacks from its territory. Otherwise, unilateral approaches to water development have prevailed, and cooperative initiatives have been ad hoc and episodic. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey met intermittently within their Joint Technical Committee, created to guide negotiations for a final trilateral water‐sharing accord, but the committee foundered over Syria's support for the PKK.               "
"63","Iraq's military was decimated by the U.S. invasion. Despite efforts at reconstituting its strength, there is no great disparity between it and Syria (whereas the two countries would be no match for Turkey in the conceivable future). The present balance of power is thus not conducive to conflict initiation by either side."
"64","The traditional hydropolitical balance of the basin has been altered by the recent territorial and political gains of quasi‐state actors, especially ISIS and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). ISIS controls much of the Euphrates River Valley on both sides of the Syria–Iraq border, a strategically important area because of the presence of dams and hydraulic structures that provide drinking water, hydroelectric power, and irrigation supplies and regulate the inflow of the Euphrates into Iraq.115 Incidents such as the Islamic State's severing of the domestic water supply for Aleppo in July 2014, Syria's second‐largest city,116 and its diversion of water from the Ramadi Dam in June 2015, which halved the flow of the Euphrates River,117 underscore ISIS's penchant for obstructing water flows as a tool of coercion vis‐à‐vis its enemies.               "
"65","Iraq's water security is also under threat from the KRG's de facto control of key dams on Tigris River tributaries.118 The KRG's willingness to exploit these geopolitical advantages as a bargaining chip in power struggles with Baghdad was driven home in February 2014, when Erbil withheld the release of waters from the Dukan Dam, depriving downstream Iraqi farmers of crucial irrigation supplies. This move was in apparent retaliation for Baghdad's suspension of monthly payments from the national budget that the KRG requires to fund government operations.119"
"66","Relations between India and Pakistan have been dangerously strained for decades, with the animosity taking the form of four wars (1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999), covert activities, and a nuclear arms race. Although water relations survived these trials, several observations temper future optimism. Growing scarcity could lead both countries to push water demands beyond the provisions of the 1960 Indus Water Treaty (IWT), and religious nationalism on both sides could impede cooperation. Most significantly, the issues of water and Kashmir are intertwined. Pakistan worries that the waters granted to it by the IWT flow first through disputed Jammu‐Kashmir, giving India upstream control and a tool of political leverage. Pakistan's leaders have indicated that water issues are a “latent cause” of the conflict over Kashmir.120 India's Strategic Foresight Group declared that “not Kashmir but Kashmir's water is the core issue for Pakistan.”121"
"67","The IWT divided the basin's water, allocating the Jhelum, Chenab, and Indus Rivers to Pakistan and the Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas Rivers to India. During a 10‐year transition period, India was to supply water to Pakistan, pending the construction of canals (financed by the World Bank). India could develop projects (mainly hydroelectric dams) on the upstream portion of its rivers but could not impede water flow to Pakistan. A Permanent Indus Commission would deal with treaty compliance; if necessary, a dispute could be referred to a neutral expert appointed by the World Bank or to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague."
"68","Pakistan frets about India's upstream control of its freshwater. India deals with the fact that it is left with only 20 percent of that water. Quarrels erupted surrounding India's right to build dams within its territory on rivers given to Pakistan. The most recent controversy involved the Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant, which was meant to divert water from the Kishanganga River to a power plant on the Jhelum. Pakistan feared that the project would reduce water to its Neelum (its name for the river) Hydropower Plant. The Permanent Court of Arbitration permitted the project, with modifications ensuring sufficient water flow to Pakistan. However, Pakistan has expressed dissatisfaction with the court's ruling and demanded modifications to various Indian hydroelectric projects under construction on the Chenab River.122 Water conflicts have been contained, not eliminated, by the IWT.               "
"69","The balance of power (see Table 7) tilts strongly toward India: its population is approximately six times Pakistan's, its GDP is nine times larger, and military strength indicators confirm the asymmetry. Still, not every aspect of India's superiority is fully pertinent to conflict scenarios. Thus, superiority in naval force would be minimally relevant to short‐term armed confrontation over Kashmir,123 while nuclear weapons alter the significance of conventional comparisons.               "
"70","India's relations with Bangladesh are neither as tense as those with Pakistan nor amicable enough to allow easy resolution of water issues. A landmark border demarcation agreement in 2015 that arranged a swap of ethnic enclaves resolved a long‐standing dispute between the two countries,124 but it remains to be seen whether the newfound amity generated by the accord will spill over into water‐sharing issues. One source of continuing tensions derives from the continuous flow of Bangladeshi refugees into India's Assam Province, propelled by environmental degradation and poverty in Bangladesh.125 In Assam, conflict over land and jobs and distrust of Bangladeshi Muslim newcomers have bred recurring interethnic violence. India's push to secure the border against refugees has included their indiscriminate killing.126"
"71","Water issues focus on West Bengal's Farakkah barrage, diverting some of the flow of the Ganges into a canal linking it to the Hooghly River (in order to flush the port of Calcutta of silt), at Bangladesh's expense. According to one study, “the Ganges‐Padma River has continued to experience declining dry season flows since the mid‐1960s, with exacerbated reductions in river flows after operational commencement of the Farakkah barrage in 1975.”127 A 1977 treaty guaranteed Bangladesh a minimum flow for five years; two short‐term agreements extended its provisions to 1988, after which India began unilaterally diverting the Ganges. Bangladesh complained to the United Nations General Assembly, and in 1996, the Ganges Water Treaty was signed, guaranteeing a minimum flow to Bangladesh on terms less favorable than those of the 1977 accord.128"
"72","Discord also persists over the Teesta River, which joins the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's hopes that offering greater security cooperation to New Delhi would prod the latter to finalize a draft Teesta water‐sharing deal negotiated in January 2011 have been dashed by looming state elections in West Bengal, which have dampened India's inclination to compromise.129 India has also balked at financing the Ganges Barrage Project, a dam whose construction Bangladesh hopes will ameliorate shortages and saltwater contamination of freshwater supplies in its badly degraded southwest coastal region.130 The IWT and the Ganges Water Treaty have been useful, but their provisions may come to compete with each side's desire for increased water access.               "
"73","India further worries about China's projected damming of the Brahmaputra/Yarlong Zangbo, which would affect water flows to Assam Province.131 Of even greater concern to New Delhi is China's potential scheme to reroute the river's flow northward in Tibetan territory, a diversion some experts believe would sharply curtail India's share and increase salinity, with dire consequences for agriculture and fishing.132"
"74","A lopsided balance makes it unlikely that Bangladesh would promote its interests by force. The gap is unlikely to narrow significantly in the relevant future, while the resentments on the Bangladeshi side may continue to fester."
"75","As indicated at the beginning of this article, relative water scarcity need not have volatile international consequences, as long as solutions can be sought within the country through measures that assume good governance. Although some nations have done more than others to meet their water needs, and while international governmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations may help at the margins, as witnessed, for example, in the United Nations Development Programme's program to improve access to drinking water in Senegal, evidence suggests that few of the states examined stand to solve their water problems domestically. This directs our attention to the international circumstances that could make the difference between conflict, cooperation, or temporary stasis."
"76","The gravest threat involves India and Pakistan. The Indus is the only river system supporting Pakistan's agriculture, while population momentum and urbanization drive water demand more powerfully even than in India. Depending on Himalayan glacial melt, its decreased flow could fuel Pakistani feelings of vulnerability, making control of Kashmir seem essential to denying India upstream control of the water. Religious intolerance and hypernationalism, a history of armed clashes, and Pakistani‐sponsored terrorism against India make cooperation, or even stasis, less likely than elsewhere. Although the current balance of power favors India, a leveling of the playing field in Pakistan's favor by virtue of its nuclear arsenal, coupled with intensifying demographic pressures, could lead to Islamabad's adoption of a more confrontational posture on water issues. While occasional arguments have been resolved within the IWT's framework, disputes are now more frequent—a probable result of the vanishing margin between water demand and supply, as well as a shrinking disparity of power stemming from mutual ownership of nuclear weapons. It is hard to conceive of mutually acceptable treaty revisions that could, in the face of objective circumstances, ease either side's concerns."
"77","Another disturbing scenario involves Israel and Syria. Whichever emerges victorious from Syria's internecine violence, a catastrophic water situation is likely. The population is expected to be one‐third larger in 2030 than it is now, the rate of urbanization is high, and efforts at post–civil war economic recovery will strain water availability. Israel's control of the Jordan's headwaters makes it important for Syria to retake the Golan Heights. No institutional arrangement exists that is capable of addressing the water issue. Should Assad prevail, he may seek to bolster his legitimacy through a more bellicose stance toward Israel (possibly backed by Hezbollah militants). Should Assad be overthrown, his even more anti‐Israeli opponents could seize power."
"78","Prospects for water cooperation seem best between Israel and Jordan. The decades since the 1994 Peace Treaty have bred faith in cooperative solutions. A recent achievement—involving not only Israel and Jordan but also the Palestinian Authority—was the 2013 agreement authorizing the construction of a desalination plant with a capacity of 80 million cubic meters per year at Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba, with water to be shared between Israel and Jordan. The Israeli Water Authority also undertook to pump more water from the Sea of Galilee into the lower Jordan River.133 The agreement provides for the sale of 20 million to 30 million cubic meters of water from Israel to the West Bank with a pipeline conveying briny water from the desalination plant to the Dead Sea, which is steadily shrinking.134 Jordan and Israel have embarked on a parallel project to build a pipeline between the Red Sea and Dead Sea.135"
"79","Water relations for the four remaining dyads (India‐Bangladesh, Egypt‐Sudan, Syria‐Jordan, Syria‐Iraq) seem most likely to produce stasis. In no case are relations and power balances unfavorable enough to incite fighting or sufficiently auspicious to foster active water cooperation. Egypt–Sudan relations have historically manifested a common purpose that, despite water issues, is unlikely to make military confrontation likely. The prospect of Sudan and Ethiopia finding common cause in their quest for a greater share of the Nile's water could, but need not, tip the power balance away from Cairo. Recent relations between Syria and Jordan have been cold, but no rational calculus would propel them into overt conflict over water."
"80","Although Iraq competes with Syria over Euphrates waters, Shia–Alawite bonds may mute water differences (barring radical Sunni victory in Syria). However, if Iraq fragments along sectarian lines, its rival sectarian communities may resort to force to establish or consolidate their control over crucial choke points and hydraulic structures on the two rivers. Meanwhile, Turkey apparently seized on the turmoil engulfing Iraq and Syria to curb the flow of the Euphrates River downstream into Syria's Lake Assad in June 2014, sharply reducing drinking water and hydroelectric power supplies in the Syrian provinces of Aleppo and Raqqa and exacerbating Iraq's already precarious water situation.136 Relations between India and Bangladesh have been uneven, but there is no deep mutual hatred, whereas the power asymmetry makes it improbable that Bangladesh would seek to remedy perceived injustices by force.         "
"81","Institutional arrangements for resolving water conflicts within these four dyads promise neither cooperation nor conflict. The 1996 Ganges Water Treaty will not by itself settle Indo‐Bangladeshi water‐related differences, for the reasons mentioned earlier, and the latter is unlikely to press the issue by force. Differences between the Nile Water Treaty and the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework are important, but they point decisively neither to conflict nor cooperation between Egypt and Sudan, nor does the Maqarin Dam agreement with regard to Syria and Jordan."
"82","How might the outlook for cooperation be improved? In the absence of a widely accepted normative regime, comparable to that for the world's oceans (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), the resolution of water issues could begin by isolating them from other sources of antagonism. Classical functionalists137 argued that interstate cooperation should start with functionally specific, somewhat technical areas, thus escaping politicization. Once collaboration bears fruit, improved political relations might follow. From our current perspective, the path to success could be further improved by an appropriate institutional framework producing, among other benefits, “epistemic communities”138 whose shared practices and beliefs facilitate mutual problem solving. The 35‐year Regional NGO Master Plan for Sustainable Development in the Jordan River Valley fashioned by EcoPeace Middle East, an NGO jointly run by Israeli, Jordanian, and Palestinian environmental scientists and citizen activists, who succeeded in mobilizing support from national leaders for a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate a heavily polluted river, represents one possible model.139"
"83","The problem is that successful functional cooperation assumes problems that are by their nature technical, not political. But differences over natural resources such as water that are existentially crucial, for which there is no substitute, and whose supply is falling short of demand are naturally political. If current water arrangements are considered inequitable while the power balance favors the privileged side, neither conflict nor cooperation should be expected, but the chances of conflict increase when the balance tilts the other way."
"84","Third‐party initiatives can facilitate cooperation by providing side payments that create a sense of equity and by helping guarantee compliance with commitments. Upon the partition of India and Pakistan, the issue of access to the waters of the Indus River System required third‐party involvement. In 1954, the World Bank proposed that the system's western rivers be allocated to Pakistan and the three eastern rivers to India. The World Bank further proposed that India supply water to Pakistan during a 10‐year period, pending construction of several canals facilitating use of the three rivers allocated to Pakistan. It also arranged financing for these canals. Without the World Bank's participation, a resolution may not have been found (the World Bank also played a facilitating role with regard to the 1999 Nile Basin Initiative, precursor to the Cooperative Framework Agreement)."
"85","Even if a meeting of minds is reached on water allocations and the obligations of upstream riparians, agreement may be blocked by doubts about rivals’ compliance. Much mistrust stems from the frequency with which upstream countries have used that position at the expense of downstream riparians. Here, too, third parties could make it more likely that agreements would be reached by acting as guarantors of compliance."
"86","The future is troubling, but under restrictive conditions, cooperation or at least stasis can be encouraged. An obvious requirement is to recognize these conditions."
