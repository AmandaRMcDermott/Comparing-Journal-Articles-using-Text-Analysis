"1","American historians, of late, have been rediscovering the history of capitalism and the key role American capitalists have played in American politics, a scholarship showcased in the edited collection, What's Good for Business: Business and American Politics since World War II (2012). Elizabeth Shermer's book on the political economy of Phoenix in the middle decades of the twentieth century is a valuable contribution to this literature. Focused on “grasstops” activists, most of them members of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, Shermer argues that a pro‐growth coalition—business boosters—took over Phoenix and Arizona politics in the immediate post‐World War II era and crafted a model of economic development that largely benefited local and regional businessmen, at the expense of working‐class residents. These business activists, like their peers in most other fast‐growing Sunbelt metropolises, continued to exert hegemonic control over the political economy of their communities well into the twenty‐first century. At least in terms of population growth, this pro‐business political bloc succeeded wildly, as Phoenix went from a small, economically peripheral town of 11,000 people in 1910 to America's sixth largest city, with a population of nearly 1.5 million in the early twenty‐first century. It is worth noting, too, that Phoenix residents enjoyed a mid‐2013 unemployment rate nearly 3 percentage points lower than residents of Philadelphia, America's fifth‐most‐populous city, and 3.5 points lower than that late‐nineteenth‐century boomtown, Chicago.

"2","The business elite in Phoenix in the 1930s, according to Shermer's cogent account, took umbrage at New Deal reforms and began to organize in earnest. Leading the charge was a new, younger business elite that recognized the need for a changing model of economic development. Rather than accept dependence on Eastern capital and extractive industries, they looked to “wholesaling, distribution, and large‐scale manufacturing” (p. 51). To compete effectively against other cities and other regions for these new economic sectors, these businessmen waged war on union power in Arizona in the 1940s and won. Shermer summarizes: “Their success was predicated on a politics of growth and on policies that privileged business expertise in managing city affairs, prioritizing the needs of outside investors above general welfare protections for local residents, and demonizing trade unionism as an affront to opportunity, affluence, and economic dynamism” (p. 94)."
"3","Barry Goldwater helped lead this businessman boosterism in Phoenix. Goldwater helped turn pro‐capitalist rhetoric and ideology into policy and programs. He was aided in this campaign by elite‐driven city charter reforms that concentrated power in businessmen's hands and by a fiercely pro‐business press. By the early 1960s, the grasstops leaders had succeeded in making the business tax codes in Phoenix and Arizona among the most business‐friendly in the United States. Low taxes, limited regulation, and city‐ and state‐sponsored support made Phoenix a business mecca. And while other states and localities in the 1960s learned that they had to compete in manufacturing similarly to pro‐business environs if they meant to survive and perhaps prosper, Goldwater's home had a decided advantage. Shermer writes that businessmen looking to move to Phoenix knew that they could demand ever more from local government “Because their grasstop allies had the political power, managerial control, and electoral backing to escalate competition into out‐and‐out combat” (p. 183). With careful attention to detail based on impeccable archival research, Shermer explains how Phoenix's business boosters brought new business and new industry to their metropolis, serving the needs of capital, if not always the fortunes of the less fortunate."
