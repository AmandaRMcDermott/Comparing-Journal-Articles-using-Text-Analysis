"1","The politics surrounding natural disasters have received increasing attention from political scientists in recent years. Two new books shed light on how and why natural disasters matter. One focuses a lens on how Hurricane Andrew shaped the behavior of politicians and voters in Florida after the 1992 storm. The other reminds scholars that disasters often disproportionately harm poor and racial and ethnic minority communities. Taken together, the books show the richness of the field of disaster politics and policy, and they open up new questions."
"2","It is a truism that natural disasters shape politics. Former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator James Lee Witt famously said that “disasters are political events.” While there is wide agreement with Witt's sentiment, how disasters matter for any particular political phenomenon remains unclear. During 2005's Hurricane Katrina, President George W. Bush was blamed by political opponents for his poor handling of the storm, but Republicans and many others seemed content to fault FEMA administrator Michael Brown, who was dismissed during the storm's cleanup. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was reelected after the storm in 2006, even though roughly two‐thirds of New Orleans citizens were displaced from their homes. Nagin now faces charges for corruption. Louisiana's governor during the storm, Kathleen Blanco, refused to run for reelection."
"3","David Twigg handles the conflicting signals about how hurricanes shape politics by carefully focusing on how one event impacted state and local political incumbents and voters, district by district. Hurricane Andrew struck southern states in 1992, and at the time, it was the costliest hurricane in American history. Florida was hit particularly hard, especially Miami‐Dade county, where the storm damaged trees, homes, power lines, and roads. The most obvious way that hurricanes shape politics is by disrupting everyday life, including door‐to‐door campaigning and advertising. One politician noted that, “Once the hurricane hit, for all practical purposes, the campaigns [for the 1992 primary] were over” (p. 26)."
"4","Despite the tumult of a natural disaster, researcher cannot easily attribute an election victory or loss to the storm. Twigg addresses the knotty research design problems involved in disaster research by comparing the pre‐ and post‐disaster share of the votes for incumbents in the Florida legislature. Unfortunately, the number of legislators is small, and many ran unopposed for reasons unrelated to the hurricane. Twigg performs a similar strategy in comparing Florida's statewide elected officials' share of the votes before and after the hurricane. Of particular interest here is that in several cases, including for the governor and lieutenant governor, incumbents lost support throughout Dade County in elections after the storm, but they lost substantially less support in the more‐severely damaged southern part of the county."
"5","After exhausting pre‐ and post‐disaster vote share comparisons, the book presents interview material and news reports. Twig hypothesizes that the governor and statewide officials were symbols of statewide disaster response in the eyes of voters, and all other things being equal, people hardest hit by the hurricane would be the most likely to support incumbents. Florida voters saw governor Lawton Chiles on the news promising relief to victims immediately after the storm. One might also ask why support for Chiles and statewide officials was not greater in the aftermath of the storm than it was."
"6","In the end, Twigg concludes that the spike in support for incumbents in southern Dade country was “helpful but probably not decisive” in the election outcome. Twigg also notes that there was very little negative campaigning on the basis of the government's performance in the storm, and it would be interesting to know whether the storm disrupted campaign routines so much that there was less negative advertising than there might otherwise have been."
"7","The Politics of Disaster makes its greatest contribution to the literature by its careful, nuanced approach in examining the effects of a hurricane on a region's electoral politics at all levels of government, including localities sometimes neglected by American political science but central to disaster politics. The book's conclusion is that Hurricane Andrew helped incumbents more than it hurt them, but probably not enough to matter in electoral outcomes. If Twigg were to push the argument further, he might conclude that rather than being a “focusing event,” disasters are part of normal politics, offering one more venue for constituent service and media visibility. Even though a hurricane disrupts political routines on the surface by delaying campaign activities, it is one more tool for constituent service and personal “branding,” which are hallmarks of the twenty‐first century American political style.         "
"8","Writing from a different tradition, Robert Bullard and BeverlyWright also remind readers that disasters are part of normal politics in that they heighten the racial and ethnic inequalities present in American society. The book surveys decades of environmental and natural disaster policies at all levels of government and finds policies that systematically disadvantage African Americans and other people of color. The Wrong Complexion for Protection is an intellectual version of a “greatest hits” album, combining autobiography and research findings to give a picture of the authors' important contributions to the field of environmental justice, and a picture of what environmental justice has contributed to political science and other fields. To take just one example, an environmental justice perspective emphasizes that claims about the success of the recovery effort in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina should take into account the disproportionate burdens borne by African Americans. Furthermore, the environmental justice perspective considers communities, not just individuals, and any account of Katrina's effects should consider the increased number of homeless people in the city after the storm as well as the fate of the former residents of New Orleans who were displaced by the storm (p. 82).         "
"9","The authors' most sweeping claim is that that “the dominant environmental protection paradigm” institutionalizes unequal enforcement and exposure to environmental risk (p. 3). Unfortunately, the authors do not fully describe this paradigm here, or compare it to the environmental justice framework side‐by‐side. This is a minor quibble, however. The book's greatest virtue is its ability to synthesize the literature and tell the story of environmental justice in a clear, readable way that can help students and, one hopes, scholars to not take communities of color for granted. The authors offer several grim stories of officials who brush off concerns about responsibility for ensuring that all communities bear an equitable burden for environmental hazards such as water pollution and vulnerability to floods. The environmental justice field succeeds when communities do not take “We had to put it somewhere” as a sufficient explanation, and when communities acknowledges how the intersection of race, community, and history shape vulnerability to hazards and disasters."
