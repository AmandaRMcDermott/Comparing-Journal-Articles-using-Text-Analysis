"1","This book is but the latest in a series of recent works—including T.V. Paul's The Warrior State and Aqil Shah's The Army and Democracy: Military Politics in Pakistan—that criticize the Pakistan Army for its supposedly revisionist ideology. Nonetheless, C. Christine Fair deserves commendation for conducting firsthand research in Pakistan despite the internal disturbances wracking the country. Her considerable research and unprecedented access to the Pakistan Army have yielded some insight into the organization's strategic culture, but her bias against the Pakistan Army has prevented her from uncovering the deeper motivations of the state.         "
"2","Fair makes several key points. She argues correctly that the Pakistan Army attributes too much aggressiveness to Indian intentions and simultaneously dismisses India as ideologically inferior. These perceptions have fed a sense of distrust and overconfidence evident in previous conflicts. Fair presents a well‐researched analysis of how “the Pakistani army manages the Afghan threat” (p. 119). Having inherited a troubled frontier from the British Raj, Pakistan has a natural interest in a friendly Afghanistan across the turbulent border. The concept of strategic depth was never intended to create physical space for military exigencies during a conflict with India, as other scholars have erroneously suggested."
"3","Fair has largely used her considerable talent for research and analysis to cherry‐pick evidence that conforms to her cognitive bias against the Pakistan military. Her selective account of the history of Indo‐Pakistani conflict seeks to ridicule the very organization that facilitated her research and protected her during her travels within Pakistan. Unfortunately, Fair reinforces her arguments with half truths. She rightly criticizes Pakistan for using jihadist tools to gain influence in Afghanistan, while she paradoxically defends the U.S. role in reinforcing this strategy. She asserts that the Pakistan military has “constructed” (p. 137) the myth of a hostile India, yet she ignores the Indian military's continued refinement of its warfighting capabilities against Pakistan through military doctrines such as Cold Start and fourth‐generation warfare. She fails to point out that the Indian military's own demonization of Pakistan reinforces similar mind‐sets in the Pakistan military. At best, Fair's undue emphasis on Pakistan Army Green Book publications may help the Indian military better understand Pakistani perceptions. Perhaps she could return the favor by analyzing Indian defense literature for Pakistani audiences as a way to prove that India is not the “perfidious . . . paper tiger” (p. 159, 161) that the Pakistan military believes it to be.         "
"4","Having identified the Pakistan military as a hopelessly villainous organization, Fair presents a recipe to “compel” (p. 261) change that runs the gambit from absurd to deeply disturbing. Fair would have the Pakistan Army give up its “unreasonable revisionism” (p. 21) and accede to Indian dominance. Fair should not be surprised that the Pakistan military refuses to give up despite previous defeats and India's growing strength. Few nations—especially those with nuclear weapons—are willing to surrender sovereignty to their adversaries. Pakistan would rather balance than bandwagon and would prefer to settle the conflict than engage in a debilitating arms race or to continue “fighting to the end.”"
"5","Fair believes that the United States and allies, including India, should simply de‐nuclearize Pakistan or—absurdly—hope for a natural disaster that cripples the Pakistan Army's ability to restore order. Her suggestion that the United States should invest exclusively in Pakistan's civilian leadership to marginalize the military has traditionally backfired, as she concedes. Her recommendations for endogenous change are reasonable, but in the end, these measures can achieve little without an exogenous shift of Indian policy away from constantly applying military pressure on Pakistan. After all, India's rise is as much contingent on a rapprochement with Pakistan as Pakistan's future security is contingent on a modus vivendi with India."
