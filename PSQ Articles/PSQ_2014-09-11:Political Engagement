"1","AS IS WELL KNOWN, AMERICANS WITH HIGHER INCOMES tend to be more politically active than lower‐income citizens. They vote more often, engage in more political discussions, attend more campaign events, contribute more money, and contact more public officials.1 But research to date has only examined the moderately affluent respondents that surveys of the general public are able to reach: the top 20 percent or 30 percent of income earners. What about really wealthy Americans, with incomes or wealth in the top 1 percent, who might potentially have a great deal of political influence? Do they—as resource‐based theories would suggest2—participate at still higher levels than the merely affluent? Do they more often initiate contacts with high‐level government officials? If so, about what? Matters of narrow economic self‐interest or the common good (as they see it)? Answers to these questions may have implications for the workings of democratic politics.         "
"2","Standard surveys of the general public cannot provide answers. A survey of a random sample of 1,000 or 1,500 respondents typically reaches no more than 10 or 15 people in the top 1 percent of U.S. income earners, so few that nothing could be learned. It is usually even impossible to identify which cases they are, since they are generally lumped together with somewhat lower‐income respondents into a broad “top‐coded” highest‐income category. Since the income “top‐coding” problem makes it difficult to identify very high income respondents, it generally prevents combining small numbers of them from each of several surveys."
"3","Specially designed surveys are required to describe the 1 percent. But such surveys have been rare. It is extremely difficult and expensive to identify, contact, and interview wealthy Americans, who tend to be very busy, to cherish their privacy, and to employ professional gatekeepers to keep survey researchers and other intruders at bay. In this article, we examine data based on a Chicago metropolitan survey, the first to investigate the political behavior of a representative sample of the top 1 percent of U.S. wealth‐holders and data from a large survey of the general public. We use data from these unique surveys in order to compare the participation levels of truly wealthy Americans to those of the public in general and to those who can be classified as “merely affluent.” Although some readers may see the terms “affluent” and “wealthy” as synonymous, economists are beginning to make distinctions, as David Leonhardt captured in a New York Times column entitled “Merely Affluent versus Truly Rich.”3 Swank writes “The richest of Americans are defined as the wealthy. They are the 1%.”4"
"4","Theoretically, how would one expect political engagement by the wealthy to differ from the engagement of other citizens? Resource theories emphasize that resources, like money, time, knowledge, cognitive skills, social contacts, and abilities, are all positively associated with political participation.5 In their Civic Voluntarism Model of political behavior, Sidney Verba, Kay Lehman Schlozman, and Henry E. Brady identify resources, which they define as money, time, and civic skills, as the most critical component, with money as particularly central.6 Substantial resources are necessary to deal with information costs (for example, figuring out what the political options are and how to pursue them); transaction costs (for example, writing a letter or visiting a politician); and direct monetary costs (for example, campaign contributions). Other things being equal, the more resources an individual has, the more these theories expect her or him to be engaged in politics.         "
"5","Several decades of research have borne out this expectation. Rates of voting, contacting public officials, giving campaign contributions, and other participatory acts are much higher among the top quintile of the public than among those with lesser income.7 Political donors have received particular research attention. “Significant” political donors appear to be quite different from the general public in terms of race, gender, geography, networks, occupation, and (most important for us) income status.8 The most affluent appear to give more to political actors in order to pursue their economic self‐interest. Significant donors are also particularly active in other areas of political participation, such as contacting a Senator or Representative. Francia et al. report that three out of four significant Congressional donors contacted at least one Senator or Representative.9"
"6","At very high levels of financial resources, the precise predictions of resource theories are less clear. They depend upon the exact functional form of the relationship between resources and participation, but resource theories do not predict whether participation increases monotonically with resources; whether the relationship curves downward at some point; or whether break points occur that signal sudden increases or decreases in how income affects political participation. Is the relationship linear, or do diminishing returns set in? Does the form of the relationship vary by different modes of political engagement, being different for, say, contacting congressional representatives versus bundling contributions?"
"7","Financial contributions should continue to increase with wealth, since the marginal utility loss from giving a dollar goes down the more dollars one has to spend. But voting turnout, attending meetings, contacting officials and the like could even start to decline as wealth increases. For instance, the opportunity costs of engaging in politics may continue to rise as individuals become busier and their time becomes more valuable. (Do we really expect Warren Buffett to spend hours attending political rallies?)         "
"8","Power theories of political participation can help sharpen theoretical predictions about political engagement by the wealthy.10 G. William Domhoff argues that the enormous economic resources of the wealthy give them the structural economic power that has the potential to dominate the federal government through such things as financing campaigns, lobbying, and funding foundations and think tanks.11 Robert Goodin and John Dryzek point out that income affects not only the cost side of political engagement, but also the expected benefits.12 They focus on the low end of the income scale, arguing that increased economic inequality should reduce participation rates among the poor: the wealthy, with increased political power, would tend to thwart them and make it futile for them to participate. Here, we apply similar logic to high levels of income and wealth. Political power derived from wealth should make participation more efficacious, and high levels of financial assets should make the policy stakes higher.         "
"9","The expected instrumental benefits of participation depend upon the probability of changing a political outcome times the amount of difference that a changed outcome will make to the individual.13 Wealthy individuals have reason to believe that their participation can make a real difference. Given the importance of campaign money, politicians are likely to pay attention when those with money write or call. Moreover, for the very wealthy, political outcomes (for example, tax rates, economic regulations) can make a very big monetary difference. In material terms, political participation can be a good investment.         "
"10","Power theories, then, unambiguously predict that the wealthy will contact public officials, give political money, and engage in high‐level political meetings at higher rates than will the general public or even the merely affluent. But ambiguity remains about more mundane activities like turning out to vote, wearing political buttons, attending rallies, and the like, where the opportunity costs may possibly exceed the expected benefits of participating."
"11","We are left, then, with some clear theoretical predictions to test, as well as some questions about political engagement by the wealthy that can only be illuminated by empirical exploration. We examine seven forms of political engagement: voting; frequency of “talking politics”; attending political meetings, rallies, speeches, or dinners; contributing money to a political party or candidate or other political cause; attending to politics most of the time; belonging to political organizations; and volunteering for political organizations. Specifically, we expect that the very wealthy are more likely than are the merely affluent and considerably more likely than is the general public to contribute money to a political party or candidate or other political cause, to attend political meetings, to contact public officials, and to attend to politics. However, given the opportunity costs and possibly lower likelihood of benefits, extant theories do not help in predicting whether the wealthy are more, less, or similarly likely than is the general public to belong to political organizations and volunteer for political organizations."
"12","Our data come from two surveys. The first is a small (n = 104), Chicago‐area study, the Survey of Economically Successful Americans and the Common Good (SESA), conducted from 27 February to 6 June 2011, by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. The purposes of the survey were substantive—to learn about the political attitudes and behavior of really wealthy Americans—and methodological—to see whether vexing problems of sampling, contacting, and interviewing the wealthy could be overcome. The methodological effort was successful (though very difficult and expensive14). The substantive findings apply only to Chicagoans, but are suggestive, though of course not conclusive, of what might be found nationally. Even so, these data on top wealth holders are the best available and are likely to remain so, unless and until someone can conduct a national study—a very major undertaking.         "
"13","Identifying who is wealthy is a difficult task. One needs a list of presumptively wealthy households, along with contact information, before one can create a representative sample from the list. Perhaps the most reliable existing lists are based on wealth estimates derived from income tax returns, which are provided by the Internal Revenue Service to the Federal Reserve Board in order to carry out the Survey of Consumer Finances. But these lists are not available to private researchers. In order to develop our sample for the Survey of Economically Successful Americans, NORC statisticians used the imperfect but commercially available WealthFinder “rank A” list of roughly the top 4 percent of U.S. wealth‐holding households, employing publicly available data to construct wealth estimates, supplemented by the ExecuReach list of business executives. We further refined both lists using individual‐level data on household finances, such as home value, income‐producing assets, position in and size of business, and the like to identify the families most likely to fall among the wealthiest 1 percent."
"14","NORC, along with our academic team, used this sampling frame to randomly draw a representative sample of wealthy people from communities in the Chicago metropolitan area, including the city itself, its affluent western suburbs, and the affluent North Shore. Our overall response rate—in the most demanding sense, the proportion of eligible, sampled potential respondents that actually completed interviews—was 37 percent, a high figure for this sort of very elite population. We guarded against self‐selection bias, such as a tilt toward the politically active among those who took part in the survey, by carefully designing promotional materials to emphasize certain aspects of what we wanted to learn—how and why individuals achieved economic success, what lessons they might offer to others, and what charitable and philanthropic activities they have engaged in. In promotional materials and the SESA survey itself, questions about respondents' economic successes and their philanthropic activities were emphasized and were placed before any discussion of politics. For example, the first two question batteries asked how important each of a list of factors was—for themselves and for others—in achieving economic success (for example, hard work, luck, sacrifice, planning, etc.). A total of 104 respondents were interviewed for SESA. Many of the first 21, however, who were selected from the WealthFinder “rank A” list by an early, unrefined sampling scheme, fell below our target of the top 1 percent of wealth holders. They are useful for comparative and correlational purposes, but would distort the representativeness of results if they were included in the computation of marginal frequencies. In this paper, we present data on the 83 households that were interviewed using our final sampling scheme."
"15","The median income of the SESA respondents was $500,000, and the mean was $1,040,000. In 2011, when the survey of the 1 percent was conducted, to be in the 99th percentile of American taxpayers, one needed an income of at least $506,533, whereas an income of $815,868 was required to be in the 99.5th percentile and $2,070,574 to be in the 99.9th percentile. These individuals had substantially greater incomes than did even those whom we would consider affluent in the 90th percentile ($154,131), 95th percentile ($200,026), and 97th percentile ($290,860). On the other hand, to put these incomes in a larger context, the 50th percentile required an income of $42,327, and changes between a single percentile in the middle third of the distribution necessitates only an additional income of approximately $700–$1,500.15"
"16","The distribution of our respondents' wealth is given in Table 1. Most respondents fall in or near the top 1 percent of U.S. wealth holders, and a fair number are in the top 0.5 percent. The average (mean) wealth is about $14 million, with a median of $7.5 million. The people in our sample are not ultra‐rich; that is, their net worth falls far below the more than $1 billion necessary to make the Forbes 400 list of the very wealthiest Americans in 2011. But, to our knowledge, ours is the wealthiest representative sample whose political behavior has yet been studied.         "
"17","To compare the political engagement of the wealthy, the general public, and the affluent in the general public, we present data from a second survey, the Pew Internet and American Life Project.16 This is a follow up to the 1990 Citizen Participation Study17; it includes many of the same questions plus new questions about political uses of the Internet. The Pew survey was conducted by telephone between 12 August and 31 August 2008, and was based on a sample of landline telephones. It included 2,251 adult respondents aged 18 and over, of whom 1,655 were Internet users. The final response rate was 22 percent. These data were used in Schlozman, Verba, and Brady, where income and education were combined to divide respondents into socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles.18 We reanalyzed the Pew data, dividing the higher income respondents into those with incomes of $75,000 to $149,000 and those with incomes of $150,000 and above, roughly the top 7 or 8 percent of the U.S. population in 2008 when the survey was conducted. In the Pew survey, $150,000 and above was the top income category, and it is clearly below the income of respondents in the SESA study.         "
"18","In the analyses that follow, we compare six groups: at the lower end of the income scale, they are those with incomes under $30,000, those with $30,000 to $49,999, and those with incomes of $50,000 to $74,999; toward the upper end, they are those with incomes from $75,000 to $149,999, those with incomes $150,000 and above, and wealthy respondents from the special SESA sample."
"19","According to the SESA data, wealthy Americans tend to be very active in politics—far more so than the average citizen, and considerably more so than the merely affluent people found at the upper end of the Pew (or other) general‐population surveys. As the last column of Table 2 shows, nearly all of our wealthy respondents said that they had voted in the 2008 presidential election. A very large majority (84 percent) said that they pay attention to politics “most of the time,” and a remarkable two fifths said that they talk politics every day. (Several commented, “all the time!”) Their attendance at a campaign speech or meeting (41 percent) and the frequency with which they contributed money to a political party or candidate or other political cause in the last three or four years (60 percent) are very high as well.         "
"20","How different are these levels of participation from those of the general public? Comparing the wealthy SESA respondents to members of the general public interviewed in the Pew Internet and American Life Survey (column 1), the differences are dramatic. By several measures, wealthy Americans participate politically at two or three times the rate of members of the general public as a whole. For example, whereas 60 percent of wealthy Americans contributed money politically, only 18 percent of the public at large contributed. And while 84 percent of wealthy Americans said they attend to politics most of the time, only 26 percent of the general public did. By every measure we examined, much higher proportions of wealthy Americans than of ordinary citizens are politically engaged."
"21","Columns 2 to 6 in Table 2 break down the participation levels of the general public by income, using five categories that run from under $30,000 to over $150,000. The $150,000+ top‐coded category (the top 5 percent of income‐earners in the Pew sample, representing the top 7 or 8 percent in the population as a whole) is quite high by the usual standards of general‐population surveys. Yet, by contrast, our wealthy respondents reported a median income of $500,000 and a mean of $1,040,000. Just as Scholzman, Verba, and Brady found, political participation increases with income for almost every type of political activity, from voting to volunteering for political organizations.19 We add two additional findings. First, we compare well‐to‐do respondents with incomes $75,000 to $149,000 and affluent respondents with incomes of $150,000 and over. Columns 5 and 6 of Table 2 show that for almost every political activity, even higher percentages of affluent respondents participate than do those with incomes $75,000 to $149,000. The differences in activity level are particularly striking in two cases: contributing money and attending political meetings, rallies, speeches, or dinners.         "
"22","The second additional finding is clear in the last two columns of Table 2. It is that truly wealthy Americans participate politically even more than do those who are merely affluent. With regard to attending meetings, paying attention to politics, and volunteering for political organizations, the wealthy are about twice as active as the merely affluent. Only for one measure—belonging to a political organization—do affluent Americans report levels of political activity similar to those of our wealthy respondents.         "
"23","Especially notable is the role of the wealthy in political contributions. On average, our wealthy respondents reported giving a very substantial $4,633 to political campaigns and organizations in the past 12 months. Remarkably, one fifth (21 percent) of them reported soliciting or “bundling” contributions from other people to a party, candidate, or political cause. Donating is easier for people with a lot of money, and it may be the area of political activity in which wealthy Americans have the largest comparative advantage over their fellow citizens."
"24","How do these findings relate to our theoretical expectations? The resource and power theories fare well. The greater the monetary resources an individual has, the higher is the level of reported political engagement. As predicted, the proportion of respondents making financial contributions continues to rise sharply with income, reaching 44 percent for those with incomes of $150,000 and over and an even higher 60 percent for the wealthy."
"25","The functional form of the resources/participation relationship is generally monotonic: that is, most types of participation increase steadily as income rises. We hasten to note, however, that the political activity category (“attended political meetings, rallies, speeches, or dinners”) is a blunt instrument; the “dinners” or “meetings” that the wealthy attend and the political organizations to which the wealthy belong, may be more rarified than simple campaign rallies or party memberships. Given that the data do not make such fine distinctions, we cannot tell whether the opportunity cost hypothesis is correct—whether the wealthy actually participate less in certain time‐consuming political activities like attending mass rallies.         "
"26","At the highest income levels, there even appears to be a particularly sharp increase in engagement for some types of political activities, notably the 17 percentage point increase in contributing money between the well‐to‐do (with incomes $75,000 to $149,999) and the affluent (with incomes $150,000 +) and another 16 percentage point increase between the affluent and the wealthy. There appears to be a similarly sharp increase for attending to politics most of the time between the affluent and the wealthy (a 46 percentage point increase).         "
"27","Our theoretical expectation was that the wealthy will be most likely to contact public officials, given their presumed efficacy at this mode of participation and their higher stakes in policy outcomes. This expectation was only partly confirmed."
"28","We asked our SESA interviewees whether they had initiated contacts with six types of federal government officials or their staffs in the past six months. Table 3 shows that about half said they had contacted at least one type of official. This contrasts with fewer than 30 percent of the general public as a whole, and 21 percent among those with very low incomes. The Pew questions asked respondents whether they had contacted a national, state, or local government official. This makes comparison with the SESA question on contacting only federal government officials inexact. We can be almost certain that not all of the 30 percent of the general public who answered the Pew questions affirmatively contacted federal officials. So the 30 percent figure probably over‐estimates federal contacts for the public, under‐stating the true contrast between them and the wealthy.            "
"29","As with most other political activities, the rate of contacting generally rises monotonically with income, though in this case, the affluent with incomes over $150,000 were almost as active as the truly wealthy. However, we cannot be sure whether the nature of contacts differs between the wealthy and others. Because data on whether the contacts involve personal meals or office visits versus casual e‐mails are not available, we cannot tell whether contacts actually level off for the wealthy or whether they take a more intense form."
"30","Results are what counts from contacts with officials, one measure of which is whether one receives a response and is satisfied. Sixty‐five percent of wealthy Americans reported being satisfied with their contacts. Pew asked members of the general public who made contacts whether they received a response and, if so, whether they were satisfied with it. Although relatively small percentages of Americans made contacts, a high proportion (70 percent) of those who actually made contacts received a response, and most (69 percent) of those receiving a response were satisfied. As can be seen in Table 3, these high rates of receiving responses and being satisfied with those responses hold across all income groups. Of course, the wealthy may have been asking for a lot more, perhaps a $1 million tax break, rather than a research position paper to help with their child's school project. We do not know. If the wealthy ask for more than others do and get what they ask for at the same rate as others, the “results” of their contact might be seen as bigger.            "
"31","Our wealthy SESA respondents were particularly likely to initiate contacts with members of Congress. Forty percent reported that they had contacted their own Senator, and 37 percent contacted their own Representative. Remarkably, 28 percent contacted a representative or senator from another district or state (see Table 4). In total, 47 percent of respondents made at least one contact with a congressional office. Contacts with executive department officials (12 percent), White House officials (11 percent), and officials at a regulatory agency (21 percent), though less frequent, were also substantial. Overall, a bit more than half of our respondents (53 percent) made at least one political contact; 41 percent made two or more.            "
"32","Most of our respondents supplied the title or position of the federal government official with whom they had their most‐important recent contact. Several offered the officials' names, occasionally indicating that they were on a first‐name basis with “Rahm” Emmanuel (then President Barack Obama's Chief of Staff) or “David” Axelrod (his chief political counsel.) The frequency of such close ties to the Chicago‐linked Obama administration may be unique to our Chicago‐area respondents, but we see no particular reason why their high frequency of contacts with congressional representatives should be atypical of wealthy Americans elsewhere in the country. For that matter, we suspect that very wealthy people anywhere in the country can probably get the attention of high‐level executive branch officials, too, when they wish to do so."
"33","Our theoretical expectations about political engagement were based chiefly on incomes, costs of participating, and the expected value of instrumental benefits. But we wanted to check whether the self‐interest assumption behind some of the power theories were, in fact, correct. Were wealthy people's contacts with officials entirely self‐interested? The answer appears to be no."
"34","When we asked an open‐ended question about the main purpose of a respondent's most important recent contact, most reported a specific topic. Many gave a fair amount of detail about what they discussed. As best we could, we coded these responses as reflecting either narrow economic self‐interest or broad collective concerns."
"35","Not surprisingly, some responses were too vague to code: “[to] try to influence legislation …”; “trying to get him to pass or veto some pending legislation”; “to make recommendations on policy issues.” And some involved ambiguous mixtures of personal and societal concerns (“A relative works for a non‐profit that trains foreign police officers to investigate alleged war crimes, for example in Africa … I found the correct person to contact to obtain money for this group”; “I met with both [the] congressman and the senator … on why government must not cut the worker training budget, as a representative of the Alliance of Manufacturing … [this] is an important investment that will return the benefits many times over.”)"
"36","But many contacts could be coded as fairly clearly concerning a matter of economic self‐interest (“to try to get the Treasury to honor their commitment to extend TARP funds to a particular bank in Chicago”; “to better understand the new regulations of the Dodd‐Frank Act and how it will affect my business [banking/finance]”; “Fish and Wildlife. Business; permitting on development land”; “on behalf of clients, seeking regulatory approvals”; “I own stock in several banks. I was concerned about legislation he was drafting that I think could be harmful for the banks.”) Many other contacts involved matters of broad public policy (“concern about … deficit spending too much”; “we don't like … defunding public broadcasting, ending funding to NOAA, decrease funding to the IRS … It's crazy to end Head Start and they want to give away oil rights …”; “[as an advisory committee member] I provided my input to the issues associated with migrant worker health”; “My congresswoman is also a friend so we met over dinner and discussed … health care issues”; “to support government fiscal responsibility.”)"
"37","According to our coding, there were many contacts of both types, but, contrary to self‐interest‐based theories, somewhat more of them concerned collective matters (56 percent of those coded one way or the other) than concerned narrow economic self‐interests (44 percent). See Table 5, which also summarizes a few examples of topics or purposes of contacts. Contacts about health care policy were particularly frequent, constituting 20 percent of all issue‐specific contacts.            "
"38","Can we believe these responses? For the most part, subject to certain caveats, we think we can. Most of the reported topics and arguments seem too detailed and too plausible to have been made up on the spot for our interviewers. Spur‐of‐the‐moment inventions would take effort to concoct and could be harmful to the self‐esteem of people who like to think of themselves as honest. On the other hand, we suspect that the frequency of self‐interested discussions with officials may have been somewhat understated. This could happen, for example, because some respondents chose to focus on a genuinely public‐regarding contact as the “most important” one (ignoring an equally important but more selfish contact), or because some of the 4 percent who acknowledged the fact of a contact but refused to state its purpose—and/or some of those whose responses were too vague to judge—were actually pursuing a narrow self‐interest but felt uncomfortable telling us about it."
"39","Moreover, even when our respondents communicated their views on broad rather than narrow policy matters, we cannot be sure that they were always correct about what would benefit their fellow citizens, or that their views were untainted by individual‐ or group‐related economic self‐interest. Indeed, the specific policy preferences expressed by SESA respondents often differed markedly from those of average citizens, sometime in ways that could be self‐interested.20"
"40","In any case, some might interpret our glass as “half empty” (the 44 percent of contacts that admittedly involved matters of narrow self‐interest) rather than “half full” (the 56 percent that claimed a collective focus.) Still, our evidence suggests that when wealthy Americans contact high‐level public officials, they may often address the common good as they see it, not solely their own parochial concerns."
"41","The Pew Internet and American Life Survey was nationally representative, whereas the SESA survey was small and confined to a single geographical area. We cannot be sure that the SESA respondents are representative of all wealthy Americans around the country. On the other hand, the Chicago metropolitan area has some advantages as a survey locale. In political terms, the Chicago‐area wealthy may fall somewhere in between wealthy people in such diverse places as New York City, Dallas, and Silicon Valley."
"42","To the extent that our survey is representative of the nation as a whole, it is clear that wealthy Americans—the top 1 percent or so of wealth holders—are exceptionally active in politics. They vote, talk politics, campaign, and donate money to political causes at much higher rates than do average citizens. They are also significantly more active than are the merely affluent in the Pew survey. Particularly notable are the findings that our respondents averaged a substantial $4,600 in annual political contributions; that 21 percent of our respondents reported “bundling” others' political contributions; and that 40 percent reported initiating a contact with their own U.S. Senators. Many also contacted their own Representatives, others' Senators or Representatives, executive branch officials, and/or members of the White House staff."
"43","These findings are broadly consistent with resource theories of participation, though they illuminate certain matters about which those theories are ambiguous or silent. In particular, participation rates generally rise monotonically with income, even up to the $500,000–$1 million in income ($7 million to $10 million in wealth) typical of SESA respondents. But the relationship is not universally linear. As the idea of diminishing returns to resources suggests, in the upper ranges, participation rates rise more slowly with each additional dollar. Moreover, in some tine‐consuming activities such as belonging to political organizations, participation among the wealthy actually declines marginally as compared to the affluent."
"44","Power theories, too, gain support from our findings, both on the many matters about which their predictions coincide with those of resource theories, and in the several cases where they offer more definite predictions (for example, about contacting officials). At the same time, we find some evidence contradicting the pure self‐interest assumption that underlies some formulations of both theories."
"45","In her book, Andrea Campbell refers to the elderly as “the Über‐citizens of the American polity, voting and making campaign contributions at rates higher than any other age group.”21 Our findings point to the fact that it may be the wealthy who are the real Über‐citizens of the American polity. Their participation levels far exceed any others that scholars have found.         "
"46","What implications does this have for democratic policymaking? Others have found evidence indicating that moderately “affluent” Americans in the top third or top fifth of the income distribution have much more influence than do other citizens over the roll call votes of their Senators and over changes in national policy.22 If a high level of political participation by the affluent is one important mechanism by which they exert such influence, then the truly wealthy—with their still‐more‐vigorous participation—may exert particularly high levels of political influence. This would presumably violate the norm of political equality (central to “populistic” democratic theories), which calls for every citizen to have an equal voice.23"
"47","Stuart N. Soroka and Christopher Wlezien point out that unequal influence by the affluent would not make much difference if the affluent generally shared the same policy preferences as the citizenry as a whole.24 But Gilens presents compelling evidence that on many important issues, the affluent in fact tend to disagree with other Americans.25 Policy disagreements may be even sharper between the truly wealthy and most Americans.26 Gilens found that when the preferences of the most‐affluent diverged from those of lower‐income groups, only the most affluent appeared to influence policy.27 The Pew and SESA data help to explain one reason why there may be such a strong association between the preferences of the affluent and policies: their high levels of political engagement, including substantial access to high ranking public officials.         "
"48","A full assessment of the normative implications of our findings, however, would depend upon precisely what sort of democratic theory one embraces (relatively populistic or pluralistic). It might also depend on learning more about the nature of wealthy Americans' higher levels of political participation. To what extent do wealthy Americans in fact pursue narrow economic self‐interest, and to what extent do they pursue the common good as they see it? Is their vision of the common good informed by superior knowledge, so that they should be seen as enlightened leaders—pushing for policies that would serve their fellow citizens better than those citizens themselves realize? Or do the unusual standpoints and experiences of the wealthy produce biases in their world‐views (perhaps hyper‐awareness of tax burdens, for example, but little understanding of the benefits of social welfare policies) that lead them to act against the best interests of their fellow citizens? In this article, we have barely been able to touch upon such issues, which we consider important matters for future inquiry.*"
