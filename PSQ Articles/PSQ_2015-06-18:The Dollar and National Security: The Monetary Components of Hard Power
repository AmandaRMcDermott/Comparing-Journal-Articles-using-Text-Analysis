"1","The 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath have sparked new interest in the ways in which international political economy and international security intersect. This is particularly true for those contemplating the economic foundations of U.S. hegemony. During his tenure, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen repeatedly averred that the national debt was the biggest national security threat to the United States. Anxiety mounted over whether the dollar would continue to be the world's reserve currency. These concerns have jumpstarted research on how waning economic influence might impinge on the global security architecture, and vice versa (Cohen and DeLong 2009; Norrlof 2010; Kirshner 2014)."
"2","With a title like The Dollar and National Security, one would expect Paul Viotti's new book to address this growing demand for knowledge on the political economy of national security. That title is a bit misleading, however; this is a book that looks backwards more than forwards. In the introduction, Viotti states that he aspires to “identify this historic but often overlooked linkage between security and international monetary arrangements that protects domestic stakes in international commerce and helps finance expenditures for foreign policy and national security purposes (p.3). ” Viotti spends the next 165 pages examining the past 150 years of international financial cooperation, with less to say about the current state of the world.         "
"3","To be fair, Viotti has a clear purpose in looking at the past record of monetary collaboration. He makes two explicit arguments in The Dollar and National Security. The first is that we should view international monetary relations through the lens of “cooperative security.” Protecting the value of a currency is an essential component of national security, and it requires collaboration to sustain. The second argument is that part of the reason for the extent of monetary cooperation – in contrast to other dimensions of security – is that the owners and managers of capital function as an epistemic community, helping to promote shared understandings. By focusing on the past, Viotti endeavors to show the robust record of monetary cooperation.         "
"4","Readers new to the topic will probably find Viotti's book to be mildly informative. International relations scholars who have studied either financial statecraft or global political economy will be left with more questions than answers. Skeptics of the robustness of monetary cooperation will note that Viotti's book elides any period of monetary discord or coercion. There is no real discussion of the breakdown of monetary cooperation that exacerbated the Great Depression. There is no mention of how the United States coerced the United Kingdom by sparking a run on the pound during the 1956 Suez crisis. There is zero discussion of how the United States exploited the Asian financial crisis to extract policy concessions from its Pacific Rim allies. Nor is there any discussion of decade‐long Sino‐American monetary tensions."
"5","International political economy scholars will note the errors and omissions in Viotti's book. Sloppy factual errors—like describing pre‐World War I Argentina as a developing country—appear in the book, but that is not the real problem. The Dollar and National Security evinces no deep understanding of how different global financial orders operate. For example, Viotti manages to discuss how the Bretton Woods system fell apart without once mentioning the Triffin dilemma. The book then discusses the post‐Bretton Woods system without any explication of the “unholy trinity” that all central bank authorities must face. The book spends a lot of pages on the creaton of the euro without ever analyzing the eurozone's current woes—and why the single currency is a big part of the problem.         "
"6","Viotti is to be applauded for attempting to dive into the ways in which monetary relations affect state power. With its omissions, however, The Dollar and National Security raises more questions than it answers.         "
