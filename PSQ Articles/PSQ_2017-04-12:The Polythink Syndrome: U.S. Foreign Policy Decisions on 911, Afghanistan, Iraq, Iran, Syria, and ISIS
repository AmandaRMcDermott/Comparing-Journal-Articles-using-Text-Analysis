"1","This book provides an excellent counterbalance to studies that focus exclusively on “groupthink.” That term—which denotes a collective rush to judgment and an unwillingness to revisit other options once an alternative has been reached within a decision‐making group—is now so accepted by practitioners and scholars that it is routinely used by prime ministers and presidents (see, for instance, David Cameron's House of Commons speech in the immediate aftermath of the July 2016 Chilcote Report on British involvement in Iraq, or the much earlier U.S. report into September 11, 2001). What the authors term “polythink” is essentially the polar opposite of this: rather than denoting mass agreement, it refers to the fragmentation and paralysis that can beset any decision‐making group. Whereas groupthink verges on total agreement among the inner circle of advisers, polythink focuses on the fault lines within an administration that can also bedevil its decision making. Using a range of examples drawn from the U.S. government's response to September 11, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and Syria, the authors convincingly show that polythink is just as prevalent as groupthink and that it can lead to a host of policymaking difficulties and undesirable outcomes."
"2","The Polythink Syndrome provides a very welcome and innovative antidote to older approaches, arguing that groups can fall prey to either tendency and that each represents the opposing extreme along a single continuum. In so doing, Alex Mintz and Carly Wayne add something genuinely useful to existing theories of foreign policy analysis, building in a timely fashion on tendencies that have been hinted at in the literature but have not yet been expressed in such a succinct and overt way. At the same time, the text acknowledges a very conscious debt to the work of the late social psychologist Irving Janis, arguing (as he often did) that group dysfunction is not inevitable, and the book reminds us that group dysfunction can be minimized through the use of various leadership techniques (see especially pp. 32–34).         "
"3","Of course, as with any short book, there are things that might have been added. For instance, it might have been nice to see the 2011 decision to strike Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound using a helicopter raid examined through this lens. The Bill Clinton administration—often paralyzed by too much information and complexity and too little decisiveness on the part of its leadership—also seems like a prime candidate for deeper analysis from the authors’ polythink perspective. Any analysis of these kinds of dynamics is vulnerable as well to the accusation that the symptoms, causes, and consequences of any group phenomenon are hard to disentangle in retrospect without any “fly on the wall” presence (see in particular pp. 11–34). Nevertheless, the authors’ analysis of the decision making during the run‐up to September 11, 2001 is especially strong, and it provides for the first time a convincing attempt to put the 9/11 Commission Report into the kind of theoretical categories that a scholar of foreign policy analysis would understand and appreciate (pp. 35–65). The analysis also rightly concedes that there were elements of groupthink at the outset of the Iraq war, while arguing that polythink became evident several years later on. Overall, the authors convincingly trace the fault lines present within U.S. government, and provide an indispensable primer on polythink that is likely to be utilized in an array of courses on foreign policy analysis and international relations in general."
