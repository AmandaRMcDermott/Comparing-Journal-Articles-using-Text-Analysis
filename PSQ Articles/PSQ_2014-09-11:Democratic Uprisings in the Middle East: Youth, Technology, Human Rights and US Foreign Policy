"1","The Tunisian protests that sparked similar uprisings in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, and elsewhere in the Arab world have been called the “Arab Spring.” Protestors effectively used technology (in particular, cell phones and the Internet) in organizing oppositionand in disseminating information and knowledge within and beyond the immediate context. These social movements were aimed at the respective rulers in each society and mobilized individuals from all walks of life; to many observers, the role of youth in the Arab Spring was noteworthy. Mahmood Monshipouri's Democratic Uprisings in the Middle East is an ambitious attempt to bring all of these together and furthermore to discuss the Arab Springfor its implications for American foreign policy.         "
"2","This book successfully incorporates and gives an informed analysis of many of the existing commentaries, scholarly works about the Middle Eastern uprisings of 2010/11. Democratic Uprisings in the Middle East, however, will not meet the expectations of any readers who are looking for a historical analysis of social mobilization in the Middle East; for Monshipouri's book remains confined to the Arab Spring and does not explore earlier work on social mobilization and protest movements in the Middle East. The author's references to the past events of mobilization in the Middle East offer but limited discussion: for example, the October 1988 riots in Egypt (p. 22), and the Iranian revolution (chap. 5).         "
"3","On Iran, Monshipouri provides a wealth of information about its domestic and foreign affairs (primarily, a background to and negotiations on the nuclear program). To the author's credit, he accurately predicts the course of developments in the Iranian nuclear talks (see, especially, pp. 101, 115). Regarding uprisings, the discussion on Iran's protests remains much weaker compared to the earlier discussion on the Arab Spring. Here, Monshipouri concentrates on the 2009 Green Movement in Iran (that is, the protests in the aftermath of the presidential elections). The author's argument is that protest events in Iran in 2009 can be interpreted as precursors to the Arab Spring in that both demanded fair, uncorrupt government and emphasized human rights issues, especially insofar as the regimes violently suppressed the masses."
"4","In general, Monshipouri's book offers a rather eclectic discussion of the many issues that one can derive from the Arab Spring. In multiple places, the author either does not refer to important scholarship or build up the necessary historical background (especially for those new to the Middle East). For instance, the author does not refer to social mobilization literature in general and specifically on the Middle East. Then, notably, there is not much—if any—space devoted to earlier instances of social mobilization in the Middle East; similarly, it is worth reminding readers that use of technology is not new to mobilization efforts in the region (or elsewhere): while in exile, Ayatollah Khomeini used tapes, video recordings to reach out to the Iranians."
"5","Monshipouri's Democratic Uprisings in the Middle East is very accessible and presents a wealth of information that outlines the dynamics of the Arab Spring. However, for an expanded scholarly debate on the causes of Arab uprisings and theoretical insights into social mobilization (broadly and specifically, in the Middle East), readers will need more‐detailed discussion.
