"1","Our America is about turning perspectives upside down. It is about reading self‐satisfying narratives of the past irreverently, mockingly, unsparingly. It is about elucidating the political work that History, with a capital H, does. History creates myths that move and inspire, but it also creates myths that silence. Our America is a book about myths: the fountain of youth, the cities of Cibola, the pursuit of King Arthur, the realm of Queen Calafia, the curse of Zorro, the revenge of Moroni, the republic of Hesperus. Our America narrates the history of the United States from the perspective of the South, rather than the East.         "
"2","The book is divided into three periods. The first period uses the myths of the fountain of youth, the cities of Cibola, the knights of King Arthur, and the realm of queen Calafia to demonstrate that Hispanics shaped every colonial event described in college textbooks, from the Puritan plantations to the American Revolution. This section is the most satisfying, insofar as it manages to thoroughly Iberianize the early modern Atlantic."
"3","The second period makes for tearful, tragic reading: losses, lynchings, brutality, and racial slurs aimed at Hispanics, Indians, Blacks, all lumped together. Felipe Fernandez‐Armesto follows El Zorro and the Mormon prophet Moroni to describe the losses of California, Texas, the Rockies, the Marianas, Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, where Hispanics, Blacks, Comanche, Sioux, Apache, and Pacific Islanders had created shared worlds together for generations. These worlds surrendered to industrialization, machine guns, railroads, steamboats, industrial tractors, and millions of land‐hungry illegal immigrants from England, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Norway, and Central Europe, who came to the land to act as, say, Texas Rangers and carry out genocide."
"4","This section could have been balanced by a more‐continental approach of mutual influences, cutting both ways. It could have yielded a narrative of Hispanic influence and continental creativity beyond the bandit and the pistolero. In the first half of the nineteenth century, for example, the printing presses of Philadelphia became an endless source of books in Spanish that helped shape Latin America's public sphere. There is also the case of the origins of Pan‐American international law and the law of nations that came about out of the continuous U.S. armed intervention. Jurisprudence and identities, in both the North and South, were the products of codependences and mutual influences. In short, the Hispanic 19th century in the United States is much more than dispossession and violence.         "
"5","The third period is no less tragic; it narrates the age of braceros and forced deportation, from the Great Depression to the Great Recession. Fernandez‐Armesto reminds us that liberal Barack Obama, who won his first and second presidencies on the back of the Hispanic vote, has deported 1.4 million undocumented immigrants. But this age of violence and racism, and merciless labor exploitation, has also experienced the Return of Aztlan: a huge demographic explosion, the Chicano movement, Cesar Chavez, and Civil Rights. And it also seems to be on its way to turning the Anglo republic into a republic of Hesperus, the king of the Hesperides, whose islands the chronicler Fernandez Oviedo claimed were, in fact, Hispanic colonies.         "
"6","This section follows the Chicano narrative too closely to offer fresh insights. How to present Hispanics as something more than undocumented or exploited laborers? How to populate the more‐ recent history of the Hispanic diaspora with Nobel Prize winners, scientists, philosophers, economists, opera singers, and captains of industry to offset the dominant image of popular culture, one of curvaceous Shakira and awesome yet corrupt baseball players? And there is the history of the reverse: the “USification” of Latin America, namely, the transformation of a region by capital, values, and returnees from the United States. In the South, there lies the Anglo just as deeply within as lies the Hispanic within the North. We can no longer sever the Hispanic from the Anglo, neither here nor there."
