"1","The Classical Liberal Constitution is Richard A. Epstein's Democracy and Distrust. John Hart Ely's elegant masterwork offered a defense of many of the Warren Court's decisions that focused on the vital role courts should play in ensuring a well‐functioning political process. Faced with ambiguous and vague constitutional texts, Ely said, judges should interfere with legislative decisions when they find the political process undeserving of trust—both because judges are relatively well suited to police “process” and, crucially, because a well‐functioning political process is the idée fixe of our actual Constitution.         "
"2","If Ely was a progressive iconoclast in search of limiting principles, Epstein is a conservative iconoclast, more learned and less elegant, who has found expansive ones. For Epstein, interpretive disputes should be resolved by resorting to what he identifies as classical liberal theory, a middle ground between order and anarchy that eschews social control, promotes individual rights—and especially property rights—and is deeply suspicious of democratic politics. As Ely did, Epstein defends his guiding political principle not just on normative and institutional grounds but also, crucially, on the premise that the principle is embedded in our actual constitutional arrangements. We are to take stock that the Framers' “conception of rights embraced the liberty of action, the ownership of private property, and the freedom from arbitrary arrest and prosecution,” Epstein writes. “A right to housing, health care, or a decent income—or indeed any positive entitlement against government—was not on their list, or even a distant image on their intellectual horizon” (p. 4)."
"3","Epstein's originalist approach, which he asserts as correct but does not adequately defend, poses a special problem for his theory. The pathologies of originalism are familiar; as relevant here, the Constitution of 1787 protected the institution of slavery, and its drafters and ratifiers excluded women, blacks, indigenous tribes, and poor people from their political communities. Epstein tellingly describes the debates between Federalists and Anti‐Federalists as “a family squabble of men agreed that the purpose of government is the regulation and thereby the protection of individual rights and that the best instrument for this purpose is some form of limited, republican government” (p. 23; emphasis added). The Framers’ bias was toward the familiar and the male, and they conquered, enslaved, and denied rights to outsiders.         "
"4","Political exclusion is reason for pause on Ely's view, but Epstein doubles down. For him, we ought to interpret the Constitution above all to preserve rights to property that was acquired and whose value was improved through practices of political marginalization and violent domination. One need not fully embrace the economic populism or constitutional skepticism of a Charles A. Beard to be troubled by this prospect. It is enough to say that slavery, Jim Crow, coverture, tribal genocide, and pervasive discrimination against women and immigrants are more than just a footnote to what Epstein calls “the greatest triumph of political statecraft in the history of the world” (p. 3); they are its main text."
"5","Epstein is a preternaturally gifted scholar, but for all his erudition, classical liberal theory simply lacks the resources to engage such illiberal foundations. Indeed, the Constitution might best honor classical liberalism by requiring aggressive economic reparations for the many victims of its promoters. Under the circumstances, to lament the ascendancy of our rather meager social welfare state seems to look a gift horse in the mouth."
