"1","This book is Gabriel Weimann's latest of many contributions to the study of how terrorists use digital media. In Terrorism in Cyberspace, he sets out to answer three questions: “1. What are the new faces of online terrorism? 2. What can be expected in the near future? 3. How can we counter these trends?” (p. 4). In order to answer these questions, Terrorism in Cyberspace gathers together Weimann's extensive writings in many venues into a single approachable volume.         "
"2","The book succeeds almost completely in responding to the first question, in that it provides an excellent description of what terrorists have been doing online for the past 20 or more years. This portion of the book, comprising Chapters 1–8, neatly lays out eight different categories of terrorists’ online behavior, providing definitions and descriptions of each. In so doing, Weimann not only provides an extensive history of contemporary terrorist behavior but also creates a useful taxonomy of said behavior that is generalizable to actions in the future. These chapters are similar in content and presentation to the best descriptions of opposition force activities written by intelligence agencies."
"3","The primary weakness of this section is that the discussion focuses so completely on terrorists’ behavior that governments and counterterrorists play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to the terrorists’ Hamlet. Governments appear from time to time, primarily to lay the conditions for later terrorism—such as by invading Iraq—only to be swept from the stage. At times, descriptions of online terrorist events are cut short, immediately preceding the denouement when government agents arrest the would‐be terrorists. The absence of a description of government activities online sometimes creates a sense that terrorists have free rein online rather than being engaged in a long‐term strategic interaction with other online actors, such as governments, which is not true, as Weimann reveals more clearly in later chapters."
"4","The sections devoted to answering the second and third questions are found in Chapters 9–11 and are best thought of as prescriptions by a leading expert in the field based upon his experience. Weimann draws upon established ideas on the role of media in conflict to prescribe ways that governments and private actors can challenge and potentially defeat terrorists online. Of special relevance is the discussion of how governments have responded to terrorism found in Chapter 11, not just because it provides the most in‐depth discussion of government strategy in the book but also because of the thoughtful consideration of how these strategies affect civil liberties."
"5","No better description of terrorists’ online actions currently exists, and any scholar or policymaker who hopes to understand what terrorists are doing online should start with this book. The tone and tenor of the book make it a welcome addition to scholarly work, as it is simultaneously academic and yet appropriately structured for use by policy readers. Because of the scarce discussion of government activities, readers and teachers who want to create a complete description of the strategic interaction between terrorists and governments should pair this book with governmentally centered writings. Although the subject matter is likely too narrow for the whole book to be part of an introduction to international security, the chapters are sufficiently self‐contained that appropriate chapters could be included as reading, and the book should certainly be included in any study of terrorism or Internet politics. Because the online situation is so fluid and empirical information is difficult to come by, we should hope that Weimann will continue to update this book, and if future editions become available, prudent students and scholars should avail themselves of the latest copy for the best possible information."
