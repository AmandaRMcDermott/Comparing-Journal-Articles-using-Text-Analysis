"1","Students of health and social policy frequently categorize the United States as a “welfare laggard” that provides less public financing for programs that offer health and social benefits. It is not difficult to identify evidence in support of this characterization. Even with the adoption of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, the United States is the only country in the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development that does not have a system of universal, publicly financed health insurance. Recent efforts to roll back the ACA by the Donald Trump administration and Republican members of Congress, along with decades of reductions to social welfare programs such as General Assistance, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, further reinforce this image."
"2","Many scholars argue that reality is far more complicated. Christopher Howard has documented America's “hidden” welfare state, in which the tax code is used to subsidize socially valuable benefits through so‐called tax expenditures. James Morone has argued that the vision of the United States as a “limited” state ignores the aggressive use of state power when it comes to criminal justice policy. In Health Divided: Public Health and Individual Medicine in the Making of the Modern American State, Daniel Sledge makes an important contribution to this debate and illustrates that even within the domain of health policy, the role of the federal government varies enormously.         "
"3","Sledge's book addresses an apparent paradox. The United States does not have universal public health insurance, but it has one of the strongest public health systems in the world. The federal government had small a role in public health at the founding of the republic, but primary responsibility was left to the states. Following an 1897 outbreak of yellow fever in the southern United States, the federal government expanded its capacity and authority in this domain. It established the U.S. Public Health Service in 1912 and was given “the vague, and as it turned out, expansive, authority to ‘study and investigate the diseases of man and the conditions influence the propagation and spread thereof, including sanitation and sewage and the pollution either directly or indirectly of the navigable streams and lakes of the United States” (p. 41). The Public Health Service created a malaria control program following the United States’ entry into World War I, which eventually led to the creation of the Center for Disease Control (now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in 1944. The National Institute of Health (later renamed the National Institutes of Health) was also created by the Public Health Service Act in 1944 (p. 167)."
"4","At the same time that Congress expanded the federal government's role in public health, it regularly rejected proposals to establish national health insurance. What explains the divergence in policy? Sledge draws on the literature on American political development and an extensive review of the historical evidence to develop an explanation. He weaves a complex story that explains how the intersection of interest group politics, race, and sectionalism helped expand the role of the federal government in public health while limiting its role in financing health care."
"5","Interest groups, particularly the American Medical Association, worked to block the establishment of national health insurance. The groups were joined by southern Democrats in Congress who were “concerned with retaining local autonomy and preserving the region's racial caste system” (p. 5). Ironically, racial politics were also central to the expansion of the federal role in public health. Because black people were viewed as a “reservoir of disease” (p. 7), efforts to fight infectious disease were viewed by many political leaders in the South as “necessary for the physical protection of whites” and something that would further “regional economic development” (p. 7). Although a similar argument might have been made in favor of insurance coverage, the opposition of powerful interests to this sort of federal intervention made this less likely."
"6","Health Divided is a wonderfully written book on an important but frequently neglected dimension of U.S. health policy. Equally important, it contributes to the literature on American political development and the broader debate about the nature strength of the U.S. state.         "
