"1","I came to this book with conflicting presumptions. Laurel Harbridge argues that bipartisanship is not dead. I know her work and have been impressed with much of it. But I regularly teach courses (graduate, honors, undergraduate) on political polarization. I have been warning about incivility in Congress since my 1993 book The Decline of Comity in Congress and continue to write about the negative effects of polarization and gridlock. If I did not think that we have entered a period of strong, even extreme, polarization, I would not spend so much time on it.         "
"2","So I started Harbridge's book with both interest and skepticism. She argues that cosponsorship of legislation across party lines is the foundation of bipartisanship. Cosponsored legislation—in which at least 20 percent of the “opposition” party joins the sponsoring members—has lots of positive benefits. Such bills have a much greater chance of passing the House, becoming enacted into law, and helping members gain votes in the most competitive districts—especially when the majority party has a small margin. In the period of her study, from 1973 to 2004, “between 20 and 40 percent of all House bills introduced … [were] bipartisan” (p. 33, italics in original); over this time period, the share of bills sponsored by the majority party with bipartisan cosponsorship has increased (p. 33). Harbridge readily admits that partisanship in roll call voting has increased sharply, but her point is that there is a an underlying area of bipartisanship cooperation that we have overlooked.         "
"3","When we recall Representative Joe Wilson (R‐SC) yelling at President Barack Obama with the epithet “You lie!” or Representative Alan Grayson (D‐FL) arguing that the Republican health care plan was for people to die, these findings come as a surprise, even a shock. We are tempted to confront Harbridge in the manner of Chico Marx in Duck Soup: “Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?”         "
"4","Yet Harbridge presents her evidence very carefully—sometimes with too much “precision.” Chapter 5, especially, reads like a paper for a methods seminar rather than a work on Congress. Can we reconcile Harbridge's findings with what seems to be a consensus in the literature on Congress that polarization has increased sharply? Whether you favor the McCarty‐Poole‐Rosenthal DW‐NOMINATE scores or prefer more issue‐specific roll call measures, as my colleague Frances Lee (in Beyond Ideology) does, students of Congress believe that partisanship has led to a dysfunctional Congress.         "
"5","I see several ways of finding some common ground, although Harbridge may not agree with my interpretation. First, most bipartisan cosponsorship involves only a handful of legislators—around 10, on average (p. 31). So cosponsorship may not be as widespread a “solution” to partisanship as Harbridge suggests. Second, bipartisan cosponsorship is likely to occur on bills that come to the floor with voice votes, under suspension of the rules or open rules, and on bills that are noncontroversial such as transportation and space rather than on civil rights, labor, and education (pp. 77, 80, 107, 117–118). These are not issues that divide the parties, and they may bring pork‐barrel benefits to Democrats and Republicans alike. Republican Dick Armey, no less than Democrat John Murtha, was a master of the earmark. Bipartisan cosponsorship may be a small part of an otherwise polarized legislative agenda."
"6","In the last chapter, Harbridge acknowledges that her story becomes less relevant in the Obama administration. More congressional districts are sorted electorally, so there is less to be gained by members forming bipartisan coalitions. The share of bipartisan cosponsorships drops significantly. Such bills do not even make it to the floor, and stories abound about how members of each party barely speak to those from the other party, much less work together. By the second decade of the twenty‐first century, then, bipartisanship was in intensive care, if not quite dead."
