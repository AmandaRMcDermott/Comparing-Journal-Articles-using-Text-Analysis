"1","IN HIS 1949 INAUGURAL ADDRESS, President Harry S. Truman enunciated a new direction for American foreign policy. The fourth point of his speech proclaimed a “bold, new program” to redress the economic backwardness and political instability that plagued underdeveloped regions of the world. It called for an innovative policy to replace the “old imperialism,” which Truman defined as “exploitation for foreign profit,” with a constructive project designed to develop foreign domestic productive capabilities as a means to foster global prosperity and stability. Truman stated that experts from the United States should share their “technical knowledge” with underdeveloped countries to create a domestic environment in which collaborative efforts of private capital and local labor could facilitate economic growth and raise standards of living. Truman's “Point Four program” extended his “fair deal” to the development of the underdeveloped world.1"
"2","Though Truman deemed his program “bold” and “new,” in reality, the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt set a series of key precedents for U.S. policy toward the underdeveloped world in the late 1930s and early 1940s.2 Roosevelt established the Institute for Inter‐American Affairs (IIAA) in 1939 to work collaboratively with Latin American governments to oversee the extraction of raw materials, increase domestic production in cooperating nations, and combat Nazi inroads into the New World. During World War II, the U.S. government expanded the IIAA to facilitate the production of materials necessary for the war effort. The United States hosted the 1944 Bretton Woods conference to create two supranational economic organizations—the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund—to promote post‐war stability. By the end of the military conflicts in Europe and Asia, the United States slowly began the arduous processes of relief, reconstruction, and ultimately, development of an international system undergoing profound transformation.         "
"3","To accomplish the daunting task of European recovery, U.S. policymakers employed government funds to establish a freer and more open international economic system to remedy the autarkic trading practices that characterized the pre‐war world.3 Having recovered from the Great Depression through the government spending policies of the New Deal and wartime mobilization, U.S. officials “were committed to a positive role for the state in promoting the general welfare” of peoples abroad.4 A 1943 Department of Commerce report suggested that the federal government should offer “direct material assistance” to Europe and Asia for post‐war relief and direct future international economic development projects.5 In the late 1940s, the Truman administration increasingly exercised the administrative manpower and financial resources of the federal government to implement economic policies to promote international trade, such as lowering tariffs, and strategic initiatives to pursue international stability, such as institutionalizing military alliances. The creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Marshall Plan, and NATO reflected this change.6 Outside of Europe, other regions ravaged by the war, such as the Soviet Union, North Africa, and East Asia, also desperately required recovery and reconstruction aid. New nations emerging in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia sought assistance not only for rehabilitation, but also for building the infrastructure required for nascent nation‐states to compete in the global market.         "
"4","Out of this context arose the Point Four program. Point Four's basic premises mirrored and further developed those of other assistance programs proposed by the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. The program used American technical expertise and a philosophy of “self‐help” through mixed public and private investment to promote economic growth. It also intended to create an open and extensive capitalist trading bloc.7 Moreover, the program presumed that economic growth and relatively free trade would foster political stability, democratization, and strategic allegiance with the United States.         "
"5","Despite the similarities in objectives, Truman's program represented a distinctive change in the means to achieve foreign policy goals. Unlike the narrow vision of the State Department's IIAA programs in Latin America, Point Four expanded development programs to include the entire underdeveloped world and linked national economic growth to a regional defense strategy and global trading relationships. Unlike the Bretton Woods organizations, Point Four was explicitly an American program—it employed only U.S. officials, used funding exclusively from Congress, and required administrative oversight from U.S. governmental organizations. In contrast to the Marshall Plan, Point Four had global development aims that focused on underdeveloped nations emerging from colonial status and proposed less governmental funding.8"
"6","Historians have often neglected detailed studies of Point Four, disparaged the program as exploitative, or dismissed it as insignificant.9 As opposed to the simplistic and rudimentary image of Point Four portrayed in these interpretations, the program operated on a complex theory of development that linked small‐scale assistance with larger geopolitical strategy. This paper explores all the dimensions that contributed to the program's origins—security concerns, strategic goals, economic philosophies and intentions, and ideological visions. Point Four was especially significant because it gave institutional expression to a protean ideology of international development. As the first formal government program explicitly designed to ameliorate social, economic, and political conditions in any “underdeveloped” nation, Point Four brought international development policy into the U.S. foreign policy apparatus to an unprecedented extent.         "
"7","Scholars have recently explored how modernization theory shaped U.S. development policy in the Third World.10 These works focus heavily on the nation‐building policies of the 1950s and 1960s, when modernization theorists became influential in the policymaking circles of the U.S. government, particularly in the administration of John F. Kennedy. Surprisingly, only a few scholars have examined Point Four as an institutional precedent for such policies.11 Yet the ideas and implementation of Point Four reflected the basic approach to international development that modernization theorists later proposed. In its initial formulation, Point Four conflated political development with economic modernization and affirmed American technical expertise as a guiding force for international development policy. Point Four, and more broadly, development, also served as a means to redress the socioeconomic environment that some policymakers believed fostered Communist sympathies. Thus, the ideological and institutional framework set forth by the Point Four program during the Truman administration defined the way in which the United States interacted with the Third World and precipitated the acceptance of the modernization theory in U.S. foreign policy.         "
"8","The policy precedents for the Point Four program date back to the nineteenth century. In his 1954 study on Point Four's origins, historian Merle Curti identified the earliest conceptual precedents in ad hoc agricultural exchange programs between Western Europe and the United States in the 1840s.12 Programs of agricultural reform, the modernization of infrastructure, and material development in the Philippines at the turn of the twentieth century represented a more coherent approach for promoting development in a single nation, as well as an early instance of linking economic modernization to social improvement and political development.13 Bilateral technical aid missions designed to offer American agricultural and economic consulting to many Asian and South American countries proliferated through the interwar years, as did programs that proffered financial experts abroad to help modernize economies during the years of “dollar diplomacy.”14"
"9","The most‐salient intellectual and policy precedents for programs of post‐war relief, recovery, and development, however, lay in the New Deal and World War II. The Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) program of rural electrification and community development provided concrete examples of how to raise standards of living in an impoverished region, through methods consonant with democratic principles.15 TVA officials taught farmers how to increase crop yields, developed new fertilizers, laid new power lines, and constructed powerful hydroelectric dams that used available water resources to power the region. Herman Finer, a political scientist who worked in the TVA offices during the late 1930s, produced a prescriptive book in 1944 entitled The T.V.A.: Lessons for International Application. The book extolled the TVA's successful campaign to raise the standards of living of an impoverished rural population, and highlighted the plasticity of the TVA's principles and their applicability to other locations around the globe.16 The TVA appeared as a solution to social, political, and economic problems, all in one governmental program. Moreover, historian Nils Gilman argues that because the TVA relied upon the three pillars of government—oversight, private investment, and technical expertise—the agency represented a stage within a larger technocratic movement that would shape thinking about economic reconstruction programs abroad.17"
"10","In the 1940s, the TVA became an administrative and intellectual blueprint for revitalizing economically underdeveloped regions outside the United States. Vice President and former Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace talked about the need for an “international TVA” at a conference in 1942.18 During meetings with Joseph Stalin at Yalta, President Roosevelt suggested that the TVA might provide a reasonable paradigm for approaching the problems of immediate European recovery.19 Some of Roosevelt's contemporaries even referred to the Marshall Plan as a “European TVA.”20 Moreover, the program's proven ability to remedy social, political, and economic problems implied to some observers that it could be an effective weapon against communism. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., the influential historian and public intellectual, stated that the TVA was “a weapon which, if properly employed, might outbid all the social ruthlessness of the Communists for support of the people of Asia.”21 For U.S. officials, the TVA offered a method for the United States to transfer its superior technological capabilities and simultaneously develop local capacity to use that technology.22 Foreign leaders, too, saw potential benefits in the rapid modernization capabilities of the TVA. By 1955, France, Australia, Mexico, and India instituted similar rural electrification and community development projects as the TVA became a symbol for environmental, economic, and political development.23"
"11","Whereas the TVA became a potential model for remedying depressed economic regions, the Institute of Inter‐American Affairs represented the first coherent U.S. policy designed to address issues of international economic development. The IIAA originated in the efforts of private philanthropic endeavors. In the first few decades of the twentieth century, church and religious agency leaders traveled throughout Latin America, where they offered food assistance, agricultural tools, and educational services, often in the form of school‐building.24 Private foundations and several universities soon followed. Organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation also financed schools, conducted agricultural research, and instituted educational exchange programs in South American countries in the 1920s and 1930s.25"
"12","The idea for a unified program of economic development for the continent arose out of the experiences of quintessential modernizer and philanthropist Nelson Rockefeller. Rockefeller visited Latin America throughout the 1930s, where he witnessed first‐hand both low standards of living and almost universal resentment toward American (and his family's) corporate investments.26 Upon returning from his various trips to Latin America, especially Venezuela, Rockefeller spoke of a new‐found commitment to increase agricultural yields, enhance modern public health facilities, and promote infrastructure improvement.27 He gathered together a group of advisers, including prominent New Dealer Beardsley Ruml, to formulate a potential development program of such technical assistance projects to propose to President Roosevelt.28 Rockefeller sought a policy that committed U.S. government resources to Latin American economic development, but significantly, also advocated one that would tie such economic policy to the strategic interests of the United States. Working with Ruml, the two presented a proposal entitled “Hemisphere Economic Policy” to the White House in 1938.29"
"13","President Roosevelt and his close adviser, Harry Hopkins, welcomed the report. Roosevelt viewed it as a way to implement a policy that would consolidate U.S. regional objectives into a single, coherent program. The President had previously advocated the Good Neighbor Policy to stress regional economic ties and emphasized the importance of hemispheric defense against European fascism at the Buenos Aires Conference in 1936.30 With enthusiasm, Roosevelt appointed Rockefeller to head the newly established Office of Inter‐American Affairs (OIAA) in 1939. The Office immediately sent diplomatic missions throughout Latin America to examine potential locations for Rockefeller's proposed programs of internal improvements. To administer these programs, Roosevelt formed the Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific and Cultural Cooperation in 1939. In April 1940, following the escalation of World War II in Europe, Roosevelt issued an Executive Order to create the Office of the Coordinator of Inter‐American Affairs, chaired by Nelson Rockefeller. The new office promptly adopted resolutions to facilitate the production of Latin American rubber resources and to extract minerals necessary to wartime production in the United States.31 Subsequently, in 1940, Congress appropriated $500 million in capital funds through the Export–Import Bank to stimulate Latin American industries, and between September 1939 and September 1940, U.S. investment in Latin American nations increased by around $400 million.32"
"14","After the war ended, the Truman administration transformed the OIAA into a government‐owned corporation, the Institute of Inter‐American Affairs, to coordinate all assistance programs to Latin American nations under Rockefeller's supervision.33 IIAA programs proliferated thereafter. By 1949, the organization coordinated projects related to hospital construction, educational development, and vocational training in most Latin American nations.34 Though managed by government officials, the programs relied heavily upon private investment, which became the main source of capital flows from the United States.35"
"15","The IIAA programs became an instructive model for engaging in technical assistance projects and the most significant precedent of Point Four. Central to the IIAA model was the servicio, a Deweyian pedagogical approach that emphasized “learning by doing.” The servicio operated as an exchange program, whereby U.S. agricultural, health, or other scientific experts traveled to Latin American countries to help satisfy immediate relief concerns or improve infrastructure. These experts taught local farmers and entrepreneurs how to use new agricultural equipment, offered new types of seeds, introduced new cultivation techniques, built new roads, and provided additional information for other such projects. In return, the United States ensured that raw materials vital to the war effort from unstable areas, such as rubber from malaria‐infested regions of Brazil, continued to flow northward.36"
"16","In the servicio model, American government officials worked collaboratively with private investors and academic experts throughout Latin America. Rarely did the U.S. government itself undertake actual development projects; American experts instead intended to cultivate an ethos of “self‐help” in the host countries. Moreover, the point of the servicio was not to allow American officials and private investors to unilaterally exploit foreign lands for profit—that would represent the “old imperialism” that Truman later deplored. Rather, the servicio proposed to train local government officials and entrepreneurs to encourage a collective philosophy of self‐reliance that could propel future development independent of continued U.S. governmental investment. This model of technical assistance based upon national “self‐help” also appeared in the 1946 Philippine Rehabilitation Act, which trained U.S. nationals to foster similar programs for domestic infrastructure building.37 It also became a hallmark of Point Four.         "
"17","Whereas the IIAA represented the earliest formulations of U.S. development policy for a specific region, post‐war relief programs offered some of the earliest articulations of U.S. government‐funded foreign aid for relief and recovery. Following World War I, various U.S. organizations, such as Herbert Hoover's Belgian Relief drive, provided essential goods and services to devastated regions. Following the immediate food drives, supranational bodies, such as the League of Nations, assumed a commanding role and provided loans for post‐war relief and aid programs for refugees in the 1920s. Though these groups aided millions of displaced persons in Europe, programs launched toward the end of World War II, such as the U.S. Office for Planning for Relief and Reconstruction and its successor organization, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), marked a distinctive change in the size and scope of U.S. relief policy.38"
"18","UNRRA offered extensive food, medicine, and agricultural supplies to war‐ravaged Europe. It also created and implemented immediate recovery projects, such as rebuilding roads and hospitals, in areas throughout Europe.39 By rebuilding national infrastructure, the program demonstrated that the U.S. government willingly embraced a leading role in establishing comprehensive programs of post‐war relief and recovery. UNRRA also represented a wider institutionalization of international relationships. The central governing council of the organization extended membership to Great Britain, the USSR, and China; and numerous other allies signed the founding articles.40 Although the United States provided the majority of the program's funding, upwards of 70 percent, other nations also donated to the organization.41 Accordingly, the program signified the beginnings of two key components of future foreign aid: international cooperation and the governmental institutionalization of relief and recovery programs.         "
"19","These components also underscored the creation of the Marshall Plan, the largest single economic assistance program undertaken by the United States in the post‐war period. For American policymakers, the Marshall Plan had two mutually reinforcing purposes—it rebuilt European national economies along liberal, capitalist lines while advancing the political and strategic interests of the United States. The Marshall Plan bound together the industrialized nations of Western Europe into an economically interdependent international system. As historian Robert Wood notes, the Marshall Plan also incorporated underdeveloped nations and colonial dependencies into its larger reconstruction plan. The colonial territories represented potential markets for Western Europe at a time when traditional markets in Eastern Europe were gradually falling under Soviet control. Additionally, American policymakers believed that these nations would help European metropoles overcome the dollar gap as a result of earnings that would flow to them from their possessions in the Third World.42"
"20","By redressing Europe's economic problems, U.S. policymakers believed that they could create an international, capitalist system to thwart the potential spread of Soviet Communism. Officials presumed that enlarging the global capitalist bloc and promoting relatively free trading policies would prevent the return of the autarkic economic practices of the pre‐war period. By extension, this viable and economically interdependent Western Europe could mitigate the influence of popular Communist parties in Western Europe. This extensive capitalist system would also effectively defend itself against any prospective advances from the Soviet Union.43 Accordingly, the Marshall Plan increasingly connected the United States and Western Europe to underdeveloped nations and colonial dependencies and linked objectives of economic growth with political strategy. In both an ideological and institutional sense, the Marshall Plan employed many of the same ideas that underscored the creation of Point Four.         "
"21","Following the Marshall Plan, Latin American leaders made it clear that they, too, wanted recovery assistance. In anticipation of the early 1948 Bogota Conference, State Department officials stated that “economic development is today the major objective of Latin American policy.”44 Assistant Secretary of State Will Clayton noted that “considerable talk” floated around on the eve of the Bogota Conference in late 1947 for “a Marshall Plan for Latin America.” Clayton acknowledged the need for economic development in Latin America, but foresaw that the Marshall Plan would not translate directly to the region. Instead, he argued that Latin America needed extensive capital investment, modern machinery, and engineering services for its recovery. Though organizations such as the Export–Import Bank and IIAA had offered loans and technical assistance, respectively, they had not done enough for Latin America. Yet a program on the scale of the Marshall Plan, in Clayton's eyes, was not politically expedient. “We could not think of asking Congress to duplicate [the Marshall Plan] by grants for development purposes,” he plainly stated, because “the Marshall Plan is wholly inapplicable to the Latin American situation.” Latin American nations required a different program, one that focused more on modernizing and investing in underdeveloped regions.45"
"22","By the late 1940s, U.S. foreign aid policies operated in a piecemeal fashion. The IIAA, UNRRA, and Marshall Plan all linked national and regional economic development to the advancement of U.S. political and economic objectives in the international system, yet each program targeted different regions through different means. U.S. foreign policy makers increasingly understood the importance of developing the underdeveloped world, but lacked a coherent program to pursue such aims. In this context, Point Four emerged as a way to reconcile these international objectives through a unified policy."
"23","In anticipation of the 1949 inaugural address, Truman aides Clark Clifford and George Elsey asked the State Department for new ideas regarding a “democratic manifesto addressed to the peoples of the world.”46 The advisers wanted to include a statement of the U.S. commitment to the economic and political development of former colonial territories in the upcoming speech. The most‐comprehensive response to their query came from a mid‐level information officer, Benjamin Hardy. Hardy, a former employee of Nelson Rockefeller in the IIAA, sent a proposal to Clifford and Elsey that lauded the potential benefits of extending the technical assistance model of the IIAA to any country that approached the United States for aid. Hardy posited that America's strength lay in its technological expertise and industrial progress, and that the United States could employ both public and private resources to assuage international poverty. His proposal also envisioned a vast expansion of U.S. technical assistance funding to alleviate the socioeconomic conditions on which the Communists capitalized.47"
"24","In the hands of Clifford and Elsey, the program shifted its focus from all nations to “poor” nations. Clifford, who originally sought advice from upper‐level officials of the State Department, found Hardy's proposed program to be a perfect fit for what he wanted to insert into Truman's address.48 Top State Department officials, however, urged Clifford to reject Hardy's proposal as “vague and premature.”49 Despite these criticisms, Clifford presented the idea to a receptive Truman. The President thought the proposal effectively complemented other initiatives, such as his domestic “fair deal,” and his support for the UN, the Marshall Plan, and NATO. Yet Truman also knew that a truculent Congress would balk at another program of extensive economic aid.50 Consequently, in his speech, he emphasized the role of private investment, not government funding, and spoke of the United States as a facilitator for national self‐reliance. In this way, Truman formally enunciated the Point Four program on 20 January 1949, in what some observers described as his finest speech.51"
"25","Despite the president's enthusiasm, many government officials did not openly embrace Point Four. Though some within the Department of State hailed the idea of a humanitarian program of international technical assistance—one that would alleviate poverty, ameliorate living standards, and thwart the growth of Communism—Secretary of State Dean Acheson was less excited about the idea. He recalled that other top State Department officials, too, were “neither enthusiastic nor impressed with its utility.”52 Nor did the program have widespread support in Congress. Congress only authorized funding for Point Four after the President emphasized the role of private investors, reiterated the program's anti‐Communist intent, and agreed that the program should receive no more than $35 million in its first year under the supervision of the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA).53"
"26","Along these lines, historians analyzing the Point Four program often cite its meager funding (compared to the Marshall Plan) as an indication of its failure and dismiss it as blatantly exploitative.54 For instance, Gabriel Kolko asserts that Point Four's scant first‐year funding left it “in the realm of abstractions rather than material fact,” and that the program “was too petty” to produce any meaningful results to match the lofty rhetoric of Truman's inaugural.55 But to look simply at the total sum of Point Four's appropriation is to miss a crucial component of the program—it was not meant to provide extensive government‐funded, capital investments. Rather, the program sought to endow small‐scale projects to improve basic living conditions on the grounds that they would, in turn, pave the way for private investments and loans from other organizations, such as the Export–Import Bank and the United Nations. Additionally, historians also argue that Point Four was nothing more than a guise for the United States to extract raw materials at cheap prices from undeveloped countries. Such interpretations, however, tendentiously skirt over the complex relationship between technical assistance, regional economic growth, and geopolitical strategy.56 For Point Four's architects envisioned a clear relationship between national economic development, international economic integration, and the promotion of liberal political institutions, a relationship that would, in turn, comport with the strategic interests of the United States.         "
"27","Technical assistance projects formed the basis of Point Four. “For the first time in history,” proclaimed State Department economist and Point Four administrator Samuel P. Hayes, a nation would seek to transfer its “knowledge” and “techniques” as a critical instrument of its foreign policy.57 Though this was an historical overstatement, Hayes nonetheless aptly identified the core components of the Point Four program in action. American scientists and academic experts reified their scientific knowledge into a variety of concrete programs in receiving countries. The servicio model of scientific education from the IIAA became the cornerstone of such projects. Such activities included the establishment of agricultural research and experiment stations modeled after their New Deal counterparts in the American Midwest; public health and education services; university exchange programs of teachers, students, and specialists; and the translation and distribution of technical publications.58 Point Four incorporated many non‐governmental organizations, such as universities, missionary groups, and philanthropic organizations, into its technical assistance programs. Often these groups, particularly Christian missionaries, had long‐established relations with local populations, and therefore provided channels through which U.S. officials could offer its programs of technical assistance.59"
"28","The central premise of Point Four was that U.S. technical expertise—identified as its superior knowledge and vast wealth of information—would be the guiding force behind national development. As Gilbert Rist argues, by defining underdevelopment as “a lack rather than the result of historical circumstances,” architects of Point Four made quantitative, legible patterns of assistance the only method to redress the causes of societal underdevelopment.60 In Point Four, the United States would send some of its leading technicians, engineers, and doctors to educate leaders in cooperating nations, creating a process of exchange that would, in the eyes of U.S. officials, “raise the dignity and place of the individual in the state, and his position and that of his nation in the free community of nations.”61 Technical assistance, in this sense, promoted development of the individual's status within a nation state as a prerequisite for larger economic growth. To catalyze this process, education, encapsulated in the servicio model, and the transfer of technology and American experts acted as the foundation for development. By focusing on improving the capacity of individuals to adopt and employ effectively new technologies, Point Four linked the rise in an individual's standard of living and knowledge base to national economic growth.         "
"29","In the minds of policymakers, technical assistance would thus build the infrastructure necessary for the development of civil society—education, public health, and productive agricultural systems—that would then spur wider changes in standards of living necessary to promote national economic production. Significantly, the program did not necessarily signify industrial modernization or an extensive commitment of American financial and capital resources. Instead, the program stipulated that either private foreign investors or the receiving country should provide the majority of investment costs, such as financial capital, heavy machinery, and labor. As dictated by the framework of the servicio, Point Four officials and American experts acted as educators and consultants, not sources of financial capital. Hayes explained that the recipient nations would jointly finance and administer the programs, with the intention that one day, each nation would “assume the costs of the project [which would] eventually become an integral part of local government structure.”62"
"30","This idea of “self‐help” was a critical component of the Point Four program. “Self‐help” implied that the United States offered technical advice to promote indigenous development that could continue indefinitely without perpetual U.S. investment. An early technical assistance proposal in the Middle East stated that “the guiding principle of Point IV is that it is a self‐help program…. The most that the United States can do is to serve as a catalytic agent to stimulate the Near Eastern countries to utilize and develop their own natural and human resources.”63 Truman himself recollected that Point Four intended to help individuals in underdeveloped areas “raise themselves from the level of colonialism to self‐support and ultimate prosperity.”64 Because “self‐help” would in theory propel future growth independent of U.S. funding, policymakers believed the program would be self‐sustaining. Similar models based upon the “self‐help” ethos also underscored Marshall Plan programs that rebuilt Western Europe's national economies.65"
"31","Because the program emphasized “self‐help” over long‐term U.S. investment, Point Four did not require extensive government funding. The Republican Congress's unwillingness to support more federally financed programs abroad further necessitated that Point Four incur limited financial obligations. Speaking before Congress, Dean Acheson, by early 1950 a reluctant supporter of the program, maintained that the purpose of Point Four was to “encourage the exchange of technical skills and promote the flow of private‐investment capital.” He specifically stated that the proponents of Point Four had no intention of asking for additional commitments of governmental financial resources, which both allayed Republican fears and reflected the program's official intentions.66"
"32","In lieu of large‐scale governmental funding, the Act for International Development, which authorized Point Four, called for coordination among private companies, philanthropic foundations, and supranational organizations to finance international development. The act required U.S. officials and government agencies to identify potential private companies to invest in Point Four countries. For example, historian Alfred Eckes notes that when a country requested assistance in mining minerals, Point Four officials turned to the U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Mines. These agencies then collaborated with government officials and businessmen from the requesting country to locate potential mineral deposits. After deciding upon a location for mining operations, Point Four officials identified U.S. mining firms that traveled to the area to collaborate with local businessmen to develop the materials. This arrangement would, in theory, benefit both countries by generating higher export earnings for the local government and diversifying the international base for U.S. mineral imports. Eckes argues that Point Four therefore melded “altruism and enlightened self‐interest.”67"
"33","In addition to facilitating private investment, Point Four also permitted receiving countries to apply to supranational organizations for grants or loans. The Act for International Development indicated that the World Bank, UN, and Organization of American States could supplement private investment.68 When necessary, Point Four allowed these institutions to intervene to offer short‐term assistance loans and guarantees to private investors.69 Countries receiving Point Four aid could also turn to the U.S. Export‐Import Bank for loans, though policymakers preferred that the Bank defer to the UN in such situations.70 In all these cases, though, private actors remained the main source of capital investment. Gordon Gray, an advisor to Truman who authored an influential report on U.S. economic policy to the underdeveloped nations in 1950, concurred with the government–private cooperation model for investment.71 Moreover, TCA administrator and future Congressman Jonathan Bingham noted in his contemporary analysis of the Point Four program that “the United States government has not furnished expensive machinery or equipment on a grant basis for industrial plants in the underdeveloped areas—except for educational or demonstration purposes—but has left to private industry and to the banks…the essential job of providing capital.”72 Point Four, therefore, did not require or desire extensive human or financial capital investment from the U.S. government. The program instead created a model of government–private cooperation that mirrored the general structure of the “New Deal synthesis” embodied in the TVA and Marshall Plan, though with an increased emphasis on private investors.73"
"34","Policymakers believed that technical assistance projects, working in tandem with private capital investment, would catalyze national economic growth, generate regional development, and ultimately, benefit the international capitalist bloc. This theory postulated that technical assistance projects raised standards of living, created new national wealth, increased domestic productivity, and expanded the purchasing power of individuals.74 Extending this model, officials such as George Bissell of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) described the potential benefits to the international system. Speaking in the fall of 1950 at a conference hosted by members of the International Development Advisory Board, which Truman had created to oversee issues pertaining to Point Four's implementation, Bissell argued that increased domestic production and purchasing power catalyzed “rapid economic development” of underdeveloped nations. These rapidly developing countries could then, according to Bissell, join the United States, Western Europe, and Japan in an ever‐expanding capitalist trading arena.75 National economic growth, in this sense, supported international economic development.         "
"35","Developing the national economic output of underdeveloped nations also offered solutions to ongoing international economic problems. Many economic officials in the ECA believed that emphasizing technical assistance over rapid industrialization in former colonial territories would expedite exports to Western Europe. They saw these primary product–producing nations as sources of supplies to Europe. European nations could re‐export these products to earn dollars to rectify the ongoing dollar crisis of the late 1940s.76 Additionally, policymakers believed that advancing the international economic system and enlarging the capitalist trading bloc provided a bulwark against autarkic economic practices that many viewed as significant causes of the Great Depression and World War II.77"
"36","By linking small‐scale technical assistance to larger patterns of economic development, U.S. officials also sought to achieve political and strategic objectives. Decolonization provided a political environment in which foreign aid could become a foundational part of America's security strategy. Indonesia, for example, declared its independence in 1949. Other nationalist movements, such as Ho Chi Minh's in Indochina, pervaded Southeast Asia. Almost immediately, policymakers viewed the region as a focal point for competition in an ideologically divided world, impelling Point Four officials to enter into technical assistance agreements with many local governments.78 Elsewhere in Asia and Africa, U.S. officials established offices for similar technical assistance programs in Afghanistan, Ceylon, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Syria between 1950 and 1951.79"
"37","U.S. officials recognized that in order for economic development to benefit global geopolitical strategy, they needed to support the growth of liberal political institutions in the emerging nations. In the absence of rapid industrialization, George Bissell argued that “the limiting factors” of any technical assistance program were “the absence of reasonable law and order…and the newness of political institutions.” National economies could not flourish without a liberalized polity that ensured the protection of foreign investors. Bissell stated that “the immediate objective of external aid, perhaps the primary objective, must be to increase the prestige of local governments in the eyes of their own citizens.”80 Similarly, a 1952 policy pamphlet stated that U.S. objectives in Southeast Asia were “to strengthen the ability of these countries to maintain their freedom and independence, [and] assist in the establishment of institutions and practices needed in democratic, independent states.”81"
"38","As Point Four offices opened up across the globe in 1950 and 1951, U.S. policymakers increasingly viewed economic development, political liberalization, and geopolitical strategy as mutually reinforcing. Upon signing the Act for International Development, President Truman remarked that the program would “contribute to our purpose of strengthening the cause of freedom, through economic measures which will demonstrate the effectiveness of free institutions in meeting human needs.”82 Capus Waynick, an early director of the TCA, believed that strengthening local government benefited America's vision for a liberal international system. He argued that “the Point IV program…is a mutual sharing, self‐help kind of cooperation designed for a free society. It is directed at disarmament of the wants and the fears which breed hate and war, and which increase susceptibility to the blandishments of those who would lead people into political slavery.”83 Point Four, in this sense, was a program designed to nurture the development of a peaceful world order.         "
"39","In the eyes of policymakers in the early 1950s, creating a peaceful world order meant combating the spread of Communism. Edward Mason, an influential Harvard professor who often consulted for the State Department and who had helped Gordon Gray prepare his 1950 report, distilled Point Four down to its utility in the Cold War. He believed the program's basic strength lay in its potential as a strategic tool. He remarked that “it seems to me that this program, particularly after the recent events in Korea and China, has to be essentially viewed as part of the American security program…. Will [Point Four] influence the willingness of the people in the underdeveloped areas to throw in their lot with the US? Will it influence them to cut their ties or lessen their ties with the Soviet Union or will it not?”84"
"40","Point Four aimed to “influence” the underdeveloped areas by alleviating the socioeconomic and political instability that fostered Communist sympathies. By redressing ailing economies, the development model of Point Four represented a means by which the United States could create viable, capitalist societies resistant to Communist influence. Indeed, Waynick declared in 1950 that “Point Four is the long‐range answer to communism.”85 TCA administrator Jonathan Bingham argued that “even if improvements are achieved in physical living standards, the objective of Point Four will not be reached if there is not also a parallel strengthening of the people's desire for freedom and self‐government” to defend against the spread of Soviet communism.86 A policy pamphlet bluntly declared that technical assistance programs in Indochina were “from the standpoint of the security of free and independent nations, the front line of defense against Communist aggression in Asia.”87 Historian Mark Lawrence similarly notes that Point Four's implementation in the Southeast Asian “periphery” reflected a growing belief that aid could also directly combat the growing instabilities in the region.88 Technical assistance programs would not just fight a “quiet war,” but could also contribute to military strategy in an actual war against Communism.         "
"41","Ultimately, government officials increasingly sold Point Four to both Congress and the American public as a mechanism to fight Communism. Program officials situated Point Four at the center of an international struggle against Soviet influence to ensure that Congress passed the Act for International Development.89 In a public speech on the program, Capus Waynick declared that Point Four was a “tangible, living expression of American democracy.” America's “true motives,” he said, were to prove to the underdeveloped world “that the methods and institutions of a free society provide the environment that liberates man's spirit and brings his talents to full flower.”90 The 1952 Democratic Party Platform listed Point Four alongside NATO and U.S. involvement in Korea as a key to resisting “Communist aggression” and “mobilizing the strength of the free world.”91 President Truman often presented similar arguments for Point Four. He stated in a letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives Sam Rayburn that Point Four was a “symbol of hope for millions of people all over the world,” and that the program was the only way to successfully improve standards of living for peoples abroad.92 Upon signing the Act for International Development in September 1950, Truman publicly proclaimed that “Communist propaganda holds that the free nations are incapable of providing a decent standard of living for the millions of people in the underdeveloped areas of the earth. The Point Four program will be one of our principal ways of demonstrating the complete falsity of that charge.”93"
"42","In the early 1950s, Point Four transformed from a collection of abstract, inchoate notions of international development into a series of concrete programs across the underdeveloped world. Officials in such disparate countries as Guatemala and Afghanistan expressed interest in signing economic development proposals with the TCA.94 Point Four programs took a variety of forms, often addressing specific needs of local communities. U.S. experts helped modify legal processes in Liberia, instituted a new monetary system and Central Bank in Saudi Arabia, and even promoted new filing systems in public offices of the Philippines in late 1950.95 By 1951, the servicio model was ubiquitous, perhaps best exemplified in Formosa, where technical assistance programs helped establish pineapple canning factories with local businessmen and modernized rice farming techniques with local farmers.96"
"43","India was one of the first nations to receive extensive technical assistance programs. In 1950 and 1951, Point Four experts oversaw the establishment of a penicillin plant, the creation of a variety of schools, and the foundation of medical research facilities, among other programs.97 Officials spoke of coordinated efforts at dam construction sites throughout rural India, building upon the TVA model for rural electrification and development.98 In January 1952, India extended its 1950 technical assistance program to remedy a lingering food crisis and generate economic growth across the nation. The program helped to modernize agricultural practices throughout rural India, and also identified manganese deposits for U.S. companies to mine. In broad terms, the Point Four agreement stipulated that the United States would continue to supply technical assistance to promote and accelerate India's integrated economic development.99"
"44","Beyond the economic aspects of the programs, U.S. officials also sought to maintain India's nascent democratic government. The technical assistance agreement stated that “individual liberty, free institutions, and independence, on the one hand, and sound economic conditions and stable international economic relationship on the other hand, are mutually interdependent.”100 Truman frequently lauded India's democratic system of government to both Congress and the American public when discussing economic assistance programs. At the same time, U.S. officials privately pressured the Indian government to avoid any diplomatic ties to the Soviet Union and China and thought that extending technical assistance could persuade India to remain independent of the two Communist nations.101 U.S. policymakers hoped that continued economic progress, spurred on by technical assistance programs, would become the foundation for India's “internal stability,” and by extension, the political basis for regional security.102"
"45","Throughout the early 1950s, technical assistance programs greatly expanded in scope and depth throughout Southeast Asia, too. The 1950 Griffin Mission to Southeast Asia explored the potential for American technical assistance projects in the region. In its summary report, the mission concluded that technical assistance programs should promote economic recovery and attempt to influence the “psychological pattern” of the area in favor of a “pro‐western orientation.”103 Within a few years, the United States signed formal technical assistance agreements using the report as a framework with Formosa, Indochina, the Philippines, Indonesia, Burma, and Thailand.         "
"46","In Indochina, technical assistance programs worked alongside larger economic and military aid programs for the French as conflict with the Communists escalated. The Truman administration deemed Indochina, viewed as part of a larger containment strategy in Asia, as a front line for defending U.S. strategic interests in the region.104 A 1952 pamphlet from the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), a newly formed administrative body that governed Point Four, stated that “a platoon of American irregulars—53 men and women—are fighting the quiet war in Indochina. A small mobile team of agricultural specialists, doctors, engineers, financial experts, and educators are battling against the ignorance, disease, and poverty which threaten Indochina's existence.”105 Amidst the wartime chaos, technical assistance funded small‐scale activities, bringing penicillin, steel hoes, prefabricated hospitals, electric generators, school supplies, water pumps, surgical instruments, and fertilizer to the region. American experts also assisted in the construction of housing projects, the purchase of calico, the allocation of rice and blankets for northern war refugees, the reconstruction of roads, and the creation of technical schools. All in all, technical assistance programs employed approximately $26 million of what the program described as “economic weapons” throughout the region.106"
"47","These economic weapons signified a new method for combating Communist influence. In one instance, agricultural experts from the United States used technical assistance funding to reconstruct an irrigation canal that had been destroyed by Viet Minh troops. Program administrators explained that the irrigation project “had direct military importance”—it rebuilt Vietnamese infrastructure to potentially “hinder a Chinese Communist invasion.” In so doing, the project represented “one of many American aid projects designed to make an immediate impact on the people while making a permanent improvement in their economy.”107"
"48","Such technical assistance projects represented the ways in which policymakers intended to use Point Four for a variety of ends. The MSA's spurious self‐congratulatory pamphlets implied that their work was the essential basis for a larger and more‐abstract project of political self‐reliance. In their words, the MSA officials helped the Vietnamese become “capable of protecting [themselves] in the modern economic and political world.” Policymakers even identified the pineapple canning factory constructed in Formosa as an “answer to Communism,” which they celebrated in a pamphlet entitled “Fuel for the Good Dragon.”108 With the successes mounting in the eyes of policymakers, funding for technical assistance programs in Southeast Asia increased to over $166 million in FY 1952, with about half of that going to Formosa and the rest spread among Philippines, Indochina, Burma, Indonesia, and Thailand.         "
"49","Though U.S. officials praised Point Four's successes in a variety of internal publications, the program engendered criticism abroad. By 1952, military assistance supplemented technical assistance in Formosa, Indochina, Thailand, and the Philippines, which raised the ire of some in the participating nations.109 U.S. policymakers often employed extensive propaganda campaigns alongside technical assistance projects to ensure that the grandiose purposes of the United States would not be lost on their recipients. In Indochina, technical assistance officials used “twelve movie sound‐trucks,” driven by local farmers, to proclaim the benign intentions of the United States and avert potential criticisms. The program also distributed a myriad of anti‐Communist leaflets, which both denigrated Communist‐style planning and preached the gospel of self‐help capitalist development.110 The Griffin Mission's report also stressed that widespread distrust of U.S. motives existed in Indochina. Despite the numerous humanitarian overtures by U.S. officials, local governments viewed the United States as a proxy for their “colonial masters.”111 A similar question of local distrust underscored the Colombo Plan, in which representatives from Southeast and Southern Asian countries met with the United States and Great Britain in Ceylon to discuss ways to improve standards of living throughout the region.112 This indigenous skepticism of U.S. motives necessitated that officials include extensive education and propaganda programs with technical assistance projects abroad.         "
"50","Point Four's strict focus on technical assistance and foreign investment also elicited criticism. In a Washington Post editorial, Manabendra Nath Roy, a former Indian Communist, suggested that the bulk of capital investment should come from India's business community, not foreign investors. While Point Four could help construct some of the necessary infrastructure for economic development and growth in India, he noted that “it may appear to be a long‐term program; but any short‐term plan to help India with the hope of building a bulwark against communism will only defeat its end. Only a democracy built from the bottom up can defend itself.”113 Historian M. Srinivas Chary suggests that many top Indian officials suspected that the United States only initiated technical assistance programs to open the door to exploitative Western business interests.114 While India's desperate food shortage necessitated international aid, the Indian government continually sought to segregate the economic aspects of U.S. assistance programs from their political implications. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru welcomed U.S. technical assistance to alleviate mass starvation and extensive human suffering but rejected the U.S. desire to link free‐enterprise models of growth with regional political objectives.115"
"51","Additionally, despite frequent indigenous calls for U.S. support for industrialization, U.S. officials committed funding exclusively to relief and technical assistance projects.116 Ambassador Chester Bowles, who organized the earliest technical assistance–based Community Development Programs in rural India, advocated exclusively on behalf of the small‐scale technical assistance projects as the solution to India's economic underdevelopment.117 In general, too, the Point Four program lacked the financial and administrative resources to address all the challenges that development presented. U.S. officials also dismissed India's alternative development proposals that would compromise U.S. strategic objectives. By the early 1950s, the connection between technical assistance and strategic objectives was clear to both U.S. officials and the leaders of underdeveloped nations, with the latter often protesting the politicized relationship.         "
"52","In the early 1950s, State Department officials discussed consolidating foreign aid programs into a more cohesive administrative structure. The first move toward consolidation occurred in October 1951 when Congress passed the Mutual Security Act, which created the Mutual Security Agency (MSA) to coordinate the various assistance programs. In 1953, the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower transferred all State Department technical assistance and foreign aid programs to the new Foreign Operations Administrations (FOA). Although the programs initiated under Point Four remained intact, the use of the term “Point Four” became increasingly rare in 1953 and 1954 as a way to designate such technical assistance programs in what scholar Sergei Shenin has termed the “liquidation” of Point Four.118 In the summer of 1954, another Mutual Security Act effectively eliminated the FOA and abolished the existing statutes of the original Act of International Development. Nevertheless, the programs that had been created, implemented, and developed under Point Four remained operative under the new MSA.119 In 1955, the International Cooperation Administration (ICA) replaced all the functions of the former FOA and became a leading source for international development funding.120"
"53","Many historians view the transition from the TCA into the Mutual Security Agency as an effective end to the humanitarian impulse encapsulated in Point Four's lofty goals. Darlene Rivas regards the era during which Point Four fell under the supervision of the MSA and when Rockefeller left the IDAB in 1952 as an “unfortunate time.”121 Thomas Paterson suggests that Point Four “lost its identity” after the MSA transition.122 David Halloran Lumsdaine posits that the Eisenhower administration failed to nurture the development impulse that began with Point Four, and accordingly, that the creation of the Development Loan Fund in 1957 constituted “the first positive step toward aid made by the Eisenhower administration.”123"
"54","Yet such analyses elide two fundamental points. First, U.S. economic self‐interest and strategic objectives always underscored the humanitarian presentation of Point Four. Point Four was neither wholly idealistic nor humanitarian in its intent or application, as evinced in the program's implementation in places like Southeast Asia. Second, technical assistance programs, though no longer described in reference to “Point Four,” still existed. The administrative structure of Point Four changed, yet the ideology behind Point Four—the inchoate conception of international development through small‐scale technical assistance—continued to flourish in foreign policy circles in the 1950s. In some instances, however, countries receiving technical assistance protested the administrative conflation between economic development projects and military assistance. By the late 1950s, the Eisenhower administration moved away from small‐scale technical assistance, advocating instead more‐extensive government funding to economic development projects."
"55","The inclusion of military aid alongside technical assistance represented a major reconfiguration of development policy under the Eisenhower administration. Beginning in 1951, funding for Point Four came through the Mutual Security Agency, which also funded military assistance projects to underdeveloped nations. In FY 1953, the TCA received $140 million through the Mutual Security Act, ostensibly for technical assistance projects. Yet the symbolic presentation of technical assistance as part of the Mutual Security Program had significant ramifications. Furthermore, technical assistance did, in fact, become enmeshed with military assistance programs in some instances.124 In January 1953, the United States and Indonesia renegotiated an existing TCA deal that effectively ended all military aid. Indonesian leaders rejected the appearance of working for the “mutual security” of the United States and asserted their ideological non‐alignment by remaining free of any perceived military involvement with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Syria and Egypt demonstrated similar displeasure with America's military assistance programs and pulled out of existing Point Four agreements in late 1953.125 In each case, funding for technical assistance projects from the United States continued and increased, though the connection between technical assistance and military aid reinforced the strategic component of development programs.126"
"56","In the mid‐1950s, the Eisenhower administration reiterated its commitment to technical assistance programs as a means to combat global Communism. In September 1953, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles emphasized the administration's support for the activities of the Colombo Plan, and Eisenhower reconvened the IDAB.127 Dulles further advocated expanding economic aid programs in late 1955. He acknowledged that increased governmental funding created “greater resources and flexibility” to combat Soviet influence across the underdeveloped world. In waging this global Cold War, Dulles sought to expand technical assistance indefinitely to break free of the annual congressional constraints on project funding.128"
"57","Throughout Eisenhower's second term, technical assistance projects, generally under the aegis of the Mutual Security program, assumed a greater role in advancing U.S. strategic objectives. Employed in the intensifying conflict with the Soviet Union in the underdeveloped world, technical assistance became a fundamental means for differentiating the two competing ideologies. By the mid‐1950s, policymakers in Washington acknowledged that the Soviet Union offered an alternative methodology for development, one that preached the tenets of rapid industrialization, collectivization, state planning, command economy, and political affinity to the Soviet Union. Indeed, policymakers began to fear that the Soviet Union was outpacing the United States in promoting their methodology of development.129 Articulating this perception in early 1956, John Foster Dulles remarked that “now that evolution of the Soviet Union has made a considerable impression upon the neighboring countries of Asia…I believe that the United States ought to try to help in ways which will not merely relieve on a year‐to‐year basis but help to transform these economies into better‐integrated economies of the kind people aspire to.”130 In late 1955, the United States began transitioning aid in Vietnam to larger governmental grants and long‐term programs of assistance and growth.131 Likewise, aid to India increased in 1957 and 1958. With India's economy struggling, a State Department paper proclaimed that “no American wants to see the Communists take over India—if assistance given in time and in the right amount can substantially contribute to forestalling this, it would be a reasonable investment from the point of view of the national security of the United States.”132 Overall, Congress authorized 168.9 million dollars for technical assistance under the 1958 appropriations for the Mutual Security Program, the highest to date.133"
"58","As the desire for increased funding intensified, the United Nations and the World Bank played more‐crucial roles in the development of American technical assistance projects.134 Throughout the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration worked with the World Bank and UN, particularly with the United Nations Technical Assistance Program and the Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED), to supplement Export–Import Bank capital loans to nations receiving technical assistance. By the late 1950s, the UN's technical assistance programs offered around $100 million in funds annually.135 Though most development funding still came from private investors at the time, the creation of these multinational funds presaged an international shift toward governmental and supranational organizational funding for economic development projects.         "
"59","A series of crises in the underdeveloped world prompted the Eisenhower administration to expand its technical assistance funding. In the late 1950s, Communism spread in Southeast Asia threatening American strategic and economic interests. The Suez Crisis rattled Western Europe and the United States in 1956.136 Perhaps most significantly, African decolonization loomed.137 In 1957 and 1958, the Eisenhower administration received a series of academic reports that trumpeted the potential value of technical assistance, and, more broadly, development funding in the struggle against Communism in the underdeveloped world.138 Following these reports, and given the administration's growing use of technical assistance as a strategic tool, Eisenhower placed a new emphasis on U.S. government–based foreign assistance. In 1957, the administration created the Development Loan Fund, a domestic version of SUNFED, to furnish grants to private sectors of underdeveloped countries and to offer extensive low‐interest loans that could be repaid in local currencies.139 By July 1959, the Fund had made or approved 87 loans to underdeveloped nations totaling over $700 million.140 Leonard J. Saccio, director of the ICA, proclaimed in October 1959 that “regardless of what happens to the status and cost of defense programs, we are going to have greater, not less, need for those parts of the Mutual Security Program which are concerned with development rather than defense or disaster.”141 By the end of the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration had continued the small‐scale technical assistance projects first institutionalized under Point Four, but it committed government funding for such projects to an unprecedented extent.         "
"60","Technical assistance programs continued into the 1960s and underscored the creation and implementation of modernization theory. Historians of modernization theory have explored the ideological development of nation‐building policies, and often focus on how officials in the Kennedy administration applied their social science and economic theories of development to the multitude of Third World crises in the early 1960s.142 By analyzing programs such as the Alliance for Progress, Peace Corps, and Strategic Hamlet policy in Vietnam, these scholars examine how policymakers employed theories of economic development through a social scientific lens to transform societies and advance strategic objectives.143 Although these historians correctly point out that the intellectual framework for the modernization theories dated back to the 1940s and 1950s, rarely do they trace the policy history of development programs back to Point Four. For when the Kennedy administration expanded government aid to the underdeveloped world to an unprecedented magnitude and explicitly used international development policies to combat communism, the administration culminated, in many ways, a long process initially crystallized in Truman's inaugural address.144"
"61","Ideas often change as contexts change. Development thinking in Point Four stressed small‐scale transfers of technology and education programs to enhance standards of living as a means to drive national economic growth, which would benefit the strategic interests of the United States. Throughout the 1950s, however, policymakers became more amenable to the idea that technical assistance programs could advance broader economic and geopolitical interests. By the Kennedy years, modernization theorists envisioned development as a more holistic process affecting societies and individuals on psychological and cultural levels. The Kennedy and Johnson administration offered extensive government funding to large‐scale development projects, infused with social science theories, which expanded Point Four's view of development as an economic tool for strategic ends by emphasizing social and cultural change. These projects were markedly different from Point Four, which sought minimal U.S. financial involvement."
"62","Though smaller in scope, funding, and design than modernization programs, Point Four was an important precedent because it incorporated an emerging liberal vision for global modernization into the U.S. foreign policy apparatus, one which defined underdevelopment in legible economic and political terms. Indeed, scholars such as Gilbert Rist and Arturo Escobar have argued that Point Four established important discursive precedents, such as the use of the phrase “underdeveloped,” to describe and define entire societies that would appear in later modernization programs.145 This definition, in turn, suggested that the indicators of global underdevelopment—levels of food production, standards of living, national economic production—could be redressed through U.S. technical assistance. This basic premise of the efficacy of U.S. development programs underlined the larger‐scale modernization policies of the 1960s.         "
"63","Historians of modernization theory have recently critiqued the intent and application of international development policy. In general, these scholars argue that modernization theorists paid little attention to specific historical conditions or cultural features, ignored local perspectives, and frequently politicized development when implementing policy.146 Modernization theorists viewed underdeveloped nations as malleable entities and imposed a singular definition of development that reflected both American values and interests. Moreover, historians have argued that modernization resonated with a particular national narrative that extolled the virtues of American liberalism. Accordingly, international development policies became intertwined with the ongoing process of national self‐identification.147"
"64","These criticisms could also extend to Point Four. Point Four officials continually focused their efforts on small‐scale technical assistance, which had neither the financial nor administrative capabilities to meet the indigenous demands or the extensive challenges of international development. Similarly, too, both Point Four and later modernization policies linked national economic and political development with individual self‐improvement, viewing social development through the lens of technological capacity and technical prowess. Point Four officials believed that the economic and technological strength of the United States could replicate successful domestic programs like the TVA elsewhere, regardless of cultural or historical contexts. By projecting a policy of international development based upon ideological assumptions of democracy, capitalism, and progress, Point Four advocated a set of liberal values that ensured that international development would reflect the fundamental premises of American society. In Point Four and modernization theory alike, U.S. policymakers linked their visions of national values to the pursuit of international objectives. Thus, for all the immediate and local successes that Point Four officials celebrated, the program's legacy is inextricably bound to the extent to which this conflation of American values and interests could appropriately address all the challenges of global development."
