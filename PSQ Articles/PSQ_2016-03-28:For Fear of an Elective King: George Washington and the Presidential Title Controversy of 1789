"1","Historians have long understood that the “title controversy” in the early Republic—the debate over what to call the president in the new government established by the U.S. Constitution—was not as frivolous as it sounds to us now, but Kathleen Bartoloni‐Tuazon, in For Fear of an Elective King: George Washington and the Presidential Title Controversy of 1789, offers such an impressive analysis of high politics and political theory and sets up so effectively the social and cultural landscape within which the conversation unfolded that everyone interested in the early Republic, broadly defined, should read it.         "
"2","The Constitution declares that “no Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States” and offers no suggestions for what to call the powerful new chief executive it created. Americans—especially those identified with opposition to the Constitution—worried a great deal about the fate of liberty under a president who possessed what “Cato” described as the “powers of a monarch” and who would live in a kind of “court” whose “language and manners” would “distinguish” it “from the rest of the community.” But, as Bartoloni‐Tuazon is at pains to note in her fascinating prehistory of the controversy, Americans were already quite used to status differentiations because titles distinguishing military rank, occupational status, and political office had long been “entrenched in the American experience” (p. 13). Even during the Revolution, Americans embraced the use of titles such as “Excellency” for governors of the new states because they did not want their governors to be any “less honored in a republican state than in a royal colony” (p. 18)."
"3","George Washington, as commander of the Continental Army, was called “His Excellency” precisely because Americans wanted him to be “on equal terms with his opponents” (p. 17). After the Revolution, as Gordon Wood and others have argued, Americans became less and less comfortable with distinctions of all sorts, but many hoped that the newly established government(s) would command respect at home and abroad. Contemporary Americans, then—not only historians—realized that arguments about titles in a republican society really were less about etiquette than about popular sovereignty (the relationship between government and people, or rulers and the ruled), about federalism (the relations between the states and the new national government), and about the status of the United States in a world of states."
"4","All of this was complicated in many ways (and simplified in others) by George Washington, whose trustworthiness with power helped make the new government (and its powerful executive) thinkable but whose very popularity, and the veneration he inspired (celebrations of his birthday replaced royal holidays during the Revolution), threatened to turn the presidency into a monarchy with all of the attendant (potential) threats to popular liberty that implied. The question of what to call the president was unavoidably wrapped up in this paradox surrounding Washington himself, but it was also animated by two competing conceptions of republican leadership and two competing fears about threats to it. The straightforward anxiety was that a powerful chief executive might threaten republican liberty, just as George III had done during the Revolutionary War years. The more complicated (then and now) concern was that a weak executive might be easily corrupted by the interested few, with oligarchy the result. Bartoloni‐Tuazon argues—compellingly—that division over this question did not fall out along simple Federalist/Anti‐Federalist lines but linked those partisans in new ways (John Adams's main ally in his quest for an elaborate and elevated title was Richard Henry Lee, who feared aristocratic corruption at least as much as Adams).         "
"5","As Bartoloni‐Tuazon points out, historians have largely relied on—and stopped at—William McClay's delightfully curmudgeonly (private) journal for the lively discussion in the Senate, where John Adams proposed and defended the use of several possible titles of address (including “Elected Majesty,” “Most Serene Highness,” and “HIS HIGHNESS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND PROTECTOR OF THEIR LIBERTIES”). But she convincingly notes that McClay himself was a partisan in the controversy and that exclusive focus on his view (which ultimately prevailed) makes it more difficult to appreciate the seriousness of—and the republican sensibility that animated—Adams's position. Adams's own theory has been effectively elucidated by James Hutson and Richard Alan Ryerson, and this book is no replacement for understanding Adams's views. But Bartoloni‐Tuazon goes well beyond Adams, explicating the debates in the House and then the broader public discussion in newspapers and private letters that followed. Ultimately, the public agreed with George Washington (and James Madison) that a simple and austere (and modest) title for the executive would augment the power of the presidency without threatening its commitment to republicanism or its link with popular sovereignty."
"6","Washington, who clearly distanced himself from the clamor for exalted titles precisely because he paid attention to public opinion and respected the egalitarian ideals of the era (p. 153), ultimately benefited from the controversy, while Adams—despite his honest concern for the Republic—became ever more associated in the public mind with monarchy. Washington gradually disassociated himself from Adams, which likely shaped the future of the vice presidency, while the rejection of an elaborate title, ironically, Bartoloni‐Tuazon suggests, lent precisely the kind of energy to the executive that Adams had encouraged, not because it sported an elaborate (and in this case superfluous) title but because it was supported by and attentive to public will. All of this, she suggests, led to “a conception of American democratic leadership that found no contradiction between democracy and strong executive authority” (p. 165). So in a way, the resolution of the controversy in a “republican” manner (and certainly the character of Washington himself) made the presidency itself possible, safe for the Republic. In a further irony, the solution, which lent the latent power of the executive the public imprimatur, also made possible what later generations would call the “imperial presidency,” with all its attendant anxieties about the relationship between necessary energy in the executive and popular sovereignty that animated the original conversation."
