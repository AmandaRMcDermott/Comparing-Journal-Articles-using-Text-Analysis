"1","More than 40 years ago, George Reedy, a veteran reporter and former Lyndon B. Johnson press secretary, argued in The Twilight of the Presidency that the growing power and isolation of the modern presidency had rendered presidents deaf to any sources of public opinion beyond the White House and, as a result, had made it impossible for them to govern effectively or democratically.         "
"2","Kenneth Walsh, a longtime White House correspondent, readily acknowledges that the White House can be, in Harry Truman's words, a “nice prison” (p. 97) and is aware of the dangers of presidential isolation. In fact, he argues that the isolation has only gotten worse over the last four decades. Unlike Reedy, however, Walsh contends that some “prisoners of the White House” have managed to scale the White House walls and stay connected to the people."
"3","Walsh identifies “four fundamental ways in which today's presidents keep in touch” (p. 12)—intuition, polls, the press, and Congress—and then evaluates various presidents from Franklin Roosevelt through Barack Obama based on their success in using these tools to break out of the White House prison. According to Walsh, four modern presidents, Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bush I, “lost the people”; five, FDR, Truman, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Obama, “stayed connected”; and two, John F. Kennedy and Bush II, were “defiant princes” who governed by their own lights more than did other modern presidents (JFK to his benefit, Bush II to his detriment)."
"4","At first glance, it seems that public opinion polling holds the key to escape. Walsh devotes far more time to polls than any of the other tools he identifies for overcoming presidential isolation. The four presidents who “lost the people” either failed to heed the polls or misused polls and, as a result, pursued unpopular policies and suffered failed presidencies. His overriding focus on polling, which includes a chapter on presidential pollsters, who he calls “some of the most interesting characters to ever work in government” (p. 167), suggests that a modern president's success or failure is largely predicated on his use of polls."
"5","Unfortunately, Walsh sheds little new light on presidential polling. He relies on only a handful of secondary sources that he quotes from far too much, to tell his story and offers very little of his own analysis. He does include interviews that he conducted with presidential pollsters and cites some confidential memos. But Walsh does not do much with these. For instance, he quotes at length from a memo Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg wrote in May of 1994 (pp. 197–198) warning of the likelihood of a Republican landslide that November without explaining whether or how the memo influenced White House strategy. Despite his fascination with polling, Walsh does not really offer much insight on how presidents have or should use polls beyond warning them to “make use of the pollsters, but don't overdo it” (p. 205)."
"6","In the end, Walsh believes it is a president's instincts, his capacity to read public opinion and relate to average Americans, that enable him to break out of the White House prison. Some presidents have this ability, some do not. For Walsh, Truman won reelection in 1948 because he ignored the polls and connected with the “common man.” “His experience,” writes Walsh, “illustrates a major premise of this book—that the intuition and background a president brings to the White House can be more important than all the pollsters, focus groups, advisors, and constituent letters in the world” (p. 100). Prisoners of the White House, however, provides few clues about how presidents actually use their instincts, polls, and other tools to connect with the American people and lead public opinion.
