"1","Modern theories of congressional elections owe themselves largely to the work of political scientists who have empirically tested data collected from the “candidate‐centered” era of the post‐World War II period. Researchers have constructed and designed these theories specifically to explain elections in the modern era. Yet, Jamie L. Carson and Jason M. Roberts, in their book, Ambition, Competition, and Electoral Reform, upend the prevailing wisdom that these theories are inapplicable to the pre‐modern “party‐centered” era of congressional elections, and demonstrate that “modern theories of congressional elections” are “equally relevant across a longer time span” (p. 7).         "
"2","Specifically, Carson and Roberts devote considerable attention to assessing Gary Jacobson and Samuel Kernell's Strategic Politicians Theory, ultimately finding that it offers significant explanatory power for U.S. House election outcomes from the party‐centered era. This finding comes as a surprise, given that previous works of the party‐centered era have not emphasized candidate‐specific factors as a cause in affecting congressional election results. As Carson and Roberts summarize, “Most accounts emphasize the fraud and corruption present across this period and reiterate that voters behaved as automatons, responding almost entirely to the interests of the party organizations who wielded nearly absolute control over the electoral machinery” (pp. 8–9). As a result, the authors add, “Most of the literature on the post‐World War II era asserts, at least implicitly, that modern patterns do not fit elections in earlier decades” (p. 85)."
"3","The problem with these previous reports of the party‐centered era, according to Carson and Roberts, is that they lack empirical confirmation. The authors address this issue by constructing a comprehensive data set of district‐level congressional results and candidate identification information going back to the year 1872. Using a variety of different sources and archival research, Carson and Roberts collect data on the previous political experience of each candidate. Consistent with the approach of Jacobson and Kernell, the authors distinguish between “quality” candidates (that is, those who have previously held elective office) and non‐quality candidates, allowing them to test systematically the Strategic Politicians Theory for elections predating the post‐World War II era."
"4","Carson and Roberts ultimately find that political experience matters. Candidates who had previous electoral experience had a much higher chance of winning than those who had never previously held office. This result comes as no shock for elections in the candidate‐centered era, but it is noteworthy for the pre‐World War II era. Moreover, the size of the effects is considerable. As the authors observe, “On average, the party holding the advantage in candidate quality can expect to receive a 4.64 percent boost in their two‐party vote. Given that close to 30 percent of the elections in our historical elections data set were decided by less than 4.5 percent of the vote, candidate quality appears to be an important factor driving election results in this era” (p. 101)."
"5","Carson and Roberts offer another very significant set of results. They also find that two major election reforms from the pre‐modern era, the direct primary and the Australian ballot (with some caveats related to whether the ballot was in an office bloc or party column form), affected quality candidate emergence and competition. For instance, they report that the probability of a quality candidate emerging to run against an incumbent in the era before the direct primary was higher than after it (see chapter 5). They explain this by noting that in the pre‐modern era, the party could persuade an experienced candidate to run for office by offering a fallback job or future nomination. This, in turn, reduced the risks for a candidate in seeking higher office. When parties lost their ability to offer these incentives due to ballot reform and the direct primary, the authors conclude, “This set the stage for the widespread growth in the incumbency advantage, a decrease in electoral competition for the U.S. House, and expanded careerism in the House of Representatives” (p. 95). On the basis of these results, the authors reach a logical conclusion that “reformers concerned with high incumbent reelection rates should consider advocating reforms that would provide incentives for more high quality candidates to emerge” (p. 138)."
"6","These are obviously weighty findings with significant implications for our understanding of the development of congressional elections. Only truly exceptional works force scholars to re‐consider long‐held assumptions. Carson and Roberts have achieved this in Ambition, Competition, and Electoral Reform. The data they have amassed and the quality of their empirical analysis make this book destined to be widely cited and discussed by political scientists who study congressional elections.         "
