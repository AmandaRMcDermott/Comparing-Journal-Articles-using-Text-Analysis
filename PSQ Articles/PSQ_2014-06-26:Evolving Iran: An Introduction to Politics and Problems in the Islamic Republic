"1","This book is a timely volume on the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian revolution. The author tries to articulate the enigma of counter‐secular forces that in an instant catapulted Ayatollah Khomeini and his followers to power less than a year after February 1979. Moreover, hostage taking at the U.S. embassy (November 1979) and the Iraqi invasion under Saddam Hussein (September 1980) are among the two pivotal and entwined, if implicit, reasons that nailed the lid on the coffin of all political opposition. As stated by the author, “This book seeks to explain the creation and development of the theocracy in Iran” (p. 11)."
"2","This volume, however, presents a level‐headed picture of today's Iran beyond prevalent clichés in the American press and think‐tank/lobbyists in Washington. The original cause of the February 1979 insurrection is somewhat decoded in the early chapters. The author alludes to the enduring effects of the 1953 Central Intelligence Agency coup d'état that overthrew the elected government of Mohammad Mossadegh and brought the Shah back. Barbara Ann Rieffer‐Flanagan is explicit on what is known as the “capitulation”—the long‐anticipated tip of colonialism/neocolonialism through the Constitutional Revolution (1906–1911), and once again revisited head‐on during the nationalization of oil under Mohammad Mossadegh (1951–1953) in Iran. We read: “The shah in 1964 also pushed revision to a bill—the American‐Iranian Status of Forces Agreement—through [the Iranian] Parliament that expanded the number of American personnel [that were] immune from [domestic] prosecution …” (pp. 27–28, emphasis added). The author adds: “[Such] resentment was further fueled by Ayatollah Khomeini” (p. 28).         "
"3","From deeper undercurrents of the Iranian politics, however, Khomeini's animosity toward the Constitutional Revolution needs further inspection. Objecting to the Shah's advocacy of the capitulation in Iran appears to be lip‐service if one investigates that Khomeini (among a tiny clerical minority) had always been on the side of mashrou'eh—as opposed to masshrouteh (supported by the majority of ulama')—and he detested the constitutionalists all his life. This is precisely the key to unraveling the “original sin,”—the kernel of conflict between Khomeini and the sizeable political opposition of the time.         "
"4","Another point is the false impression that Mohammad Reza Shah challenged “the role of Islam in society” (p. 37), a sweeping statement that betrays a fact about the ease of access to political space (that is, the mosque, Hosseinieh, etc.) by the Islamists (minus Mojadedin‐e Khalgh), and the unmitigated restriction of all secular forces, leftist or nationalist alike, in the 1970 s. The Shah's (and the U.S.'s) anti‐leftist/anti‐nationalist posture had created a zero‐sum game in the internal politics of Iran, a horrific game that finally gobbled him up for good."
"5","Yet, we ought to be fair to this observant author and this important and timely book. Rieffer‐Flanagan is informing us about the issues that matter, both in contemporary Iranian politics and international relations. We read:            "
"6","When examining Iranian foreign policy during the last few decades, scholars have seen Tehran pursue realism in its foreign policy. Although we have heard much religious rhetoric emanating from Friday prayers … Iranian leaders … have been guided by realpolitik. … Even Tehran's pursuit of nuclear energy, and [the] possibility of nuclear weapons, can be viewed in terms of the state's national interest. Some in Iran believe that nuclear weapons would ensure the survival of the regime because the United States would not invade a nuclear‐armed Iran as it invaded Iraq and Afghanistan (p. 169, emphasis added).               "
"7","The critical quandary about U.S.–Iran relations is not that Iran is being perceived as an adversary of the United States. It is not even that Iran is enriching uranium, and that such enrichment might some day lead to an actual production of a nuclear arsenal. What is at stake here is the epochal change and truth about the irreversibility of the now‐defunct Pax Americana (1945–1979) when it comes to U.S.–Iran relations. This book should be of interest to those who also wish to reexamine the United States in the mirror of change, wondering (and pondering) how much was misplaced between the two countries in these lost decades."
