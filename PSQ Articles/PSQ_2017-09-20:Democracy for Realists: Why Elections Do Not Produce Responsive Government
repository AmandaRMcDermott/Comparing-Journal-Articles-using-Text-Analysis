"1","Scholars who study American elections tend to divide into two camps. One, to which this reviewer belongs, sifts for evidence of intelligence and rationality in the aggregate decisions of voters. With Democracy for Realists, Christopher H. Achen and Larry M. Bartels place themselves decidedly in the opposite camp. They see an electorate that is unprepared for its job in a democracy.         "
"2","Achen and Bartels dismiss the “folk theory” of democracy, the idea that voters know best and elect officials who follow their will. Rather, they depict ordinary people as having little interest or competence regarding politics, a subject that is too complicated even for the best of us. When Achen and Bartels's citizens are stirred to act politically, such as when they feel obliged to cast votes, they consult their emotions more than facts and reason. What keeps them from becoming totally unmoored politically is their group allegiances based on social identity."
"3","Several chapters delve into the public's haplessness when it comes to retrospective voting, whether concerning the economy or disasters such as shark attacks. Their centerpiece example is about how angry voters in New Jersey shoreline counties punished the Woodrow Wilson administration in 1916 for not preventing the many shark attacks off the New Jersey coast that summer. Achen and Bartels mount a general argument that that when voters try to evaluate government performance, they largely fail to behave rationally."
"4","Achen and Bartels see electoral trends largely as a response to social identity. Partisanship provides one guidepost. They present instances in which, when partisanship and policy views misalign, voters change their issue positions to accommodate their party identifications. “It only feels like thinking.” And when partisanship undergoes massive change in the aggregate? That is voters following partisan cues from their group leaders. Perhaps their boldest claim is to deny race or policy as main motivators for white Southerners’ massive switch to the GOP. Instead, it was a simple identification as Southerners. They were just following their elite leaders."
"5","An obvious question arises. Does this book help make sense of Donald Trump's ascendance to the presidency? Both yes and no. On the one hand, analyses of 2016 voters will undoubtedly reveal instances of uninformed voters voting badly, just as the book would predict. It might just be that late decisions by ignorant and confused voters put Trump over the top. On the other hand, Democracy for Realists has virtually nothing to say about the growing ideological polarization that fueled the chaos of the 2016 campaign. It even dismisses the presence of much ideological thinking among the public. Achen and Bartels's voters are akin to the quiescent electorate described in the literature from the 1940s and 1950s.         "
"6","Democracy for Realists is densely packed with supportive examples and statistics. It is well written with a persistently scholarly tone and far more nuance than can be portrayed here. Yet it is bound to (and perhaps intended to) draw controversy. Critics who are persuaded of rationality within electoral politics will see it as telling only one side of the story.         "
"7","If Achen and Bartels's portrayal is essentially correct, what is to be done? On this question, their analysis is thoughtful but largely barren of optimism. Their most hopeful claim is that at least we have a rotation of competing elites. Achen and Bartels are not quite willing to acknowledge that voters can competently decide when to replace one set of elites with another. But they note that the party in power is held in check by the realization that eventually, perhaps due to random events, electoral change will put it in the minority. Take comfort from that."
