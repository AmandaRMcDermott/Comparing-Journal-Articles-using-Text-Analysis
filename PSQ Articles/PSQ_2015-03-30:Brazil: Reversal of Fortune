"1","Despite recent problems of economic stagnation and social unrest, Brazil, in the last 20 years, has undergone a striking reversal of fortune. Policymaking institutions have improved, and better economic and social policies have resulted, leading to sustained low inflation, a long economic boom, and significant reductions in Brazil's notoriously high levels of poverty and inequality. These advances in governability and policy quality confounded the pessimistic predictions that dominated analyses of Brazil during the country's first decade of democracy (1985–1995). Yet they have also generated a degree of optimism about Brazil's economic and political future that probably is not warranted. Precisely how—and how much—has Brazil changed for the better since the early 1990s? Can we find a reasonable middle ground between the excessive pessimism of early analyses and the excessive optimism of more recent ones? For a reader interested in these questions, there are few better places to look than Alfred P. Montero's clear, wide‐ranging, and consistently interesting new book."
"2","Montero identifies three dimensions of possible turnaround: governability, the quality of policy, and the quality of democracy. The most significant turnarounds, Montero argues, have come in the first two areas. First, Brazilian governability notably improved after the breakdown of presidential–legislative relations under President Fernando Collor de Mello, who was impeached in 1992. Following the precedent set by Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994–2002), all Brazilian presidents since have made it a fundamental priority to forge multiparty governing coalitions. This unwritten rule of contemporary Brazilian politics, known as “coalitional presidentialism,” has stabilized presidential–legislative relations, and as a result, the country has become more governable. Partly because of this improved governability, Brazilian policy outcomes have also improved. Over the last 20 years, Brazil's democratic governments have produced smart and innovative economic and social policies, including Cardoso's foundational Real Plan, which has kept inflation down for decades, new industrial policies associated with the National Development Bank, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's highly successful Family Grant (Bolsa Família), the largest conditional cash transfer program in the world. Montero cautions that these improvements in governability and policy quality should not be overstated. Patronage remains the dominant currency of Brazilian politics (underwriting coalitional presidentialism), and the Brazilian economy remains inefficient in numerous respects. Still, the overall turnaround in governability and policy quality is unmistakable, and this turnaround, Montero judges, is clearly a product of the strategic choices made by Cardoso and his successor Da Silva (2002–2010).         "
"3","It is a positive sign that, in recent years, scholars have stopped asking whether Brazil can function democratically and instead have turned their attention to the issue of democratic quality—the last of Montero's three dimensions. Have Brazilian elites become more accountable and responsive to citizens? Has voting become an effective tool for public oversight of the political class? Unfortunately, the answer is mixed instead of resoundingly affirmative. According to Montero, Brazil, in the area of democratic quality, has made marginal progress but not yet experienced a turnaround. In particular, despite the strengthening and proliferation of watchdog organizations in both government and civil society, other, more persistent aspects of Brazilian democracy—corruption, pro‐incumbent bias, and endemic patronage and clientelism—continue to limit elites' responsiveness to voters' policy."
"4","Montero describes and analyzes the foregoing shifts (and continuities) with clarity, thoroughness, and methodological sophistication. The result is one of the best books currently available on the evolving politics and political economy of Brazil's now 30‐year‐old democracy."
