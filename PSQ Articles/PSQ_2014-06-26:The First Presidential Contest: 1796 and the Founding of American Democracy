"1","The presidential election of 1796, memorialized in history tomes for the bitter divisions the campaign mirrored among citizens in the fledgling Republic, receives innovative and refreshing analytical consideration in this eminently readable and clever account of the Adams–Jefferson contest. Jeffrey L. Pasley's major contribution is to the notion of party development in the late eighteenth century. Challenging the conventional wisdom in the dominant political science literature, the author contends that the election of 1796 has been largely overlooked in contemporary scholarship, due to the lack of institutionalized parties, which is, in his view, a problematic definition even in the contemporary era. For Pasley, “The first contested presidential election came about as a result of popular politics, broadly conceived, even if parties and elections themselves were not highly participatory” (p. 14). Eschewing the notion that political parties are simply “devices for collecting votes” (p. 5), the author invites us to look beyond formal political party structures as well as a traditional focus on elite personalities and the candidates themselves (who did not campaign, given the custom of the day) and embrace the cultural, ideological, and symbolic features that the dynamics of the 1796 campaign represented at other levels of society."
"2","Pasley posits that “Partisanship not only can be but may be most effectively expressed in terms of metaphors and morality tales rather than platforms and arguments” (p. 12). One of the major strengths of the book is the author's meticulous research drawn from a host of primary resources of lesser‐known figures on each side of the Adams–Jefferson electoral duel, as well as from local newspaper accounts of the contest from North to South and state by state. The payoff is an exceptionally rich and penetrating account of the imagery and mythology employed by supporters of each of the campaigns, often to vilify the other. The cleavages are, of course, familiar to readers with an interest in the founding and the early Republic—anglophiles vs. francophiles, the Jay Treaty, recriminations of monarchism and Jacobinism, and the personal invectives leveled at both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.         "
"3","What readers will appreciate throughout the substantive chapters is the thoughtful and judicious récit of the political philosophies of Adams and Jefferson, including their writings on governance and how their understandings of the political world—influenced as they were by the colonial experience, revolutions on either side of the Atlantic, and their outlook on the democratic and economic evolution of the American Republic—were framed by their supporters. Chapter 6 (“The First Culture War: Themes and Issues of the Federalist Campaign Against Thomas Jefferson”) and chapter 7 (“His Rotundity: Themes and Issues of the Democratic Republican Campaign Against John Adams”) provide a particularly captivating account of the nation's first encounter with negative campaigning, the politics of “messaging,” and ample foreign intrigue in the age of the printed press."
"4","If there is a shortcoming to Pasley's analysis, it is that political scientists—more so perhaps than historians—will find the conclusions less satisfying in terms of the book's theoretical purchase. There is no attempt in the insouciantly titled epilogue (“Kiss My A** and Go to Hell!”) to tie the threads of the analysis into a larger theoretical structure to guide future research. Can a focus on the fabrication of powerful imagery rooted in cultural metaphors be extended to other elections in the early Republic and beyond, or was 1796 simply a unique “outlier” in this regard? Thinking through a systematic application of Pasley's call to reconceptualize the meaning and operationalization of partisanship across time should spark lively debate."
