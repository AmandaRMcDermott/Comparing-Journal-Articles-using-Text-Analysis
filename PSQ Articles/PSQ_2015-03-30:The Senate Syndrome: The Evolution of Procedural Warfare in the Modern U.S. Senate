"1","The evolution of the U.S. Senate into its current form as a supermajoritarian institution is one of the most important developments in the political history of the United States. This book is an indispensable chronicle of the events over the past half century that have led to the current state of the institution, a state that is markedly different from the way the chamber operated during most of its history."
"2","The syndrome referenced in the title of the book is a fairly recent change in the behavior of senators whereby both the majority and minority parties exploit their procedural prerogatives to the fullest for political gain. This is a momentous change for an institution long characterized by a collegial environment in which compromise was prevalent and senators practiced remarkable restraint in limiting their use of the extraordinary parliamentary rights granted to them. As minorities have expanded the use of parliamentary obstruction (generically labeled “filibustering”), especially with respect to the range of Senate business in which obstruction is employed, majorities and their leaders have responded by limiting minority participation in Senate business. Senate majority leaders have come to rely much more heavily on the cloture procedure (which is used to end filibusters) to move legislation and nominations forward, as well as parliamentary tactics that restrict the amending activity of minorities. This tit‐for‐tat pattern is part of the syndrome that has led to the increasing erosion of collegiality and willingness to compromise, which recursively drives the scorched‐earth procedural warfare that has become a central feature of the contemporary Senate."
"3","The book does an excellent job of carefully walking readers through the esoterica of Senate procedure, making recent important parliamentary battles both accessible and engaging. A key focus is the Democratic majority's use of “reform‐by‐ruling” to reduce the cloture threshold on nominations to the executive branch and to judicial positions (below the Supreme Court) from a three‐fifths supermajority to a simple majority, effectively ending supermajority rule in the confirmation process. As the book argues, the significance of this action cannot be understated. For the first time in the Senate's history, a majority used a parliamentary maneuver, colloquially known as the “nuclear option,” to directly change the supermajority requirements embedded in the standing rules of the institution. Even though Senate rules require a two‐thirds majority to invoke cloture on a proposal to change the chamber's standing rules, which translates into a requirement of two‐thirds support for a rules change, a narrow majority of senators ignored “the plain text of a standing rule” and “changed the effective rule by merely declaring it to be something else” (p. 265). This move has far‐reaching consequences not just for the Senate but also for our general understanding of the role that institutions play in promoting political stability. The book provides a comprehensive narrative of how the Senate got to this point, including discussion of original, systematic empirical work on beliefs and attitudes about the supermajoritarian Senate expressed by the media and the general public."
"4","The book falters somewhat in its treatment of different schools of thought concerning the extent to which Senate majorities have chosen to accept supermajoritarian rule versus being hamstrung by past decisions on parliamentary procedure. The discussion lacks depth and is inaccurate in its characterization of the perspective that threats to use reform‐by‐ruling served to keep minority obstruction in check throughout most of the Senate's history. That said, this book is required reading for those who wish to have a better grasp on developments that profoundly affect the nature and process of American politics."
