"1","Regardless of whether it occurs in a cooperative or a coercive setting, verifying that a state has actually abandoned a chemical, biological, or nuclear arsenal is politically vexing and technically challenging. Verifying compliance is ultimately a political judgment; questions will always remain about the nature and number of weapons produced and destroyed and the latent capabilities that remain. Existing methodologies and technologies used to monitor disarmament are limited in their scope and accuracy. They can also introduce externalities. Transparency concerning the verification technologies employed can facilitate cheating by identifying successful denial and deception strategies, while verification data can reveal design, operational, and manufacturing details of weapons systems, information that itself can facilitate proliferation. Despite the fact that many disarmament advocates treat verification regimes as a lesser‐included problem in the general quest to roll‐back the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), there are no easy solutions to this auditing nightmare."
"2","In this well‐researched and balanced assessment of the recent history and contemporary challenges related to monitoring WMD disarmament, Nathan E. Busch and Joseph F. Pilat document the achievements and shortcomings of efforts to monitor WMD elimination and how these techniques might be applied to nuclear disarmament in general and the hard cases (Syria, Iran, North Korea) in particular."
"3","Their narrative presents some surprising results. For instance, South Africa's decision to abandon its nuclear arsenal, which is depicted as a success story by disarmament advocates, is problematic in their view. Although the South Africans apparently eliminated their WMD capability, they not only failed to document the destruction of their arsenal with an eye toward auditability, but also they destroyed much of the documentation related to the program along with the weapons themselves. In terms of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, decades of verification efforts that continued even after his elimination left not only a host of unanswered questions but also the occasional cache of rusting chemical weapons. In Busch and Pilat's view, Iraq's WMD programs were in a sort of “stand‐by” mode when the United States invaded, and it is uncertain whether hazardous materials or weapons remain somewhere in the country."
"4","Even more disconcerting is a compliance paradox identified by Busch and Pilat: when a state readily and openly engages in disarmament, verification can become lackadaisical. Cooperation, albeit real or feigned, lowers both the political motivation and justification for stringency. Despite initial optimism concerning Libya, for example, remnants of its chemical arsenal were uncovered after Muammar el‐Qaddafi was swept away by an insurrection."
"5","The Politics of Weapons Inspection suggests that complete disarmament verification might prove to be a mirage that will ultimately be beyond the reach of even the best‐laid plans and most advanced technologies. The source of this conundrum is found in the weapons programs themselves, which were never created with disarmament in mind. For the most part, the documentation needed to account for what was produced, tested, stored, and discarded does not exist and even advanced states tend to lose track of materials over time. Even when governments decide to eliminate weapons and facilities, it is not surprising that weapons, materials or associated systems might be uncovered in some long‐forgotten bunker or building. Busch and Pilat interpret these discoveries as evidence of deliberate efforts to deceive, but they could conceivably reflect a general lack of situational awareness of the governments involved. Complete and verifiable disarmament might demand a level of accountability that exceeds organizational and governmental capabilities. Although no records exist of the presence or use of chemical munitions on the firing ranges of Fort Ord, California, kits to test for the presence of chemical weapons were found buried on the grounds. Can anyone guarantee that something else was not buried, long forgotten, nearby?         "
