"1","Chase Untermeyer has already made a name for himself as a bureaucratic diarist of the Ronald Reagan era. His When Things Went Right ably recounts the first two years of the Reagan presidency, when Untermeyer served as executive assistant to Vice President George H.W. Bush. His new book, Inside Reagan's Navy, serves as that work's successful sequel. Inside Reagan's Navy follows Untermeyer's stint at the Department of the Navy, first as assistant secretary of the navy for installations and facilities, then later as assistant secretary of the navy for manpower and reserve affairs. From this unique vantage point, Untermeyer witnessed the changing politico‐military structure of the last days of the Cold War and the formal ascension of American hegemony. During Untermeyer's time as assistant secretary, the U.S. Navy not only engaged threats in Libya and the Middle East but also made major strides toward its stated goal of a 600‐ship fleet. Inside Reagan's Navy provides a nearly day‐by‐day account of this transformative period.         "
"2","As in his previous work, Untermeyer constructs his narrative such that it reflects its original diary format. As a result, treatments of major political incidents show up almost in passing; the bombing of Libya appears in a footnote, and the reaction to the attack on the USS Stark by Iraq revolves around internal discussions stretched out over only three pages. Conversations with the Bush family, particularly a striking exchange with Barbara at a Frank Sinatra performance, do take center stage, however, and regularly populate the narrative. Inside Reagan's Navy relies heavily on personal anecdotes and character studies to examine the internal dynamics of the Department of the Navy and the executive branch.         "
"3","The strength of the work lies in its discussion of politics and its depiction of Pentagon infighting. Untermeyer gives possibly the most intimate portraits of the two successive secretaries of the navy whom he worked for: John Lehman and Jim Webb. Both secretaries, incredibly important in terms of understanding the fights over budget and oversight, play prominent roles in the work's narrative. Untermeyer clearly idolizes Lehman, fully explaining his admiration for him in the book's introduction. This in no way indicates that he does not look up to Webb. Untermeyer revels in his pugnacious attitude, although he finally questions his intent to resign rather than agree to decrease the size of the navy. Future scholars of either the department or the modern secretariat would be well served to analyze Untermeyer's characterization of the role played by these two men during the 1980s."
"4","He does concede that the current work represents a more stringent selection process than his previous one, freely admitting to leaving a more robust discussion of his work in reforming the Naval Academy and ship procurement on the cutting room floor. The absence of such episodes does not harm the narrative, but it does leave one to wonder what else might have been left out. While the work does feel like an accurate account of events, it comes across more as a study of leadership and personal interactions than a true assessment of “Reagan's navy.” As noted earlier, this does not represent a critical flaw; scholars simply should be aware that Inside Reagan's Navy provides more contextualization than articulation of the era and policies then being enacted. With successive jobs in the first Bush White house following his time at the Department of the Navy, we can expect that Untermeyer will follow up this work with another clearheaded, day‐by‐day account.
