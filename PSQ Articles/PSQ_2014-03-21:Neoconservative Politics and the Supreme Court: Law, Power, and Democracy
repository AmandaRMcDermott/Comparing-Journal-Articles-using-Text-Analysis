"1","In this concise and clearly written book, Stephen M. Feldman argues that the conservative ascendance in the United States since the presidency of Ronald Reagan can be understood as an effort to reestablish the legal and political order that existed prior to the New Deal. He labels this pre‐New Deal order “republican democracy,” distinct from the “pluralist democracy” that characterizes our politics since 1937. The heart of the book is the analysis of the Supreme Court and how its conservative majority has pushed this agenda. But to get there, Feldman must establish the broad historical‐political‐legal context. For the book is as much a political argument as it is legal analysis."
"2","Indeed, Feldman suggests, the conservative ascendance is actually the triumph of neoconservatism, with its characteristic distrust of government's ability to get things done, embrace of the “moral clarity” of virtue and the common good (no relativism here) and American exceptionalism. Unlike other manifestations of American conservatism, such as traditionalism, country‐club Republicanism, and libertarianism, neoconservatism has many fewer qualms about utilizing the power of the state—so long as the state's actions are of the right kind. And the right kind are actions that would restore republican democracy. Here, the influence of the political philosopher Leo Strauss is important, and Feldman devotes many pages to Strauss's critique of liberalism and pluralist democracy. Pluralist democracy rests on the shallow principle of self‐interest, resulting in interest‐group liberalism and ultimately in political polarization and sclerosis. It is amoral. Strauss and his neoconservative followers demand a return to moral clarity and the common good."
"3","But republican democracy faded in the 1930s for good reason, Feldman suggests. It was a political order that embodied a largely agrarian, relatively homogeneous white Protestant dominance. That dominance eroded as a consequence of the large forces of industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and the ethnic and religious diversity they brought. By the 1930s, such diversity undermined any possibility of the moral clarity of an agreed‐upon notion of the common good."
"4","Such is our world since then, and for this very reason, the neoconservative effort to restore republican democracy is ultimately doomed, in Feldman's view. In the meantime, however, the effort has produced stunning changes in the law. It is through the lens of republican democracy that we can best understand the essential nature of the conservative thrust at the Supreme Court over the last three decades. Here, Feldman underscores the duplicity of the claims that judicial restraint and hewing to constitutional originalism are apolitical and the only interpretive strategy that maintains the necessary distinction between law and politics. Because the decisions under originalism seem uncannily to produce results consistent with the Republican agenda. Thus, even as the neoconservative Court majority champions judicial restraint in favor of the people making decisions through legislation, that majority pares back Congress's use of the Commerce Clause (as in United States v. Lopez, which held that Congress had exceeded its commerce power when it enacted the Gun‐Free School Zones Act), and applies strict scrutiny in affirmative action issues, even if the government acts with benign intent (as in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District). And far from judicial restraint, the William Rehnquist and John Roberts courts have toppled precedents in many areas of the law, in sometimes radical fashion, as in the campaign finance case, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.         "
"5","One can quibble with Feldman's history of how the New Deal was won and his underplaying of the religious dimension to the Reagan revolution, and one can be skeptical of the intellectual consistency he ascribes to neoconservatism. But this is a provocative and compelling argument."
