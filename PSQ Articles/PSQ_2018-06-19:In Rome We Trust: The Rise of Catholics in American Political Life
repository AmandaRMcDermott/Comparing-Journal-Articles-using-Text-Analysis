"1","In May 2017, word leaked that White House press secretary Sean Spicer, reportedly an observant Catholic, had been snubbed from inclusion on the guest list to meet Pope Francis during President Donald Trump's visit to the Vatican. The episode could serve as a cautionary coda to Manlio Graziano's intriguing analysis of Catholicism's relationship to the American project. On the one hand, as the volume ably documents, Catholics have moved into the mainstream of national‐level political life in America, and vice versa. At the same time, this populist moment, in America and elsewhere, raises questions about the durability of that progress in the face of partisanship and shifting great‐power politics."
"2","While Graziano is not the first to note the changing place of Catholics in American politics, he brings an international, “geopolitical” perspective to his subject matter. In Rome We Trust charts the progress of Catholics in American political life, as the subtitle indicates, while also paying significant attention to the rise of Americans within the Vatican. In Washington, Catholics occupy positions of influence within executive, legislative, and judicial branches with little controversy. In the Vatican, a large cohort of American cardinals wielding significant financial purses enjoy influence unthinkable at the American founding. Graziano points out that these trends coincide with the decline of America's status as global hegemon and what he considers “renewed dynamism” (p. 3) within the global Catholic Church.         "
"3","The analysis is at its best in tracing the complex relationship between American and Vatican interests in international affairs. Graziano demythologizes the U.S.‐Vatican relationship in the post–World War II era, particularly the cooperation between President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. While the two certainly shared an opposition to Soviet power, they represented what Graziano provocatively terms “two different geopolitical agendas” (p. 128) and diverged in a range of policy spheres, from economics to arms control, Middle East peace to Marcos's Philippines."
"4","While there is much to recommend in Graziano's lively and concise account, the specter of political populism and shifting great‐power politics looms throughout. One certainly cannot fault the author for not anticipating President Trump's election; American political analysts did no better. But the populist moment, coupled with China's rise on the international stage, raises questions about the durability of the trends documented in these pages."
"5","First, the conjunction of polarization and anti‐elitism in the contemporary United States calls Catholic influence into question. Given American partisan polarization, particularly within religious traditions, is the presence of a Catholic at the chief of staff's desk, whether John Kelly or Denis McDonough, actually an indicator of “Catholic” influence? Generic Catholic identity seems less salient to American political behavior than religiosity, political ideology, or ethnic background. The anti‐elite rhetoric of President Donald Trump's movement poses further challenges. Graziano rightly documents increasing Catholic representation in elite institutions, but at the moment when the legitimacy of those institutions is undermined on a near daily basis. Similarly, while the American Catholic Church possesses enviable institutional infrastructure, there is limited recent evidence that the elites who manage these structures can translate their ecclesial positions into mass mobilization.         "
"6","Second, returning to geopolitics, Graziano rightly points to declining American hegemony on the international stage. The most obvious locus of competition lies in Beijing, a place with its own fraught history of Vatican relations. If Catholics have risen to power in America only at the close of its international predominance, one wonders what renewed global multipolarity could mean for U.S.‐Vatican relations. Of course, in areas such as the protection of religious liberty, shared interests may endure. But as the United States cedes global leadership in confronting climate change, to give one example, U.S.‐Vatican “geopolitical agendas” may drift apart in surprising ways."
