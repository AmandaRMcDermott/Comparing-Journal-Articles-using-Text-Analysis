"1","Historians and political scientists have long been interested in what Gordon Wood has called the “James Madison problem.” That problem is the tension between Madison's nationalism in the 1780s and attentiveness to states' rights in the 1790s, and between his concern with powerful majorities in the 1780s and his turn to public opinion in the 1790s. One strand in the scholarship has tried to solve the Madison problem by arguing for a consistently democratic Madison. Lance Banning first made this argument by charging that the Madison problem rested on a caricatured account of Madison in the 1780s. Rather than being a Hamiltonian nationalist, Banning's Madison wanted to strengthen the national government, but only in ways that would be compatible with a specific notion of liberty, which, for Banning, is that Madison was loyal to Virginia's prerogatives and suspicious of full‐throated Hamiltonianism. Colleen Sheehan followed Banning to argue that Madison's writings in the early 1790s demonstrate that Madison believed in the “sovereignty of public opinion,” and it is this feature of Madison's political thought that connects the seemingly disparate strands of Madison's thought. The potential difficulty with each of these accounts is that neither confronts directly Madison's writings in The Federalist, writings that have given evidence for generations of scholars that Madison was unfriendly to democracy. Put differently, Banning and Sheehan have transformed our understanding of Madison's political thought, but they have not necessarily affected the way we think about what we might call Madisonian constitutionalism.         "
"2","This is where Greg Weiner's provocative book comes in. Weiner directly confronts the Madison problem by presenting a new version of the Madison we already know and thereby challenging what we think we know of Madisonian constitutionalism. The standard view is that Madison worried about democratic majorities, particularly because he believed that majorities tended to infringe upon rights, and therefore constructed a constitutional framework that would limit the power of majorities. For Weiner, this standard view rests on the critical assumption that Madison was anti‐majoritarian. For Weiner, this view gets Madison wrong and unnecessarily pits liberalism against republicanism. Rather, Madison believed in “temporal republicanism” and, accordingly, “his objective was not to thwart majorities but rather to season them with time” (p. 7). As he puts it, “Isolating majority rule as a decision‐making mechanism clarifies the essential question: Did Madison ever endorse any other means of making decisions? The emphatic answer is that he did not” (p. 6)."
"3","To his credit, Weiner confronts the events that would seem to most challenge his argument: Madison's writings in The Federalist, Madison's support for the Bill of Rights, and Madison's critique of the Alien and Sedition acts. In particular, Weiner's treatment of Madison's arguments in The Federalist provide the backbone of his argument. For Weiner, the critical point is that Madison believed that “the people ordinarily act on the basis of reason, justice, and truth” (p. 50). Because it is only during “particular moments” that people have their reason clouded by passion, Madisonian constitutionalism is based on slowing things down so that the majority's ordinary good sense takes back over. The problem, then, is not the majority; the problem is the temporary moments. “The question is not who rules, but when” (p. 52).         "
"4","This is a potentially clarifying argument, and it pushes the Madison literature forward, particularly by showing a path for Madisonian constitutionalism that does not rest on twentieth‐century notions of judicial review."
"5","I am not wholly convinced that Weiner is right about Madison. In general, I think Weiner understates Madison's commitment to rights and overstates Madison's commitment to deliberation. With respect to the latter, Weiner casts deliberation almost wholly in terms of time and rarely in terms of rising above interest or in terms of wisdom. If deliberation were defined in this broader sense, I think there is pretty good evidence that Madison did not think that the majorities would frequently deliberate their way to the public good. But this is an interpretative difference (and I must disclose that I am writing a book on the subject) that readers should confront for themselves. In this, Weiner should be commended; he has taken a powerful step in forcing readers of Madison—including this one—to rethink their assumptions about the premises of Madisonian constitutionalism."
