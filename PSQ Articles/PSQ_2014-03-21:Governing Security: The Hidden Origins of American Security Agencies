"1","What is the relationship between security and the competing ideological and parochial interests of policymakers? Governing Security helps answer this question by investigating this complex web of relationships as embodied in the creation and evolution of agency design. In particular, Mariano‐Florentino Cueller juxtaposes the history of the Federal Security Agency (FSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to show how two different presidents, first Franklin Roosevelt and then George W. Bush, manipulated notions of security to expand their political control by reorganizing government agencies. The result is a detailed political history of both organizations that is informed by circumstance (the imperatives of crisis decision making) and competing interests (namely, those of the president and stakeholders in Congress), both of which are entangled in a fluid definition of security that is both manipulated for political goals but which also informs of the possibilities of agency action. As such, Governing Security makes important contributions to our understanding of agency design, the evolution of regulatory power, and especially the creation of FSA and DHS.         "
"2","The book makes two overarching claims: it will use agency design and legal mandate to understand how national security is defined, and it will show how competing political interests attempt to “secure” control over agencies and implementation. On both counts, the book is only partially successful. Certainly, the histories of FSA and DHS are presented as rich and complex, a contribution which should not be underestimated. But this detail tends to leave the reader with the impression that everything matters. The main causal mechanisms are underdeveloped, and it is not clear how the book's core contribution can be applied to other disputes over regulatory power or agency reorganization. Similarly, counter explanations are often neglected. For example, good policy motives are rarely allowed to compete with ideas rooted in ideology or parochial interest. Likewise, the agency exercised by organizational process and structure is often overlooked. For example, when Roosevelt decided to put essentially illegal biological weapons research under the FSA (p. 79), was he motivated by security, his greater ability to control that department, or the flexibility inherit in the pockets of budgetary resources found in FSA but not in other agencies? Too often the book argues what is “likely to” or “might” have happened and, in the process, denies itself the explanatory power that would have come with discounting even a few major counter arguments."
"3","The definition of “national security” has political power and Governing Security persuasively argues that this definition can allow presidents to both consolidate and reorganize agencies to their own political advantage. This focus on the definition and manipulation of security, however, leaves some unanswered questions. For example, if “security” was the guise that allowed Roosevelt to expand his power over a variety of public health and social safety net issues, what then explains the shift in the opposite direction? Why, for example, is the security trope no longer as successful in capturing funding for public health, education, and welfare? Perhaps part of the answer can be found in investigating the degree to which new or emerging definitions of national security are shared among policy stakeholders, Congress, and the public; in other words, whether “national security” remains mostly only a rhetorical device.         "
"4","Overall, these concerns are minor issues in an otherwise compelling argument about the creation of FSA and DHS. They do, however, raise cautions about the degree to which Governing Security offers an argument that can be used to explain other agencies.         "
