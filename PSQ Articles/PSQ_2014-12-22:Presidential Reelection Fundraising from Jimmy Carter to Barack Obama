"1","PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA KICKED OFF HIS OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN for a second term in the White House with a whirlwind trip to Chicago for a trio of fundraisers on 14 April 2011. At each event that night, Obama explained that although his campaign had begun, he was not yet able to devote much of his attention to it. At his final stop of the evening, he declared, “There's going to come a time when I'll fully engage in this race. When the time comes, I will be campaigning. I'll be ready to go. But I've got to tell you, right now I still have this day job.”1 In spite of Obama's profession of limited involvement with his reelection bid, in 2011, he would go on to headline 70 fundraisers for his reelection committee, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), or both, on his way to a record of 223 such events in 2011 and 2012—more than double the number of such fundraisers held by any of the previous five presidents.         "
"2","Time is a president's scarcest resource, inasmuch as there are always many more compelling demands for his attention than he has the time to address. Why did Obama devote so much more time than his predecessors did to reelection fundraising, and why did his reelection bid officially begin earlier than those of his predecessors, just over two years after he was sworn in as president? The answers lie in the rules of the U.S. campaign finance system, the competitive nature of presidential elections, and the dynamics of what has come to be called the permanent campaign. While scholars and political practitioners alike have long believed that a presidency could be divided into periods of campaigning and governing, this assumption no longer holds. In the era of the permanent campaign, the lines between electioneering and performing the official duties of office have become increasingly blurred, with important implications for both electoral campaigns and presidential leadership."
"3","To explore Obama's unprecedented reelection fundraising and the evolving dynamics of the permanent campaign, this article first discusses the lines between campaigning and governing and the concept of the permanent campaign, and then analyzes empirically Obama's record‐breaking efforts to raise money for his reelection bid in comparison to his predecessors in the Oval Office. It next lays out an argument about the institutional and contextual factors that have spurred the increase in reelection fundraising and discusses the implications of these developments for presidential governance, for the president's role as party leader, for Obama's second term in the White House, and for future presidents."
"4","The concept of the permanent campaign is often applied broadly to refer to the many ways in which the lines between campaigning and governing are no longer clear and distinct. Some scholars, including Samuel Kernell, George Edwards, and Corey Cook, have focused on a president's efforts to win the support of the public and to market his policy priorities once in office in the same manner in which he marketed himself as a candidate in the campaign.2 Others have analyzed the ways in which presidents bring to bear a central tool of campaigning in order to aid them in governing by gauging public opinion through the frequent use of polling.3 Additional studies have examined whether presidents lead or follow public opinion.4 These works all tackle questions related to the premise that presidents' efforts to reach and lead the public are part of an ongoing campaign‐like effort.         "
"5","Other studies have focused on the extent to which sitting presidents respond to electoral incentives, not just in an election year, but also throughout their term in office. Despite the conventional wisdom that presidents are quite concerned about their own electoral fortunes, until recently, research on the institution of the presidency has rarely addressed campaigns, and scholarship on campaigns has seldom examined what presidents do throughout their term to enhance their chances of reelection. In efforts to bridge this gap, several recent studies have examined the extent to which presidents direct federal spending to electorally important states,5 while other scholars have analyzed how presidential travel relates to the incentives of the electoral college, not just in an election year, but throughout a president's first term.6"
"6","Kathryn Dunn Tenpas and others have explored another avenue of inquiry linking the study of campaigns to research on the institution of the presidency by examining the ways in which White House aides in recent decades have come to play a greater role in presidential reelection campaigns than was the case previously.7 As scholars such as William Mayer and Andrew Busch have shown how the rules of the electoral system have incentivized both sitting and aspiring presidents to begin their campaign efforts earlier and earlier, researchers have sought to study systematically and empirically how these dynamics play out during a presidency.8 Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann brought together research on many of these related topics in their edited volume on the permanent campaign at the end of the administration of Bill Clinton, offering essays on the role of the press in the permanent campaign, presidential polling efforts, the roles of White House staff, the implications of the permanent campaign for governing, and more.9"
"7","Scholars aiming to connect research on the presidency itself and on presidential campaigns must grapple with the question of when in the course of a president's term explicitly electoral efforts begin. Some academic studies of elections focus only on the traditional campaign season, which encompasses the approximately two‐month period from Labor Day to election day.10 This approach is based upon a long‐established political tradition exemplified in a memo from the Truman administration that declared that the 1948 “campaign extended from September 6, Labor Day, to November 2.”11 Although this period does see the most‐intense campaign activity, the notion of the permanent campaign suggests that limiting a study of presidential campaigning to only the few months leading up to election day would fail to capture the full scope of electoral activity, insofar as both the president and his opponents engage in electoral activity long before Labor Day of the election year.         "
"8","Some scholars who acknowledge that campaigning usually begins well in advance of Labor Day have studied campaign efforts in the summer months of an election year as well.12 This approach yields a more‐expansive examination of electoral activity, but still not a comprehensive one. Other studies have assumed that campaign activity takes place throughout the entire election year but not beforehand. Kernell, in his study of presidential efforts to go public, explained that he focused his analysis on a president's first three years in office but not the reelection year in order “To eliminate public activities inspired by concerns of reelection rather than governing.”13 But is it realistic to assume that a line between governing and campaigning can be drawn at the beginning of an election year?         "
"9","Both the logic of the permanent campaign and the April 2011 initiation of Obama's reelection fundraising suggest that the answer is no. But only a few studies have attempted to look systematically at explicitly electoral efforts beyond presidential and congressional election years. One such effort examined Bill Clinton's fundraising to support his fellow Democrats in 1999 and 2000, and two others studied George W. Bush's campaign efforts for House candidates throughout the 2001–2002 election cycle. Focusing on a longer time period, another study analyzed presidential campaigning in midterm Senate contests in the 22 months leading up to each midterm election from 1982 to 2002.14 Most recently, this author recently focused on electorally related efforts throughout a president's entire term in office by systematically studying fundraising, strategic travel, and electoral decision making from 1977 through the midpoint of 2011.15 This article builds upon the research in that book by analyzing the entirety of Obama's reelection fundraising efforts and by drawing on additional data about the closed‐press fundraising of his five immediate predecessors as president.         "
"10","This study focuses on an unambiguously electoral activity that provides clear insight into how campaigning and governing have become intermingled—presidential fundraising efforts. Critics of a given president are quick to categorize a wide range of actions as being electorally motivated. But for most instances that take place in non‐election years, the electoral connection is debatable. If a president visits a school in Florida well in advance of an election, did he choose the location because of Florida's perennial status as a key electoral college swing state, or for another, unrelated reason? Observers must be careful not to improperly assign electoral motives to presidential actions. This study addresses this dilemma by focusing on political fundraising. Whenever a president headlines a fundraiser, he leaves no doubt about the electoral nature of his efforts. Presidents engage in political fundraising for themselves and their fellow party members far beyond the traditional campaign season, looking to strengthen their party's ranks in order to help the president during his term and to carry on the party's policy agenda beyond the president's time in the White House."
"11","Most research analyzing political fundraising draws upon data from the Federal Election Commission on contributions to and expenditures by candidates, political parties, and political action groups.16 This study approaches campaign finance dynamics by examining not the amount of money raised by a presidential campaign, but instead the extent to which a president devotes his time to the pursuit of campaign funds. Any president must make difficult choices about how to allocate his time. These decisions reveal a great deal about his priorities, and recent presidents have increasingly prioritized fundraising throughout their terms in office.         "
"12","To analyze presidential fundraising efforts systematically, an original data set was constructed of the political fundraisers that presidents attended beginning with the presidency of Jimmy Carter, as he was the first elected president to seek reelection during the campaign finance regime established by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 (FECA). Carter and his five successors all made strategic choices that took into account the restrictions, requirements, and incentives established by FECA and thus operated within a common, though evolving, institutional environment. This data set of political fundraisers does not include presidential meetings with supporters that were declared to be donor courting, reward, or maintenance events but not actual fundraisers. While many of these gatherings were certainly related to fundraising efforts, including them in this analysis would begin a slide down a very slippery and unbounded slope. Many such events take place at the White House itself, where official fundraising is prohibited. Others are avowed to be meetings of the president with key supporters and friends with no price tag for admission attached. Although one certainly suspects that donations are key to many of these political friendships, an attempt to categorize any meeting of a president with a party donor as a fundraising effort would be an unmanageable journey down a problematic slippery slope, and thus this data set is restricted to actual fundraising events."
"13","This data set was built by first examining the fundraisers recorded in the Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States via the American Presidency Project, the web site of each presidential library, and the White House web sites of Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. Multiple approaches were used to account for the many presidential fundraisers that were closed to the press or did not involve a speech by the president and thus were not included in the Public Papers. First, LexisNexis searches were conducted of Associated Press articles that contained each president's name within 25 words of the word fundraiser or one of its variants over the past six presidencies, and the resulting news stories were used to check the data set. To capture additional closed press fundraisers that these searches might not have covered, the Digests of Other White House Announcements, which provide supplemental information from the White House press office on presidential activities that do not appear in the Public Papers, were painstakingly reviewed. The White House daily diaries for Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Clinton, which have recently become available online, as well as Obama's public schedules on the White House web site, were checked as well (the daily presidential schedules for the relevant years for both Presidents Bush are not similarly available). Information from all of these sources was often cross‐referenced with information from the discussion of the president's activities by the White House press secretary in his or her daily gaggle with the press corps.         "
"14","Although it is impossible to guarantee that these efforts have yielded every closed‐press presidential fundraiser, the resulting data set is the most‐comprehensive record available of the extent to which presidents allocate their scarce time to reelection fundraising. These efforts revealed 497 fundraisers for the past six presidents' reelection campaign committees or the Democratic or Republican National Committee (RNC) in the third and fourth years of a president's first term. The volume and timing of these events reveal a great deal about the six most‐recent presidents' reelection efforts and the increasingly blurred lines between campaigning and governing."
"15","Barack Obama's reelection campaign and its related Democratic Party fundraising committees shattered records in 2011 and 2012, even taking into account inflation, by collectively raising over $1.1 billion in their successful attempt to win Obama a second term in the White House.17 A central part of this effort was the unprecedented personal commitment that Obama himself made to political fundraising. Figure 1 depicts the number of fundraisers headlined by the past six presidents for their reelection campaign committee, their party's national committee, or both, in the third and fourth years of their first term in office. The first key takeaway is that Obama's efforts dwarf those of his predecessors. He headlined 223 fundraisers for his reelection campaign committee, the DNC, or both, in his third and fourth years in office, a number more than twice as great as the president ranking second—Clinton, with 111 such fundraisers. Obama's total was more than double that of George W. Bush, six times that of Carter, over seven times that of George H.W. Bush, and almost 56 times higher than that of Reagan.         "
"16","Although a president's personal involvement in fundraising is only one part of a reelection fundraising effort, it is an increasingly important one. Fundraising efforts by surrogates such as the vice president or the first lady and via direct mail and, in recent elections, the Internet do not involve commitments of presidential time. But these efforts only go so far. Mike McCurry, who served as White House press secretary during Clinton's reelection bid, explained the essential role of the president in reelection fundraising, given the amount of money they needed to raise. “Frankly he had to put a lot of time into it. The single best ingredient you've got [in fund‐raising] is face time with the president, the picture, the personal note.”18 Confronted with increasing campaign costs, recent presidents have chosen to devote growing amounts of time to reelection fundraising.         "
"17","Focusing just on Obama's efforts overshadows the fact that the rise in presidential reelection fundraising is a multi‐president phenomenon. Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush all spent relatively little time fundraising for their reelection campaign committee and their respective national committees in the third and fourth years in the White House. Carter's total of 37 such fundraisers in 1979 and 1980 was followed by Reagan's four in 1983 and 1984, and then by the first President Bush's 30 such events in 1991 and 1992. Bill Clinton's combined total of 111 such fundraisers in 1995 and 1996 was more than triple George H.W. Bush's commitment. While George W. Bush's 92 such events in 2003 and 2004 did not eclipse Clinton's record, Bush's number exceeded the combined totals of Carter, Reagan, and the first President Bush. Obama's 223 such fundraisers would leave the efforts of his five most‐recent predecessors far behind."
"18","Although a president's fundraising for his campaign committee is at the heart of his reelection efforts, considering his third and fourth year efforts on behalf of the DNC or RNC yields a more‐complete picture of a president's reelection fundraising. For example, in 1995 and 1996, Bill Clinton headlined just 28 fundraisers for the Clinton‐Gore '96 campaign, 23 of which took place in 1995. Clinton limited his efforts for his own reelection committee because of the spending limits that came with his participation in the public matching funds program for the nominating contest. The cap on pre‐convention spending in the 1996 campaign by candidates who accepted public funding was $37.1 million.19 But Clinton also took part in 83 additional fundraisers for the DNC in 1995 and 1996. After the Clinton‐Gore campaign had raised the maximum amount of money it could legally spend, Clinton turned even more of his attention to helping the DNC, which used the money to help reelect Clinton and support other down‐ballot Democrats. Not all of Clinton's DNC fundraising helped his own campaign, but a great deal of it did, inasmuch as the DNC used the money to air television issue advertisements and to organize get‐out‐the‐vote efforts.20 While including Clinton's DNC fundraising leads to the consideration of some efforts that benefitted fellow party members, focusing just on Clinton's reelection campaign committee fundraising but not his efforts for the DNC would miss a substantial portion of his commitment to raise money in order to secure a second term.21"
"19","In 2003 and 2004, George W. Bush exceeded Clinton's fundraising for his reelection campaign committee, but not for his national committee. As the first sitting president to opt out of public matching funds for the nominating contest, Bush was not limited in the amount that he could raise for his reelection campaign committee before the convention, as Clinton had been. Thus, in the third and fourth years of his first term, Bush headlined an unprecedented 58 fundraisers for the Bush‐Cheney reelection campaign, as well as 26 events that jointly benefitted both his reelection campaign committee and the RNC, plus an additional eight fundraisers for the RNC. This combined total of 92 did not break Clinton's record, but it far exceeded the efforts of Carter, Reagan, and the first President Bush"
"20","Although Clinton and George W. Bush both primarily focused on their own reelection campaign committee first and then on their national committee, Obama integrated his fundraising efforts for both entities from the beginning of his reelection bid. The proceeds from every fundraiser for his reelection campaign went to the Obama Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that benefited both the Obama‐Biden reelection campaign and the DNC. The first $5,000 of a contribution from an individual at a given fundraising event went to the campaign itself, since the maximum legal individual contribution to a campaign for the 2012 election cycle was $2,500 for the nominating season and $2,500 for the general election. The DNC received any additional amount up to $30,800, which was the maximum legal contribution per year by an individual to a national political party. At some events where donors gave more than $35,800, the additional money was then directed to state parties in swing states that would use it to help the Obama reelection effort and other Democrats. For example, the price of admission for some Obama fundraising events was $75,800; the $40,000 above the amount that went to the reelection campaign committee and the DNC was divided, with $10,000 going to each of four state party organizations in key swing states.22 Obama held 220 fundraisers for the Obama Victory Fund and an additional three for just the DNC in 2011 and 2012, a total that easily outpaced the similar efforts of his five immediate predecessors.         "
"21","As presidents have spent more of their time fundraising for their reelection bid, these efforts have begun earlier and earlier in their terms, progressively eroding the lines between campaigning and governing. Carter planned to take part in his first fundraiser for his reelection campaign committee in early December 1979, but cancelled his attendance after American citizens were taken hostage in Iran. Instead, he asked Vice President Walter Mondale and First Lady Rosalynn Carter to headline the event.23 Carter, who at first sought to avoid electoral politics during the hostage crisis, would not attend a reelection fundraiser until 29 May 1980, just over five months before Election Day, but the planned December 1979 start to fundraising indicates when the campaign believed the president needed to begin his personal efforts to finance his reelection bid. Four years later, the Reagan‐Bush reelection campaign's direct mail solicitations and the fundraising efforts of Vice President George H.W. Bush were so successful that this author found no record of Reagan's personal participation in any fundraising events for his reelection campaign committee in 1983 and 1984, though he did headline four fundraisers for the RNC in the third and fourth years of his first term.24"
"22","George H.W. Bush's first fundraiser for the Bush‐Quayle '92 committee took place on 31 October 1991, just over a year before the 1992 election and a month earlier in his term than the planned start of Carter's fundraising in early December 1979. His aides planned an initial series of fundraisers that they hoped would raise $30 million. Said one adviser, “We want to be able to get out of the field before the others get in.”25 Bush's declining popularity and the surprisingly vigorous challenge he received from Pat Buchanan complicated this plan. As a result, Bush was still headlining Bush‐Quayle fundraising events through the end of May 1992. Bush might have gotten off to an earlier start had it not been for the Gulf War in the first part of 1991 and the prospect of what many mistakenly thought would be a weak Democratic field that would pose little challenge to a president whose popularity had soared when American troops liberated Kuwait. In the week before the 1992 election, as Bush sprinted toward his campaign's finish line, he told television host Larry King in an interview, “For a long time I decided I wouldn't get in the arena. … Some thought it was a little late. I've had some criticism of that from my own party.”26"
"23","The next three presidents appeared to have learned from the experiences of George H.W. Bush. Not only would they have more‐ambitious fundraising goals, but they began raising money much earlier in their terms. Bill Clinton's first fundraiser for the Clinton‐Gore campaign took place on 22 June 1995, almost a year and a half before the 1996 election, and over four months earlier in his term than George H.W. Bush's first fundraising efforts. George W. Bush's initial reelection campaign fundraiser was held on 17 June 2003, just a few days earlier than Clinton's start had been. And Barack Obama outdid his predecessors' early starts, beginning his reelection fundraising on 14 April 2011, just months after the midpoint of his first term in the White House."
"24","Over time, presidents have devoted more and more time to being the fundraiser‐in‐chief, and as they have done so, they have begun their reelection fundraising efforts earlier, further muddying the lines between campaigning and governing. While Obama's record‐breaking reelection fundraising might easily draw the most attention, it is important to note that the rise in reelection fundraising is a multi‐presidency phenomenon. Although the increase has not always been linear, the overall trend is decidedly upward; the efforts of recent presidents have far outstripped those of their predecessors. The next section lays out an argument about why these dynamics have unfolded in this way."
"25","The key to understanding the rise in presidential reelection fundraising lies in the rules of the campaign finance system and the competitive nature of presidential elections. Presidents are goal‐oriented political actors who respond to the institutional and contextual incentives that result from the rules of the system in which they operate. And they are quite aware of the very real possibility of being denied a second term in the White House. Before Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford in 1976, an incumbent president had not lost a reelection bid in the 44 years since Herbert Hoover's loss in 1932. Between 1976 and 1992, however, three of the four presidents—Gerald Ford, Carter, and George H.W. Bush—faced significant intraparty challenges to their renomination and were then ousted from office in the general election."
"26","Of the four presidents since 1976 who have been reelected, only Reagan won in a landslide. While Bill Clinton earned a second term with a comfortable electoral college vote margin, he carried only 49.2 percent of the popular vote, indicating that more Americans voted for someone other than Clinton. George W. Bush won a clear popular majority in 2004, but his narrow electoral college victory rested on his win in Ohio, which he carried by just under 120,000 votes.27 In 2012, Obama's near sweep of electoral college battleground states was by no means predetermined, as the economy had been slow to recover from the most‐substantial economic crisis since the Great Depression. Lynn Vavreck has demonstrated that while economic conditions are a strong predictor of the outcomes of presidential elections, carefully crafted campaign messages can help candidates to take advantage of good economic circumstances and to mitigate the electoral peril posed by a weak economy. Given this, Obama and his team needed substantial resources to wage an effective campaign for a second term.28"
"27","Additionally, the two presidents who showed the biggest increase in reelection fundraisers over their immediate Oval Office predecessors were Clinton and Obama, both of whom had seen their party suffer historic midterm congressional election losses in their first term. In 1994, Republicans won control of both the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years. In 2010, Democrats lost 63 seats in the House, the most seats lost in a midterm election since 1938, as Republicans reclaimed the majority in that chamber and picked up seats in the Senate as well.29 Midterm election results are often viewed as a referendum on the president, and in the wake of these elections, many observers thought that the odds were stacked against either Clinton or Obama winning a second term. These midterm setbacks served as a powerful motivation for both presidents to amass sufficient financial resources for their reelection bids.         "
"28","It is against this backdrop of electoral competitiveness that recent presidents have exceeded their predecessors' reelection fundraising efforts due to the confluence of the rising costs of campaigns, laws that limit the size of contributions to campaigns and parties, the recent irrelevancy of the public funding system for presidential elections, and the new prominence of outside groups that can raise money not subject to the contribution limits set by federal election laws. In an era in which no party has consistently held the upper hand in presidential elections, presidents are well aware that they might lose and are determined to do what they can to ensure that they do not."
"29","Over the course of the 10 presidential elections since the 1974 amendments to FECA, which established the core rules of the current U.S. campaign finance system, the amounts spent in presidential elections have risen dramatically. Figure 2 depicts the total amount spent by all presidential candidates in each election cycle from 1976 through 2012, and the trend is clear. A steady and substantial rise in money spent through 1996 is followed by a dramatic increase in 2000, 2004, and 2008 at a pace that far exceeded the rate of inflation. The total spent dipped in 2012 from the peak of 2008. The lack of a contested Democratic nomination fight in 2012 probably accounts for this drop; Hillary Clinton spent about $225 million dollars in her unsuccessful bid to win the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, contributing substantially to the record total spending in that election cycle.30 The 2012 totals were still over one and a half times greater than the amounts spent in the 2004 election cycle, and over two and a half times more than what was spent in the 2000 election cycle.            "
"30","The greater rate of increase in total candidate spending beginning in 2000 resulted in large part from the winning candidates opting out of first the public funding regime and its accompanying spending limits during the nominating process in 2000 and 2004, and then at both the nominating and general election stages in 2008 and 2012, which is discussed in more detail below. If the 1976 total of $118 million spent by all presidential candidates had risen at the rate of inflation, the amount for 2012 would have been $476 million. The actual total was almost three times higher, with total spending reaching $1.31 billion. Sitting presidents have helped to drive the rising costs of campaigns; they have set increasingly aggressive fundraising and spending goals. But they have also had to respond to the broader trend of rising electoral costs. Campaigns for a wide range of offices over the past few decades have dedicated increasing amounts of money to television advertising, public opinion polling, direct‐mail outreach, fundraising solicitations, and, in recent elections, Internet campaigning and social media efforts.31 These endeavors usually involve expensive political consultants and campaign professionals, contributing to the skyrocketing costs of running for high office.32"
"31","The dramatic increase in campaign costs has interacted with the evolving rules of the U.S. campaign finance system established by FECA to incentivize presidents to spend greater amounts of time raising money. FECA set limits on political contributions in order to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption by reducing the potential that elected officials would be beholden to large donors. The 1974 law initially set a cap on contributions to candidates for federal office by individuals at $1,000 per election cycle, an amount that was fixed for 28 years until it was changed to $2,000 and mandated to increase with inflation as part of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA)."
"32","Because contribution limits did not change between 1974 and 2002, the amount of money that a presidential campaign could raise from an individual decreased in actual terms over time because of inflation. If contribution limits had risen with inflation during this period, the contribution limit in the 2000 presidential election cycle, the final campaign for which the donation limit was $1,000, would have been $3,026. Instead, a $1,000 contribution in 2000 was the functional equivalent of a $331 donation in 1976 when taking into account inflation over the 24 intervening years.33 The law intentionally required presidents and other political actors to reach out to many donors who would give money in relatively small increments. As one Republican who was involved in George H.W. Bush's reelection fundraising efforts explained, “We've got to raise $25 million with $1,000 limits [on each individual contribution]. So it's a huge undertaking.”34 As campaign costs increased at a rate far greater than that of inflation and the contribution limit remained fixed, presidents had to find large numbers of donors to fund their campaigns, and thus spend more time doing so. These pressures led to reelection fundraising efforts beginning earlier and earlier in a president's term.            "
"33","The spending caps that came with the voluntary public funding system for presidential nominating contests increased every four years, as the law's individual contribution limit remained constant from 1976 through 2002, leading presidents and candidates to devote even more time to fundraising. In order to be eligible for this public funding program, presidential candidates had to raise $5,000 in each of 20 states in contributions of $250 or less, for a total of $100,000. Candidates who met this threshold would have the first $250 of a contribution matched by the federal funding program up to certain limits set by the law. In return for these matching funds, candidates had to abide by spending caps in each state and in the aggregate for their entire nominating campaign effort. The system was intended both to incentivize candidates to draw upon a large number of small donors and to constrain campaign costs. The spending limits for candidates who took part in the public funding program for the nominating process increased from $13.1 million for the 1976 race to $40.5 million for the 2000 campaign, the last year in which contributions were limited to $1,000, and the last election cycle in which a major party nominee took part in the matching funds program.35"
"34","How did the rise in spending caps for the nominating contest affect the time presidents spent raising money? In 1976, a candidate receiving only donations from individuals would have had to convince 109,000 people to contribute the maximum amount of $1,000 to reach that year's pre‐convention spending limit. In 2000, a candidate would need to find 405,000 people who would each contribute $1,000 in order to raise enough money to reach that year's cap—close to four times as many donors as in 1976. While campaigns have fundraising techniques that do not involve the president's time, as the money raised for a presidential reelection bid has increased over the past several decades, so has the time that presidents have spent on fundraising. Even given the higher contribution limit established by the BCRA in 2002, presidents still needed to spend increasing amounts of time fundraising."
"35","Although only two of the six most‐recent presidents have faced a serious challenge for renomination—Carter and George H.W. Bush—even presidential campaigns unopposed at the nominating stage raised nominating money in part to scare off potential intraparty challengers. As Harold Ickes, head of Clinton's White House Office of Political Affairs, explained in 1995, “We're gearing up as if there will be a primary opponent. My view, though, is there won't be.”36 Presidential reelection campaigns also raise funds during the nominating stage that are then directed against the other party well before their party's national convention. With contribution limits low relative to both rising campaign costs and public funding spending limits, recent presidents have devoted increasing amounts of time to raising money. These dynamics would be exacerbated once the public funding of presidential elections no longer offered sufficient resources to mount a successful campaign.            "
"36","In the six presidential elections from 1976 to 1996, the campaign finance regime established by FECA succeeded in holding down overall candidate campaign fundraising and spending; every Democratic and Republican nominee over this 20‐year period chose to participate in the federal public funding program at both the nominating and general‐election stages. While the interaction of rising campaign expenditures and fixed contribution limits led to most presidents devoting substantial amounts of time to fundraising, the campaign spending caps that were a condition of accepting matching funds served as a brake on increasing campaign expenditures."
"37","The case of Reagan's reelection bid serves to highlight how the public funding program held down the amounts of money raised and spent in presidential campaigns, and thus the time the president spent personally seeking campaign funds. The Reagan‐Bush '84 campaign's fundraising efforts via direct mail and by surrogates such as the vice president were so successful that this author found no record of Reagan himself headlining a fundraiser to benefit his own campaign organization. Additionally, his campaign halted its fundraising efforts in May 1984, having already raised all the money it could spend under the legal limits that accompanied the use of public funds for the nominating process. Despite the fact that Reagan was unopposed for the nomination, the campaign continued to receive donations after it stopped soliciting them, leading to a surplus of more than $1.5 million above what the law dictated the campaign could spend throughout the nominating process.37 If the public financing system was designed in part to reduce the amount of money presidential candidates raise and spend and thus the amount of time they devote to raising funds, it certainly succeeded in this respect in 1984. Reagan's lack of personal involvement in his reelection fundraising would not be emulated by his successors, who would spend much more time raising political funds.            "
"38","Although the two presidents who immediately succeeded Reagan would participate in both stages of the presidential public funding program, its incremental progression to irrelevance has unfolded over the four presidential elections since 2000 and has accelerated the rise in campaign costs and thus the amounts of time that sitting presidents allocate to reelection fundraising. In 2000, George W. Bush became the first major‐party nominee to forgo federal matching funds for the nominating contest. Campaign finance law mandated that candidates in that election cycle could receive up to $16.9 million in matching funds in exchange for limiting their pre‐convention spending to $40.5 million.38 Bush was wary that public funding would limit his ability to compete with Steve Forbes, who had spent $37 million in a self‐financed 1996 presidential bid and seemed poised to exceed that amount in 2000. Discussing his decision not to accept matching funds and the accompanying spending caps, Bush explained, “You've got limits that constrain a candidate. I want to be in a position to respond.”39 Bush would go on to raise more than $95 million for his campaign committee in the pre‐convention period.40 In 2004, John Kerry made the same choice that Bush had; for the first time, both major‐party nominees declined public funding for the nominating process. The spending cap that year for those accepting matching funds was $44.8 million; Bush raised almost $270 million in an unopposed bid for renomination, while Kerry raised close to $235 million.41 Both candidates' decisions not to accept public funding during the nominating process allowed them to draw upon far greater financial resources for their campaign than otherwise would have been possible.            "
"39","With the institutional constraint of pre‐nomination spending limits removed, George W. Bush would spend record amounts of time fundraising for his reelection campaign committee, as Figure 1 illustrates. Clinton had headlined only 28 fundraisers that benefitted the Clinton‐Gore reelection committee and another 83 for the DNC in 1995 and 1996. In 2003 and 2004, Bush took part in 58 fundraisers for the Bush‐Cheney campaign, as well as 26 more that jointly benefitted the campaign committee and the RNC, and another eight solely for the RNC. The decision to forgo matching funds led to Bush headlining three times as many fundraisers for his reelection committee than had Clinton, whereas Clinton chose to devote more time to fundraising for the DNC than Bush would for the RNC. Bush's reelection committee fundraising goal was greater than that of any president before him, and he would need to spend record time raising committee campaign cash due to the limits on individual contributions, which had been raised to $2,000 per person per campaign cycle for the 2004 elections by the BCRA. Every major‐party nominee since 2004 has similarly declined to participate in the pre‐nomination matching funds program, as its potential rewards are no longer substantial enough to run an effective campaign.            "
"40","FECA also established a separate presidential public financing system for the general election. Instead of receiving matching funds, qualifying party nominees are granted a set amount of public funding to be used from their party's national convention through Election Day. In exchange, they agree not to raise or spend additional campaign committee funds after the convention. The general election funding amount increased every election from $21.8 million in 1976 to $84.1 million in 2008, and every candidate of both major parties from 1976 through 2004 opted to take part in this program.42"
"41","In 2008, Barack Obama became the first major‐party nominee since the passage of FECA not to participate in the public financing system at either the nominating or the general‐election stage. The spending limits that came with the public funds that year were $50.5 million for the nomination process and an additional $84.1 million for the general election. Unconstrained by these spending caps, the Obama campaign proceeded to raise $745 million.43 Republican nominee John McCain declined public funding at the nominating stage but accepted public financing for the general election, leaving him with far fewer financial resources than Obama after the national conventions. In 2012, for the first time, neither major party nominee participated in the public funding program at either stage of the election; the spending limits of the program fell far short of what had become required to run an effective presidential campaign. As the costs of campaigns have risen far more rapidly than have the spending caps associated with public funding, this program, which once served to limit both the amount of money raised and the time presidents and candidates spent raising it, has become irrelevant for major‐party nominees.            "
"42","Another key contributor to the rising costs of campaigns and the decline of the public financing system has been the increased prominence of outside groups not formally affiliated with political parties that can raise unregulated money in unlimited amounts. One of the principal aims when BCRA was passed in 2002 was to ban the then‐widespread practice of national political parties collecting soft money donations—that is, money not subject to the contribution limits of FECA. National parties had been allowed to use these unregulated funds to support party‐building efforts, conduct get‐out‐the‐vote campaigns, and run general‐issue advertisements that did not directly call for the election or defeat of a particular candidate for federal office.44"
"43","In response, BCRA aimed to ban soft‐money contributions to national parties by mandating that party activities must be funded with hard, or regulated, money, which had to be raised subject to contribution caps. In the 2004 presidential election, the first following the passage of BCRA, unregulated money did not vanish from the campaign field. Instead of going to national parties, outside organizations, often called 527 groups after the section of the tax code under which they were organized, raised funds in unregulated amounts and ran advertisements and voter mobilization efforts designed to influence federal elections. While the majority of the spending by 527 groups that election cycle aimed to help Democratic candidates, the single most‐prominent such organization was the anti–John Kerry organization called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. The 527 groups collectively spent over $350 million in the 2004 election cycle.45"
"44","While the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in the Citizens United case that overturned the prohibition on direct spending in federal elections by corporations is often cited as creating the outside groups known popularly as super PACs—formally called Independent Expenditure‐Only Committees46—these organizations are only the latest incarnation of a phenomenon that began to play a key role in federal elections soon after the enactment of BCRA. With soft money banned to political parties, it has flowed to various types of outside groups. In the most‐recent presidential campaign, super PACs aligned with, but legally independent of, specific candidates and political parties played a prominent role. In one leading example, Nevada billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife contributed approximately $90 million to super PACs supporting Republican candidates in the 2012 election cycle.47"
"45","The prospect of super PACs raising money in million‐dollar increments placed even more pressure on Obama and his Republican challengers to devote more time to raising money in the relatively small increments laid out by campaign finance law. These dynamics help to explain why Obama headlined a record 223 events for his reelection campaign committee, the DNC, or both, in 2011 and 2012. The legislators who led the passage of BCRA sought to address the possibility that national parties would be corrupted by large, unregulated contributions. In doing so, the legislation unintentionally redirected these unregulated funds to other, less‐accountable actors, and increased the pressure on presidents and candidates to spend more and more time raising money in the regulated amounts prescribed by campaign finance law."
"46","The potential benefits of the permanent campaign are clear. Sitting presidents who devote more time earlier in their first term to raise sufficient funds for their reelection bid aim to win four more years in the White House. Presidents who succeed in this endeavor have an additional term in which to enact policies that carry the nation closer to their vision of a more‐perfect union. Presidents are goal‐oriented political actors who respond to the institutional incentives of the political system in which they operate. But responding to the factors that have helped to create the permanent campaign can lead to a number of additional potential consequences that merit investigation and analysis."
"47","In November 2012, just after Obama's successful reelection bid concluded, a top White House aide discussed a key question that every administration faces when determining the president's schedule. “When you're talking about the president's time, which is the most precious resource in the White House, there's going to be a debate about whether or not this is worth the candle. Is it worth that amount of time?”48 In George W. Bush's administration, the White House schedule was planned in five‐minute increments, highlighting the value of the president's time.49 Presidential aides know that there are more demands on a president's time than can be accommodated, and must weigh carefully how much time a president should devote to fundraising and other campaign efforts, meeting with advisers at the White House, negotiating with members of Congress, interacting with foreign leaders, and more.            "
"48","A president running for reelection confronts particularly important trade‐offs about how to allocate his time. White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked on 7 August 2012 whether Obama's unprecedented reelection fundraising would “impact the President's ability to do his day job?” Carney replied, “It is a simple reality that even as he is a candidate for reelection, he continues to be President of the United States, and the demands of the job restrict his capacity in some instances to focus entirely on the campaign. He simply cannot do that. So he and we carefully allocate his time working with the campaign. And when matters of state trump campaign requests for his time, that's a fact that he has to live with and we have to live with because that is his primary responsibility.”50 Two decades earlier, Ronald Reagan's deputy press secretary, Larry Speakes, addressed the tensions between campaigning and governing when discussing Reagan's efforts to support fellow Republicans in the 1982 midterm elections, explaining, “The man will be out [campaigning] three days this week. The rest of the time he will govern.”51 Both presidential aides acknowledged that time spent campaigning takes away from time dedicated to the task of governing, and vice versa.            "
"49","Presidents who devote much time to fundraising invite sharp criticism, which may or may not be merited, that they are neglecting their official duties. In early 2012, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared, “What is different about this president is that he is always campaigning,” and the RNC sent a memo to journalists accusing Obama of being a president who “prioritizes the demands of politics over the duties of governing.”52 In 2002, a Democratic spokesperson assailed George W. Bush's fundraising travel as, “A clear example of the White House using people's hard‐earned tax dollars to finance its partisan political activities.”53 In the 1990s, Republicans accused Clinton of being a “part‐time president” and “fund‐raiser‐in‐chief” who traveled around the country on “Fund‐raiser One” instead of focusing on his official presidential duties.54"
"50","It is important to be careful about what is and is not known about the impact of presidential campaign efforts. While presidents who spend more time fundraising must by necessity do less of something else, scholars and political observers have not determined just what presidents choose to do less of when they fundraise more. Critics are quick to say that presidents who dedicate much time to campaigning consequently spend less time on critical official duties. But it could be the case that time allocated to fundraising comes from time that they otherwise would spend with their family, sleeping, or attending ceremonial occasions. Kathryn Dunn Tenpas has documented that a reelection bid triggers substantial changes in the workings of the White House, shifting the focus of White House staff, altering the president's activities, and leading to fewer executive orders and legislative proposals from the White House.55 Scholars should follow up on these insights by conducting research along the lines of Terry Sullivan's detailed and illuminating study on presidential time allocation during the first 100 days of an administration in order to shed more light on how presidential schedules change when they devote more time to fundraising.56"
"51","Aides at the DNC and RNC work in conjunction with certain members of the White House staff to plan the president's fundraising activities and to minimize the impact that they will have upon his official duties. One of the ways in which they do so is by scheduling presidential fundraisers in Washington, DC or in the nearby Maryland or Virginia suburbs, which take less of a president's time than do fundraising trips to states like New York or California. Fifty‐two of Obama's 223 fundraisers—22.3 percent—for his reelection committee, the DNC, or both in his third or fourth year in office were in DC or just outside its borders. One journalist who examined presidential schedules concluded that Obama could take part in a fundraiser in a nearby hotel and be back at the White House in about an hour.57 Six of Carter's 37 such fundraisers, three of Reagan's four, three of George H.W. Bush's 30, 24 of Clinton's 111, and 11 of George W. Bush's 92 such fundraisers were held in DC or its immediate suburbs. Just as Obama's number of reelection fundraisers far exceeded that of his five predecessors, so did the number of these events held close to the White House, as his aides worked to limit the impact of these efforts upon his schedule. Nevertheless, 171 of Obama's fundraising events were held outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, requiring more of the President's time than did the smaller proportion of fundraisers that were close to the White House.            "
"52","Paradoxically, beginning reelection fundraising earlier in a president's term signals both an earlier intrusion of campaigning on the business of governing as well as an effort to minimize the impact of fundraising on the president's schedule. Given rising fundraising goals and very demanding official duties, presidents begin reelection fundraising earlier and earlier in their term in an attempt to spread out their increased efforts over a longer period of time, and thus integrate them more smoothly into a president's very tight schedule. Viewed in this light, earlier starts to fundraising can be seen as an attempt to balance campaigning and governing in a responsible way. But these earlier starts invite even more criticism that a president is neglecting his job in order to campaign."
"53","Increased presidential fundraising has also changed the ways in which a president leads his political party. The 2012 election cycle marked the integration of Obama's fundraising for his reelection committee and the DNC, since proceeds from all his events went to the Obama Victory Fund, which also benefitted the DNC. But the increased demand for Obama to raise money for his own reelection bid coincided with a decline in fundraising for fellow Democrats, aside from his DNC efforts. In the early months of 2011, he attended three DNC fundraisers, two for Senate campaigns, and one to aid candidates running for the House of Representatives. But once he headlined the first of his Obama Victory Fund events in April 2011, he did not take part in a single fundraiser for another beneficiary for the rest of that year or in 2012. While his reelection fundraising also helped down‐ticket Democrats in presidential battleground states, fellow party members in other states did not receive direct presidential fundraising help."
"54","In contrast, in addition to George W. Bush's 92 fundraisers for his reelection committee and the RNC in 2003 and 2004, he took part in another 12 fundraisers that benefited Republican candidates for the Senate, the House of Representatives, and gubernatorial races. Clinton held 111 fundraisers for his reelection committee and the DNC in 1995 and 1996, as well as another 49 fundraisers for Democrats running for office. In 1991 and 1992, George H.W. Bush headlined just 30 fundraisers for his reelection campaign and the RNC, and took part in an additional 45 fundraisers for fellow Republicans, though 23 of these benefited state parties in support of all Republicans on the ticket, including the president. While Reagan held only four fundraisers for the RNC in 1983 and 1984, he headlined an additional 31 for other Republicans. Carter took part in 26 fundraisers for fellow Democrats, in addition to the 37 he held for his reelection committee and the DNC in 1979 and 1980. A president's time is finite, and the trend over the past three decades is clear. As presidents have spent more time raising funds for themselves and their national party, their other efforts for fellow party members have declined, changing the ways that presidents perform their role as head of party when they are also seeking reelection."
"55","In the wake of Obama's record‐setting reelection fundraising, what lies ahead for fundraising and the permanent campaign? Obama's second term is likely to offer little respite from presidential fundraising. Why would the permanent campaign mentality pervade Obama's second term, given that he will never submit his candidacy to the voters again? The previous three two‐term presidents who have served since the current U.S. campaign finance system was created in the mid‐1970s engaged in extensive fundraising in their second term, as they actively embraced their role as the electoral leader of their party. Both Reagan and Clinton actually headlined more fundraisers in their second term than in their first, and George W. Bush was on course to do so before he canceled a series of fundraising events in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis."
"56","Many of the institutional and contextual factors that have incentivized presidents to devote more time to reelection fundraising have had similar effects in congressional campaigns. The combination of rising campaign costs and federal contribution limits means that members of Congress must spend a great deal of time raising campaign funds, and presidents have devoted more time to helping their party raise the financial resources necessary for success at the ballot box. Outside groups like super PACs play a role in congressional and gubernatorial races as well, heightening the pressure on the president to help fellow party members raise money in the relatively small amounts proscribed by campaign finance law in election years and non‐election years alike."
"57","Presidents see fundraising as a means to an end. In an era marked by competitive presidential elections and without long‐lasting majorities in a polarized Congress, presidents and their parties have more to gain or lose in any particular election. Presidents know that their and their party's electoral successes will strengthen their ability to win much‐desired policy victories. In this view, governing does not suffer because of more time spent campaigning. Instead, it is a means to achieve the goal of governing more effectively. Indeed, Democrats in the spring of 2013 were already touting Obama's early commitment to win back a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2014 midterm elections. The chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attested in March 2013 that “The president understands that to get anything done, he needs a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. To have a legacy in 2016, he will need a House majority in 2014, and that work has to start now.”58"
"58","Although each political party has frequently criticized increased fundraising by presidents of the other party, it is important to understand that the rules of the U.S. campaign finance system drive these dynamics. If campaign costs continue to rise, presidential elections continue to be competitive, and the same institutional rules remain in place, the president elected in 2016 will probably exceed Barack Obama's record fundraising efforts if he or she seeks reelection in 2020. What might result if campaign finance rules are changed? Perhaps raising the amount of the maximum individual contribution or removing the limit altogether would relieve some of the pressure on presidents to fundraise, since they could then raise more money from fewer donors. But presidents might not scale back their time spent fundraising; instead, their efforts might simply yield more campaign funds. The consequences of reform are difficult to predict. Modifying the public funding program so that it provides more resources might offer a greater incentive for presidential aspirants to participate and thus accept the associated spending caps, which limited both fundraising and spending by presidential campaigns for almost three decades. But such legislation is unlikely to gain traction in the current political climate. While the merits of potential reforms can be debated, what is clear is that if current campaign finance legislation remains unchanged, laws that sought to restrict the role of money in electoral politics will continue to incentivize presidents and candidates to devote increasing amounts of their scarcest asset, their time, to fundraising.*"
