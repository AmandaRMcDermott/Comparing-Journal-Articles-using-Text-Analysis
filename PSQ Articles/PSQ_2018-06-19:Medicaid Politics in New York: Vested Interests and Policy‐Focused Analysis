"1","MEDICAID IS THE LARGEST HEALTH care insurance program in the nation, covering some 77 million people at an annual cost of more than $565 billion. It insures low‐income individuals, children, the disabled, the mentally ill, and some of the aged. The federal and state governments jointly fund Medicaid. Individual states determine eligibility rules and benefits levels. Federal law requires roughly 40 percent of Medicaid spending, while 60 percent is done at the states’ discretion.1 Medicaid has steadily expanded since its creation in 1965, culminating in the passage of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which brought millions of new people under its auspices. Medicaid's trajectory defied predictions that a means‐tested program for the poor would be ripe for retrenchment. Although states continue to vary greatly in the generosity of their programs, Medicaid also flouted predictions that interstate competition would produce a “race to the bottom.” As a result, the politics of Medicaid are different from other redistributionist policies that target the poor, such as welfare and low‐income housing, which have been subject to retrenchment.2"
"2","Medicaid's high costs put pressure on state budgets.3 Governors develop a “love‐hate” relationship with the program—appreciating the federal dollars but detesting the rising costs—that shapes state politics.4 In New York State, every governor since Nelson Rockefeller (1959–1973) has tried and failed to reduce Medicaid spending. Instead, the program has grown as a result of political pressure from the state's giant health care union, United Healthcare Workers East of the Service Employees International Union (1199SEIU), and the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), which represents 175 hospitals and nursing homes in the New York City metro region. These groups have deployed lobbying and electioneering power to defeat calls for retrenchment and instead expand the program's generosity.         "
"3","This article tells a bottom‐up story of New York's Medicaid politics. It pays particular attention to the neglected role of labor unions in blocking retrenchment and enabling expansion of the state's Medicaid program. Prior studies of the role of interest groups in Medicaid politics have found that they are sources of program durability and expansion. But little attention has been paid to the process by which durability and expansion are achieved. A look at New York helps us see how and why certain groups have been crucial in defending the program. New York is unusual in the Medicaid world, which makes its politics substantively important. Its program is the most expensive and generous (in terms of both access and coverage) in the nation. Decisions made in New York have at times shaped development of the program at the federal level. And New York's politics are distinctive insofar as a union plays an outsized role—especially after creating a partnership with hospital management to enhance its clout.         "
"4","The article has two aims. The first is to make a theoretical contribution to the study of the politics of public policy. I argue that we need to refine and enlarge the conceptual tools available in the emerging school of “policy‐focused political science,” which has sought to revive scholarly attention to interest groups.5 More specifically, I argue that Terry Moe's theory of “vested interests” needs to be incorporated into what Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have labeled the “Schattschneider” approach.6"
"5","Interest group theories were once at the forefront of the study of American politics. Yet they lost pride of place in the 1970s and 1980s when new theoretical approaches placed politicians, voters, and elections at the center of the action. Recently, Hacker and Pierson have challenged the dominance of such “Downsian” approaches in the field. They argue that interest groups are the driving forces behind the politics of public policy. Therefore, interest groups should be at the heart of theory. Others have been working in a similar vein. A group of scholars argue that America's political parties are best understood as coalitions of interest groups and that politicians adopt policies beneficial to those groups in ways that are invisible to ill‐informed voters.7"
"6","A movement is afoot to pay greater attention to organized groups. However, it remains to be seen where this new line of inquiry will lead. In this article, I seek to move that agenda forward. There is great value in using the Schattschneider approach in the Medicaid context. For instance, among those working in the Downsian tradition, there is a long‐standing debate about whether variation in state Medicaid generosity is driven by party structures or socioeconomic variables.8 Yet it may be that organized interests, pushed into the background in this debate, are the real divers of state generosity. The Schattschneider approach provides a rationale to return groups to the foreground by highlighting the importance of initial policy decisions, the power of the status quo, and the force of information asymmetries, which serve to make organized interests rather than voters and elections the determinants of policy stability or change.         "
"7","However, the Schattschneider approach needs conceptual refinement. It needs better tools to account for how interest groups work themselves into government. The politics of public policy are intricately woven. To understand the essential elements, we must pull them apart. The concept of vested interests helps us do that. Thinking in terms of vested interests helps demarcate the different sorts of interest groups as well as their means and motives. It also clarifies differences in their relative power and shows how they acquire their political clout.9"
"8","For reasons detailed below, scholarship in the Schattschnieder tradition has failed to pay enough attention to the fully array of groups, such that some have been poorly treated or overlooked. While existing research has noted the importance of interest groups in Medicaid policy, the vested interests that I identify in this paper have been understudied. In particular, labor unions as a force in Medicaid politics have gone largely unnoticed in prior scholarship.10 As a first step in correcting that neglect, this article highlights how unions are different from other provider groups (such as insurance companies, physicians, and hospitals) insofar as they can mobilize a mass membership and engage in electioneering on a level and scale that other provider groups cannot replicate. Furthermore, in New York, labor forged an alliance with hospitals to create a potent partnership that studies of individual provider groups miss. These groups also wove themselves into both political parties’ coalitions. In short, prior work has shown that provider groups matter, but not enough has been done to show why they matter.         "
"9","My second aim is to provide a case study of New York's Medicaid program. With billions of dollars at stake, the battle to control New York's Medicaid policy has been consequential for state and national politics. New York has been anomalous since it created its Medicaid program in 1966. Governor Rockefeller pushed for an expansive program—one that consumed 35 percent of the nation's Medicaid expenditures in 1967 and, if allowed to continue, would have covered half the state's population.11 This forced the federal government to decide whether to embrace his vision of Medicaid as a stepping stone to universal coverage or instead to restrict program eligibility.12 It chose the latter. More recently, New York has been a leader among states in covering children (Child Health Plus) and extending coverage to uninsured adults (Family Health Plus).13 It has also helped pioneer the use of federal waivers to move a large number of Medicaid enrollees into managed care and to expand coverage.14"
"10","Today, New York's Medicaid program is more expensive and more generous than those of other states because of high enrollment, broad coverage, and politicized rate setting.15 In 2016, the program covered some 5.7 million of the state's 19.7 million residents, or more than one in four New Yorkers. New York accounts for roughly 12 percent of all U.S. Medicaid spending.16 By controlling this portion of total spending, decisions made at the state level have national repercussions.17"
"11","An analysis of New York also gives us leverage on the variation in state level Medicaid generosity, which is central to Medicaid's overall political development. Today, New York spends more on a per capita basis on Medicaid than any other state. With Medicaid accounting for one‐third of New York's budget ($54 billion), the state spends more on Medicaid than the total state budgets of 43 other states and more on the program than Texas, Florida, and North Carolina combined.18 For example, spending per disabled enrollee in 2015 was only $10,142 in Alabama compared with $33,808 in the New York.19 New York's politics explains why it is a divergent case in terms of Medicaid generosity compared with other states.         "
"12","Finally, looking at Medicaid politics from the bottom up, rather than just the top down (as many recent studies of Medicaid politics focus on what happens in Washington), shows the process by which labor unions representing hospital and nursing home workers have shaped the program. The role of unions in buttressing Medicaid in the states helps explain why national partisan alignments of Medicaid politics are not mirrored at the state level. While New York is distinctive in terms of the outsized role that labor unions have played in Medicaid politics, other states—such as California, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, Washington, and Minnesota—display similar patterns. They should be subjects of future research."
"13","All told, I incorporate the concept of vested interests into policy‐focused political science to show how they are central to the politics of a major policy area. I argue that the key to understanding New York's health care policy lies in the role of powerful interest groups rather than in competition between the two parties. If we want to understand Medicaid politics in New York, we need to understand how policy gives rise to vested interests and how those vested interests then shape politics. I document how vested interests have been molding New York's health care policy for decades. I derive evidence from an exhaustive collection of newspaper articles, government documents, public statements of policymakers, foundation and think tank reports, and the scholarly literature."
"14","Hacker and Pierson argue that the Downsian approach poorly explains the politics of many public policies and seek to replace it with a “Schattschneiderian” one. Downs's median voter theorem posited that in order to win elections, politicians in a two‐party system will converge on the center of the ideological distribution.20 In Downs's view, politicians craft policies that appeal to voters, and, with a few caveats, voters’ preferences should be reflected in eventual outcomes, as they will hew largely in the direction of the median voter.21 While the Downsian perspective has many attractive features, it also has shortcomings.22 It pushed interest groups to the periphery; it is agnostic about policy details; and it is ill quipped to deal with policy change.         "
"15","Hacker and Pierson's approach seeks to clarify what the Downsian model obscured. The Schattschneider perspective focuses on organized interests. It stresses the importance of policies over elections and interest groups over voters. And it develops Schattschneider's insight that “new policies create a new politics,” which highlights how initial policy decisions and features of the policy itself shape future political combat.23 The key actors in these battles are not poorly informed voters in periodic elections but well‐informed organized interests with long time horizons.         "
"16","Scholars working in this tradition show how public policies impact politics. Changes in a policy alter the political contestation surrounding it, a process called a “policy feedback.”24 Using this conceptual tool, scholars show how new policies (or changes to old policies) reconfigure the interest group environment and reshape the political behavior of elites and the mass public. Scholars have focused attention on the political mobilization of program beneficiaries—welfare recipients, the elderly, veterans, homeowners, and others.25 They document how program recipients learn to conceive of themselves as a group, form a new constituency, and organize to protect the program from changes that are deemed antithetical to their interests. Policy feedback has been fecund in explaining the politics of Social Security, the GI Bill, the home mortgage interest tax deduction, and more.         "
"17","Critics of the Schattschneider approach and the policy feedback literature charge that it is too broad conceptually to offer much analytic leverage, especially in the health policy context.26 While the approach makes organized interests central, it does not give much guidance on how to think or theorize about the organized. Existing work raises several questions. Do policy feedbacks produce similar sorts of organized interests? Are there different types of organized interests? How can we identify the most important groups in a given policy area? What are their distinguishing traits and political incentives? We lack good concepts to deal with these questions. The Schattschneider tradition has identified recipient groups as a “type” and established their importance. However, many other groups remain analytically unidentified. As a result, we miss important things theoretically and empirically.27"
"18","What makes Moe's theory of vested interests so valuable is that it pays attention to a wider array of groups than just a public policy's beneficiaries. Moe defines a vested interest as any group that receives material benefits directly from existing institutional arrangements, and those benefits must be concentrated on the group rather than the mass public.28 Vested interests are those with a tangible, immediate, and focused stake in the political and policy outcomes in a given area. The classic vested interests are business firms. Insurance companies have a vested interest in the health care system. Agribusiness has a vested interest in farm subsidies. And so on. Yet mass constituencies that benefit from programs, nonprofit groups that receive government grants, and public employee unions can also be considered vested interests. Ideological groups, on the other hand, are not vested interests. The issue, according to Moe, is that we simply have not thought of recipient groups or business firms as vested interests, which has drawn attention away from salient aspects of the politics of public policy.         "
"19","The concept of vested interests provides a way to better specify the different sorts of organized interests operating in a given policy area. It focuses our attention on the most important among them because vested interests will seek to maximize the concentrated material benefits they can directly secure from a policy system. Thinking in terms of vested interests forces us to pay close attention to incentives and concentrate on groups who may mold policy in ways that are contrary to the public interest—or at least contrary to voters’ preferences. Vested interests are intent on securing material benefits, sometimes in ways that have nothing to do with whether public services are efficient or effective. Sometimes vested interests may benefit most when programs are costly and inefficient. All this stands in contrast to the policy feedback literature, in which the policies are usually seen as “good” by and for those who receive them and questions about the programs’ affordability, efficiency, and effectiveness are pushed to the margins."
"20","Consequently, vested interests turn up in areas in which information asymmetries are large and policy outcomes are detached from voters’ preferences. Vested interests are the most knowledgeable and best‐resourced actors. They are also likely to be indifferent to political party and willing to strike deals with whoever is in power. Of course, many historical institutionalist scholars discover instances in which the desires of vested interests and those of the public are at odds. For example, Hacker's Divided Welfare State shows how all sorts of special interests perverted the development of the American welfare state.29 Recent scholars of Medicaid politics have also noted the importance of health care providers (doctors, hospitals, retirement homes) in Medicaid's durability.30 However, neither Hacker nor the Medicaid scholars hone in on vested interests or draw any analytic conclusions from them.         "
"21","This article shows how vested interests matter. Consideration of them helps us refine existing theoretical frameworks. The Schattschneider approach brings interest groups back to center stage and shows how they are central to the politics of public policy. Thinking about vested interests forces us to untangle the interest group environment and look at the groups that are the most fundamental. It turns out that some key groups have been insufficiently treated in prior studies. The concept of vested interests concentrates our attention on groups’ incentives, resources, and strategies for weaving themselves into the policymaking apparatus.         "
"22","Medicaid politics in New York offers a vivid example of how the Schattschneider framework and the concept of vested interests work together to provide a compelling account of the politics of public policy. Prior studies of Medicaid policy formation that treat the role of interest groups tend to look at their activity at the federal level or how groups shape intergovernmental relations between federal and state officials.31 They focus on national partisan alignments, intergovernmental financing structures, and other attributes of the program to explain Medicaid's development. The vested interests studied here (especially labor unions) go almost unnoticed as a force strengthening Medicaid. Among the studies that examine interest groups at the state level, attention has been concentrated on recipients (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance for Needy Families qualifiers, children, seniors, the disabled), their advocates (civic organizations, churches, nonprofits), or provide­rs (physicians, insurance companies, hospitals).32 These studies have identified recipient groups that result from policy feedbacks as the sources of programmatic stability. But that takes us only so far because it does not make sufficient distinctions between them. Nor do these studies closely trace the process by which provider groups come to matter in Medicaid politics.         "
"23","Using the Schattschneider framework and the concept of vested interests, I provide an up‐close look at groups that have been remarkably politically active at the state level but have received limited treatment in prior scholarship. Labor unions have been understudied in Medicaid politics and the study of New York shows how they can matter profoundly. I show how labor unions (1199SEIU) and hospitals (GNYHA) shape important state policy, often through alliances with each other and with both political parties that studying provider groups separately would miss. This is crucial because states’ internal politics shape their relations with the federal government.33"
"24","Medicaid in New York and nationally was profoundly shaped by Governor Nelson Rockefeller's decision to adopt an expansive program in 1966.34 New York's program built on one of the nation's largest Kerr‐Mills programs, which had brought in more federal dollars to pay for health care for the poor. Rockefeller sought to capitalize on Medicaid's federal‐state financing scheme of open‐ended matching grants to develop the most generous state plan in the nation.35 Although the federal government soon limited New York's policy, its initial program would have covered half of the state's population.36 New York established itself among the states that viewed Medicaid not only as a program for the poor but also as a step toward universal health insurance for its residents—a view that Rockefeller vigorously defended in Washington.         "
"25","New York's initial decision to create a program with middle‐class eligibility had a big impact on policy and politics down the line. Liberal eligibility requirements and broad coverage provisions out of the gate made reducing expenditures in the future more difficult. This is because they meant more business for hospitals and nursing homes, as more people gained access to insurance coverage, and more jobs for those working in those institutions."
"26","The feedback effects of New York's initial Medicaid decisions were the creation of vested interests in the form of 1199SEIU and the GNYHA. Both receive concentrated material benefits directly from current policy arrangements.37 The union represents hospital and nursing home workers throughout New York State, and GNYHA represents hospitals in the New York City metro region. Health care workers have vested interests in their jobs. They want higher pay, more job security, and better working conditions. The union's job is to protect and advance workers’ interests. Hospitals and nursing homes have a vested interest in financial stability and increased revenue. The collaboration of these two groups gave 1199SEIU more political leverage, and the hospitals a way to participate more directly in political campaigns.         "
"27","Medicaid is at once one of New York's largest budgetary appropriations and a critically important revenue source for the hospitals that employ members of 1199SEIU. The vast majority of 1199 members work for hospitals and homes that are legally chartered as private nonprofit organizations. Yet a significant percentage of the revenue stream that funds member salaries, and thus their dues to the union, comes from government programs. In New York City's five largest medical centers, all of which employ 1199 members, Medicaid provides one‐third of the annual revenues, on average, and another third comes from Medicare. (This is because some 70 percent of New York State's Medicaid recipients live in the New York City metro region.) Thus, to a large extent, 1199SEIU members are private workers paid with public dollars, making it a quasi–public sector union. And a number of hospitals, while nominally private nonprofits, have increasingly become parts of the state's social service apparatus."
"28","Why is this important? Because more state Medicaid spending—especially increases in reimbursement rates—increases the hospitals and homes’ bottom lines, allowing them to pass along revenue gains to workers. This has broader implications for public policy formation. Medicaid politics in New York is a quasi‐intergovernmental dispute, as the lines between public and private institutions are blurred."
"29","A new policy created a new set of constituents and changed their political incentives and behavior. Their political activity as organized interests largely followed rather than preceded major policy change. The GNHYA was a long‐standing trade association founded in 1904 that that advocated on behalf of hospitals. Medicaid changed the character of the GNHYA's member hospitals. New York has long had some of the most prestigious and well‐endowed teaching hospitals. Medicaid boosted less affluent hospitals and public institutions but made them heavily dependent on Medicaid payments. By the late 1980s, some 60 percent of hospital and 85 percent of nursing home revenue came from Medicaid. Balancing the demands of these two groups—the former sought independence and the latter wanted more political activity—became one of the association's primary challenges. The Medicaid‐dependent hospitals became a new and powerful constituency that reoriented GNYHA advocacy efforts in state politics. The rise of Medicaid also impacted hospital labor relations, which the GNYHA coordinated through its collective bargaining arm, the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes.38"
"30","Prior to the passage of Medicaid, 1199 began modestly, as a small union of pharmacists and drug clerks led by Leon Davis.39 In 1958, Davis and a few other pharmacists with communist and socialist roots set out to organize New York City's hospitals.40 The health care sector was then sometimes referred to as the “quiet zone” of labor relations. Trustees of “voluntary” hospitals, which are nonprofit public charities, opposed unionization on grounds similar to the opposition to government unionization.41 In their view, hospitals could not be fully committed to the public good and loyal to their donors and engage in collective bargaining. Adversarial labor relations, they claimed, were at odds with the hospitals’ charitable mission.         "
"31","That position soon crumbled under bottom‐up pressure from the union and top‐down pressure from the state. After organizing Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx in 1959, 1199 proceeded to organize Mount Sinai, Lenox Hill, Beth Israel, and other hospitals in Manhattan. The union succeeded by wearing down hospital boards with strikes.42 Even more pivotal was 1199's discovery that the most effective way to win over hospital management was government intervention. A pattern emerged in which 1199 would threaten hospital management with a strike, then the city or state government would arrive at the last minute with funds to prevent it. The hospitals soon learned that government monies could be useful to their bottom lines.         "
"32","In 1962, another 1199‐led strike induced Governor Rockefeller to grant health care workers collective bargaining rights. He signed legislation that year that amended the New York State Labor Relations Act. By 1968, 1199 had gained a foothold in the city. Over the next 20 years, as 1199 organized the rest of the city's voluntary hospitals, workers’ wages increased by 140 percent, their benefit packages were enriched, and their job security was bolstered. The union also launched membership drives in the nursing homes, as Medicaid in New York, as elsewhere, pays for long‐term care for the elderly, mentally ill, and developmentally disabled.43 Unionization of the health care sector thus coincided with the rise of public sector unions.44 As labor historian Joshua Freeman has noted, “1199's expansion into hospitals and nursing homes was, with the exception of the unionization of public employees, New York labor's most important organizing success of the post‐World War II era.”45"
"33","By making 1199 into a quasi‐public union, state policy shaped its behavioral incentives. Like public sector unions, 1199 argued that what is good for union members is good for the public. As an issue of its monthly newsletter put it, “Saving our hospitals isn't just about jobs, but also about healthcare for the people.”46 In this view, the hospital workers’ vested interests in their jobs chime with the public's interest in quality health care. Such messaging by vested interests and allied politicians has been part of a long‐term effort to mobilize 1199 members and shift public opinion.47 The vested interests’ messaging highlights some of Medicaid's effects (such as how it protects seniors) while obscuring others (such as its high costs). Such rhetoric helps frame the Medicaid debate for ill‐informed voters in ways that make the vested interests’ positions appear sympathetic and unthreatening.         "
"34","Medicaid politics in New York have been profoundly shaped by Governor Rockefeller's initial decision to create a generous program, which, in turn, generated powerful vested interests intent on sustaining that generosity and arrogating some of it to themselves. Medicaid policy in New York has continued on an upward trajectory of greater access and more extensive coverage for program beneficiaries, with the state and the federal government paying a larger bill. At the same time, the vested interests became entrenched as they increased their political resources."
"35","New York's adoption of an expansive Medicaid program facilitated the vested interests’ acquisition of political resources. Although the GNYHA is somewhat constrained in the political realm by the nonprofit status of its member hospitals, it found a number of ways around those strictures. It brings its policy expertise to bear by submitting letters stating its policy positions to state agencies and when its leaders testify before the legislature. In 1984, the GNYHA gained a steady leader in Kenneth Raske, who has headed the association ever since. Raske began informal talks with 1199 leaders in 1989, which transformed the association's relationship with the union from oppositional to collaborative. Finally, the GNYHA created a portfolio of business subsidiaries called GNYHA Ventures, which make direct donations to political campaigns. As the “largest business enterprise of any trade association in the U.S.,” the GNYHA's advocacy efforts receive substantial financial support from this source. In 2008, GNYHA Ventures made almost $100 million in revenue and provided some $14 million for advocacy purposes.48 From 2006 to 2012, the GNYHA was the third‐largest “soft money” donor to party committees in New York State, giving almost $3 million.49"
"36","Turning to 1199, which has a freer hand to engage in political activity than the nonprofit hospitals, its political resources may be measured in terms of the size of its membership, campaign and lobbying expenditures, and ties to the state political establishment. Today, 1199 has nearly 400,000 members in New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, Florida, and Washington, DC. It is the nation's largest union local and perhaps the largest local in the world.50,51 It has also been one of the fastest‐growing unions: between 2002 and 2013, its membership grew from 225,000 to 347,000, as it enlisted other locals to merge with it. In turn, 1199's merger with the Service Employees International Union in 1998 made SEIU the fastest‐growing unions in the nation and a major lobbying force in Washington for the Affordable Care Act.         "
"37","State laws allow 1199 to automatically deduct union dues from hospital employees’ paychecks. The result is a large treasury. According to mandatory reporting to the U.S. Department of Labor, 1199's annual budget is about $185 million, most of which comes from members’ $18 to $75 monthly dues. Annual revenues between 2002 and 2013 grew from $118 million to $184 million.52"
"38","Of the four main forms of political activity through which New York interest groups pursue their aims—lobbying at the state and local levels and state and local campaign contributions—1199 spends the most by far on state‐level lobbying. State reports show that the Healthcare Education Project, the fruit of the partnership between 1199SEIU and the GNYHA, spent $30.7 million between 2005 and 2015, more than any other interest group, including the powerful New York State United Teachers.53 So while 1199 cares deeply about what voters do and makes significant investments in election campaigns, it places competition for votes second to lobbying in Albany.54"
"39","In addition, 1199 is consistently among the state's largest campaign contributors. According to the National Institute for Money in State Politics, it gave $9.5 million between 1997 and 2014. The union's “hard money” contributions reveal that it gives equally to both parties: the New York Senate Republican Campaign Committee received $1,348,800, and the New York Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee received $1,313,250.55 The union's get‐out‐the‐vote ground operation, whose efforts do not count as a campaign contribution and whose value is hard to measure, is reputed to be highly effective. Its politically active membership makes it adept at retail campaign operations, such a knocking on doors, passing out flyers, emailing constituents, and calling voters.         "
"40","Another way that 1199 exercises influence at the state and city levels is through the Working Families Party (WFP). Along with several other unions and activist groups, 1199 founded the WFP in 1998 (and 1199 remains the WFP's largest financial supporter). The WFP exploits New York's “fusion” electoral system. In that system, minor parties have their own ballot line but can cross‐endorse major‐party candidates. To avoid a challenger running on their left flank and potentially splitting the vote, Democrats must secure the WFP's endorsement. With a 40‐person full‐time staff and 500 paid election canvassers, the WFP is New York's most important third party.56"
"41","The union has also woven itself into the tapestry of the Democratic Party.57 Longtime union president Dennis Rivera was a member of the Democratic National Committee and a vice chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee. Consider, too, the career of Jennifer Cunningham, who was once described by the New York Post as “the most powerful woman in Albany.”58 She joined 1199SEIU in 1999 and today works for the lobbying and consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker, which advised Governor Andrew Cuomo on his Medicaid Redesign Team.59 She began her career with Victor Gotbaum's AFSCME (American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) District Council 37, a union that represents public employees in New York City, and then served as staffer for Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic Speaker of the New York State Assembly.60"
"42","Finally, 1199 has made itself indispensable to the larger liberal coalition in New York. It has sustained its liberal bona fides by helping advance a broader agenda that has included tenant's rights, same‐sex marriage, universal health care, tax increases, climate change, and expansive immigration policy.61 The union has underwritten “living wage” campaigns, including the “Fight for $15” fast‐food workers’ movement, and lent support to Black Lives Matter protests. These activities cost the union little in money or manpower but provide political cover for a union that has been closely allied with hospital management and New York Republican Party.         "
"43","The union's and GNYHA's political resources make them among the most well‐endowed organized interests in the state. They have channeled these resources through all of the main political parties and linked them to other politically active groups in the state. The political parties are, in this light, vehicles for the achieving the vested interests’ aims. If New York's political parties are coalitions of “intense policy demanders,” then 1199 and GNYHA are among some of the most intense demanders and have inserted themselves into both parties’ coalition.62 Therefore, New York politicians have navigated the competing demands of voters and organized interests by crafting policy in ways that can satisfy both. With their arsenal of political weapons, New York's vested interests have sustained an expansionary Medicaid policy for over nearly a half century.         "
"44","The expansive origins of New York's Medicaid program and the powerful vested interests it generated soon made Medicaid costs a significant political issue. By the mid‐1970s, state health expenditures had become the third‐largest category and were steadily increasing.63 To control rising costs, Governor Hugh Carey (1975–1983) sought to reduce the number of hospital beds and monitor the treatments that doctors were ordering for Medicaid recipients.64 Carey's successor, Mario Cuomo (1983–1995), also sought Medicaid retrenchment to free up money for other policy initiatives. Yet their efforts to control costs often made them more uncontrollable. Governor Carey signed a law in 1982 that created New York's Prospective Hospital Reimbursement Methodology, the system by which the state legislature set the price of every procedure in every hospital. Designed to get a grip on health care expenditures, state control relaxed the need for hospitals to run efficiently, as it funneled revenues into failing hospitals by skimming from those that were well run.65 It also made it politically more difficult to downscale or close struggling hospitals.         "
"45","These initiatives prompted 1199 to mobilize and adopt new tactics to mold policy in ways favorable to its interests. The shift to greater state intervention meant that while 1199SEIU retained its traditional labor union tools, politics became the center of the union's focus. Prior to the 1980s, 1199 pursued the ends of better wages and conditions for its members through the standard trade union methods of collective bargaining, organizing campaigns, and strikes. Yet beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, 1199 became deeply involved in state politics to stave off Medicaid cuts. The new politics that emerged was more consensual than conflictual. As GNYHA president Raske put it, “times have changed, combativeness and combustibility don't work [in the health care sector].”66"
"46","Elected president of 1199 in 1989, Dennis Rivera guided the union's change of course. Rivera's leadership steadied the union internally, paved the way for a variety of locals to join 1199, transformed 1199 into a powerful organized interest, and affiliated 1199 with SEIU.67 Rivera's strategic redirection meant forming alliances with former adversaries. One was with New York City–area hospital management and the other with the state Republican Party.         "
"47","The union's first big treaty was with hospital management through the GNYHA. Rivera and Raske began working together on an informal basis in 1989.68 The alliance took organizational form with the creation of the joint Healthcare Education Project in the 1990s. As a “social welfare organization,” the organization spends extensively on state politics. The hospitals needed more revenue if they were to offer their workers a better deal. Labor and management realized that, as Raske put it, “government [held] the key to all our problems.”69 Government could eliminate labor and management's traditionally adversarial relationship, if they could extract greater economic rents from the state.         "
"48","With the Healthcare Education Project, 1199's political advocacy accelerated. The union expanded its activities with a multimillion‐dollar Committee on Political Education fund derived from voluntary contributions of $5 to $10 from some 125,000 members. Of this shift, Jennifer Cunningham, a top Rivera lieutenant said, “[We took] the existing [union] culture of giving to political candidates and ramp[ed] it up to a whole new level.” Cunningham attributed the union's political success to “the ability to mobilize voters around a public policy issue, sophistication of materials, and frankly, a boatload of cash.”70"
"49","The union's second alliance was with the state GOP, which controlled the governorship and state senate during 1990s and early 2000s, when Medicaid expanded significantly. The big shift in Medicaid politics came during Republican George Pataki's governorship (1995–2007). Pataki began his term in office bent on austerity, asserting, “We have learned from our experience with Medicaid that more spending does not mean better care. New York State is committed to providing the finest health care possible in an efficient and effective fashion.”71 By his final State of the State address, however, better health care had come to be defined as expanded enrollment in Medicaid.72 The reason for the flip‐flop was that the Republican Party's power was eroding in the state. Republicans needed political resources to sustain themselves. Both 1199 and GNYHA could offer those resources. Joining hands with a progressive union could also help Republicans moderate their image in a fairly liberal state. With 1199 and GNYHA enjoying solid alliances with Republicans in the state Senate and Democrats in the Assembly, that left only the governor as a possible obstacle.         "
"50","Elected in 1994, Pataki ran smack into the vested interests spawned by the state's Medicaid program. Pataki's attempt to cut Medicaid inevitably involved trimming expenditures on senior citizens in nursing homes. This effort was met with brutal attack ads from the vested interests suggesting that vulnerable seniors would be hurt. These attacks damaged Pataki's poll numbers. He was forced to choose between winning reelection and cutting Medicaid. He chose the former. Therefore, after opposing Pataki in his initial bid for office in 1994, 1199SEIU remained neutral in his 1998 reelection campaign and in 2002 endorsed Pataki outright.73"
"51","The vested interests’ relationship to the state legislature was more straightforward. The union's partnership with the Republican Party in the legislature had a longer history since 1199 had been one of the largest donors to the state senate GOP's campaign coffers for years. Republican Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader from 1994 to 2008, also became friends with Rivera.74 In addition, 1199SEIU had long enjoyed a productive relationship with the Democratic majority in the Assembly and was close to Speaker Silver. With the governor neutralized, these alliances preserved New York's expansive Medicaid program and set the table for even more growth.         "
"52","In 1999, 1199 achieved a major breakthrough. A $13 million lobbying campaign pressured state lawmakers to appropriate more than $1 billion to expand Medicaid. Called Family Health Plus (FHP), the program extended coverage to about one million out of the three million uninsured New Yorkers.75 FHP provides health coverage to working families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. It was initially funded by a 55‐cent increase in the cigarette tax and a share of the federal tobacco settlement. In 2010, there were some 425,000 people enrolled in FHP, and it was the fastest‐growing part of New York's Medicaid program. FHP is a good example of vested interests locking in future expenditures to maintain their position.         "
"53","New York's final Medicaid expansion came in the fall of 2001, when Pataki and Rivera negotiated a deal, which the legislature approved in early 2002. The deal sp­­­ecifically provided $750 million in wage subsidies for 1199 members out of a larger $1.8 billion package in pay raises for hospital workers.76 To express its gratitude, the union endorsed Pataki's run for a third term as governor. The plan's financing rested on $4.5 billion in hoped‐for new federal contributions to the state's Medicaid program, an increase in the cigarette tax, and some $1 billion in expected proceeds from the conversion of the nonprofit insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield into a for‐profit company.77"
"54","The Blue Cross Blue Shield conversion was idiosyncratic. States usually use conversion profits to endow independent health‐related charitable foundations to support scientific inquiry and underwrite health care for the dispossessed. New York, however, commandeered the initial public offering (IPO) proceeds and appropriated those monies to subsidize hospitals and underwrite workers raises, that is reward the vested interests.78 In New York, only 5 percent of the IPO's market value was given to the newly created New York State Health Foundation.79 Between 2006 and 2016, the foundation has awarded only $117 million in grants. Critics argued that there were few benefits for the public in the Blue Cross Blue Shield conversion and questioned the link between boosting union workers salaries and improving public health.80 Nonetheless, the Medicaid spending and pay increases became the new floor from which 1199SEIU and the GNYHA would work in the future.         "
"55","One of the strongest testaments to 1199's influence is that Medicaid enrollment in New York now stands at 6.5 million, as opposed to 2.7 million when Governor Pataki first took office (one in four New Yorkers are now covered by Medicaid)—and this was during a period when the state lost more than one million residents.81 Increased enrollment combined with higher salaries and better job protections for 1199 members are indications that the vested interests were getting more of what they wanted, which was jobs and money.         "
"56","However, given the squeeze that Medicaid was putting on the state budget in return for limited improvements in the public health, Governor Eliot Spitzer (2007–2008) sought to push back against 1199SEIU and the GNYHA. Confident that he possessed a reform mandate after having been elected with nearly 70 percent of the vote, Spitzer proposed expanding government health insurance through cuts to hospitals.82 He called 1199SEIU and the GNYHA “defenders of the status quo.”83 They responded to this provocation with a multimillion‐dollar ad campaign that significantly reduced Spitzer's public approval rating.84 Spitzer fought back with an ad campaign financed by his family fortune. However, with Bruno, 1199's ally, in control of the Republican Senate, few of Spitzer's proposed cuts were enacted.85 After Spitzer was forced to resign as governor for frequenting prostitutes, his successor, David Paterson (2008–2010), also tried to impose Medicaid cuts in the teeth of the Great Recession. His proposals fared no better than Spitzer's.         "
"57","Adopting a posture of cooperation rather than confrontation, Governor Andrew Cuomo (2011–present) has enjoyed good relations with 1199SEIU and the GNYHA. Upon taking office, Cuomo made a deal with the vested interests. To reduce Medicaid expenditures, Cuomo offered Rivera and Raske places on his Medicaid Redesign Team, so that they could help identify ways to cut payments to the hospitals. In effect, Cuomo asked the vested interests to make policy that was suitable to them. To build support for the deal in the legislature and among the public, 1199/GNYHA spent $6.8 million on a monthlong campaign of television ads and other communications.86 The aim, once again, was to move public opinion in a direction favorable to the vested interests’ position.         "
"58","Cuomo's strategy pushed Medicaid policy into the background and eliminated conflict with 1199SEIU and the GNYHA. However, New York has yet to get Medicaid spending under control, as it grew at more than twice the rate of inflation between 2000 and 2010. The enrollment expansion begun under Cuomo's predecessors has also continued. Expanding access, of course, will inevitably increase costs. None of the changes made by the Medicaid Redesign Team reduced eligibility or eliminated optional benefits, either of which would have cut costs. Cuomo's hope for cost containment is that the federal government will grant New York more administrative flexibility under the Affordable Care Act.87"
"59","Once at the center of the study of American politics, interest groups have been pushed to the margins. Recently, prominent scholars have argued that we should bring them back to center stage. This article is a contribution to this new line of inquiry. It shows that there is great value in current approaches, but they need conceptual refinement to figure out how interest groups are woven into the fabric of government. I have argued that thinking in terms of vested interest gets us to focus on groups that have been understudied in Medicaid policy formation. I make this case by examining New York, the state with arguably the most powerful labor union and, perhaps as a result, the largest and most generous Medicaid program in the nation."
"60","The study of New York's Medicaid politics supports the key propositions of the Schattschneider approach. First, the case shows that the state's initial decision to adopt an expansive program had profound consequences for later politics. Second, it underscores how policy feedbacks created powerful vested interests. Third, it illustrates how Medicaid policy is a huge “prize” that attracts vested interests eager to use the power of the state to secure material benefits. Fourth, it confirms the significance of policy‐relevant information asymmetries, as New York's Medicaid system generates concentrated benefits but diffuses and obscures costs. Fifth, it illuminates how vested interests are in it for the long haul and outlast shifting electoral majorities. Finally, it validates the claim that it is harder for politicians to take away benefits than hand them out because politicians fear the political consequences of imposing cuts on programs from which powerful groups benefit."
"61","This article also demonstrates the analytic value of the concept of vested interest to the study of New York Medicaid politics. Together, 1199SEIU and the GNYHA form the cornerstone of what is sometimes referred to as New York's “medical‐industrial complex.”88 Thinking in terms of vested interests gets us to hone in on the material incentives for their political behavior. Meanwhile thinking in terms of policy feedbacks alone would lead us to focus on program recipients rather than providers. Yet it is 1199SEIU and GNYHA's advocacy efforts that have made the health care jobs some of the most stable and secure in New York, which is good for workers. They have also pressured the state government to increase access to the program, which is good for beneficiaries.89 In short, tracing the activity of the vested interests shows how development of the New York health policy system has created some winners (1199, hospitals, nursing homes, beneficiaries, and politicians from both parties) and some losers (taxpayers, patients, and other consumers of government services).         "
"62","Whether there has been a net welfare gain from New York's expansive Medicaid program is hard to measure. The munificence of New York's health system does not appear to be reflected in its performance. According to the Commonwealth Fund, New York ranks nineteenth in the nation in the quality of care and last in preventable hospitalizations.90 By some measures, the Medicaid program is also inequitable, as some of those paying the costs in taxes are less wealthy than those receiving the benefits.91 To cap it off, Medicaid's high costs tie the state's hands. The program crowds out room in budgets that could go to address many other needs such as infrastructure.92"
"63","Yet Medicaid is a vital safety net that insures some 5.7 million New Yorkers who would otherwise face high hurdles to obtaining health insurance. Many studies point to the benefits in terms of access and health outcomes. However, the vested interests are, at the end of the day, about pursuing their interests in jobs and money, not about making sure that the system is effective or efficient. In some instances, they might be better off if were ineffective and inefficient. Their interests are not synonymous with those of program beneficiaries and the groups they form. The theory of vested interests helps us see that. And that is one of the reasons it is so important to incorporate it into the new policy‐focused political science."
"64","The theory of vested interests also illuminates why New York's Medicaid system remains politically difficult, if not impossible, to reform. The vested interests’ power reinforces the status quo. Their network is braided into every political party and level of government in the state. There is no powerful organized interest on the other side promoting reform. Reformers seeking to control costs, if and when they emerge, will face big obstacles. A Schattschniederian approach augmented by the theory of vested interests explains such policy durability in the face of high costs and questionable performance."
"65","If change is to come to New York's Medicaid politics, it is likely to come from outside. Perhaps Medicaid reform along the lines proposed by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, which would “block grant” the program and drastically reduce the aid to states like New York, will someday be enacted into law. Such a change in the financing mechanism would dramatically alter the character of New York's Medicaid program—and with it the behavior of the vested interests."
"66","Whatever happens, much remains to be learned about how union labor unions shape the politics and policy of Medicaid in the states. For instance, SEIU had been highly actively in organizing home health care workers in California, Illinois, Connecticut, and Washington State until the U.S. Supreme Court shut down those efforts with its decision in Harris v. Quinn (2014). In Minnesota, SEIU won a major Medicaid funding victory in 2013. The patterns of politicking in these other states are likely to be different from New York in one way or another, and scholars should explore them. Future research can hopefully uncover the similarities and differences with the patterns observed in New York. To the extent that the analysis here serves as an opening wedge, such cross‐state comparative work would be a logical next step for research. Further exploration of union activity in the politics of Medicaid can also serve as a good testing ground for theories about the role of interest groups in American politics.         "
