"1","THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES POLICY RESPONSES to a specific set of labor market challenges in three relatively small European countries, namely Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. The analysis takes into account developments since European Union accession—1973, 1981, and 1986 in the Irish, Greek, and Portuguese cases, respectively—but focuses more particularly on the period since the mid‐1990s, since this is the point at which Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) countries began to seriously consider the requirements of “knowledge‐based” and “innovation‐led” growth.1 As lenses on general patterns in the extent to which the three countries have either succeeded or failed to embrace economic modernization, the focus is narrowed to a comparison of three policy areas, selected because of their importance to the state's ability to shape labor market outcomes in each case. The first section of the article further explains the importance of labor market policies to an economic development strategy for the twenty‐first century, and, in turn, the importance of policies for work‐life balance, higher education, and immigration for such a labor market support structure. While the policy summaries that follow this discussion are necessarily extremely brief, they are informed by an extensive review of both the primary and secondary literature in each national case, as well as a series of interviews with policymakers in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, conducted between 2005 and 2010. The overall conclusion is that between 1987 and 2008, Ireland substantially reoriented its development strategy around the requirements of the “knowledge economy.” By contrast, Greece still has a very long way to go on this score, while Portugal, as a late‐modernizer, falls somewhere in between.         "
"2","Among the good reasons for explicitly comparing these three national case studies is the fact that all three countries were all once part of what used to be called the “European periphery.”2 While this term has increasingly gone out of fashion among social scientists, it speaks to a set of common historical experiences shared by the countries located on Europe's extreme west and far south. Taking as the point of departure the entrance of each of these countries into the European Union (EU) supranational club, this group of countries had far to go in terms of catching up to Western European averages in terms of economic development, living standards, and, arguably, the construction of strong and effective political institutions. These states shared a status as poorer, less‐advantaged European underdogs at the time of accession, a status later embodied by their formal designation as “cohesion” countries on the part of the EU itself. Furthermore, the three smaller countries that provide the focus of this article share additional features in common that cause them to stand apart from Spain. Importantly, these include the existence of highly centralized political systems and, consequently, the political and economic dominance of Athens, Dublin, and Lisbon, respectively; a previously highly culturally and linguistically homogenous population in each case; and an extremely underdeveloped manufacturing base on which to build economic growth. These commonalities have only been further underlined by the financial and debt crisis that has rocked the region since 2009 and continues to dominate the news coming out of Europe's southern and western periphery as all three countries struggle to conform to debt reduction targets in the face of European Union‐International Monetary Fund bailouts. Furthermore, the policy options available to these countries (not only in response to the financial crisis but also more generally) have been shaped by the common influences of Europeanization, not least, in recent times, the constraints imposed by the adoption of the euro.3"
"3","While Irish fortunes had seemingly diverged significantly from southern European ones during the 1990s, witnessed by the stunning growth rates and overall increased living standards associated with the rise of the “Celtic Tiger,” the recent European sovereign debt crisis has seemed to plague all three countries nearly equally. This caused European and international commentators to again group Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain together, this time as the “PIGS” of Europe. With clearly derogatory overtones, at which southern Europeans as well as the Irish have reasonably taken offence, this acronym does point to the vulnerabilities still apparently common to this set of countries. Arguably, however, while the recent economic crisis may have reminded us of the common starting point from which Greece, Ireland, and Portugal began the march along their respective “pathways from the periphery,”4 both the roots of this crisis, and, consequently, its probable long‐term effects, are different in each national case. While the economic collapse has apparently similar proximate causes, namely the growth of public debt, as well as similar short‐term consequences, including the imposition of a range of tough austerity measures, the following analysis highlights the fact that the underlying cause of economic crisis is quite different across the three cases. In sum, Ireland has modernized its economy significantly since EU accession, while the two southern European countries, especially Greece, have failed in significant ways to adapt their development strategies to twenty‐first century requirements. The underlying cause of the Irish economic collapse is thus mainly financial in nature; financial market deregulation and the burst of an unrestrained property bubble precipitated an explosion of public debt. Granted, Ireland has suffered badly as the result of the international crisis, but overall, contemporary Irish economic woes mirror those of other small and relatively highly developed countries such as Iceland and New Zealand, as well as, to some extent, the United States.5 By contrast, basic pathologies of underdevelopment mark the fortunes of the two smaller southern European countries, adding up to a resistance of the economy to “knowledge‐based” or “innovation‐led” growth, whether this be derived internationally or indigenously, although this is much more so the case in Greece than in Portugal. While this article does not attempt to explicitly link responses to labor market challenges to the current financial crisis, the analysis does underline acute and basic developmental differences between the three cases.         "
"4","Most medium‐ to high‐income countries currently find themselves at a crossroads: maintaining existing living standards while making the transition to a post‐industrial development strategy is proving to be challenging. Arguably, the multiple challenges associated with early twenty‐first century economic and social development have been especially apparent for Europeans. Among other issues, a low birth rate and the associated costs of having one of the world's most rapidly aging populations, along with persistent unemployment, make the adoption of a new strategy for European success very much needed as well as increasingly difficult to achieve. Specifically, the main contemporary developmental challenge faced by latecomer EU member states such as Ireland, Portugal, and Greece is how to carve out an economic modernization strategy that involves competing in the world economy on the basis of high skills and technology‐intensive or niche service industries in order to fulfill not only national developmental goals but also regional policy objectives of economic and social “convergence” within Europe."
"5","While there is no clear agreement over how precisely these policy goals should be achieved, I would argue that there is a broad consensus among post‐industrial countries on the general direction that a development strategy for the twenty‐first century should take. While there might be significant debate within individual states, as well as between countries, over which policies are best suited to achieving successful outcomes, there is a general shared understanding over what those outcomes should be. This is reflected in the widespread adoption of concepts such as the “knowledge society” and the shift from “comparative” to “competitive” advantage.6 This latter strategy is based on the promotion of value‐added production where, crucially for this present analysis, much of that value comes from having a highly skilled and increasingly productive labor force. In the European context, this basic consensus was represented by the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. A cornerstone of European development policy from 2000 to 2010, the Strategy aimed at increasing productivity and greater job creation in order to deliver improved living standards in the region. Framed around the need for economic modernization, reforms connected to this program were supposed to be constructed around specific targets; especially relevant to the issue of reconciling family and working life, the Strategy included a goal of raising average female workforce participation rates from 54 to 60 percent by 2010.7 While the chance of achieving many of these targets were reduced as a result of the post‐2008 global recession, the point is twofold: that high skills and high wages are seen as central planks of a twenty‐first century development strategy, and that labor market issues are at the forefront of this vision.         "
"6","The importance of the state's role in shaping the structure and performance of the labor market to a twenty‐first century economic development strategy poses specific problems for smaller states such as Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. Smaller countries in contemporary times face additional challenges when it comes to labor market development, often lacking the pool of highly skilled workers needed to fuel high‐wage, knowledge‐based economic growth, and increasingly relying on immigration in order to meet those needs. Recognizing the importance of labor market development, for all states, both big and small, also arguably requires a reconceptualization of the policy mechanisms by which desired labor market outcomes might be achieved. Traditional aspects of “labor market policy,” including industrial relations legislation as well as industrial policy, are no less important than in previous eras, and are conceptualized here as the “core” or “first tier” of a labor market support structure (see Figure 1). While very interesting in themselves, the research on which this article is based focuses on neither these traditional policy arenas, nor on what are classically referred to as active labor market programs, another crucial component of the “first tier,” which aim at easing citizens out of labor market inactivity. Rather, the focus of this research is on what I refer to as the “second tier” of the labor market support structure. This second tier encompasses policy areas that have not necessarily always been approached primarily from a labor market perspective, yet are extremely important for shaping labor market outcomes, including, but not limited to, family, higher education, and immigration policies. This choice of policy areas is not guided by the belief that these are necessarily the most important influences on labor market outcomes, let alone the most crucial elements of an overall successful economic strategy. Rather, together they provide a good lens on the extent to which the three states in question have incorporated labor market concerns into these policy areas as part of a knowledge‐based, productivity, and innovation‐led development strategy.         "
"7","With regard to work‐life balance, the debate over the state's role in promoting particular types of family structure and organization was framed until recently in terms of “women's rights,” sometimes set against fears about the “breakdown” of the nuclear family. However, governments across the developed world, concerned about declining birth rates and aging populations, have increasingly framed family policy in economic terms. The problem for governments is how state intervention might encourage families, especially women, to both have more children and participate in paid work. Counter‐intuitively perhaps, the “work‐family trade‐off” is even more acute in countries with traditionally conservative welfare regimes such as Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. Traditionally, it was presumed that increased female participation in the paid work force was linked to the declining birth rates experienced by advanced industrial nations, but current data suggest that variations in the birth rate have much more to do with the extent to which states devote resources to easing the tension between family and work life.8"
"8","Family policy may be “direct” or “indirect,” meaning that deliberate attempts can be made to influence family size and parental workforce participation but also that many government policies have non‐deliberate and unintended consequences in this field.9 In addition, of the three policy areas considered here, responsibility for this one is the most diffuse. Unlike higher education or immigration, countries tend not to have departments or ministries dedicated to achieving work–life balance; it is more likely that several state organizations might share responsibility. Both policy analysts and family policy activists tend to argue that better policy would result from having a single administrative body coordinating state action in the field. Many different factors operate to influence the work–child trade‐off, including access to contraception and abortion, local cultural beliefs and practices, indirect effects of the tax system, as well as deliberate government policies aimed at reducing the costs of this trade‐off. However, in line with recent policy analyses, there are six key mechanisms that evidence suggests have the most influence on desired policy outcomes.10 These comprise:            "
"9","Although higher education policies are rarely studied by political scientists, there is politics at play here as much as in any other policy arena. Not only are there non‐state actors with deeply entrenched interests involved, but education policies are shaped by ideological shifts and long‐term political and cultural changes. The shift away from agro‐export led growth in countries such as Greece, Ireland, and Portugal can go in either of two general directions: governments can make a serious effort to upskill the population and seek overseas investment in industries that require an educated workforce, or they can try to compete on the basis of “low labor costs” in the manufacturing and service sectors against other low‐wage economies. Investment in education, technical training, and research and development is central to the high‐wage, high‐skill strategy, which is surely the preferred option for states such as Greece, Ireland, and Portugal in light of their size, commitment to European goals of social inclusion, and overall levels of development.11"
"10","Since it is impossible to cover all aspects of education policy here, the focus is narrowed to higher or third‐level education and training and, more especially, to the extent to which states conceptualize this sector as part of the labor market support structure. Specifically, the interest is in the extent to which the university system has been re‐oriented toward vocational training or whether it maintains a more traditional role, and the extent to which the non‐university sector has been expanded to meet new needs through such measures as “life‐long learning” programs, job re‐training, and the establishment of technical colleges or similar institutions. While there are a number of mechanisms by which states may orient their higher education systems toward meeting new economic needs, four specific dimensions are especially worth noting:            "
"11","Running through these four dimensions are also three enduring concerns—ensuring quality, increasing quantity, and the issue of institutional autonomy—concerns which are in frequent conflict with one another.12"
"12","Family and higher education policies are at best medium‐ to long‐term solutions to labor market challenges caused by demographic imbalances and skill shortages. Immigration policy, by contrast, can have almost immediate effects, and attracting skilled labor from overseas may be the best option where higher education and training policy fails or has not yet taken effect.13 Likewise, governments may have to resort to immigration in order to increase the ratio of working‐age to dependent members of the population. Yet the importation of labor might take one of two directions. Cheap migrant workers have been used throughout the OECD during periods of economic expansion and labor shortages. Alternatively, highly skilled immigrants may fill skill shortages resulting from rapid economic growth or change, failed education policies, or the simple lack of skill diversity often experienced by relatively small countries such as Greece, Ireland, or Portugal. It is this latter aspect of immigration policy that is particularly important to a European economic and social development strategy for the twenty‐first century. The following analysis thus takes into account several specific features of national immigration policy. Of particular interest is the extent to which policies on labor migration, asylum seekers, and how to address the problem of illegal migration and trafficking are coordinated with one another and to what extent policy responses are in line with national developmental requirements. What is more important than how many migrants enter the country in any given year is under what conditions they are permitted to enter. Work permits tied to specific positions, quotas, or “points” systems are alternative strategies available to policymakers for influencing outcomes.         "
"13","Given space and word limitations, it is not possible to detail all of the above dimensions of each arena of state activity in terms of policy output here. Neither are there always reliable and comparable data available to measure policy development in any objective sense. The following sections thus present some of the data that are comparable across the three national cases, then sketch out national‐level policy responses in general terms, explaining how state actions have influenced outcomes in each country under investigation. The focus throughout is on the extent to which each of the three policy areas has been re‐oriented and re‐conceptualized as an important second‐tier component of the labor market support structure."
"14","Table 1 contains a number of family policy indicators, especially related to issues of work–life balance. These indictors not only partially reflect prior patterns of state intervention in this policy arena, but also illustrate the specific circumstances in which each country must formulate new policies. Turning first to the Irish case, the country experienced a surge of women entering the paid workforce during the economic boom period of the 1990s. Employment growth during this period was largely fuelled by return migration, then women entering the labor force for the first time, followed by, chronologically speaking, foreign migration.14 This meant that by the late 2000s, Ireland had a female workforce participation rate equal to that of the OECD average, although not as high as that of Portugal or of many Northern European countries. Part of the reason for this continued lag is that the gap between female and maternal employment rates is still pronounced, reflecting the fact that many mothers of young children opt to stay at home. This in turn can be explained by a combination of prevailing cultural attitudes that mothers should not be “forced” to work outside the home, as well as continuing gaps in the availability and affordability of childcare in particular. In terms of fertility rates, Ireland continues to have one of the highest birth rates in the developed world, outstripped only by Iceland, the United States, Turkey, and Mexico, out of 30 OECD countries, in 2006.            "
"15","Until the early 1970s, Irish family policy combined a minimalist and non‐interventionist approach to social welfare and direct family service provision with a conservative approach to both labor and family law that actively discouraged women from engaging in paid work.15 Expansion of state intervention in terms of services and state support for family‐friendly work practices did not really begin until the mid‐1990s, and then, only incrementally. However, and in contrast to the Greek case especially, extensive government and non‐government attention to the subject, particularly among the academic community, has ensured that the policy arena is increasingly “framed” in terms of work–life balance. Table 1 paints Ireland as the most generous of the three countries analyzed here in terms of the total spent on families, including cash benefits, services, and tax breaks, spending a little more than average in comparison to the rest of the OECD. At 2.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), however, this is still well below western European norms. Since Ireland still devotes relatively little public funding to childcare, increases in spending can largely be explained by measures aimed at raising welfare benefit levels in order to combat the high poverty rate during the late 1980s and early 1990s; then from the mid‐1990s, at increasing the level of and reducing marginal tax rates on a range of family benefit schemes.16 Ireland also introduced new maternity and parental leave schemes during this period in order to bring national policy into line with, but not go beyond, EU directives governing this area of state activity. Enrollment rates in childcare institutions have increased markedly over the past decade and a half, although concerns over affordability remain high.            "
"16","One further area in which the country has paid specific attention has been the encouragement of flexi‐time through tri‐partite cooperation and public education, including a National Framework for Family‐Friendly Policies (later for Work–Life Balance), a Work–Life Balance website, and a National Work–Life Balance day. This voluntary rather than legislative or mandatory approach is entirely in keeping with Ireland's post‐1987 largely market‐led but “social‐partner‐negotiated” approach to economic and social development.17 Even so, the approach has encouraged an increase in the use of flexi‐time in particular, so that Ireland compares favorably, at least with southern Europe, in this regard.            "
"17","Portugal is an interesting case when it comes to the development of policies for work–life balance, especially in a southern European context, because high rates of female workforce participation have been maintained, especially from the early 1980s, without much support for families on the part of the state. While there has historically been very little state intervention in order to help individuals and families ease the tension between work and family life, the majority of women engage in full‐time, paid work, with participation rates almost matching those of the Nordic countries. This can be explained by a mixture of idiosyncratic local factors, including the historical entry of women into the workforce as the result of labor shortages caused by the African colonial wars in the 1960s; the state's commitment to gender equality legally enshrined in the 1974 post‐revolutionary constitution; and the fact that the structure of the labor market in Portugal, as it is in the rest of southern Europe, is hostile to part‐time work.18 This means that if a family's income needs to be supplemented by women, and mothers in particular, their employment is extremely likely to be on a full‐time basis.19 Despite this fact, during the 1990s, fertility rates remained slightly above those of Italy, Greece, and Spain.            "
"18","During the dictatorship of António Salazar (1926–1974), Portuguese family policy was extremely minimalist and non‐interventionist. While many arenas of state activity were radically reformed during the 1980s, social policy in general and family policy in particular was one of the later areas to receive significant attention.20 Despite some attempts in the 1980s to pay explicit attention to family policy, to include the temporary establishment of a dedicated policy unit within the Ministry of Social and Family Affairs,21 the major policy shift in this field took place in the late 1990s. More specifically, the Portuguese state did much to expand its welfare functions and develop family policy under the leadership of the Socialist government elected in 1995. These policy developments were framed explicitly in terms of gender equality, rather than work–life balance per se, giving the flavor of the debate here something different from that found at the EU level, in Ireland, and in Greece in particular.22"
"19","Under the Socialists, two major areas of policy development were the expansion of childcare facilities and parental leave legislation. Table 1 thus shows that Portugal does well compared with the other two countries in terms of childcare coverage, with 43.9 percent of one to three year olds and 78.9 percent of four and five year olds enrolled in formal facilities. Between 1991 and 2004 alone, participation rates increased from 35.6 to 75 percent for the three to six year old age cohort.23 However, concern still remains for the under‐three age group, especially given the almost non‐existent gap between female and maternal workforce participation rates and given that childcare facilities have their limitations: parents often pay for care on a full‐time basis, which acts as a disincentive to take up part‐time work; private providers are often very expensive in comparison to wages; and public providers often have short operating hours, reflecting the fact that childcare is viewed less as a mechanism for the reconciliation of working and family life, and more as a welfare and education function of the state. Most attention, however, both inside and outside of Portugal, has been paid to the Socialists' parental leave scheme, because of its unusual focus on paternity leave as opposed to general parental leave that is transferable between men and women.24 Importantly, parental leave is paid, but it does depend on a worker's insurance contribution record, and so does not cover all cases. The end result, however, is that Portugal appears slightly more generous than both Ireland and Greece, especially with respect to parental and paternal leave.            "
"20","For the past two decades, Greece has stood out among European countries, along with Italy and Spain, as combining an especially low female workforce participation rate with a low birth rate. While Table 1 reports Greece's recent 2006 fertility rate as being slightly higher than Portugal's, not only does it remain below OECD and European averages, there are also several additional reasons to be cautious about this trend. After reaching a low of 1.26 in 2001, the turnaround only began in 2004, and 2006 was, in fact, the first year that Greece's rate overtook Portugal's. Furthermore, the increase in birth rates may be more indicative of Greece's high rate of migration, discussed below, rather than government policy success as such. Most significantly, however, Greece has a particularly low female workforce participation rate, with only four OECD countries, Italy, Mexico, Turkey, and Malta, trailing behind. This has remained an underlying trend for some time, in contrast to the way in which Irish women surged into the paid workforce during the 1990s. Taking into account women aged between 15 and 64, a slightly different measure from that used in Table 1, Ireland's female workforce participation rate grew by 22.2 percentage points between 1991 and 2000, while Greece's increased only slightly, by 4.6 percent.25"
"21","Given the European level debate over employment growth and the contribution of policies for work–life balance to that growth, it might be expected that the Greek state has increased the amount of attention paid to this policy arena since 1990. However, not only does Greek family policy remain particularly underdeveloped, but public debate as well as state policy has focused on the fertility component of the work–life balance equation, at the expense of efforts to help families genuinely reconcile family and working life or, increasingly, the female workforce participation rate in general.26 Overall, the Greek state remains largely wedded to the same policy framework that has governed this area since at least the early 1970s. While policymakers frequently show concern over the imminent “population crisis,” family policy is limited to a series of benefits and subsidies awarded to large families.27 This series of “families with many children” benefits is guaranteed by the Greek Constitution, meaning that they are particularly difficult to reverse or redesign in order to redistribute resources more efficiently. Under the modernizing government of Costas Simitis in the late 1990s, several attempts were made to do just this. However, efforts to reorganize family policy were hampered by mobilization on the part of the Supreme Confederation of Large Families (known by its Greek acronym ASPE), a conservative lobby and protest group that has influence well out of proportion to its size.28"
"22","Promoting families to have many children clearly does not work, however, since Greece has generally had the highest incidence of two‐child families in the EU‐15.29 The main result of the country's “many children” benefits has been to skew resources away from families in general and toward a specific group of families instead. This pattern is also reflected in Greece's wider social policy commitments, to include the pension system and minimum income guarantees.30 Some of the results of the neglect of policies for work–life balance and the skewing of family policy resources toward very specific groups are illustrated in Table 1. Childcare coverage, especially for children aged three and under, is very low by European standards. While much public debate in Ireland centers on the availability and affordability of childcare, coverage rates for Greece are lower than those of Ireland. Total spending on families in terms of cash, services, and tax breaks is significantly lower as a percentage of GDP than that of the other two countries, and much lower than the OECD average, despite the sometimes quite generous subsidies paid to parents of large families. Provisions for maternity and parental leave meet minimum EU standards, but do not go beyond these. The labor relations system's resistance to part‐time work, as in Portugal, goes a long way to explaining the low use of flexi‐time amongst Greek businesses—at least in the formal sector.31"
"23","Using data compiled from the OECD's Education at a Glance, Ireland generally appears to provide the highest quality higher education out of the three countries analyzed here. Over the past two decades, Ireland has spent more than the OECD average on higher education, and significantly more than either Portugal or Greece. Since the 1960s, the Irish state has put great effort into expanding higher education, first through the development of new institutions and infrastructure, and later through the dedication of increased resources to improve the quality of teaching and research. Higher education policy has centered on a long‐term, self‐conscious strategy on the part of policymakers to develop and maintain a “binary” higher education system, by which is meant an administrative, institutional, and philosophical differentiation between technical and university education.32 At the forefront of state planning since at least the late 1960s, this strategy has been characterized by an acknowledgement of the importance of the technical education sector to economic development. During the 1960s and 1970s, this non‐university sector was singled out for investment, including the establishment of a network of regional technical colleges (later referred to as regional institutes of technology), and two national institutes of higher education.33 Problems of underfunding in this sector began to be addressed in the late 1980s, significantly improving the quality of education provided, so that by the end of the 1990s, the regional institutes were able to offer post‐graduate programs. During the 1990s, increased attention was paid by policymakers to further developing the university sector. A twin emphasis on improving quality, partly through legislation governing the qualifications system, and encouraging the research and development focus of the universities, governed policy development during this period.34"
"24","The ability to supply technically trained, highly skilled workers helped fuel multinational‐led job creation, especially during the 1990s. Indicator 3 in Table 2 shows that participation rates, at least for students leaving high school to pursue their first course of study, are still a little below the OECD average, although participation has greatly expanded over time. The non‐university sector was particularly responsible for increasing entry to higher education institutions, with participation in the polytechnics and institutes of technology expanding by 2,900 percent between 1968 and 1998.35 The “binary” strategy has witnessed not only a massive expansion of participation in higher education but, given that this growth has been tightly regulated, the quality of provision has substantially improved over time. It has also facilitated the matching of educational provision to economic development: indicator 5 shows that Ireland produces well above average in terms of science (as well as technology) graduates, and the ratio of students to teachers is relatively low across the entire higher education sector. Recent debates surrounding this policy area have centered not only on the need for the education system to produce highly skilled workers to attract multi‐national companies, but also on the need to shift higher education priorities to suit the “next stage” of economic development, meaning a higher level of scientific and “entrepreneurial” education in order to move away from reliance on foreign investment‐led growth.36"
"25","Portugal has also greatly expanded participation in higher education, since the mid‐1980s in this case. However, the means by which this expansion has been achieved has differed greatly from that of the Irish. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Portuguese population was arguably the most undereducated in western and southern Europe. During the 1969–70 school year, 27.7 percent of 14 year olds were enrolled in school, compared to almost 50 percent in Spain and around 90 percent in a country such as The Netherlands.37 The long‐term legacy of this has been a lag in literacy rates: by 1988 almost 18 percent of Portuguese over the age of 15 remained illiterate, while the illiteracy rates of most other Western European countries were approaching zero.38 Rapid expansion of participation at both the second and third levels has thus been the primary goal of Portuguese policymakers since at least the early 1980s. However, since resources were stretched extremely thin in the early democratic period, this had to occur with as little cost to the state as possible.39 A two‐pronged approach involved the establishment of several new public universities and a network of polytechnic institutions, but more significantly, the stimulation of the private sector to increase participation levels. Government policy directed at stimulating the development of private institutions involved altering the system of access to higher education, changing rules to allow professors to work in both the public and private sectors simultaneously, and the provision of subsidies to private providers.40 According to Portuguese government figures, the number of students in higher education doubled between 1990 and 1995,41 with much of this growth occurring in the newly created private sector. Enrollments in public institutions increased by 40 percent between 1987 and 1991, compared to a growth rate of 250 percent in the private sector.42"
"26","The privatization strategy has been credited with delivering better than expected outcomes in terms of participation in education, although, as Table 2 illustrates, first degrees tend to be highly theoretical in focus (Tertiary A courses), rather than technically focused (Tertiary B). Even so, Portugal produces a relatively high number of science graduates, and on one other measure of quality, at least, has a lower than average student–teacher ratio. This mix of results is also reflected in ongoing concerns about some of the consequences of the privatization strategy. While stimulating the private sector may have helped to expand participation in higher education, serious concerns have often been raised not only about the quality of education provided by most private institutions but also about the inability of the private sector, in particular, to respond to labor market needs. Concerns about quality have fuelled a negative public perception of the private sector, so that public institutions cream off the better students.43 This has muddied the original intention of Portuguese policymakers to provide a “binary” system of education, similar to Ireland's, capable of producing both internationally competitive research and a technically trained labor force, since the public–private divide has perhaps become more important than the university–polytechnic one. In addition, the private sector has not tended toward the provision of technical education, but toward courses in social science, law, and business studies.44 This partly explains the theoretical rather than technical focus of the higher education system as a whole. In addition, despite the rapid expansion of educational participation since the late 1980s, Portugal spends less than average on higher education, at just 1 percent of GDP. In terms of expenditure on higher education per student, excluding research and development, in 2007, Portugal spent US $7,208, lower than the OECD average of $8,455, and lower than the EU‐19 average of $7,592, a total which includes a number of central and eastern European low spenders.45"
"27","Most analyses of Greek education policy since redemocratization in 1974 focus not only on the elite and restricted nature of the university sector in particular, but also on the extremely low‐quality levels offered across the higher education system as a whole.46 Table 2 shows that, overall, Greek access rates to higher education are now somewhat similar to those of Ireland and Portugal. There is, however, a greater concentration in polytechnic rather than university‐type education, with only 23 percent gaining access to this latter form of education out of high school. In fact, access to university education was severely restricted before 2000, with many Greeks continuing an intergenerational pattern of gaining university education elsewhere in Europe or in North America, given the tight restrictions placed on the number of places available. Access was previously controlled by a stringent national examination, which ranked students and restricted the places available to a pre‐determined number. In 1997, a new law was passed granting “open access.” Coming into force in 2000, this law stated that all students who met minimum passing grades in the national examination would now be allowed access to higher education courses.47 While entrance rates have thus been expanded, higher education in Greece has suffered from low quality standards for several decades, at least in comparison to much of Europe.

"28","While efforts have been made to expand the non‐university sector since the 1980s, technical education is seen as vastly inferior to university education, and there is a significant problem in matching training to labor market needs: Greece had an extraordinarily high percentage of unemployed graduates, even before the 2009 collapse of the Greek economy.48 This is underscored by the low number of technically trained graduates—witness the very low number of science graduates (Table 2). This situation can be traced to the specifics of a policy framework that has, similarly to family policy, proven largely intractable. After 1975, a constitutional ban on private education in Greece was combined with a commitment to free education, including textbooks and meals for students. This sounds very generous, but the generosity was undercut by the fact that since there is hardly any private funding for education and research in Greece, the level of public spending is well below the OECD average. In private and public spending combined, Greece spends around 0.8 percent of GDP on higher education, compared to an OECD average of 1.3 percent. Additional data in Table 2 also speak to the issue of low‐quality higher education. The ratio of students to teachers is twice that of Portugal's, and drop‐out rates and rates of students who fail to finish courses within a five‐ or six‐year period are extraordinarily high.49 While Indicator 3 does not exactly measure drop‐out rates, it does show that a comparatively small percentage of the university‐age cohort manages to complete their program in any given year. Efforts to introduce a reform package, formulated by stakeholders under the umbrella of the National Council on Education between 2004 and 2007, were met by fierce resistance by both student groups and teachers' unions. However, some piecemeal changes were made, including limits on the duration of study, as well as alterations to the system of university governance in order to reduce the politicization of higher education.            "
"29","Immigration is such a new policy problem in Ireland that policy responses were minimalist during the 1990s, with the most significant changes occurring since 2003. The country only became one of net inward migration in the mid‐1990s. Return migrants, lured by the economic boom, were followed by both an influx of asylum seekers from various parts of Africa and Europe and then an upsurge of arrivals from central and eastern Europe after 2000 as a result of EU expansion.50 During the 1990s, immigration policy remained framed by security concerns and governed by the restrictive and outdated work permit‐based 1935 Aliens Act, with measures to control the flow and processing of asylum seekers tending to preoccupy policymakers.51 However, by the end of that decade, it became clear that issues of migrant integration as well as reshaping the immigration policy framework around new labor market requirements needed to become the new policy priorities. Up until 2003, Ireland allowed an essentially market‐based approach to determine the number of work permits issued to migrants from non‐EU member states. While Ireland continued to welcome all categories of migrants from the European economic area, it significantly tightened the flow of migrants from non‐EU countries in favor of highly skilled workers. In 2003, a new set of restrictions on immigration from non‐EU member states made certain (low‐skilled or unskilled) job categories ineligible for work permits, while a new 2007 law further tightened the rules governing the employment of foreign nationals, including the introduction of a new type of green card for highly skilled (and highly paid) workers. Meanwhile, Ireland has continued to extend generous policies toward migrants from new EU member states.            "
"30","The results of having a more‐or‐less unrestricted approach to immigration, which has gradually been replaced by a more restricted, skills‐oriented approach, are reflected in Table 3. Ireland has a relatively high number of foreign‐born members of the population, at 11.0 percent according to recent figures, but this is especially remarkable given the fact that most of these migrants have arrived since 1995. Yet, in contrast especially to the two southern European cases discussed below, this foreign population is increasingly concentrated in highly skilled, well‐paid professions, especially in the service sector. Indicator 4 shows that less than a third of immigrants are employed in primary and secondary sectors of the economy, something that is further underlined by government statistics. While 9,342 work permits were issued in the agriculture, fisheries, and industrial sectors in 2002, this had dropped to 3,227 by 2007, following tightening of work permit regulations, but before the 2008 financial crisis.52 Correspondingly, the percentage of migrants with tertiary education qualifications is relatively high and almost twice that of the native‐born population.            "
"31","Immigration also poses a relatively new policy problem for Portugal. A slow but steady trickle of migrants from Portuguese‐speaking Africa and Brazil arrived during the 1980s, but immigration did not really become much of a political issue until the 1990s, when the fall of communism in eastern Europe encouraged an entirely new immigration phenomenon. Since the Portuguese state during this period inherited a relatively restrictive immigration policy framework, vast numbers of these recent arrivals were undocumented. One estimate puts the number of illegal migrants living in Portugal by the early 1990s at around 70,000,53 and another finds that illegal migrants made up at least 25–30 percent of migrants entering the country until 1996.54 Thus, along with Spain, Italy, and Greece, the challenge posed to the Portuguese government during the 1990s was how best to deal with the problem of undocumented workers. In common with the rest of southern Europe, an apparently more realistic approach to immigration policy was reflected in a series of one‐off mass regularization programs.55 The problem with the regularization option, however, is that it does nothing to actively attract highly skilled migrants to the country.            "
"32","While there is some debate about the “brain drain” in Portugal, it has not been as sharp as it appears to be in many other OECD countries, to include Ireland. In fact, greater concern has been voiced on the part of professional organizations about the threat of foreign talent and job competition than the need to recruit highly skilled professionals.56 In this respect, Portugal lags behind Ireland in conceptualizing immigration policy as part of a high‐wage, high‐skill development strategy.57 Something of this is reflected in the objective indicators outlined in Table 3. A relatively small proportion of Portugal's population is foreign born, and while foreign workers are more than twice as likely to have completed higher education qualifications than native‐born Portuguese workers, this is still half as likely as in the case of foreign workers in Ireland. While only a third of foreign‐born Portuguese workers are concentrated in the primary and secondary sectors of the economy, which is much lower than is the case in Greece, specific groups of immigrants are heavily concentrated in specific occupations, including Portuguese‐speaking Africans in the construction sector, the restaurant sector in the case of Brazilians, and eastern Europeans, notably Ukranians, in the cleaning sector.58 All three of these job categories are also dominated by informal labor. None of this is to say, however, that skilled workers do not perform important functions in the Portuguese economy. In fact, workers filling transfer and short‐term contracts in overseas companies with new Portuguese branches or bases provide an important channel for increasing the skills of local workers. Rather, the point is that the Portuguese state has not developed a comprehensive policy framework for attracting foreign talent.            "
"33","As in Ireland and Portugal, by the 1990s, Greece found itself in the position of having become a new country of migration, having experienced a huge influx of migrants, especially from its Balkan neighbors, intensifying after 1989. Given its close geographical proximity to eastern Europe, the country has a particularly acute problem with illegal migration. Unfortunately, this means that combating illegality has almost entirely dominated the Greek immigration policy debate, leaving even less room for the possibility of designing policies capable of attracting highly skilled migrants from further afield than is the case in Portugal. When confronted with changed immigration circumstances in the early 1990s, Greece's first response was to pass legislation stating that Greece “is not a country of immigration,”59 along with a number of measures cracking down on illegal immigration and retaining decades‐old and rather outdated provisions for the issuance of working visas. By the mid‐1990s, it was clear that this approach was not working, and Greece followed the rest of southern Europe in opting for migrant regularization programs rather than comprehensive immigration policy change. Two main legalization programs occurred in 1998 and 2001, and, while representing a step forward from previous arguments that immigration did not exist, these programs suffered from a number of problems of design as well as implementation.60 Since the regularization programs were developed with very little input from policy stakeholders, many of the requirements encouraged inefficiency, if not corruption, especially when it came to migrants collecting the documents necessary to be legalized.61"
"34","The consequences of these policies are clearly reflected in the relevant statistics. Greece has a relatively large foreign‐born population, at around 10.8 percent, which is especially high considering that Greece has not made deliberate efforts to recruit foreigners, nor does it have the kind of well‐paid job opportunities in highly skilled sectors offered by countries such as Ireland. The proportion of highly qualified foreigners is similar to that of Portugal, but much more tellingly, there is virtually no gap between the local and foreign‐born population in this regard. A clear minority of foreign workers is employed in the professions, and almost half are concentrated in the agricultural and industrial sectors. It can also be noted with respect to this latter statistic that 67 percent of Albanians work in these sectors, especially agriculture, and that Albanians make up a very large proportion of immigrants to Greece overall.62 In addition to the fact that there is no real attempt to recruit highly skilled foreign labor in order to contribute to knowledge‐based industrial growth, there are consistent concerns about the human rights abuses that are regularly associated with the detention and expulsion of undocumented migrants in Greece. In general, then, immigration continues to be viewed more as a security concern than a labor market issue.            "
"35","This article has analyzed the extent to which three relatively small and formerly peripheral European countries have reoriented three labor market related public policy arenas around the needs of a high‐skilled, high‐waged, “knowledge‐based” economic and social development strategy. While governments may inherit sometimes crippling preexisting policy legacies that limit the extent to which they can influence outcomes across any of these fields, reorienting state strategies generally involves both re‐conceptualizing and re‐framing each policy area before bringing legal and regulatory frameworks into line with those new goals. One of the main findings here is that there is more national‐level consistency in the way that states have met these policy challenges than there is consistency within particular policy arenas across the three national cases, even while allowing for some within‐country variation. While the scope of the discussion has been limited in terms of the range of policy areas investigated, these specific fields of policy activity act not only as lenses on the extent to which the Irish, Portuguese, and Greek states have self‐consciously adopted strategies to meet the needs of twenty‐first century development, but also as windows on the underlying roots of the contemporary economic crisis in each national case. Furthermore, the importance of identifying these underlying causes lies in the fact that they point toward the scope and depth of reform required in order for each of these countries to recover from their current economic crises.         "
"36","In terms of the criteria outlined above, Ireland has been the most successful case study analyzed here, drawing on a mix of market‐driven and state‐led mechanisms to gradually bring all three policy areas roughly into line with national developmental objectives. Yet despite these efforts, as a relatively small country highly dependent on foreign investment, the global recession hit the country hard. Irish policy strategies in arenas of state activity beyond the direct scope of this article exacerbated and deepened the crisis by allowing a deregulated financial sector to get out of control and a property bubble to go unchecked, the antidote to which is likely to be “better” regulation of these specific sectors.63 The precipitating factor underlying the Irish collapse was thus the 2008 government decision to guarantee the debt of six major banks whose lending practices, especially to property developers in this case, had fuelled the housing bubble, not government over‐spending per se. On the other hand, this laissez‐faire approach to financial regulation has been coupled, since the late 1980s, with the continuation of comparatively strong state guidance over education, social, and industrial policies and a negotiated approach to industrial relations issues. This has delivered the country a relatively highly skilled workforce that is likely to provide a base from which to attract foreign investment back to the country. I would thus argue that despite Ireland's current miseries, the country already has the fundamental building blocks of a basic development strategy in place, which is likely to help it recover from the crisis in the long term.         "
"37","As the preceding analysis shows, Portugal represents quite a mixed case when it comes to responding to new labor market challenges. In the family policy arena, Portugal is relatively advanced, especially given the very late development of the Portuguese welfare state. Yet immigration policy in particular is barely seen as part of the labor market support structure, especially in the case of attracting highly skilled migrants and entrepreneurs to the country. Admittedly, the Portuguese state has arguably faced the most difficult challenges in terms of availability of resources and in confronting policy legacies inherited from the past, especially, for the purposes of this article, with respect to the related problems of under‐education and social inequality. This reflects a larger pattern in the extent to which the Portuguese state has not only come to terms with these legacies of underdevelopment, but fully embraced the policy challenges of the twenty‐first century. The country has made a number of modernizing reforms, notably in the case of telecommunications and technology policy, public sector reform, and as discussed in this article, the expansion of educational participation.64 Yet Portugal does not yet seem to see itself as vigorously competing against other high‐income countries in the new world economy; policy reforms are still often about “catching up” to Western European averages rather than, as a relatively small player, carving out niche industries and markets on the basis of “competitive” advantage. The nature of the crisis in Portugal is thus quite different from that in Ireland; it has not been caused by an out‐of‐control financial sector, but is the cumulative result of half‐way successful attempts to economically modernize and vulnerability as a small, late‐developing European country. In fact, one line of analysis argues that the Portuguese debt crisis and subsequent bail‐out is not really a “crisis” at all. Even if the country has sustained relatively high levels of government debt over the past decade and more, this is part of the Portuguese strategy for catching up with European developmental averages and, in that sense, nothing especially new.65 Rather, the crisis was a product of speculation and pressure from international credit rating agencies and the result of contagion from the Greek crisis, in particular.66"
"38","The underlying causes of the Greek crisis are similar to Portugal's, but much deeper and arguably more profound. Whereas the Portuguese pattern of adjustment to the developmental needs of the twenty‐first century is one of unevenness, the Greek pattern is one of consistent failure to introduce structural reforms. Greece did experience a high level of growth in the late 1990s, but this was the result of short‐term strategies, such as asset privatization in an effort to conform to the European Monetary Union convergence criteria. Importantly, this apparent moment of success was largely devoid of any innovation‐led or “knowledge‐based” content and only served to mask some of the underlying, ongoing problems of Greek economic development.67 In fact, the roots of the Greek debt crisis, which subsequently snowballed across Europe's southern and western fringe, lie in the Greek state's “masking” of public debt from the rest of Europe. Furthermore, the country thus still suffers from basic facets of underdevelopment, including a very weak and poorly paid private sector and high unemployment rates among the better‐educated. Prescriptions on the part of international financial institutions in the wake of the Greek financial bailout of 2010 tended to focus on removing supposed labor market “rigidities,” yet the above analysis shows that the source of Greek problems may lie elsewhere. The Greek economy, with its large informal sector and an oversized pool of undocumented workers, is already really quite “flexible” in many regards. This, however, is the kind of flexibility that drives skills and wages downwards, and which does not provide a good basis for future knowledge‐led growth. The entire structure of the labor market—and the relationship of family, education, and immigration among other policy areas to labor market structure—needs serious attention if Greece is to carve out a long‐term development strategy for future success.
