"1","First ladies present both scholars and the public with a paradox: unelected, unpaid, and unguided by the Constitution, they wield great power through their personal, social, and political efforts. Inextricably linked to American conceptions of womanhood, first ladies have helped define women's roles as citizens. As Jill Abraham Hummer declares, “American first ladies have acted” (p. 1). Her book First Ladies and American Women: In Politics and at Home offers a detailed account of how, why, and to what ends.         "
"2","Hummer's book progresses both chronologically and topically. She covers three major historical epochs, each containing two semidistinct chapters that follow the same group of first ladies. The first era, “After Suffrage,” chronicles opposing dimensions of women's life from Lou Hoover to Jacqueline Kennedy. A focus on “Women's Citizenship” in Chapter 1 addresses how first ladies have advanced women's activities in the public sphere, such as Lou Hoover's support women's physical education, and maintained liaisons with women's groups, such as Mamie Eisenhower's receptions for Republican National Committee women. More intriguing, though, are the highly contextualized accounts of less active first ladies, including Bess Truman's role in helping postwar women feel appreciated. Chapter 2, “The Stable Society,” provides an apt counterpart in which the same women are recounted explicitly in their roles as wives, mothers, and consumers."
"3","In the following section, “The Second Wave,” Hummer tracks first ladies from Lady Bird Johnson through Rosalynn Carter, depicting how they impacted women's legal/political equality, as well as their responses to the second‐wave mantra “the personal is political.” Chapter 3 primarily focuses on support for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. However, it is Chapter 4 that shines, as Hummer articulates how each first lady narrated her own sense of womanhood while simultaneously setting standards for American women. For example, Lady Bird Johnson truly embodied “having it all”—modeling a traditional homemaker while simultaneously taking on unprecedented campaigns and calling for women's widespread participation in politics."
"4","The final epoch follows first ladies “After 1980,” covering Nancy Reagan through Michelle Obama. Chapter 5 offers an ambitious mix of how first ladies continued to respond to issues of the second wave, shifted trends in “pet projects,” and advocated for global and human rights. From Nancy Reagan's well known antidrug campaign to Michelle Obama's use of social media to bring attention to global issues, Chapter 6 delivers a unique take on how our recent first ladies have used their own ideology surrounding motherhood and family politics as a springboard for their activism."
"5","Writing about each woman individually allows Hummer to weave together context and defining moments, resulting in a robust summary of first lady contributions. The two chapters within each era highlight both the structures and individual women who have shaped the first lady role. In particular, Hummer skillfully illustrates out how first lady advocacy has paralleled both national and personal interest, as well as the particular needs of an administration. However, readers might feel some historical whiplash because of the repetitive organizational structure and the lack of conclusion drawing at the end of each chapter. Brief internal summaries would have been helpful to connect each woman's activities to the central thesis. The book does not offer a critical analysis but rather provides in‐depth accounts of how modern first ladies have shaped relations between American women, the presidency, and politics. Thus, those interested in the first lady, women's activism, or the influences on modern American womanhood will find this account informative and rich with historical detail."
