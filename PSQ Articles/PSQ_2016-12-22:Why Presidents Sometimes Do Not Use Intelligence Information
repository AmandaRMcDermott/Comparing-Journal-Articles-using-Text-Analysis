"1","IMPASSIONED CALLS FOR REFORMING the intelligence process in U.S. foreign policy routinely follow on the heels of high‐profile intelligence failures in which the intelligence community or the government as a whole is caught by surprise. These failures are blamed on inadequate warning grounded in organizational, psychological, and informational weaknesses in the intelligence process, as in Pearl Harbor or the failure to “connect the dots” before the 11 September 2001 attacks.1 The reforms that follow usually attempt to reorganize agencies and processes by improving the speed, amount, and accuracy of intelligence information provided to politicians, particularly the president.2 Yet these reforms often fail.3"
"2","The reforms might have a better chance of succeeding if reformers understood that policy output does not always flow from intelligence input. Given this disconnect, what may appear to the public or even to Congress as an intelligence failure or a policy failure may be neither from the perspective of the president or the bureaucracy.4 There may be reasons other than a lack of sufficient information as to why no policy action was taken in response to intelligence information, even if the situation seems to call for action. This is a particular version of a larger problem with policy‐relevant information. If administrative agencies, think tanks, and scholars produce so much research, why is so little of it used?5 With respect to intelligence information, the reason has to do with the mismatch between the incentives for intelligence producers and consumers. The former are rewarded for satisfying the latter, and the latter often perceive that they will be rewarded for pursuing an agenda that does not always comport with the best available information.         "
"3","Scholars of intelligence history have lamented that policymakers sometimes do not want the best intelligence, even if analysts could provide a more accurate, correct, or timely product. Robert Jervis, one of the deans of intelligence studies, concludes that “[a]lthough decision makers call for better intelligence, under many circumstances they do not want it.”6 The sometimes puzzling distance between what intelligence analysts produce and what policymakers use has led Stephen Marrin to call for a new kind of theory to be developed to show how decision makers actually use intelligence, taking into account decision makers’ preexisting beliefs.7 Paul Pillar recounts the many ways in which American foreign policy is driven by overarching strategic and political agendas, unrestrained by intelligence information.8 In a similar vein, Joshua Rovner identifies the “pathologies” of the intelligence producer–consumer relationship that lead to a mutual suspicion.9 One classic principal–agent analysis of the intelligence producer–consumer relationship explains policy nonaction with reference to bureaucratic noncompliance stemming from agents who do not share the president's interests and presidents who cannot monitor agency activity.10 While Amy Zegart produces compelling evidence for noncompliance, the opposite is also true. Presidents do not always comply with the advice of intelligence producers and analysts, even when, in hindsight, it appears that they should have.         "
"4","This article contributes to the analysis of why policymakers might not want the best intelligence available by identifying four categories of reasons why presidents and their advisers may not take action even in a situation in which new intelligence information seems to demand new policy. Sometimes bureaucrats and advisers withhold information that they know will contradict the president's preferred policy positions. In other situations, typically in international diplomacy, intelligence collectors and analysts may give the president information that he does not wish to acknowledge publicly. In still other cases in which the president does not take action, he may be seeking plausible deniability about some practice or new information. Finally, presidents may have a desire for opacity in cases in which public certainty about some intelligence information would upset the global strategic balance or a president's foreign policy interests. In response, presidents may expand the scope of the problem or introduce new information or a new procedure, such as a commission, with the intent of moving an issue from the realm of knowledge to the realm of opacity. The desire for opacity is the most novel of the four categories, and this article illustrates the phenomenon using the example of the alleged secret Israeli–South African nuclear test over the South Atlantic 1979."
"5","Intelligence failure can result from technical or human capital limitations. For instance, an intelligence agency may not be able to get past computer security, or it may not have enough speakers of a foreign language to go undercover to penetrate dark networks. One of the most popular non‐resource‐based diagnoses of the cause of intelligence failure is “politicization.” This capacious term refers to a variety of mechanisms and contexts, including situations in which subordinates are too eager to please their superiors, intelligence officials are wary of unresponsive or ill‐informed presidents, a congressional oversight system is structured to satisfy individual legislators’ interests rather than the national interest, or an overly complex bureaucracy leads to information overload for decision makers.11"
"6","Better intelligence reform requires better understanding the causes of intelligence failure. As the list in the foregoing paragraph shows, there are many causes of intelligence failure. One phenomenon that sometimes leads to a perceived intelligence or policy failure is the nonuse of intelligence information when a situation seems to demand action. There are at least four categories of nonuse of intelligence information."
"7","Sometimes intelligence officials or White House advisers receive intelligence information but do not share it with the president because it would contradict or call into question the president's preferred policy position. In other cases, the bureaucracy may have a different policy preference than the president and may not wish to introduce information that would change the status quo. Information can be withheld at many levels, from the level of an analyst, to a manager, to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). As a result, the president does not take action to alter the status quo because he does not have the relevant information. In most cases, however, the president has already signaled that he does not want such information through official statements, unofficial comments, selection of advisers, nonverbal cues, strategic priorities, and priorities left out.12"
"8","The paradigmatic example of withholding undesirable information is the Vietnam War, when advisers withheld estimates of the Vietcong's strength, leading to wildly optimistic estimates of American superiority.13 For example, in 1970, the Office of National Estimates wrote an analysis that highlighted the costs and unintended consequences of invading Cambodia. DCI Richard Helms withheld the estimate rather than deliver it to the president and policymakers in order to protect the intelligence community, which was under fire for its performance during the war. Intelligence scholars have concluded that the estimate would not have stopped the invasion, and Helms might have decided that withholding the information would not make a difference in the course of events of the war.14 If the willingness to withhold information is generalized, however, it can lead to policy unrestrained by facts and analysis. In another case, military estimates pegged the Vietcong's strength at between 200,000 and 300,000 men and declining. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) criticized this estimate as overly optimistic, noting that it did not take into account the nonregular forces that operated with the Vietcong, underestimating the Vietcong's true strength. The CIA's estimate of the Vietcong's size was twice as large as the military estimate. The lower numbers put the White House and military commanders in a better light because they showed that the United States was closer to winning the war.15"
"9","John Gentry and others have analyzed how intelligence professionals sometimes withhold information or mislead in order to please politicians and, presumably, to remain close to power and continue serving as trusted advisers to the president.16 Gentry identifies cases in which politicians prefer poor intelligence or no intelligence at all to more accurate intelligence. For example, DCI Helms refused to tell the president about a CIA report that emphasized the high cost of the Cambodian incursion in 1971 because he knew that President Richard Nixon had already made up his mind to invade. Helms also drew criticism for not warning Nixon about how unlikely South Vietnam was to win the war. Helms complained about White House staff who challenged the assumptions behind the CIA estimates, pressured him to accept the military estimate, and suggested that he “get on the team.” In the end, he responded to White House pressure and accepted the military estimates.17"
"10","Pressure usually comes only indirectly from the president through White House advisers. Henry Kissinger, who served as Nixon's National Security Adviser, famously filtered the judgments of the intelligence community to suit the president's (and his) policy priorities. Among the incidents that Rovner reports is this gem: “[Kissinger] told a group of senior intelligence officials that his ‘most important client’ wanted the facts separated from the judgments and identified as such. One witness recalled that Kissinger was ‘pretty unhappy’ about the CIA's conclusions about Soviet intentions: ‘He kept saying he didn't want to influence our judgments—but!’”18"
"11","In many cases, the bottlenecks for heterodox intelligence estimates are politically appointed officials whose career advancement depends on pleasing politicians. Uri Bar‐Joseph alleges that Robert Gates, Deputy Director for Intelligence from 1986 to 1989, produced “selective intelligence estimates that reflected the administration's political preferences, not only with regard to the magnitude of the Soviet threat, but also other global issues, from Iran's internal politics to the likelihood of a popular revolution in Mexico.”19 Numerous scholars have recounted a similar process during the Iraq war, when White House advisers filtered out intelligence estimates that did not reflect their priorities.20 Officials in the Department of Defense promoted estimates developed from information gathered from Iraqi defectors with unreliable histories. These estimates suited the George W. Bush administration's justification for war based on finding weapons of mass destruction.21"
"12","Intelligence community leaders and presidential advisers perceive that they and their organizations are more likely to be penalized for advancing information contrary to what the president wants than to be penalized for withholding information. This cost–benefit calculation is similar to the idea of groupthink, whereby status rewards flow to those who can “get with the program,” but rather than the peer pressure of a group, the intelligence producer–consumer relationship relies on a hierarchical system of rewards and sanctions."
"13","To take one example, just before the Cuban missile crisis, members of the United States Intelligence Board issued an estimate that said that the Soviet Union was unlikely to bring nuclear missiles to Cuba. Pillar concludes that they knew that the John F. Kennedy administration would discount any other judgment, as it had already publicly dismissed the idea that nuclear missiles would be brought to Cuba.22"
"14","Intelligence officials and White House advisers may withhold information because they realize that bringing it forward would damage their career prospects or weaken their influence in future debates. A president may gradually tune out advisers who present information that threatens to derail his priorities. Michael Handel notes that Walt Rostow and Kissinger served unusually long tenures as advisers to Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Nixon because they rarely offered judgments contrary to the president's preferred positions.23"
"15","All of these examples could be considered “politicization,” whereby intelligence strays too far from the facts as recognized by professionals and is changed to please policymakers. Rovner describes withholding information as “soft politicization” because no documents are forged and no speeches rewritten. Instead, some information is discounted and other information is highlighted.24 A single instance might have relatively minor implications, but withholding information can distort the policy processes if it is part of a pattern in which the costs of bringing forward information contrary to the president's preferences are borne solely by the analysts. The president may experience some costs when war goes badly or the country experiences a surprise attack, but in reality, the political costs may be borne by a president's successors.25"
"16","A second category of nonuse of intelligence information occurs when a policymaker has clear knowledge of some fact or intelligence report but does not acknowledge it. The most straightforward instance of this phenomenon occurs when a president or policymaker substitutes his or her knowledge for the intelligence community's analysis, or when a policymaker uses one intelligence estimate to justify actions and ignores another. During the Vietnam War, Nixon and Kissinger received estimates from the military and the CIA, but they often chose military intelligence estimates over the CIA's, which were more pessimistic about the progress of the war. When it came to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), however, the president and his staff relied more heavily on the CIA estimates, which confirmed their policy preferences.26 The president was aware of conflicting intelligence and military estimates, but he discounted estimates less favorable to his policy positions and publicly acknowledged estimates that supported his positions as reason to act. Sometimes the president looks outside the traditional intelligence community for estimates, as in George W. Bush's reliance on the newly created Office of Special Plans in the Department of Defense, after administration officials were dissatisfied with CIA estimates.27"
"17","In another example, President George H.W. Bush did not give credence to warnings that Iraq might threaten its neighbors before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.28 As a result, the invasion caught some U.S. policymakers by surprise. Erik Dahl explains this and other failures to heed warnings before Pearl Harbor and the 11 September 2001 attacks as the result of two factors that determine policymakers’ level of interest. Policymakers are more likely to listen to intelligence information the more they believe in the seriousness of the threat or issue, and the more they believe in the utility of the information. Dahl's analysis provides a useful prism through which to view a president's decision making, and it can be supplemented by considering nonacknowledgment as one of several ways in which policymakers might not use intelligence information.            "
"18","In other cases, leaders may acknowledge intelligence information privately but prefer not to acknowledge it publicly or in official discussions because doing so would upset the status quo. For example, the United States has had clear knowledge that Israel possesses nuclear weapons for decades, but it has cooperated with Israel's policy of nuclear opacity, whereby the two countries do not publicly acknowledge Israel as a nuclear weapons state.29 Similarly, U.S. law did not recognize India as a nuclear weapons state after it detonated a “peaceful” nuclear explosive nicknamed “Smiling Buddha” in 1974 or even after it conducted nuclear weapons tests in 1998. Policymakers knew about India's nuclear activities, but they considered it unwise to publicly acknowledge India as a nuclear power because doing so could encourage other states to seek nuclear weapons in order to enhance their status.30"
"19","In some cases, a president may pursue nonacknowledgment through inaction. It is difficult to identify clear cases of deliberate inaction in the face of intelligence community evidence that calls out for the president to do something, but finding a gap between intelligence community findings about potential threats and presidential inaction can direct scholars to areas in which the president preferred not to acknowledge new information. For example, the intelligence community concluded that North Korea probably continued to engage in a covert nuclear weapons program even after a 1994 agreed framework in which the country pledged not to develop such a program.31 The intelligence community had no official view, however, because it had not been asked to formally review the matter in an intelligence estimate. Henry Sokolski charges that the Bill Clinton administration did not ask for a formal estimate because doing so might bring to light revelations that would endanger the 1994 agreement.32 Thus, the president's conspicuous lack of action in requesting an estimate contributed to nonacknowledgement about the status of the North Korean program.            "
"20","Another situation in which leaders have clear knowledge but prefer nonacknowledgment is when they seek plausible deniability about some activity that is morally or legally questionable. In these cases, the information concerns some activity or deed, often covert action overseas, rather than an estimate or analysis.33 Some scholars use the term “plausible deniability” to refer to situations in which the president had clear knowledge but did not want to publicly acknowledge the U.S. role in some activity. For instance, Mark Lowenthal writes that “[i]n the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs debacle … President Kennedy defended his decision not to commit air power to assist the invasion on the grounds of maintaining the deniability of the U.S. role.”34 In contrast, this article uses plausible deniability to refer to situations in which it is not clear that the president or his closest advisers knew the most relevant details about the activity in question, and their involvement cannot be conclusively traced or proven. This is distinct from the second category of nonacknowledgment and clear knowledge, which occurs when contemporaries or historians can provide evidence that the president and his closest advisers knew about an activity or estimate but chose to neither give credence to the information nor acknowledge it publicly.            "
"21","Loch Johnson's review of the history of CIA covert action shows that the president's role in authorizing covert action was structured so as to be hidden from outside view. “Keeping the White House at a distance from unsavory activities would allow the President to say publicly, ‘I never authorized this inappropriate secret operation and I am taking measures to punish those who carried it out.’”35"
"22","Plausible deniability can occur at many levels of government. For instance, one mid‐level government official involved in warrantless eavesdropping inside the United States told the New York Times that when he questioned the legality of the program, “People just looked the other way because they didn't want to know what was going on.”36"
"23","As a category of nonuse of intelligence information, however, plausible deniability is important when it prevents information about some activity from reaching decision makers, especially the president. Sometimes the president's subordinates decide on their own to remove the president from a decision‐making chain. Vice Admiral John Poindexter told a congressional committee investigating the Iran‐Contra affair that, “I made a deliberate decision not to ask the President, so that I could insulate him from the decision and provide some future deniability for the President if it ever leaked out.”37 Loch Johnson emphasizes the problems that plausible deniability poses for democratic accountability, writing that “the nation's chief executive may as well have been a mannequin in a storefront display of the Oval Office. The president was an irrelevancy” during the Iran‐Contra and Huston Plan schemes.38 Poindexter's justification was to protect the president and the presidency from being tarnished by morally and legally questionable acts. In the infamous Huston Plan, intelligence officials likely did not want to risk that Nixon would ask them to stop the morally and legally suspect electronic surveillance and spying on domestic radicals that was already under way.            "
"24","It is by definition difficult to obtain information about who knew about plausibly deniable activities. We know enough about the history of covert actions and spying, however, to suspect that presidents and their closest advisers structure these activities so that the president sets a goal and has some information about outcomes, but that the president's legal advisers ensure that he is told about the activities only in the most vague or ambiguous terms, if at all. We have some more information about presidential involvement in plausibly deniable activities from the past, such as plots to assassinate Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba in the Congo or Fidel Castro in Cuba, efforts to destabilize the regime of Salvador Allende in Chile, and projects to arm the mujahedeen in Afghanistan.39"
"25","Some readers of the Senate Intelligence Committee's 2014 summary of its report on torture have accused presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama of overseeing torture and drone strike programs with “eyes wide shut,” implying that they granted authority and policy goals to the CIA while preserving their plausible deniability.40 The same could be said of members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who have oversight responsibility.41 Demonstrating whether these presidents had clear knowledge of secret programs will require access to archives as well as historical distance.            "
"26","A president's creation of opacity is a related but distinct phenomenon that occurs when the president prefers the murky realm of opacity and a lack of certain knowledge. Creating opacity is a strategy to seek numerous sources of information as a means of reinforcing the status quo and denying credence to new information that might destabilize U.S. policy. Intelligence opacity means that one cannot move from the realm of belief to the realm of knowledge in a particular matter. It is most commonly a policy of actively muddying the waters so as to distract attention from information contrary to the status quo or to a preferred policy position by, for example, expanding the scope of a problem or creating a commission to study an issue. The cumulative effect limits what can be known about a particular matter as a basis of policy. This is different than cases in which the president prefers public nonacknowledgment when he has clear knowledge because in cases of opacity the president actively contributes to creating uncertainty."
"27","The theoretical roots of a president's desire for opacity lie in presidents’ search for “strategic competence,” which results in a puzzling situation: a president deeply discounts information that may seem important in gaining an accurate picture of the world. Strategic competence refers to how presidents deploy time, attention, and capacity to achieve partisan, institutional, and ideological advantage.42 In cases in which information might upset partisan, institutional, or ideological advantage, the president may prefer opacity rather than clarity. This insight follows from prospect theory, which holds that individuals weigh losses greater than gains.43 If a decision context occurs in the domain of losses, presidents, like most human beings, are more likely to make risky decisions, such as Dwight D. Eisenhower's initial choice to deny that the American U‐2 plane shot down over Soviet territory was engaged in espionage.44 Risk‐averse presidents may prefer opacity in matters that are so sensitive that they could embarrass the president or upset international stability.            "
"28","Presidents may not want to acknowledge whether a country is making progress toward developing nuclear weapons, for instance, because that would require the United States to take a political or military risk that has substantial negative consequences, while the consequences of remaining in the realm of opacity are much less, at least within the four‐year timeline of a presidential term."
"29","The clearest evidence for whether the president has a desire for opacity in a particular matter is whether the president has created a commission that casts doubt on previously accepted facts. After 11 September 2001, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith created an intelligence office in the Pentagon that questioned intelligence community estimates regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and its connections to al Qaeda—both rationales for regime change in Iraq. This became the Office of Special Plans, which collected information from Iraqi defectors that was used to provide the rationale for war.45 Although the president himself did not create the office, questions remain for future historians about the degree to which the office carried out Bush's wishes compared to the goals of other White House officials, in particular the vice president, which may have been distinct from the president's goals.            "
"30","There are other examples of presidents who created a commission to move an issue from accepted knowledge to opacity. During the Nixon and Gerald Ford administrations, journalist Seymour Hersh wrote articles about CIA‐sponsored assassinations and political plots overseas. President Nixon had ignored these articles, but as evidence began to mount, Ford decided on a new strategy to protect the secrets that were called the CIA's “family jewels.” He formed the Rockefeller Commission, headed by his own vice president. The commission “had the appearance of a group of serious public servants. However, none of them were really likely to question presidential prerogatives, or dig too deeply, or so Ford thought,” according to former DCI Stansfield Turner. The commission eventually led to the Church and Pike Committees, both congressional investigations that were more critical of the CIA.46"
"31","The strategy of creating opacity and, therefore, not using intelligence information about an event or a prediction is the most understudied and undertheorized of the reasons presidents do not use intelligence information. This category raises a number of questions for why and how presidents pursue opacity. Why wouldn't a president seek full knowledge about events and the best predictions about the future? How can presidents create a commission that has both legitimacy and sufficient loyalty to the president's view? The best way to analyze these questions and begin to understand why presidents might employ a strategy of opacity rather than other strategies of nonuse of information is to examine one case in detail, using a mix of primary and secondary sources. The move from widely agreed‐upon near likelihood to opacity in the case of an alleged nuclear test over the South Atlantic points to a pattern that historians are likely to uncover in other instances in which the facts are murky."
"32","On 22 September 1979, an American satellite detected a flash of light that many U.S. and other government officials concluded was a secret Israeli–South African nuclear test over the South Atlantic. The Jimmy Carter administration sought explanations, but it had to consider the implications of the test before issuing a response. If the flash was a nuclear test, it would potentially undermine U.S. global strategy, and it could blemish Carter's diplomatic accomplishments before his reelection campaign. The scientific information was ambiguous. Theoretically, it could have been a strange natural phenomenon, a nuclear test, or something else, but initially the Carter administration believed that it was possibly and even likely an Israeli–South African nuclear test. Yet if the event were to remain unexplained or mysterious, President Carter could continue pursuing U.S. strategy abroad and reelection at home without interruption. The “Flash over the Atlantic” shows the incentives for a president not to know intelligence information that might upset a president's or a country's strategic goals."
"33","The incident began on 22 September, when the Vela 6911 Satellite detected a double flash, a signature characteristic of an atmospheric nuclear explosion, in a region near the Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic. The aging Vela satellites were first launched in 1963 for the purpose of detecting atmospheric nuclear tests as part of monitoring for a limited test ban treaty. Later tests identified the location as near South Africa's Prince Edward Island in the Indian Ocean."
"34","The Vela satellites have optical sensors that are used to detect light emissions on a time scale of less than a millisecond.47 Atmospheric nuclear explosions produce a distinctive signature: a short flash followed by a longer, comparatively dimmer emission of light, which is a thin layer of compressed air. Nothing else in nature has this signature, and there are no other known false alarms.48 The Vela 6911 had two light sensors, and normally they would have recorded exactly the same double flash signature, except for spatial differences depending on the orientation of the satellite. However, the two sensors did not produce the same values for the double flash, possibly because one sensor malfunctioned, and thus skeptics of the claim that a test occurred point to the discrepancy as a key reason to doubt the evidence for a nuclear test.49 In addition, two U.S. defense satellites that monitored signals in the South Atlantic did not notice the test—another piece of evidence that the test never occurred. However, a Los Alamos Laboratory study from the period that was recently made available explains that the event was not actually within the defense satellites’ field of view and that clouds and weather weakened the signal so that it would not have been perceptible. The Los Alamos study found “strong evidence” of a test.50"
"35","After the incident, the U.S. government sent aircraft and naval ships to collect radiological evidence from the region in “one of the most extensive air sampling operations in recent years,” according to a U.S. Air Force historian.51 None was found, but a researcher at the Ionospheric Observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, recorded an ionospheric wave that could have come from a nuclear test.52 The evidence mounted further when a naval research laboratory that was a key part of Cold War nuclear detection concluded that the flash was probably a nuclear test, although the data and analysis from this report remain classified.53 The first assessment of the National Security Council (NSC) on 22 October 1979 was that the intelligence community had “high confidence” that the event was a nuclear test.54 The NSC memo began, “The Intelligence Community has high confidence, after intense technical scrutiny of satellite data, that a low yield atmospheric nuclear explosion occurred in the early morning hours of September 22.”Along with this assessment, the memo warned that news of the test may leak and that the possibility of a South African test “impede[s] on our global nonproliferation and African policy interests.” In other words, the test would show that U.S. efforts to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons in general and in particular to encourage South Africa to put its civilian nuclear plants under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards and join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty had been futile. The memo went on to warn that “[t]he nonproliferation stakes could be high if the 22 September event caused a rupture in our nuclear negotiations with South Africa” and that failure to take action could cause problems for deterring proliferation elsewhere, such as in Pakistan and India.            "
"36","The memo concluded by noting that the event came at a bad time because it could interfere with nuclear and other security negotiations in Africa and South Asia. The memo also raised the possibility of not confronting the South Africans about the issue because South Africa would likely plead innocence if the evidence for a test was at all ambiguous, and because the United Nations Security Council behavior could be unpredictable, although the UN would likely require a penalty greater than simply sanctions on nuclear trade. The South Africans, however, could retaliate against sanctions through economic means, such as disrupting uranium supplies to key U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom. The memo concluded by urging cabinet secretaries and top national security decision makers who received it to act because “[w]e are unlikely to obtain any more information on the event in the near term—if at all.” White House sources quoted by the media in stories before Christmas said that natural phenomena such as a lighting strike were “unlikely” explanations for the flash and that the signal the satellite saw appeared to be a nuclear explosion.55"
"37","Something caused the intelligence community to backtrack, however, and a 7 January 1980 NSC memo revised the initial view and took “a position of agnosticism.”56 The January memo noted that the South Africans “have not issued an authoritative denial of involvement,” and it followed with the standard NSC options paper format, listing reasons why acknowledging a nuclear test would create diplomatic problems for the United States. The memo said that the United States could not afford to support UN sanctions against South Africa because European allies would suffer severe costs—a possibility if South Africa was found to have participated in a nuclear test. The memo reported that the United Kingdom, France, and Germany would expect that South Africa would cease uranium exports in response to UN sanctions, which would damage the European nuclear industry, and “the French have also told us that they would regard nuclear sanctions against South Africa as directed against themselves,” as France supplied South Africa with power reactors.            "
"38","Precisely what happened between October and January remains unclear. Hersh reported that the White House convened an advisory group to plan a response.57 National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski held a meeting at the White House in which the probability of the event being a nuclear test was placed at 90 percent or higher. One of the aides present suggested convening a panel to review the evidence, which Hersh suggests was a tactic to delay presidential involvement and hope that interest in the incident would fade. President Carter asked Frank Press, his science adviser, to establish a panel that would hear expert testimony and review the evidence. The matter became public when an ABC news reporter broke the story on 25 October 1979 after learning about the possible test from Pentagon contacts. When the White House was asked about the incident, a spokesman could parry the question by saying that an expert panel was reviewing the evidence.58"
"39","The Ruina panel, named for its chair, Jack Ruina, a former head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, was asked to evaluate the evidence. The panel was convened in late 1979 before doubts emerged, but over the course of three meetings, it collected evidence that called into question the conclusion that the incident was a nuclear test. In particular, the panel's investigation revealed some problems with the aging satellites. The sensors did not agree on how bright the flashes were.59 Without consistent information from a satellite past its operational lifespan and with a faulty sensor, the panel issued a report saying that the double flash “was probably not from a nuclear explosion. Although we cannot rule out that this signal was of nuclear origin.”60 The panel also considered a plausible alternative: that a meteoroid collided with a satellite and its debris reflected sunlight that was picked up as a flash.61 Most of the panel's report, completed on 23 May 1980, was limited to an analysis of the scientific evidence for a measurement of a nuclear test rather than analysis of the political situation that might have given rise to the test.            "
"40","Although a shift from initial suspicions about a test, the Ruina panel's conclusion was not unreasonable, and it was followed by other, later denials of Israeli–South African cooperation in a test. Waldo Stumpf, the head of the Atomic Energy Corporation of South Africa, claimed that South Africa lacked the resources to conduct a test and that “South Africa was certainly not responsible and was also not involved with anybody else, in this incident.”62 South Africa did develop a secret nuclear program that it did not reveal until 1993, however a subsequent IAEA analysis found that South Africa's program would have developed sufficiently by 1979 to conduct a test on its own, without Israeli help.63"
"41","During and shortly after the Ruina panel's deliberations, a number of new pieces of evidence emerged that suggested that the double flash was a nuclear test, but these were not reported by the panel. An Australian doctor detected iodine‐131, a product of nuclear fission, in sheep thyroids in western Australia, suggesting that fallout from the explosion might have spread there.64 Furthermore, a Los Alamos Laboratory study cast doubt on one of the prominent alternative theories—that the flash was caused by a superbolt of lightening. The Los Alamos study found that the signature of the flash matched the “unmistakable” signature of a nuclear test.65 Finally, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory collected additional ionospheric data that suggested that a test took place, and U.S. Air Force early warning signals showed evidence of a test on 22 September, according to nuclear analyst Frank Barnaby's account of the incident.66"
"42","Barnaby's case that a test took place also notes circumstantial evidence before the test. A South African official had made an unusual request that the U.S. National Technical Information Service review the literature “on nuclear explosions and the seismic detection of nuclear explosions, including the flight plans, predicted orbit plans and operations of the Vela satellite.”67 The request could have been an attempt to plan a test that was likely to escape detection. Additionally, a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) analysis led by a Harvard‐trained physics PhD and a lieutenant colonel found that while the search for a single piece of evidence that could confirm a test was unsuccessful, there were many other signals, but these were buried in the noise of data and difficult to detect, or the science behind them was so new or specialized as to not be well understood. The DIA analysis suggested that a nuclear explosion could have taken place while producing very low and almost undetectable levels of radioactivity.68"
"43","The lack of any public acknowledgment of a test is one reason it was difficult for U.S. authorities to publicly contradict the South African and Israeli governments and claim that a test occurred. Years later, however, a former Soviet spy, Dieter Gerhardt, told a Johannesburg newspaper that the flash was a nuclear test. He said in the 20 February 1994, City Press, “The explosion was clean and was not supposed to be detected. But they were not as smart as they thought, and the weather changed—so the Americans were able to pick it up.”69 That March, nuclear analyst David Albright reported that Gerhardt told him that no South African ships were involved in the test but refused to say who else might have been involved.70"
"44","The Ruina panel's ambiguous conclusion combined with mounting evidence that a test took place left observers with a puzzle similar to the JFK assassination. There was not enough evidence on either side to put an end to the debate about what really happened, and eventually it was not clear what evidence, if any, would be sufficient to provide a definitive conclusion. Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, a member of the Ruina panel, described his reasoning process in a 1989 memoir:               "
"45","I doubt that any responsible person now believes that a nuclear explosion occurred because no one has broken security, among South Africans or elsewhere. U.S. experience teaches that secrets of such import can't be kept long. After the United States tested its first megaton‐scale thermonuclear weapon, which completely evaporated the small Pacific island of Elugelab, stories about a disappearing island reached U.S. newspapers as soon as the task force steamed into Pearl Harbor and sailors had time to call home."
"46","Many people think that solving a scientific puzzle is an exercise in logic that could be carried out equally well by a computer. To the contrary, a scientific detective's main stock‐in‐trade is his ability to decide which evidence to ignore. In our DIA briefings we were shown, and quickly discarded, confirming evidence from a wild assemblage of sensors: radioactive Australian sheep thyroids, radiotelescopic ionospheric wind analyses, recording from the Navy's sonic submarine‐detection arrays that supposedly precisely located the blast from patterns of sound reflected from bays and promontories on the coast of Antarctica.71"
"47","Alvarez correctly notes that analysts should be wary of confirmation bias, in which information confirming an outcome is given greater weight that disconfirmatory evidence. However, he implies that the only confirmatory evidence would be a “smoking gun,” such as a public confession or indisputable evidence of a test. Unfortunately, smoking guns are rare in intelligence and security matters, and it is impossible to know how many nuclear secrets have never come to light. Another approach would be to develop a theory of what might have happened, including intent, cause and effect, and the actions leading up to and following a test. The analyst could then look for confirming or disconfirming evidence before and after the actual event. If there was a test, it was shrouded in secrecy, and Alvarez's observation that a secret cannot be kept is dubious, especially considering that Israel and South Africa kept a tight rein on government officials and the press during the era."
"48","Contrary to Alvarez's way of thinking about the problem, one could think more like a Sherlock Holmes detective, beginning with a theory of who might have wanted to conduct a test, how a test might have happened, and why news of it would have been kept under wraps or denied. Israel and South Africa both had nuclear programs in various stages of development at the time of the test, and a contemporaneous NSC memo reports that both countries had incentives to cooperate—South Africa had a burgeoning nuclear industry and isolated waters for testing, and Israel had advanced technology.72 Both countries were relatively politically isolated at the time. In 1991, Hersh reported evidence of Israeli–South African cooperation, with Israeli ships having sailed to the supposed site of the event and the South African navy observing under a cover of bad weather.73"
"49","Furthermore, other analysis besides the Ruina panel concluded that a test took place and should be considered alongside the panel's conclusions. Hersh reported that the CIA's Nuclear Intelligence Panel decided in February 1980, that the event was a nuclear test. The facts contained in the panel's report to the CIA were redacted in response to a Freedom of Information Act request for the memo, but Hersh's quotation from the panel's chair, Donald Kerr, a former Carter administration defense official, is clear.74 “We had no doubt it was a bomb,” Kerr told Hersh.75"
"50","Finally, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory issued a 300‐page report synthesizing available scientific data and concluded that there had been a nuclear event near Prince Edward Island, which is south of South Africa.76 Other calculations from Los Alamos and Mission Research Corporation (which supports the U.S. Air Force) produced plausible scenarios for how a test might have occurred given the discrepancies in how the two light sensors recorded the flash.77 These studies also took a dim view of the Ruina panel's meteor theory. The models behind these studies remain classified.            "
"51","Whether or not Israel and South Africa conducted a joint nuclear test remains disputed, and the question may never be settled definitively for history. A number of organizations analyzed the facts, and they reached different conclusions. More recently, a former Senate arms control staffer, Leonard Weiss, has offered his conclusion that president Carter created the Ruina panel in order to increase ambiguity about the situation for political reasons.78"
"52","Whatever the reality, the president had reasons to prefer opacity to certainty that a nuclear test occurred, and the incentives for opacity increased over time. If it came to light that a test had occurred, either the U.S. government would have been shown to be secretive and perhaps duplicitous, or the revelation would have weakened confidence in the government's ability to detect clandestine nuclear tests."
"53","Initially, some experts feared that the flash might have been a Soviet test, which would have undermined the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II), which the president had signed in June.79 If the Soviets were caught cheating, Carter's diplomatic accomplishment was for naught. If the test was a cooperative effort between Israel and South Africa, however, it would call into question the U.S. policy of tolerating Israel's position of nuclear ambiguity, where it did not publicly announce its possession of nuclear weapons.80 Finally, one of Carter's signature achievements was the Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt, which was to be one of the triumphs he would tout during his election campaign. If Israel was found to be responsible for the nuclear test, the political cost of Carter either imposing or opposing sanctions on Israel would be severe during his upcoming campaign.            "
"54","Aside from evidence of a test being contrary to the president's political interest, the evidence was so ambiguous that it could only confuse policymakers, even if they truly believed that the event was a test. If the Ruina panel had found there was a test in the South Atlantic in 1979 and the White House agreed, it is doubtful whether the data would have been clear enough to convince other countries to levy sanctions against either of those nations. David Simons, a Los Alamos physicist involved in nuclear verification who reviewed the evidence, was quoted in the July 1980 Albuquerque Journal saying, “Even we felt the United States would be putting itself in an awkward position. To stand up and force some kind of political sanctions with that kind of data would have been very difficult.”81"
"55","When it comes to foreign policy, we can assume that most presidents are risk averse, and it was better for the president to move from certainty to conventional wisdom in order to reduce the likelihood of sanctions against the U.S. ally, Israel, as well as reduce the chances that the president would be blamed for not taking action against the two countries for violating international norms and agreements."
"56","While calls for intelligence reform that emphasize “connecting the dots” assume that information shared will be information used, principals sometimes have reasons not to use intelligence information.82 Recent history reveals four explanations for why presidents in particular sometimes do not use intelligence information: to withhold information, to not acknowledge information, to maintain plausible deniability about some information, and to create opacity. In each of these instances, presidents do not use some available intelligence information because doing so would harm their interests, including their popular approval and their or their party's reelection chances. In some cases, using the information would destabilize the status quo and create the possibility for negative outcomes, such as war or reduced American credibility. The four categories of reasons why information is not used are explanations, covering the motivation, the process, and the outcome. Within each of these explanations are strategies employed by the conventional principals, such as the presidents, as well as the conventional agents, including bureaucrats. In reality, each person and organization involved has a number of goals and a number of interactions around information about a particular subject. Therefore, the four categories of reasons why information is not used are best appreciated using historical analysis that takes into account time and context.         "
"57","The fourth category, the desire to create opacity, is the most novel explanation and the most difficult to detect. Presidents might expand the scope of a problem in order to create opacity yet be lauded for their attempt to bring clarity to a new problem. They might also create commissions and refer problems for expert study, which appears like a step toward clarity rather than opacity. To determine whether the president is consciously not using information as part of a strategy to create opacity around an issue requires careful attention to which political figure and which analyst knew what, with what level of confidence, and when. This is a test best suited for the archival research and oral history tools of policy history. Just because a president's desire to create opacity around a particular matter cannot be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, however, does not mean that it does not exist."
"58","Considering the possibility that there are conscious reasons why presidents do not use information, including the desire for opacity about the facts of an event or forecast, helps shed light on the intelligence process. If the goal of intelligence reform is to make better use of intelligence for the public good, then it is not sufficient to improve the supply of intelligence to policymakers and assume that they will use it. One possible remedy is to increase the number of political decision makers who offer their points of view about intelligence so that no one person's agenda squelches intelligence information that otherwise should be aired. This is not a foolproof way to ensure that intelligence policy serves the national interest, but it does increase the likelihood that intelligence information will be acknowledged and, possibly, used.*"
