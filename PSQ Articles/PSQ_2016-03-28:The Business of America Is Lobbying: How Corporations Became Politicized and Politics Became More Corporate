"1","Prior to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, systematic data on corporate political activity were limited to firms' electoral activities, and thus most studies of firms' engagement in politics focused on campaign contributions. As Lee Drutman and others note, however, firms' spending on lobbying is many multiples of their political action committees' contributions to candidates."
"2","Drutman's book builds on Frank Baumgartner and colleagues' Lobbying and Policy Change by focusing on corporations. The broad thrust of Drutman's argument is that corporate lobbying has internal momentum, with the best predictor of current lobbying being past lobbying. The mechanism behind this relationship is an agency problem in which lobbyists exploit the informational advantages they have vis‐à‐vis their managers and clients to overpromote the benefits of their services and thus extract unjustified gains. Although others have identified similar agency issues, only Drutman ties them to lobbying's growth, as well as to broader political and economic harms.         "
"3","For the general reader, Chapters 1–7 provide a nice background on interdisciplinary lobbying research. The book's data and narrow focus limit its ability to inform practice and research, however. First, for a book studying firm decision making, the author's failure to interview any corporate managers for their views on lobbying is unusual. Instead, only lobbyists are interviewed. Second, the book's focus on agency seems to miss significant changes in business's market and nonmarket environments since 1980 that may help explain lobbying patterns. For those familiar with the “financialization” of the economy, the shift toward particularistic and competitive lobbying is no surprise. Further, in the last decade, several studies have shown how “diffuse” interest groups are increasingly challenging firms directly through private politics, which has made investment in politics more important for firms. As neither of these changes is addressed, there is no sense as to how they, too, may be driving lobbying."
"4","Political science and strategy scholars may also find Drutman's empirical evidence insufficiently supportive of his arguments. For example, many analyses are limited to S&P 500 members, which are outliers in terms of lobbying, and several analyses are also restricted to 2007, an odd choice given that lobbying reforms enacted that year and the 2008 financial crisis have altered firms' lobbying strategies. More problematically, Drutman principally measures lobbying using counts of in‐house and contract lobbyists hired by firms, as coded from the Washington Representatives directory. There are several issues with these data, as they are measured inconsistently before and after 1996 and fail to properly capture lobbying intensity. The reader should at least know how these counts correlate with lobbying expenditures in available years.         "
"5","The econometric model of lobbying presence in Chapter 9 has limitations, too. Because the sample is conditioned by previous lobbying engagement, there is an unaddressed selection issue; further, the model controls for neither other forms of political activity nor competitors' activity. Additionally, Drutman seems to have missed an opportunity to provide stronger evidence for an agency argument by failing to exploit the different incentives of in‐house and contract lobbyists. The former clearly have a greater interest in their principal or firm performing well. Given these micro‐level concerns, skeptical readers may find it difficult to see corporate lobbyists as responsible for macro‐level harms."
"6","Finally, Drutman offers a package of reforms. The proposals call for greater representation of noncorporate interests and increasing government's policymaking capacity. The latter raises the question of why Congress has not yet empowered itself. One possible answer that lessens businesses' fault for the current state of affairs is that just as firms are skilled at constrained optimization in their market and nonmarket environments, politicians are skilled at structuring the rules that govern these environments to their own benefit."
