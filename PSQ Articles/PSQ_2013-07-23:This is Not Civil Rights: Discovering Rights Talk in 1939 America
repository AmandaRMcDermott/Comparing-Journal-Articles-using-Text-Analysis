"1","How deeply is “rights talk” woven into everyday political discourse? How much of that talk merely indicates idealism, confusion, or complacency on the part of the democratic masses, rather than thoughtful engagement? To address these questions, George Lovell examines 879 letters written by individuals to the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Section (CRS) from 1939 to 1941. Although the CRS's mission involved only race, individuals wrote to the CRS seeking redress of all other imaginable alleged rights violations as well—prompting the head of the CRS to remark, “This is not civil rights.” Thus, almost none of the rights claims were heeded by the CRS. Lovell details both the legal and extralegal arguments made in the letters, and concludes that they “result in a relatively optimistic picture of rights claiming as a rhetorical strategy in everyday political encounters” (p. 138)."
"2","Lovell admits that his conclusion depends on his interpretation of the letters. Although few of the letter writers were educated in the law, Lovell nonetheless asserts that most of them made coherent legal arguments. He is extremely generous in his interpretations, though, as few of the rights claims had any basis in law at the time. Even in the rare instance in which he finds that a letter “makes little sense,” he compliments the writer as having an “oddness that is poetic.” The relevant letter states, in part, “They are indelicate. I please for indemnification. I get been inculcate frequent time” (p. 133). Indeed, Lovell concedes that one might alternatively conclude that “the primary lesson that the letters teach is that Americans are stunningly ignorant” (p. 198)."
"3","In the classic film Casablanca, French inspector Louis Renault proclaims with mock surprise that he is shocked to find gambling going on in a casino. Likewise, in reading Lovell's analysis, I was shocked (shocked!) to find that human beings will conjure up rights claims to support their desired outcomes, regardless how expansive, legally ungrounded, or unlikely to succeed those claims are. In other words, the letters demonstrate unsurprisingly that individuals will grasp at legal straws when that is all they have to grasp. In fact, some letters did not even ask for redress, but merely vented angry catharsis.         "
"4","Lovell argues that the fact that many of these rights aspirations were legally fulfilled in later decades reveals the sophistication of these claims. In a democracy, however, the sustained wishes of the majority are typically translated into legal policy eventually. Thus, Lovell's evidence does not necessarily show that ordinary individuals are legally sophisticated, but does show that law often eventually conforms to a democratic public's desires, regardless of how unsophisticatedly those desires are expressed. Different readers, though, obviously will interpret the letters differently."
"5","Lovell also asserts that his conclusion differs from other critical scholarship. Most critical legal scholars posit that legal discourse by the public typically submits to, and thus reinforces, the hegemony of the ruling legal ideology. The letters here, on the other hand, frequently challenged the existing legal regime. This is Lovell's best point. He admits, however, that there is the potential of significant self‐selection bias, since he does not (and cannot) compare the rights discourse of the letter writers to the rights discourse of the vast majority of the public who did not write such letters. Thus, his findings possess debatable generalizability. Regardless, by examining rights talk in 1939 America, Lovell has offered an original, interesting, and important contribution to the study of legal discourse."
