"1","ON 12 MAY 1975, A U.S.‐REGISTERED COMMERCIAL ship, the SS Mayaguez, was commandeered by Cambodian forces while en route from Hong Kong to Thailand. In response, the United States threatened military action, which it took after waiting several days to assemble forces. The Cambodians released the crew members and U.S. forces retook the Mayaguez, but other military operations were nearly disastrous. Questions quickly arose about the way the crisis was managed, and Congress ordered an investigation. The resultant report raised issues about U.S. motives, the adequacy of intelligence, and missed diplomatic opportunities, among other things.         "
"2","Since then scholarly publications, including four books from university presses, have examined the crisis, benefiting from an increasing amount of primary source documentation.1 Data on what was said and done during the crisis is exceedingly rich. Researchers have the president's whereabouts on a minute‐by‐minute basis throughout the crisis; what was said in all the National Security Council (NSC) meetings at which the president made his major decisions; a chronological listing of intelligence community activities and communications during the crisis; all the oral and written Department of Defense orders; the most important diplomatic communications from the crisis; the conversations during Henry Kissinger's Department of State staff meeting on the first day of the crisis; the content of NSC staff products on the crisis; memoranda of conversation in the Oval Office between key leaders during the crisis; what was said during telephone calls and conversations between key leaders, including the president and his senior advisers; the memoirs of numerous major and minor White House figures who comment on their impressions of decision‐making during the crisis; in‐depth interviews with key leaders, including the president, who gave two detailed interviews immediately following the crisis; recently declassified minute‐by‐minute notes from the military assistant to Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger, who records the secretary's conversations by phone and in meetings; numerous oral histories from participants in the crisis, particularly military and diplomatic subordinates; an inspector general investigation of flawed intelligence dissemination; congressional hearings and testimony on the incident within days of the event; White House staff memos written during the crisis; documentation of White House outreach to members of Congress, including the conversations from the meeting between White House participants and selected members of Congress during the crisis; declassified military histories that chart the military decision‐making process between the Pentagon and forces in the field; and numerous accounts written by military officers who commanded and conducted the military operations.         "
"3","However, the copious amount of data has not produced a consensus explanation for what happened. Thirty years ago, an article in this journal argued that the U.S. response to the seizure of the Mayaguez “was a hasty, risky, ill‐conceived action not commensurate with publicly stated objectives.”2 All scholars agree that U.S. military operations narrowly avoided disaster,3 but there is no corresponding consensus on why the United States behaved as it did. The reason is that scholarship has focused on describing rather than explaining crisis behaviors, which is unnecessary and unsatisfactory. It is unnecessary because one explanatory variable accounts for all U.S. behavior with great consistency. It is unsatisfactory because not distinguishing between competing explanatory variables and their efficacy stymies progress toward cumulative knowledge.         "
"4","Before explaining U.S. behavior, it helps to describe what happened. After that, a detailed analysis of critical decisions made during the crisis corrects some errors in the literature to date and enables an accurate explanation of crisis behaviors.4 The article concludes with commentary on how the record of scholarship on the Mayaguez crisis helps explain the slow advance of cumulative knowledge in foreign policy analysis.         "
"5","From Monday, 12 May through Thursday, 15 May 1975, President Gerald Ford and his senior advisers managed the crisis precipitated by the seizure of the Mayaguez. According to Brent Scowcroft,5 the deputy national security adviser at the time, it was the only time in history that a president managed a crisis directly through his NSC. The NSC met four times,6 and Ford made all the decisions on how to manage the crisis in those meetings rather than authorizing a subordinate group to exercise oversight on an ongoing basis. There was near unanimity on objectives, but not on how to achieve them. The extent to which cabinet officials used their positions to control implementation of presidential decisions to obtain their preferred outcomes has not been fully appreciated. In the end, one cabinet official was fired but for the wrong act of insubordination, while another's orchestration of events has largely been ignored.         "
"6","Scowcroft informed President Ford about the Mayaguez seizure at his 7:00 a.m. intelligence briefing. (Note: Befitting the discussion of U.S. decisions, all times mentioned are eastern standard time unless otherwise noted. Local Cambodian time was 11 hours ahead of Washington, DC.) Cabinet officials learned of the event in their morning briefings or staff meetings, but only National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger immediately reacted to the news with great alarm. When he met with Ford at their 9:15 a.m. meeting, he argued the gravity of the situation and convinced Ford to convene an NSC meeting around noon to examine response options.            "
"7","The NSC meeting opened with William Colby, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, noting that Cambodia probably was stopping ships like the Mayaguez to assert sovereignty over islands contested by Vietnam and Cambodia because of their underlying oil fields. U.S. leaders thought the Cambodians had taken the ship and crew to the mainland port of Kompong Som, so when they discussed military options, they considered reactive and punitive measures, including seizing Cambodian assets, taking an island hostage, or mounting a blockade. Kissinger raised the idea of seizing Cambodian shipping or mining harbors, and Schlesinger offered the possibility of sinking the Cambodian navy. The meeting ended with agreement on strong statements demanding the release of the ship and crew and the need for more detailed military options from the Pentagon.            "
"8","After the meeting, Kissinger left for an event in Kansas City, Missouri. Ford's political advisers wanted to portray him as in command of the crisis, and having Kissinger out of town contributed to that perception. While Kissinger's plane was in the air, the White House announced the seizure of the ship, calling it an “act of piracy,” demanded its immediate release, and promised dire consequences otherwise. Several hours later, the deputy secretary of state, Robert Ingersoll, tried to pass the same warning to Cambodian authorities through a representative of the Liaison Office of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese diplomat refused to accept the message. Later the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing delivered notes to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Cambodian Embassy that repeated the threat to take military action if the ship and crew were not released."
"9","Meanwhile, Pentagon leaders ordered the USS Coral Sea aircraft carrier and its escorts to head for Cambodia and worked on military options for the president. That evening, shortly after 9:30 p.m., the Pentagon called Scowcroft with good news: a U.S. reconnaissance plane had located the Mayaguez not far from where it had been seized. Contrary to assumptions, there was still a chance to isolate the Mayaguez from the mainland. Scowcroft informed Ford and then left for home. Less than an hour later, Scowcroft's assistant, Marine Major Bud McFarlane, called with more news. The Mayaguez was moving toward Kompong Som. Scowcroft immediately returned to the White House, where he contacted Major General John Wickham, Schlesinger's military assistant, to ask whether there was time to stop the Mayaguez from reaching the mainland.            "
"10","Wickham called Scowcroft back around 1:00 a.m. and told him that Thai‐based F‐4 fighters could reach the ship and were being loaded for that mission. Scowcroft told Wickham to launch the aircraft while he sought presidential permission for the interdiction. It turned out there was more time than Scowcroft thought. Captain Charles Miller of the Mayaguez had convinced the Cambodians that he could not safely move his ship to Kompong Som harbor without running it aground.7 Not long thereafter, U.S. intelligence intercepted a Cambodian communication indicating that “the American prisoners were to be moved to Tang Island,”8 a narrow three‐mile‐long island about 30 miles southeast of Kompong Som.            "
"11","Not knowing this, Scowcroft called Ford at 2:23 a.m. He said he did not think there was time for an intercept but felt they needed to try. The president agreed but cautioned that the plane should not sink the Mayaguez, which Scowcroft agreed would be disastrous. Minutes later, Scowcroft was told the Mayaguez was anchored off of Tang Island, and he relayed this to Ford.9 Later, U.S. aircraft reported some of the crew had been transferred to the island on small boats. Ford called Schlesinger shortly before 6:00 a.m. to say he wanted the Mayaguez quarantined: no Cambodian vessels should be allowed to move between the island and the mainland. Schlesinger passed these orders down the chain of command to Lieutenant General John L. Burns, the on‐scene commander. The wording demonstrated great concern with a modulated use of force:               "
"12","It is desired that we isolate island of Kas Tang [sic] by turning boats away. Gunfire across the bow is one method that can be used. In view of the direct communications contact with the on‐scene commander, immediate report on any movements should be available to Washington. Therefore, the decision to fire on or sink any boats resides in Washington. It is particularly important to get maximum information on any outgoing boat to determine if there are Americans aboard and to report such when requesting authority to sink. Although this will be difficult to accomplish, deck loading will probably be required on the small boats as they did in taking personnel . . . from the ship to the island.10"
"13","Scowcroft met with Ford alone that morning since Kissinger was in Missouri. They agreed that another NSC meeting was needed even though Kissinger would be absent. Scowcroft notified the Pentagon, and Schlesinger met with his uniformed leaders to review military options.11 There also were indications that morning that Cambodia might be interested in a diplomatic solution. A news broadcast reported that the Mayaguez would be released after Cambodia received “US apologies and the return of Khmer aircraft in Thailand” (that is, planes transferred as Cambodia fell to the communists). Thinking about communicating with the Cambodians, the Defense Intelligence Agency shot a query to the National Security Agency about entering the Khmer communications net to transmit messages to Khmer leadership.            "
"14","At the second NSC meeting, Colby updated the NSC, noting that it was believed that some of the crew members were on Tang Island. The president, vice president, and Scowcroft were upset about the faulty reports that had misled decision makers about the location of the ship (see Figure 1). Ford also insisted, “We must have the information immediately. There must be the quickest possible communication to me.” General David Jones, acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reassured the NSC that the Pentagon was well staffed for the crisis and ready to quarantine the ship and crew. He thought “there is a good chance that we could keep it from going into the harbor without sinking it.” With respect to rescuing the crew members on Tang Island, Schlesinger noted the inherent risk, but he had a plan:               "
"15","The danger for the Americans on the island is that we do not know what the Cambodians would do. I think there is less danger if we have the dominant force. We will have Cambodians on the choppers who will be able to say that we can take the island unless they give us the Americans or the foreigners. This message would be bull‐horned from the choppers at a time when we are ready to act."
"16","A little later, during a meeting on domestic policy issues, the president stepped away to make a call to Kissinger in Missouri. The president wanted Kissinger's thoughts about a general ultimatum—that is, setting a deadline for the Cambodians to release the Mayaguez, a position favored by some of Ford's advisers. Kissinger told Ford he was against it. To newsmen, Kissinger appeared confident and upbeat. He said he had the impression that “the government is fully united on the course that needs to be taken.” Asked by Time correspondent Strobe Talbott when he foresaw the incident ending, Kissinger smiled and said, “I know your magazine's deadline. I think we can meet it.”12"
"17","Ford spoke with Schlesinger about an hour after calling Kissinger. He told him there would be a third NSC meeting that night, and he wanted military options in writing. He reiterated his instructions on the quarantine and specified the ship was to be prevented from moving with carefully escalated force. Scowcroft reiterated Ford's instructions in a phone call to Wickham at 2:00 p.m., adding Ford wanted a coordinated assault on the island and ship and approved moving Marines from Okinawa to Thailand. Scowcroft closed with an odd request, saying that White House lawyers needed a copy of the execute orders on interdicting the Cambodian boats."

"19","Source: GAO Report, 64.                        "
"20","Just after 6:00 p.m., Schlesinger called Ford with news that one of the small boats had left the island, and Ford reiterated that any boats leaving should be sunk. Schlesinger also gave the president the tragic news that 23 U.S. personnel had died in a helicopter crash. It happened while U.S. Air Force security police from the 56th Security Police Squadron were being positioned as an emergency assault force at Utapao, Thailand, in case Marines could not arrive quickly enough. It was a tragic reminder to the senior leaders of the inherent risk involved in any military operations. That evening, White House staff began notifying members of Congress about military measures to quarantine the Mayaguez and its crew and keep Cambodian reinforcements from reaching Tang Island.            "
"21","Then began several hours of tension that determined the outcome of the crisis. For three hours, the president's orders were sidestepped, questioned, delayed, and eventually thwarted in an act of insubordination that greatly angered the White House but saved the lives of the crew and, arguably, Ford's reputation. It began with the chairman's assistant, Lieutenant General John W. Pauly, and Wickham discussing several boats that departed Tang Island for the mainland. U.S. planes turned back two with riot control agents, but the third was undeterred. At 8:11 p.m., Wickham passed this information to Scowcroft and then Schlesinger. Schlesinger told Wickham to “destroy it” before leaving to get ready for his late‐night NSC meeting.13 Ford and Scowcroft reached the same conclusion. “If they can't stop it any other way, we have no choice but to destroy it,” Scowcroft said. Ford agreed.14 Scowcroft called Wickham back at 8:14 p.m. and said that Ford wanted the boat stopped: “If they can't do it any other way, it has to be destroyed.” Alarmed about the possibility of killing Mayaguez crew members, Wickham responded, “We may lose the thing here in the next few minutes.”15"
"22","Despite orders to sink the boat, Wickham deferred. Eventually, hearing the pilot say that he noticed a large group of about 40 people on deck, Pauly and Wickham asked for details. The pilot said “the ten to twelve up on the focsle appear to be Caucasian.”16 With that information, they decided to approach the White House for permission to engage the boat. Scowcroft wanted to know why Wickham was asking, given the president's standing orders. “Well,” Wickham replied, “now we have a question as to the identity of the people on the bow.” He asked Scowcroft to “run it by the President. I have an open line to them [i.e. the pilots] and you can get right back to me.”17 Scowcroft (S) called the president (P):               "
"23","S: The pilot thinks he can stop it without sinking it. . . .                     "
"24","P: Well, I don't think we have any choice.                     "
"25","S: If they get the Americans to the mainland they have hostages and . . .                     "
"26","P: We have to predicate all these actions on the possibility of losing Americans.                     "
"27","S: I will have them ask the pilot to do his best to stop it without sinking it.                     "
"28","P: I think that is right. I will be over there in about 15 minutes.18"
"29","When the NSC convened for the third time at 10:40 p.m., Ford asked Scowcroft to summarize the fast‐evolving situation. In considering the risk to the crew, Ford said that if the boat reached the mainland, “and we have done the other things we are contemplating, there will not be much opportunity for [the crew] anyway.” Kissinger, back from Missouri, thought the Cambodians might hold the crew “for bargaining.” Schlesinger thought the NSC should worry less about “avoiding bargaining chips” and more about “being in a position where the Cambodians can say that the F‐4's killed our own men.” Ford asked for recommendations. Schlesinger was for sinking the boats but only using riot control agents on the vessel with Caucasians. Kissinger dithered before agreeing with Schlesinger, saying, “We will take a beating if we kill the Americans.” But, he told Ford, “We must understand that we cannot negotiate for them once they are on the mainland. If you are willing to take that position, then I think we can let them go.” Scowcroft said a boat had already been sunk, implying that the decision to risk the crew was a moot issue. Schlesinger retorted that the patrol boat “did not have Caucasians on it,” prompting Kissinger to observe that could not be known with certainty."
"30","This exchange led to a venting of White House frustration about the Pentagon not having sunk boats as previously ordered. After discussing whether the Pentagon was implementing presidential orders with alacrity, Ford decided to “reluctantly agree with Jim and Henry” and let the boat with the Caucasians go. As it turned out, the Cambodians were not dissuaded by riot gas, so the boat proceeded to the mainland along with what U.S. leaders assumed was at least part of the Mayaguez crew. NSC members then agreed on sinking all other Cambodian patrol boats, even though they might be carrying Americans.            "
"31","Another topic in this NSC meeting was the risk in seizing Tang Island. The NSC knew that assaulting Tang before all U.S. forces were assembled carried higher risks, and they assessed how the arrival of various U.S. forces would affect risk. Ford listened and then summarized the consensus that attacking right away was not worth the additional risk. Schlesinger, Kissinger, and Jones all agreed, so Ford postponed operations. He asked the Pentagon to be ready to go 24 hours later but reserved the final decision about whether to wait yet another day for the next NSC meeting. The decision on whether to use B‐52s or Coral Sea aircraft to strike the mainland was also postponed. The meeting ended with a discussion of mainland targets and how to justify attacking them.            "
"32","Not long after the third NSC meeting ended at 12:30 a.m., an intercepted Cambodian communication indicated a possible desire on the part of Cambodian authorities to seek a political solution. The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research alerted the director of the Mayaguez Working Group (in the Department's operations center) to this development at 1:20 a.m., as well as Kissinger's personal assistant and the White House Situation Room. Just before 5:00 a.m., a cable from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran announced another possible diplomatic opportunity. The subject line read, “Chinese Embassy Tehran Believes Mayaguez to be Freed Soon.”20 A senior Chinese Embassy official in Tehran said that China was “embarrassed” by the seizure of the Mayaguez and expected it to be released soon. State officials also learned that morning that China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had returned the U.S. message for Cambodia, saying the Cambodians had refused to accept it.            "
"33","Scowcroft and Kissinger met with Ford several times that morning. During one meeting, Kissinger took a call from Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Joseph Sisco, just before 10:00 a.m. Sisco said,               "
"34","For public relations reasons only, why don't we go through the cosmetic motions by writing a letter to the UN [that is, United Nations] and send it to the Security Council protesting the seizure on the high seas. It will help us with the Congress when we get to military action. Why don't we also try to get the Secretary General? I know nothing will come from this.21"
"35","Kissinger was leery, but Sisco persisted, saying, “we can't lose a thing by it.” Kissinger gave Sisco permission to prepare the communication but did not approve it."
"36","In the Pentagon, Jones and Schlesinger discussed military options, reaching agreement on the use of air power and the risks the Marines were running. Schlesinger voiced his strong opposition to B‐52s, arguing that “any use would have to be on political grounds.” As for the Marine assault, both men expected some “preparation” of the landing zone and continuous air cover thereafter. It was noted that Marine Commandant General Robert Cushman “had no concern about securing the assault area.” At the White House, Ford, Kissinger, and Scowcroft discussed the Mayaguez after visiting with the Dutch prime minister, Johannes den Uyl. Kissinger encouraged Ford to “take out the port,” saying they would “take as much heat for a big strike as for a small strike.” Kissinger then left the Oval Office briefly to call Sisco. “Joe,” he asked, “can we just send that letter to the Secretary General and not to the President of the Security Council?” Sisco agreed, saying he would make it public so that it “looks like a serious attempt.”22 Kissinger directed him to go ahead. Sisco moved quickly. Within the hour, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations (UN) approached UN Secretary‐General Kurt Waldheim.            "
"37","The fourth NSC meeting started just before 4:00 p.m. and went almost two hours. Colby noted that some crew members were on the mainland. Jones briefed the Joint Chiefs’ recommendations, saying they considered B‐52s “overkill.” Ford asked about the departure time for the island assault, observing that based on the schedule provided, the Marines were already 40 minutes late (see Figure 2). Instead of seizing the opportunity to ask for another day's delay, Jones responded, “they should still make it.” Ford then approved the assault. Not long after that, 11 CH‐53 and HH‐53 helicopters took off from Thailand, eight carrying 179 Marines toward Tang Island and three carrying 48 Marines to retake the Mayaguez.            "

"39","Source: Author, from numerous primary sources.                        "
"40","On mainland strikes, Ford decided in favor of carrier strikes, specifying that they “should not stop until we tell them.” Jones asked about an ultimatum before striking mainland targets, which was discussed at length. Kissinger was still against it, and Ford accepted his position. The subject of casualties came up. Schlesinger opined there might be 20 or 30 killed in action. Deputy Secretary Clements said that, sooner or later, the public would hear about the 23 men already killed in the helicopter crash. The meeting ended with discussion about how to manage “consultation” with Congress and when to notify the public and allies that operations were underway."
"41","At 7:00 p.m., the United Nations issued a statement stating that the secretary‐general was communicating with the Cambodians and urging all parties to refrain from further use of force. Seven minutes later, the Cambodians locally broadcast a long, rambling statement that ended with a reference to the release of the Mayaguez: “we will release this ship, but we will not allow the U.S. imperialists to violate our territorial waters, provoke incidents in our territorial waters or force us to release their ships whenever they want, by applying threats.” It took time to receive, translate, and deliver this news. The Department of State heard about it just before 8:00 p.m., and Kissinger and Scowcroft 15 minutes later. Kissinger had Scowcroft call the Pentagon to hold off the first air strike. At that time, Schlesinger was en route to the White House. Upon arriving he found Kissinger, who showed him a copy of the broadcast. Fearing it was just propaganda, Schlesinger argued that mainland strikes should continue.23 Kissinger called Ford out of the state dinner with Uyl at 8:50 p.m. to tell him that their combined recommendation was that the strikes continue. Ford agreed.            "
"42","Meanwhile, White House staff considered how to communicate back to the Cambodians. One NSC staffer, William Lloyd Stearman, suggested using Khmer frequencies the NSA was monitoring. Instead, Kissinger decided “the most expeditious way would be to release a statement to the news services.”24 White House Press Secretary Ronald Nessen put Kissinger's message out to the press at 9:15 p.m. It said that the ship had been retaken, but if Cambodia was prepared to release the crew “unconditionally and immediately,” military operations would cease. By then the Marines had been fighting for almost two hours and were in difficult straits. Shortly after 10:00 p.m., a fishing boat carrying the Mayaguez crew was sighted by a U.S. plane. Four minutes after the president bid his Dutch guests farewell at 10:45 p.m., the USS Wilson, a destroyer, intercepted the boat and recovered the entire crew. At 10:57, the second wave of aircraft from the Coral Sea bombed Ream Airfield, destroying 17 planes, cratering the runway, and flattening the hangar.            "
"43","Ford returned to the Oval Office at 11:00 p.m. There he was joined by Kissinger, Scowcroft, and McFarlane, and over the next half hour, by White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld and other staff. At the Pentagon, the question arose as to whether the third wave of aircraft should strike given that Captain Miller of the Mayaguez had promised strikes would cease if the crew was released. Miller explained his bargain to the USS Wilson's captain, who passed it up the chain of command. This issue was also being discussed in the White House. Stearman argued, “Henry, we got our people back, we got the ship back, why don't we call off the air strikes? Suppose one of our guys gets shot down and we have another prisoner or worse yet somebody gets killed. So, why don't we knock it off?” Kissinger retorted, “We are not going to lose any aircraft.”            "
"44","Rumsfeld had a different concern. He wanted assurances that the entire crew was safe before Ford announced it on live television. While Ford was on the phone with Schlesinger to get this confirmation, Scowcroft asked whether there was any reason not to disengage. Kissinger said, “No, but tell them to bomb the mainland. Let's look ferocious! Otherwise they will attack us as the ship leaves.”25 At 11:50 p.m., the third strike group hit an oil refinery and several buildings, including barracks and warehouses.            "
"45","President Ford made his brief televised remarks to the nation announcing the safe recovery of the ship and crew just before 12:30 a.m. He then returned to his residence, where he spoke one last time with Schlesinger at 12:35 a.m. before retiring. After that conversation, Schlesinger cancelled the fourth air strike against the mainland so that Coral Sea aircraft could provide support for the Marines. For the next eight hours, U.S. forces worked in harrowing circumstances to extract the Marines with the fewest possible casualties.            "
"46","The most important issue to resolve was what U.S. leaders were trying to accomplish and what objective had the highest priority. Kissinger made the case for a demonstrative use of force in his first private meeting with Ford and, with support from Vice‐President Rockefeller, again in the first NSC meeting. He argued that the lives of the Mayaguez crew “must unfortunately be a secondary consideration.” He later denied this quote, but the subsequent arguments, decisions, and behaviors of the key leaders indicate they agreed this was the case. Boats were sunk despite the possibility that crew members might be aboard and the island was assaulted despite the obvious dangers that posed to the crew. All evidence indicates Scowcroft was right when he later explained that the overriding priority was “to make it clear, to everyone, to our friends, to potential opponents, that notwithstanding the fact that we had just withdrawn from Southeast Asia under fairly ignominious circumstances . . . the United States understood its interests and was prepared to protect them.”26 The corollary of this primary objective was the need to avoid the opposite: a weak response or, worst of all, a humiliation akin to the USS Pueblo experience.         "
"47","Pentagon leaders are sometimes depicted as disagreeing about the need to punish Cambodia to make a larger point,27 but this is not true. Schlesinger advocated punitive action but wanted to avoid a use of force that was counterproductive. He believed a botched operation or overkill would inflame public and congressional opinion and undermine U.S. credibility. The punitive actions he favored were commensurate with the nature of the offense, a naval action, and designed to minimize collateral damage. He said several times that the Cambodians could kill the crew at will, but he said he wanted “to paste Cambodia to the point that they realized it was not worth it to them to keep the crew.”28 He argued for a sequence of actions that would minimize chances of Cambodian reprisals. In the second NSC meeting, he listed U.S. objectives as the need to prevent the ship from reaching the mainland, recover the crew, and “attack and sink the Cambodian Navy,” but “later, after we have our ship and our people out, in order to maximize the punishment.” When news of the Cambodian broadcast arrived, he argued with Kissinger that the air strikes should continue and won him over on that point.         "
"48","At no point were the lives of the crew accorded paramount importance. The iconic moment illustrating the latent incompatibility of punitive military operations and protecting the crew occurred when pilots reported Caucasians on the fishing boat. “It would have been a much better position for us to take,” Kissinger said, “that we will simply hit anything that leaves the island.” “Now,” he said, “we are debating with the pilot.” Ford insisted he had given just such an order, but the Pentagon had flouted his will. Ford called it “inexcusable” and promised an accounting would be made. He “reluctantly” agreed that destroying the boat after a positive sighting of Americans would be counterproductive. Ford then quickly drove the group to agreement on the need to destroy all the remaining Cambodian boats. When one adviser obtusely observed that some boat might “have Americans on it,” Kissinger spelled things out clearly: “I think the pilot should sink them. He should destroy the boats and not send situation reports.”"
"49","Military operations were a foregone conclusion given the key decision makers’ overriding priority. However, a number of important subsidiary decisions had to be made."
"50","Kissinger managed diplomatic communications to further the priority objective. Diplomatic communications and public statements were cast as threats because, as he explained, “we can get some credit if the boat is released.” If Cambodia buckled, he said, the United States could say “the release is in response to our statement.” In the third NSC meeting, he favored a public acknowledgment that U.S. forces had sunk Cambodian boats, because “it is not inconceivable that the Khmers will cave,” and if so, it “should come in response to something that we had done.”"
"51","Declassified U.S. diplomatic communications reveal threats and not appeals for assistance. China declined the role of courier for American threats, which Kissinger later said he expected.29 As congressional investigators noted, Kissinger did not contact the Cambodians directly in Phnom Penh, Paris, or Moscow. He did not respond to the NSA intercepts suggesting Cambodian interest in a resolution to the crisis or to the report from Tehran 12 hours before the military assault on Tang Island. He did not inform other NSC members about the Tehran cable.30 It was only distributed to offices in Kissinger's Department of State and NSC staff. Kissinger made it plain in the third NSC meeting that he feared a diplomatic development might sidetrack the use of force, so it is not surprising that neither he nor Deputy Secretary of State Ingersoll mentioned the Tehran cable during the fourth NSC meeting. Kissinger personally held up Sisco's diplomatic outreach to the United Nations and other diplomatic communications until it was too late to interfere with military operations. He only approved contacting Waldheim on the afternoon of the 14 May, a few hours before the decision to launch the assault on Tang Island.               "
"52","The other diplomatic issue discussed during the crisis was an ultimatum with a deadline. The idea originated at the Department of Defense, which was struggling with how to assault a defended island while obtaining the release of the crew. Military officers proposed using a bullhorn to communicate a simple ultimatum: “Produce all the Americans immediately or we will harm you.” The idea of a broader ultimatum was attractive to some in the White House. Kissinger argued against it, saying that “the risks were greater than the benefits, and the benefits were really domestic”—that is, to convince domestic critics the administration had given peace a chance.31"
"53","Sisco tried to get Kissinger to exercise more diplomacy. He asked Kissinger to approve diplomatic communications, assuring him they were cosmetic only and would not interfere with the use of force. He wanted to notify other nations and U.S. missions and provide guidance to the ambassador in Thailand (who was furious about being kept in the dark) and, most importantly, the UN Security Council. Kissinger approved some notifications, but they were so late that interference with military operations was unlikely. In doing so, he stipulated that he did not want the “usual pansy briefings” or “to give the impression of super reasonableness.” He pigeonholed other messages that Sisco offered to read over the phone or have hand‐carried to Kissinger for quick approval. Kissinger told him to have them hand‐carried, but he left them unattended on his desk."
"54","In sum, and contrary to other accounts,32 Kissinger, like Schlesinger, controlled his department to promote his preferred outcome, which was a demonstrative use of force. He also used his influence with Ford to ensure the military operations were as demonstrative as possible. He prevailed upon Ford to keep air strikes going after the Cambodian broadcast and again after it was known the crew was safe.               "
"55","The first of three key military execution issues was how to manage the quarantine of the Mayaguez and its crew from the mainland. The White House wanted carefully modulated force options for the Mayaguez but automatic interdiction of all other Cambodian naval traffic, even though it was not clear whether they carried Mayaguez crew members. The White House's lack of trust in the Pentagon to do this was underscored when Scowcroft told Wickham the White House needed copies of the execute orders for interdicting boats. Scowcroft, monitoring interdiction efforts closely, had the impression the Pentagon was stonewalling Ford's blanket interdiction orders. Ford said as much during the third NSC meeting but, given the pilot's sighting of Caucasians, let the fishing boat go. However, he insisted from that point on that all boats be sunk. He later expressed his anger at the Pentagon in a private conversation with Kissinger and Scowcroft, saying, “I am disturbed at the lack of carrying out orders. I can give all the orders, but if they don't carry them out. . . . I was mad yesterday.” He also expressed his anger in the fourth NSC meeting after Kissinger asked Pentagon representatives why boats were not being sunk.               "
"56","Given the diverse wording of presidential instructions in phone calls and NSC discussions, the Pentagon could have made excuses for not automatically sinking Cambodian boats. But rather than do so, both Schlesinger and Wickham have gone on record confirming Pentagon intransigence. Wickham acknowledged that he and General Pauly gave the “do not shoot” order “in defiance of instructions from the NSC.” Wickham said it would seem a “serious offense” but that it was “real‐time interceding,” which, he argued, “saved the lives of that crew.”33 In a widely overlooked interview, Schlesinger also acknowledged stonewalling the White House. “I refused to sink the boat,” he said, because, “to say the least, it seemed to me it would destroy our own purposes to sink a ship which would have killed the Americans we were trying to save.” He told his interviewer, “I stalled for three hours.”34 The three hours ran from 8:15 p.m. when Wickham responded to the order to sink the boat by saying, “We may lose the thing here in the next few minutes,” until approximately 11:00 p.m. when President Ford, gave the orders in the third NSC meeting to let the fishing boat go but sink all other Cambodian boats.               "
"57","The second key military issue was the timing of the operations. Here the Pentagon was compliant with senior civilian preferences—arguably more so than necessary or advisable. There was a great deal of discussion in the NSC meetings about the arrival times of U.S. forces and the risks of assaulting the island and retaking the ship, all of which were interrelated. In the third NSC meeting, Ford ignored Colby's advice to go as soon as possible and accepted the arguments by Schlesinger, Kissinger, and Jones, who believed the risks of going as early as the 14 May were too high. The debate then revolved around whether to go on 15 May or later after the USS Hancock arrived with its large complement of Marines and 10 more helicopters.               "
"58","The Pentagon option paper that Jones distributed explained the advantage of waiting for the Hancock. The risk of going earlier was the “serious disadvantage of slow insertion (270 men per wave at 4+ hour intervals).” Waiting another day would “carry lower military risks” and “enhance the prospects of quick success and minimize the loss of life.” The disadvantage of waiting was more time for the Cambodians to “put forward preconditions for the return of the ship and/or crew.”35 Rumsfeld worried about delaying and Kissinger agreed, but he added, “I cannot judge if there would be a problem in taking the island. . . . I cannot judge if 270 Marines can do it.” Rumsfeld said there would be 500 Marines and Kissinger corrected him, noting that for four hours there would only be 270 Marines, until the helicopters returned from Thailand with the second load of Marines. And Kissinger insisted, “We have to be sure that the landing has a chance of success.”               "
"59","At this juncture, the question of whether to wait another 24 hours hung in the balance and could have been influenced by General Jones. Jones urged a 24‐hour delay in the third NSC meeting because he believed going sooner was too risky, but he indicated that U.S. forces would be ready to go on 15 May with acceptable risk. Before the fourth NSC meeting, Jones met with the other Chiefs of Staff to review the question again. Presumably the Chiefs knew that subordinates such as Vice Admiral George Steele, the Seventh Fleet commander, were asking for more time,36 and they agreed that another day to coordinate the disparate forces arriving on the scene would be useful. However, the Chiefs decided another delay was not necessary. In an interview not long after the crisis, Jones said the Chiefs felt the need to move before the crew was imprisoned on the mainland. Thus, “on balance the Chiefs decided that the degree of risk in going as planned on the fourteenth [15 May in Cambodia] was acceptable and that the urgency of the recovery should govern.”37"
"60","This explanation is hard to understand. The decision had been made in the third NSC meeting to allow the boat with Caucasians to reach the mainland and sink all other patrol boats. Thus, any further risk of the crew being taken to the mainland was presumably eliminated. The only remaining reasons to accept higher military risk were the hope that moving quickly would encourage Cambodia to capitulate rather than conduct reprisals—a questionable proposition—and Kissinger's fear that delaying another day might result in some kind of diplomatic breakthrough or gambit that would sidetrack military operations. Before the final NSC meeting Jones was told by Scowcroft that there was “considerable concern” about his not bringing in the views of the other Chiefs who, according to later interviews, were “eager to proceed without delay.”38 Years later Jones said, “There was great pressure to act very quickly and to act before all the forces were in place; to take that risk.”39 Jones apparently was referring to pressure from the White House, but he may have meant from the other Chiefs as well. In any case, it appears he wanted to accommodate White House preferences.               "
"61","Much of the literature on the Mayaguez asserts civilian leadership micromanaged the crisis and made inappropriate decisions on military operations. The most recent book on the crisis argues that “the operation was being driven from the very top” by “people at the strategic level not trained in military planning” who were “making operational and tactical decisions,” which “was a recipe for disaster.”40 It is true that military operations were driven from the top, but that group included General Jones who spoke for the Joint Chiefs. Ford acceded to the first 24‐hour delay when his advisers agreed it was too risky to go on 14 May. He likely could have been convinced to delay another 24 hours if the case had been made that the island assault was high risk. Kissinger, who wanted a preponderance of force and no chance of failure, pushed back against Colby and Rumsfeld when they ignored military risk too readily. He also invited the military's assessment of risk on several occasions by saying he was not competent to render judgment on how many Marines were needed for the island assault. Schlesinger obliged, arguing for 16 May, but neither General Jones nor Admiral James Holloway, the chief of naval operations, who also was in attendance, chimed in. Instead, Jones recommended going on 15 May. He told Ford and the NSC, “We can do it with high assurance of success” and noted that he was making “a joint recommendation from all the Joint Chiefs.”41"
"62","Thus, after all the discussion, civilian decision makers were left with the impression that taking the island was not a high‐risk endeavor. Accordingly, and consistent with their overarching goal, they gave priority to conducting the military operations sooner rather than later, recognizing that unnecessary delay ran the risk of having all military operations suspended by some unexpected development. Thus, they discussed how long to hold the island and what to do with prisoners taken, but they did not express any further concern that taking the island might prove difficult."
"63","Ford, Kissinger, and Scowcroft believed the Pentagon was chary of attacking the mainland. Ford came to believe that Schlesinger had “contravened” his authority on mainland air strikes and fired him several months later.42 In reality, Schlesinger was less obdurate about mainland strikes than Ford thought. Kissinger and Schlesinger differed on whether to use B‐52s or carrier aircraft, but neither was as adamant as sometimes depicted. Kissinger came to see Schlesinger's point that the use of B‐52s would exact too heavy a political penalty and made that point to Ford several times. Schlesinger was against using B‐52s, but he was prepared to use them if Ford so ordered and acknowledged that “B‐52s may represent the best image for what Henry is trying to accomplish.” B‐52s could launch from Guam without any other country's permission and reach their targets within six hours. Ford privately told Kissinger he only kept the B‐52 issue alive to encourage the Pentagon to deliver the full set of carrier strikes he wanted.43"
"64","That left the question of how many carrier air strikes there would be. Ford specified continuous air strikes, but because the crew was returned shortly after U.S. military operations began, only four waves of aircraft were launched. Ford learned that two of the four strikes never hit targets and was furious about it. Already suspicious the Pentagon was resisting his decisions to use military force, Ford came to believe that Schlesinger contravened his orders for the first and fourth air strikes. It is now evident that poor communication played a much larger role than Ford assumed."
"65","Space limitations preclude a full review of the first strike's failure to hit targets. However, it should be noted that Kissinger's memoirs err in asserting that Ford “had never been told the [first waves’ mission was] ‘armed reconnaissance’—whatever that meant.”44 In the fourth NSC meeting, Pentagon leaders described the Coral Sea strikes in detail, including the fact that the first mission would be armed reconnaissance. As it turned out, the first strike was put on hold by multiple calls from multiple people in the White House reacting to the Cambodian broadcast. There were 20 minutes of confusion before the strikes were turned back on. Schlesinger was not responsible for the first strike being aborted because he was on his way to the White House dinner for the Dutch prime minister, and when he arrived he recommended the strikes continue despite the broadcast.               "
"66","The cancellation of the fourth strike is more clear‐cut. At 11:45 p.m. Ford checked in with Schlesinger to confirm that the entire crew was safe before he made his nationally televised address. This was the call where other White House participants recall Kissinger encouraging Ford to “look ferocious” and keep bombing the mainland. Schlesinger told Ford that the Mayaguez captain, on his own initiative, bargained with the Cambodians by saying he would arrange an end to the bombing. Schlesinger told Ford the Pentagon was continuing with the third wave of Coral Sea aircraft (and they actually hit their targets at 11:50 p.m. while this conversation took place). According to Wickham's notes on the conversation, Ford responded by asking about the Marines:                  "
"67","P: What's status of Marines?                        "
"68","S: Heavily engaged on island. We can divert Coral Sea attack to help out.                        "
"69","P: 3rd wave diverted?                        "
"70","S: We are prepared to do this.                        "
"71","P: Think this is right decision. HAK [Henry Kissinger]?                        "
"72","S: 4th wave would go to the island.                        "
"73","Kissinger: I would keep some attack on the mainland until we get Marines disengaged on island.                        "
"74","P: Moderated—some. We divert rest to help Marines on island. We ought to have perception of continuing pressure.45"
"75","Wickham's notes suggest that Ford split his decision after Kissinger's intervention, indicating some aircraft could hit mainland targets while others helped the Marines. Yet White House interest in continuing pressure on the mainland was evident. After speaking with the president, Schlesinger went to the Pentagon's National Military Command Center. In the center's conference room Schlesinger, General George S. Brown (the actual chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had returned to the Pentagon during the crisis), Admiral Noel Gayler, and others discussed another strike on the mainland. Schlesinger told Brown to conduct a fourth strike, but Brown, Holloway, and Gayler all strongly argued against it, primarily because of the need to support the Marines. Schlesinger listened, accepted their recommendation, and redirected the fourth wave to assist the Marines on Tang. Coral Sea aircraft could not conduct close air support because they could not communicate with the Marines on Island, but moving the Coral Sea closer to the island did prove critically important for rescuing some damaged helicopters and wounded Marines.46"
"76","In sum, the Pentagon configured the first strike consistent with Schlesinger's preferences for a discriminate and proportional military response but did not hide this from the White House. Once the crew was released, Schlesinger supported punitive strikes, recommending to Ford the continuation of the second strike and ordering third and fourth strikes as well. Confronted with united opposition from his commanders and the need to support the Marines, he reversed himself and ordered the fourth wave cancelled.47"
"77","The most important insight from new sources, and particularly the NSC meeting minutes, is that U.S. leaders attached even greater importance to a demonstrative use of force than previously believed. Two revelations underscore their commitment: the decision to sink boats they knew might be carrying crew members,48 and the decision not to delay military operations another day for fear of losing the opportunity to use force. The willingness to risk the crew has long been surmised, but declassified materials demonstrate just how explicit the decision‐making was on this point. Another substantial revelation from declassified documents is that the White House was convinced Schlesinger and the Pentagon were ignoring the presidential order to sink any boats coming and going from Tang Island. Lucien Vandenbroucke cites an anonymous participant in a confidential interview saying that “officials reportedly withheld the order to shoot until it was too late for the planes to act.” John Guilmartin, who interviewed Schlesinger, says that Schlesinger “‘fluffed off’ the White House for three hours.” Robert Mahoney notes the White House's willingness to sink the boats and its frustration with the Pentagon's reluctance to act, but not the Pentagon's conscious decision to stonewall the White House. All these sources missed Schlesinger's explicit explanation of his behavior in his interview with Veteran magazine.49"
"78","This article makes some additional contributions to a better description of the crisis, such as Schlesinger's support for punitive measures; his preference for their sequencing to minimize possible Cambodian retribution; the extent to which Kissinger used his control of diplomatic communications to prevent interference with military operations; precisely how the Pentagon controlled air strikes and stonewalled the White House for three hours, beginning with Schlesinger's restrictive rules of engagement; how the debate about delaying military operations provided ample opportunity for senior military leaders to request another delay before launching the assault on Tang Island; and that the Pentagon was less obstructionist and duplicitous about the air strikes than Ford supposed."
"79","The additional descriptive details about crisis behaviors now available are illuminating, but their net impact for an explanation for U.S. behavior is minor. The fact that U.S. leaders attached even greater importance to a demonstrative use of force than previously believed just reinforces the basic explanation provided 30 years ago. But this is not at all apparent from scholarship on the Mayaguez crisis. Indeed, rather than improving understanding of why decision makers behaved as they did, the growing abundance of descriptive detail coincides with a deterioration of explanatory clarity.         "
"80","From the beginning, several alternative hypotheses for U.S. behavior predominated. Newsweek's reporting is illustrative. The magazine's cover carried the headline “The Rescue,” reflecting official U.S. explanations for the quick military action. Newsweek also suggested that Ford was motivated by domestic political concerns, citing a Republican congressman's tagline for the affair—“Marines Rescue Ship, Crew and Ford”—to suggest that Ford used force to resurrect his failing presidency, crippled by the fall of Vietnam and his unpopular decision to pardon President Richard Nixon. Newsweek also called U.S. military operations a “two‐day punitive expedition” to compensate for the “image of America's despairing retreat from Indochina.” The article said Ford was “putting adversaries . . . on notice that the U.S. is not after all a paper tiger.”50 Finally, it suggested that the U.S. response was an emotional reaction to the humiliation of losing Vietnam. It quoted politicians expressing ardent satisfaction, such as Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, who “exulted,” “I'm very proud to be an American today.” It said Ford's supporters “celebrated the recovery of the Mayaguez as though it were the battle of Thermopylae.” It ran a cartoon depicting Uncle Sam calmly evaluating responses to the seizure of the Mayaguez before succumbing to a first‐class hissy fit and lashing out militarily.51"
"81","All these competing explanations were embraced to varying degrees by commentators and analysts.52 Lamb's 1985 article in this journal argued something different: that U.S. leaders’ priority goal was a demonstrative, punitive use of force and that this explained their crisis behaviors. It compared and contrasted different decision‐making models for their explanatory efficacy before concluding that key leaders’ belief systems best explained priorities and behaviors. The case was made that other leaders with different beliefs about “the lessons of Vietnam” would have acted differently.53 Lamb's article, plus his 1989 University of Florida Press book, Belief Systems and Decision Making in the Mayaguez Crisis, critiqued previous research on the crisis at length. It benefited from interviews with Scowcroft and Colby but, notably, not from interviews with either Kissinger or Schlesinger.         "
"82","With the new information now available, it is clear that Belief Systems and Decision Making in the Mayaguez Crisis missed some important points. It overlooked the Pentagon's insubordination in initially refusing to sink all boats coming and going to Tang Island. It overstated the extent to which the decision makers had conflicting priorities. We now know that the concern with a demonstrative use of force was always the higher priority. It overestimated the extent to which Schlesinger viewed the military operations as a rescue mission, when in reality he supported punitive measures with his preferred sequencing and timing. It noted but underestimated the willingness of Ford and his advisers to risk the lives of the crew, and it portrayed Ford as an arbiter among strong subordinates, when in fact he was consistently guided by Kissinger's advice (indeed, the Mayaguez crisis may have been the high‐water mark of Kissinger's influence).54 For these and other reasons, the study needs revision. However, its explanation for U.S. behavior was correct and is only strengthened by declassified materials:            "
"83","The broad decision that force was necessary resulted from the belief shared by four key U.S. decision makers that deteriorating American prestige and credibility were threatening developments that had to be arrested. In particular, the decision makers were concerned about the probability of North Korean aggression based on perceptions of American weakness and lack of resolve. . . . From this tenet . . . flowed two corollaries [that] explain U.S. behavior with more specificity. First, the United States needed a show of force to substantiate the deterrent efficacy of U.S. power. Second, the United States absolutely could not afford another blow to its prestige, especially not a gratuitous humiliation from a minor power which had just recently participated in the forced removal of U.S. influence from Indochina.55"
"84","In 1993 Oxford University Press published Perilous Options by Lucien Vandenbroucke, a well‐researched book with multiple in‐depth cases studies, including a multiple‐chapter analysis of the Mayaguez crisis. It benefited from numerous interviews with both White House and Pentagon participants, and it was the first source to raise the allegation that the Pentagon was slow to implement the presidential order to sink boats coming from and going to Tang Island. Vandenbroucke took an eclectic approach to explaining U.S. behavior, embracing all the factors originally identified by Newsweek.56 He seems to place the most emphasis on the emotional catharsis explanation. “Anger at the new Communist regimes in Indochina . . . ran high,” he says, and “The administration ended up displaying an almost unthinking preference for the language of force.” He concludes, “the administration's handling of the Mayaguez fell short of cool, careful deliberation. When the ship was seized, the administration reacted with deep anger. From the start, there was strong sentiment among the president's advisers to lash back.”57"
"85","Vandenbroucke also embraces other explanatory factors. He argues, “Ford's domestic fortunes also subtly influenced . . . White House perceptions,” and “from the onset Ford ‘was not unconcerned with the effect of the crisis on his popularity’”; “U.S. policymakers were also gravely concerned about the country's image”; “the real purpose of the mainland strikes [was] to provide a lesson for the Cambodians and the others”; and “the Ford administration was determined to prevent another such humiliation [that is, a Pueblo incident].” Vandenbroucke also sees the military operations as a genuine rescue effort, arguing that Ford “was seriously concerned about the welfare of the crew.” However, he also argues that “[n]otwithstanding Ford's concern about the crew, hostility toward Cambodia and the administration's bellicose mood influenced White House decisions and attitudes from the start.”58 He believes blind enthusiasm for force led to cognitive dissonance as U.S. leaders “rapidly concluded that the Cambodians’ failure to respond to the diplomatic messages delivered in Beijing meant that they were not interested in a peaceful solution.” He also thinks U.S. leaders were so “eager to retaliate against Cambodia” they “apparently wished away key shortcomings of the plan.”59"
"86","Perilous Options muddles the explanation for U.S. behavior by using multiple explanatory variables without clearly establishing their relative efficacy. U.S. leaders were not driven by anger, domestic political calculations, or concern for the welfare of the crew; Ford did not change his mind on his priorities over the course of the crisis. On the contrary, the NSC minutes reveal decision makers who were calm, resolute, and calculating, who from the beginning gave priority to geostrategic purposes and consistently ranked the lives of the crew a secondary consideration.         "
"87","Neither were decision makers blinded by cognitive dissonance and wishful thinking. They correctly identified likely Cambodian motives in their first meeting and dismissed them as irrelevant.60 They carefully and repeatedly assessed risks as the crisis progressed, debating and reconsidering the risks of a Marine assault on Tang Island. The risks of the island assault were not correctly assessed, especially by subordinate military commanders, but the Joint Chiefs and the NSC did not ignore or wish the risks away. They discussed the risks at length and delayed operations a day as a result. Then the president accepted the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs that the operation could be executed with acceptable risk and high assurance of success, which in the end, and in terms of anticipated casualties, proved an accurate assessment; largely because of good fortune and the incredible efforts of U.S. servicemen.         "
"88","The senior leaders also directly confronted and debated the risks of military operations harming the crew. From the beginning, all the key leaders considered the lives of the crew a secondary concern. Schlesinger differed from the other key decision makers on how much the crew should be put at risk by U.S. military operations, but Ford, with support from Kissinger and Scowcroft, consciously decided to risk the crew by sinking Cambodian boats until Schlesinger's imposed rules of engagement led to a pilot reporting his sighting of crew members on the front of a vessel. At that point, the NSC debated again, and Schlesinger won over Kissinger to the view that the political blowback from killing the crew would be too detrimental to the image they wanted to project of a United States prepared to defend its geostrategic interests. Risks to the crew and of the island assault were not overlooked or wished away."
"89","In 1995 John Guilmartin's A Very Short War was published by Texas A&M University Press. Guilmartin was a participant in the military operations during the crisis, and he makes good use of new primary material from military sources, such as command and unit histories, and interviews with military participants. He examines the “interactions among policy, strategy, operations, and tactics” but devotes most of the book to an examination of the military operations and especially command and control arrangements. He finds fault with on‐scene commanders for failing to anticipate enemy opposition, noting that “no one in the operational chain of command above . . . a captain and a gunnery sergeant, seems to have done a worst‐case tactical assessment” of enemy capabilities. He also notes an egregious tactical omission, pointing out that there was “no workable plan to coordinate air and naval gunfire support with the assault.”61 According to Guilmartin, these types of problems were exacerbated by global communications that gave leaders in Washington a “false impression of positive control.”62"
"90","Guilmartin states that he relied on Lamb's study for depictions of Washington decision‐making, but his conclusions about U.S. leader priorities differ from Lamb's significantly. He agrees that decision makers “were prepared to give priority to the avoidance of hostage negotiations at the expense of the crew's welfare” but that those two objectives “clearly took precedence over a demonstrative application of force.” He offers no evidence for this ranking of decision makers’ priorities. He just argues that it makes sense because the bombing “could be orchestrated at leisure,” whereas the assault on Tang Island was where “the enemy ability to interfere was greatest.” He thinks it stands to reason that U.S. leaders would give priority attention to the assault on Tang Island.63 This conjecture gets decision makers’ priorities exactly wrong. U.S. leaders consistently gave priority to the demonstrative use of force, and secondarily, to avoiding hostage negotiations. The assault on Tang Island was rushed to accommodate those priorities at significant risk to the crew.         "
"91","The final university press book on the Mayaguez crisis is Robert J. Mahoney's 2011 study The Mayaguez Incident: Testing America's Resolve in the Post‐Vietnam Era. Published by Texas Tech University Press, Mahoney's work was the first scholarly analysis to benefit from declassified NSC meeting minutes.64 He illuminates the extent to which the White House was willing to risk harming the crew, Kissinger's strong dissent when other NSC members advised against delaying military operations, and other descriptive details not previously disclosed.65 The Mayaguez Incident gets some things wrong, however, in part because of uncritical acceptance of Ford's and Kissinger's memoirs, which contain notable inaccuracies.66 For example, it misses Kissinger's manipulation of diplomacy, his encouraging Ford to take the incident seriously and convene the NSC, that Schlesinger's strict rules of engagement and insubordination by Pentagon generals saved the crew on the fishing boat rather than “the pilot's initiative”, that Schlesinger was not against punitive strikes, and so on.67 But, more importantly, its explanation for U.S. behavior is not clear.68"
"92","On the all‐important question of what the United States was trying to achieve, Mahoney asserts, “The NSC's first priority was to send a strong message to the Cambodian government, as well as the world writ large, that the United States, although stung by setback in Vietnam, was not a hollow power.”69 A few paragraphs later he seems to hedge, citing the assertion in Kissinger's memoirs that U.S. leaders “were primarily worried about the safety of the crew” but also about international perceptions. Mahoney notes, “the two main priorities, advancing (or restoring) American prestige and the rescue of the Mayaguez and her crew, were so interrelated that it was possible one could not have been accomplished without the other.” But after reviewing White House decisions, he acknowledges “the prioritization of punitive action over the release of the crew,” which also “clarifies several other actions taken by the Ford administration.”70"
"93","However, Mahoney then blurs this explanation by asserting other explanatory variables. He believes the U.S. response was “shaped by the assumptions and predispositions of the members of the NSC,” which, in turn, were “shaped in part by the pressures at all levels—international, domestic, political, and personal.”71 He believes Ford refused to delay military operations another 24 hours because he “was determined not to allow a repetition of [the Pueblo].”72 But the Pueblo crisis was not a critical factor in Ford's decision on when to launch military operations. It was not mentioned during the fourth NSC meeting when Ford decided against further delays. By then Ford had done what he could to prevent a humiliating hostage scenario by quarantining the ship and Tang Island. At that point, the primary argument against delay was the threat of a sudden diplomatic or political development that might preclude the opportunity to use force.73"
"94","Mahoney also argues that Ford was motivated by domestic political concerns, stating that “Ford needed to address his weak power position as an unelected president and head of a party in shame.”74 Asserting that Ford used the crisis for political advantage makes the mistake of reasoning from effect to intent. There is no doubt that the initial public response to the use of force was highly favorable. A day after the crisis, the White House had received 3,254 telephone calls, 3,062 of which were in favor of the president's actions, and 5,404 telegrams, 5,068 of which also favored the president.75 However, those effects could not have been anticipated and were short‐lived in any case. Ford's public approval ratings fell quickly and precipitously as details of the incident and casualty figures became known.76"
"95","More importantly, the release of the crew that fueled the widespread public satisfaction could not have been anticipated and in fact was not expected. It was considered an unlikely outcome. Even after the fortunate release of the crew unharmed, many pundits and members of Congress were critical, which conversations with reporters and members of Congress during the crisis suggested would be the case if the president used force. Gaylord Nelson said he did not question the popularity of the president's decision but nevertheless thought it was wrong, noting that “these incidents are matters for negotiation, not force.” Senator George McGovern said, “I continue to be alarmed and puzzled as to why military action of this kind was taken before an opportunity was given to the diplomatic process.” Congressman Elizabeth Holtzman went further, saying the president's resort to force “appears to have been illegal and unconstitutional” and an “overreaction.” As Ford notes in his memoirs, given the divisive effects of the Vietnam War, these kinds of negative reactions were expected: “Predictably, liberals in both the press and Congress were harshly critical of my decisions.”77"
"96","What is most relevant to this discussion is whether Ford based any of his key decisions during the crisis on anticipated public and congressional reactions. With one exception, the opposite is the case. The president made it clear in the first NSC meeting that he would do what he thought necessary, saying “I can assure you that, irrespective of the Congress, we will move.” Early on he told multiple people, including his wife and a Congressman, that he had a very hard decision to make. He made the decision, agreeing with Kissinger that the lives of the crew were “unfortunately a secondary consideration,” and, as he later said several times, he was not inclined to revisit difficult decisions once he made up his mind. He was resolute in the other NSC meetings and in private conversations about doing what was in the nation's best interest rather than what might be popular. He used force earlier than the Pentagon recommended and consciously ran high risks of killing the crew members. He knew and discussed in advance that employing force would entail significant human and political costs but was undeterred by these considerations. NSC members spent considerable time discussing how to manage public perceptions of their actions, including the risks they were taking with the crew, which prompted Colby to comment, “We need to be braced against that pilot” (that is, the pilot who observed the Caucasians on the boat being attacked). Kissinger told Ford to ignore the idea of an ultimatum because its benefits were only “domestic,” (that is, a sop to domestic critics) and warned him he would “take as much heat for a big strike as for a small strike.” Ford took that advice, and in fact, by some accounts, he was more steadfast than Kissinger about the matter.78 It is evident from the recorded deliberations that decision makers were prepared for a storm of criticism79 and yet never let that influence their decisions.         "
"97","The exception was Ford's decision not to use the B‐52s, which his advisers thought would elicit a counterproductive political backlash that might suggest the U.S. ability to use force was hamstrung.80 Even then Ford only relented in the last meeting after being reassured by the Pentagon that it could deliver the desired amount of aerial bombardment with carrier aircraft. This exception proves the rule insofar as Ford and Kissinger acquiesced not to placate domestic opinion but in order to preserve the image of a United States ready, able and willing to defend its interests. All things considered, it is clear Ford understood the political risks he was running by using the seizure of the Mayaguez to signal U.S. resolve and yet ignored them in pursuit of what he considered more important national interests.         "
"98","In sum, The Mayaguez Incident includes a correct observation that decision makers gave priority to a demonstrative use of force for geostrategic reasons. But to the extent that Mahoney intends this comment to serve as an explanation for U.S. behavior, he muddles it by adding other explanatory variables such as Ford's supposed interest in improving his domestic political fortunes and an abiding concern with preventing hostage negotiations reminiscent of the Pueblo crisis. In reality, Ford was not influenced by domestic political considerations. Instead, he was determined to act forcefully regardless of domestic political consequences, including congressional angst over noncompliance with the War Powers Act.         "
"99","University press books are the focus of this inquiry because they carry the presumption of academic rigor. What is interesting about the record of scholarship from these sources is how, despite an ever‐increasing amount of primary data, they obscure rather than clarify the explanation for U.S. decision‐making. The three more recent university press books on the Mayaguez crisis make good use of new sources and contribute to a fuller description of the crisis. Yet they do not critically evaluate alternative explanations for U.S. behavior or assess the findings of previous scholarship.            "
"100","Guilmartin offers the clearest explanation of what he thinks motivated decision makers and the least evidence to support it. Both Vandenbroucke and Mahoney offer multivariate explanations without a clear assessment of the explanatory weight of the different variables they introduce. All three books jump from detailed description to “findings” and prescriptions, passing lightly over explanatory analysis. The authors offer diverse explanations, in essence arguing U.S. decision makers acted from a mix of motives, and leave it to readers to ascertain whether there was a primary motive driving U.S. behavior."
"101","This trend is important for two reasons. Fundamentally, it diminishes understanding of the Mayaguez crisis. Instead of correcting or building upon previous explanations for U.S. behavior, these scholarly works weaken consensus on the best explanation and introduce serious errors into the literature. Concern about declining U.S. credibility was not a lesser, tangential concern or one among several or many influential concerns. It was the overriding concern of U.S. decision makers and their controlling objective. New evidence from declassified documents makes this more evident, not less.            "
"102","The confusion over U.S. leaders’ priorities also obscures the primary focus of their effort to reinforce U.S. credibility: North Korea. U.S. leaders repeatedly mentioned North Korea in NSC meetings and emphasized their apprehensions about North Korea before, during, and after the crisis. News media reiterated their concerns. Newsweek singled out the “trigger‐happy North Koreans” as the country U.S. leaders hoped to impress with the punitive strikes on Cambodia.81 The New York Times and other news media and pundits did the same.82 In a May 16th article The New York Times reported that “leading Administration officials” said military operations during the Mayaguez crisis were “undertaken in part to alert North Korea and other Communist countries that the United States was ready to meet force with force to protect its interests.” Under the subheading “A Korean Crisis Feared,” the Times noted, “there have been no overt signs that North Korea is preparing to attack South Korea,” but “Administration officials have said for some time that the next major trouble spot in Asia would probably be the Korean Peninsula.”83 Kissinger, the likely source for the article, told the reporter that “he believed the North Koreans, at the least, would have to consider more seriously the American commitment to South Korea than they might have immediately after the fall of South Vietnam to the Communists in April.” In an ABC television interview on 18 May 1975, Schlesinger was specifically asked whether the “salutary” message delivered during the Mayaguez crisis had gotten through to North Korea. The interviewer wanted to know how the United States would react “if the Koreans should start something.” Schlesinger said that the United States would “destroy the heart of enemy power” and that the North Koreans needed to understand “that the United States is bound by a mutual defense treaty to South Korea.”84 Scowcroft said after the crisis, “To the extent that we were looking anywhere specifically, it was primarily probably not Southeast Asia at that time, but at Korea.”85"
"103","Declassified documents and research on North Korea agree that the threat from North Korea was real and of great concern to U.S. leaders. It was known then,86 and is stressed by scholars studying North Korea more recently, that its leader, Kim Il‐Sung, visited China in April “to seek support for an invasion of South Korea but apparently did not receive it.”87 Even after being rebuffed by China, Kim Il‐Sung continued to pursue diplomatic and military efforts to reduce international support for South Korea in hopes of setting the conditions for a successful conflict. Throughout the first half of 1976, North Korea pursued an all‐out diplomatic offensive to build international support for a United Nations resolution to dissolve the UN Command in Korea and force the withdrawal of foreign forces under the UN flag.88"
"104","Recent declassified documents and other new materials reinforce the notion that U.S. leaders were concerned about an aggressive North Korea. In the period leading up to the Mayaguez crisis, Kissinger used David Rockefeller as a secret channel to the North Koreans with the mission of making sure they knew the United States would respond with alacrity to a North Korea attack.89 Kissinger personally delivered the same message to China. Three days before the Mayaguez crisis, he met with Huang Chen, chief of the People's Republic of China Liaison Office in Washington, and other Chinese diplomats. A staff briefing paper for the event noted rumors in the Peking (Beijing) diplomatic corps that the North Korean leader was also planning to visit Moscow and various Eastern European capitals, presumably for the same reason he had gone to Beijing: to seek support for war. Despite a hopeful assessment about China's reaction, the paper encouraged Kissinger to clarify for the Chinese that the U.S. response to a North Korean military provocation would be harsh. Kissinger did so in his discussions with Huang Chen by saying he had read an editorial in the People's Daily asserting that “the United States is in a period of strategic passivity.” Kissinger explained how wrong and dangerous this misperception was, telling the Chinese diplomat, “We have absolutely no intention of remaining passive.” He added, “With respect to Korea, I want to make clear that under no circumstances will we tolerate a military attack on Korea,” and that “a military attack on Korea will involve the certainty of American involvement.”90"
"105","When the Mayaguez crisis broke several days later, Korea came up in the NSC discussions. Rockefeller insisted that “many are watching us, in Korea and elsewhere”; Kissinger argued that “we should seize the island, seize the ship, and hit the mainland,” saying, “I am thinking not of Cambodia, but of Korea and of the Soviet Union and of others”; “The Koreans and others would like to look us over and to see how we react”; and “I think we should do something that will impress the Koreans and the Chinese.” The day after the crisis, Ford confided to the Shah of Iran that the U.S. response was calculated “to show the Koreans and others our resolve.” In a phone conversation with a reporter after the crisis, Kissinger said Ford had acted “decisively; enough so it didn't look like we were blinking,” and then said, “Even China and North Korea,” identifying those countries as participants in the stare‐down.91 William Stearman, the NSC staff member who had argued to Kissinger against more air strikes after the return of the crew, later said he came to understand the reasons for Kissinger's insistence on those strikes:               "
"106","The reason he was doing this had nothing to do with Cambodia. It was aimed at North Korea. At that time, we had a lot of intelligence that North Korea was planning to launch a strike against South Korea because they thought we had been so demoralized by the fall of Indochina that now would be a good time to attack. So Henry was sending a message to Kim Il Sung by continuing the bombing. In retrospect, I think he was right. As a matter of fact, I was quite concerned myself about a possible North Korean attack at that time. Many of us were. There was a lot of intelligence that indicated they were seriously thinking about it.”92"
"107","A longer discussion of U.S. concerns about North Korea will be available in a more detailed forthcoming account of the Mayaguez crisis.93 What should be noted here is that over time, scholarship on the crisis lost sight of the North Korean factor. Perilous Options mentions concern about North Korea in passing, and then devalues the point by portraying the U.S. response as an emotional overreaction.94 A Very Short War and The Mayaguez Incident ignore North Korea. Both Vandenbroucke and Mahoney say that U.S. leaders were trying to teach Cambodia a lesson rather than dissuade North Korea.95 It is impossible to fully appreciate what U.S. leaders thought was at stake and were trying to do without understanding their concern about possible North Korean aggression. Thus, understanding of the Mayaguez crisis has deteriorated as scholars focused on descriptive details while missing a part of the explanation once readily apparent to journalists.            "
"108","In May 1975, a columnist for the Christian Science Monitor noted the public could not know “what really happened” during the Mayaguez crisis because news accounts were “shaped by conflicting and what appear to be self‐serving reports of what happened in those behind‐the‐scenes presidential sessions.” The columnist hoped that “at some point historians may be able to provide a clear chronicle of the President's decision making process.”96 That clear chronicle has emerged over time. What is surprising is that scholars could not translate the copious amount of information about crisis decision‐making into a compelling explanation for U.S. behavior. Instead, scholarship has weakened understanding. Scholars concentrated on description at the expense of explanatory analysis, which makes building cumulative knowledge impossible. This tendency may suggest why foreign policy analysis in general is struggling.            "
"109","International relations theorists explain typical nation‐state behaviors—for example, why there is conflict—but when, where, and how international actors decide to initiate or respond to conflicts requires foreign policy analysis. Foreign policy analysis considers human decision makers the “center of its theoretical enterprise” and evaluates the multiple factors constraining and shaping decisions.97 When enough well‐researched cases or multiple case studies reveal behavior patterns, theory can advance. Yet the track record on generalizable propositions is so poor that expectations of “empirically derived and theoretically sound contingent generalizations” for foreign policy have declined.98 Some even conclude that foreign policy studies “are too reductionist to explain the big patterns we find in world politics or that they are too flimsy or messy to explain anything at all.”99"
"110","The reaction to the second edition of Graham Allison's classic study on the Cuban missile crisis, Essence of Decision, is illustrative. Essence of Decision “focuses principally on explanation,” which “requires singling out the relevant, critical determinants of the occurrence, the junctures at which particular factors produced one state of the world rather than another.” However, Allison never explained the crisis, stating he did “not settle the matter of what happened and why.” Instead he aimed for “a rich source of hypotheses about the causes of various outcomes.”100 Fifty years ago, that was a major step forward.            "
"111","When Allison coauthored a second edition of the book in 2010, he stuck with the original concept, posing alternative plausible explanations for a single case without reaching any conclusions.101 Many consider this too modest after half a century of analysis and reams of new data on what decision makers thought, said, and did during the crisis. One reviewer argues, “Even historians, who make far fewer claims to objectivity and to the use of a scientific method,” “do better than Essence of Decision.” “Any historian worth his or her salt produces an integrated account, sure at least of what he or she thinks.” The reviewer thought all Allison's material on “social‐science methodology, and the philosophy of science” just obscured the simple insight that an event can be examined from different perspectives. Describing an event from multiple perspectives may be enriching, but only if it eventually helps social scientists winnow out the best explanation.102 Otherwise, as the reviewer argues, multiple explanatory perspectives are just “a way of preventing us from understanding the missile crisis.”103 The same is true of the Mayaguez crisis.            "
"112","Repeatedly generating multiple explanations for the same phenomenon ensures the quest for generalized knowledge remains stuck in neutral. Essence of Decision was heuristic rather than explanatory, but Allison's work was intended to improve explanation and argued that comparing and contrasting different explanatory models could help.104 Too many foreign policy analysts emulate the rich description in Essence of Decision while ignoring Allison's recommendations for rigorous explanation.            "
"113","Put differently, the field needs more “disciplined‐configurative” rather than “configurative‐ideographic” (or “idiosyncratic”) case studies.105 Disciplined‐configurative case studies identify the class of event being explained (in the case of the Mayaguez, a foreign policy crisis), identify explanatory variables, and investigate and compare the explanatory weight of the different variables postulated. Therefore, they are theoretically informed and contribute to theory building. Configurative‐ideographic cases, often preferred by historians, allow “facts to speak for themselves or bring out their significance by largely intuitive interpretation, claiming validity on the ground that intensive study and empathetic feel for cases provide authoritative insights into them.”106 Configurative‐idiographic case studies can provide helpful descriptions “but by themselves” “do not cumulate or contribute directly to theory.”107"
"114","Political scientists regarding the field of foreign policy analysis as a whole have recommended more studies structured to compare and contrast alternative explanatory models as Allison did in Essence of Decision—but ones that actually arrive at an explanation.108 Scholarship on the Mayaguez crisis exposes the limitations of configurative‐ideographic case studies and substantiates the calls for more disciplined‐configurative research.109 If the scholars researching the Mayaguez crisis had used a “disciplined‐configurative” case study approach, at least they would have been obliged to consciously make an argument for the weight of the diverse explanatory variables they cited.            "
"115","The well‐documented Mayaguez crisis provides political scientists with an exceptional opportunity for comparing the efficacy of alternative decision‐making explanations. As more information became available, there should have been a corresponding coalescence of scholarly consensus around a compelling explanation. This expectation simply reflects the normal understanding of how we build social science knowledge: by carefully examining the growing evidence for alternative hypotheses and gravitating toward the explanation best supported by the evidence. But this did not happen.         "
"116","Instead, as more information became available, the explanations for U.S. behavior became more diffuse and idiosyncratic. Even though growing evidence supported the contention that the primary and sufficient independent variable explaining U.S. behavior was senior leader geostrategic concerns,110 researchers offered multivariate explanations without identifying the relative explanatory efficacy of the different variables they introduced. In doing so, they also lost sight of the primary role North Korea played in decision makers’ geostrategic calculations. The explanation offered here differs from all previous university press books on the Mayaguez by arguing the decision makers were singularly focused on reinforcing U.S. credibility and, in particular, deterring North Korea.         "
"117","A compelling explanation of U.S. behavior in the Mayaguez crisis is important for the growth of cumulative knowledge in the field. Every case that is not correctly categorized and explained makes it more difficult to hypothesize, test, and generalize about behaviors. Sometimes multiple variables carry explanatory weight, and yet it is not possible to determine when and where they mattered. That is not true of the Mayaguez crisis. The evidence has long favored a singular explanation for U.S. behavior that reveals when secondary but reinforcing concerns (such as preventing a Pueblo‐like humiliation) mattered and why plausible but ultimately false hypotheses with little to no explanatory weight do not (such as a desire to further Ford's political fortunes).         "
"118","To the extent that the trend in Mayaguez scholarship is indicative of foreign policy analysis in general, it is not surprising the field is making slow progress toward building theory. The record of scholarship on the Mayaguez crisis also suggests why those examining the field as a whole call for more theoretically informed case studies and for better understanding of the discrete building blocks of foreign policy analysis before attempting to formulate generalizations that explain foreign policy behavior as a whole.111*"
"119","The congressional leaders were unenthusiastic, especially about attacks on the mainland. Senator Mike Mansfield wanted to know, “why are we again going into the mainland of Asia, especially at a time when we almost have the boat in our custody once again?” Even the usually stalwart Senator John McClellan expressed his uneasiness about the attack on the mainland. Speaker Thomas P. “Tip” O'Neill implied that the boat was a “Pentagon charter,” as if this changed the reality of its having been hijacked in international waters; he continued low‐key grumbling even after Schlesinger assured him that his suspicion was unfounded.
