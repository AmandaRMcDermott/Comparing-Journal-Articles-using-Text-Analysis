"1","Marc Trachtenberg delivers an immensely rewarding and intellectually coherent collection of essays on international politics. Yes, they all were published previously (though one appears here for the first time in English), and were surely never intended to be brought together as a book. Yes, there is some overlap both among the essays and between them and some of Trachtenberg's other works, notably A Constructed Peace (1999). And, yes, on the surface the topics covered might seem heterogeneous enough to resist efforts at post‐hoc synthesis: two essays on international relations theory, five substantive papers on U.S. foreign policy in various episodes of the Cold War from 1945 to the 1970s, and two policy pieces on preventive war and the 2003 Iraq crisis. But Princeton University Press was right to bring this collection out as a book.         "
"2","Trachtenberg advances—and provides substantial though hardly conclusive evidence for—three major claims. First, if domestic politics and ideology do not get in the way, governments face strong incentives to respond to the international system's constraints and inducements with a cold‐blooded, calculating, heartless, but nonetheless pretty prudent Realpolitik. Left to themselves to calculate the optimal response to an anarchic setting in which any other major state can unleash war at any moment, statesmen are apt to fashion fairly moderate strategies that maximize the prospect of peaceful coexistence. It follows that for Trachtenberg, the most‐important parts of the explanation for war lie within states rather than in the condition of anarchy itself. Second, the United States in the Cold War is a case in point. The best example here is 1945, when Washington was ready to sell out its democratic principles as well as the Eastern Europeans in a classic spheres‐of‐influence deal with Joseph Stalin, who seemed ready to accept. By recognizing rather than denying power realities, such a deal would have avoided most of what we now know of as the Cold War. Nothing inherent in the international system of 1945 doomed the deal. Third, the first two points are consistent with a particular theory of international politics—a kind of realism that has been lost over recent decades. In the first two chapters, Trachtenberg develops this theory of prudential statecraft and shows how modern realists lost track of it, resolving the contradiction between many American realists' preference for restrained policies and their theories' predictions of optimal state behavior. Noteworthy, but in need of further development, is Trachtenberg's argument that a balance‐of‐power mechanism is not a necessary part of a realist logic of restraint.         "
"3","There is lot more here, not all of which is perfectly consistent with Trachtenberg's theory, but all of which rewards reading. Trachtenberg manages to make the diplomacy of the 1970s exciting, raising new and fascinating puzzles about it. He delves deeply into the making of foreign policy, conveying as few others can the “feel” of the strategic challenges of the Cold War. He reveals some of the nastier aspects of U.S. policy in these years: its ruthless exploitation of power, ramrodding of preferred policies down allies' throats, its deception, its unwillingness to bind its power to the restraints of law. But he also details remarkably able statecraft, and decision makers acting with skill and persistence. And the core chapters show the empirical method for which Trachtenberg is justly so well known. He shows you how he reads the documents, how he draws inferences, and how he relates them to larger propositions about the logic of inter‐state politics. It is as transparent a method as any scientist could wish, and you do not need advanced statistics to replicate his analysis—just three or four languages, a lot of time, and a prodigious appetite for hard work."
