"1","TO MOST AMERICANS, the title of Richard Haass's sprawling new book will seem to capture how they feel about the world—chaotic, in crisis, and radically changed. Public opinion polls reveal that many, if not most, Americans would add: and not worth the trouble. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, believes they are wrong. In this thoughtful, detailed, necessarily somewhat frenetic review of the global and regional issues and challenges confronting the world, and specifically the United States, in the second decade of the twenty‐first century, Haass makes the case for U.S. leadership in constructing what he calls “World Order 2.0”—a set of principles, norms, and policy priorities around which he believes the world can, and must, come together. His vision of world order is appealing, and his defense of U.S. global leadership seems especially urgent and apropos, given the inclinations of the Oval Office's current occupant. But Haass's vision is driven by nostalgia for a world that never existed. And it warrants caution: world‐shaping ambitions have proved extremely costly—for the shapers, and especially for the shaped."
"2","The central premise of A World in Disarray is that the fundamental tenets of global politics are up for grabs today.1 From the mid‐seventeenth century through the end of the Cold War, the basic rules of the global game were well established and well understood. They centered around the institution of sovereignty and the norm of noninterference. Drawing on the great British international relations theorist Hedley Bull, Haass contends that international politics over these centuries was not merely a system but a society.2 Despite its anarchical nature—the absence of a common government, capable of enforcing commitments—the system's great powers had worked out a consensus on the basic norms that would structure their competition. It was therefore a relatively orderly society, albeit one that sometimes required much bloodshed to beat back challengers. International order is not something automatic or mechanical, Haass maintains.3 It must be actively nurtured, sustained, and even tinkered with, if it is to survive (Chapter 1). For the most part, Haass argues, these principles informed superpower relations throughout the Cold War, and nuclear weapons served to bolster that order (Chapter 2).         "
"3","Alongside this Westphalian order, a more deeply institutionalized and liberal international (if not always fully global) order emerged after the Second World War. Its interlocking economic (Bretton Woods), diplomatic (United Nations), strategic (various arms conventions), political (human rights), and legal pillars sought to tame the forces that had brought on two ruinous world wars in the first half of the century and to construct a world of peace and prosperity. Measured against the liberal order's grand ambitions, Haass rightly sees its record as mixed (Chapter 3)—although its defenders adopt a very different baseline.4"
"4","In A World in Disarray, Haass advances a narrative of historical rupture: with the end of the Cold War, everything began to change. Part II of the book is devoted to an assessment of global politics since the Soviet Union fell. Haass's central thesis is that international society—that is, consensus on the basic rules of the game—has withered. Major power relations have been relatively and surprisingly good, and the bulwarks against great power war remain firmly in place (Chapter 4). However, the great powers have lacked “anything approximating a shared definition of legitimacy as applied to determining how best to deal with either global or regional challenges” (101). Since the Cold War, there has been at best fleeting consensus on how to respond to a plethora of transnational challenges: civil war, humanitarian tragedy, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, climate change, cyberattacks, global public health, lingering impediments to free trade. The “international community” remains more aspiration than reality (Chapter 5). Departing somewhat from this core theme, Haass usefully surveys developments across the world's regions (Chapter 6), offering a variety of keen observations along with some arguably unfair hindsight criticism (notably, of the Barack Obama administration's reluctance to intervene in Syria). But he returns to his central argument in assessing the limits of the United Nations, which, he argues, cannot dispense legitimacy when its own legitimacy, grounded in an outdated distribution of power, is in doubt (Chapter 7).         "
"5","Why has agreement on a new set of global rules of the game proved so elusive since the Cold War ended? Haass points, briefly, to two factors. The first is a constant: “different governments see things differently” (200). Haass proceeds to note, correctly, that governments are reluctant to sacrifice national interests for the common good. But he hints at an important insight about the persistence of human difference: people and governments can harbor fundamentally different understandings not only of what their own interests are but also of what interests they share, of what the common good is. This appreciation of enduring human difference is at odds with the liberal worldview, which assumes a decontextualized—dehistoricized, decommunalized, ungrounded—individual. From that starting point, the liberal tradition thus emphasizes the universal nature of human interests and the prospects for consensus, and it deemphasizes the sometimes unavoidable conflicts among contending visions and necessary trade‐offs between competing values. The second is a more recent development: the diffusion of power in international politics and the shrinking of the gap between major and secondary powers. The world, Haass suggests (and earlier argued at length), is marked by “nonpolarity” (pp. 201–202).5"
"6","Part III sets out—as all such books seem to feel obligated to—a solution to the problem the author has diagnosed. Alluding to the conventional reading of Thucydides, that the Peloponnesian War was inevitable because of the rise of Athens, Haass offers guidance to U.S. foreign policymakers in an effort to “thwart Thucydides” (Chapter 9). Haass recognizes that policy with respect to China and Russia—to deter aggression without provoking costly and debilitating confrontation—is a tricky balancing act. So, in addition to textbook deterrence, signaling credibly and clearly the lines that cannot be crossed, he advises an intensified version of “engagement” (which he calls “integration”): seeking to give these nations a seat at the table and thereby transform them into “responsible stakeholders” of international society. However, this is, more or less, what U.S. administrations have been doing for the last 25 years, with modest impact. Haass suggests some tinkering at the margins, but the central thrust of the proposed policy is the same. When it comes to human rights, Haass notes that “the United States can . . . criticize [China and Russia] when they violate human rights on any scale, but it has neither the influence with them nor the luxury of placing such concerns at the center of the relationship” (p. 222). True, but when has the United States actually placed such concerns at the center of the relationship? Never. These nations have bristled merely at their write‐ups in the State Department's annual human rights report. In short, A World in Disarray advances no silver bullet for the problem of shifting power, and Haass wisely notes that the United States has limited influence over “the internal trajectories of both countries and how their leaders choose to deal with their respective challenges” (p. 223).         "
"7","Nevertheless, Haass devotes a long chapter to fleshing out his ambitious program to define new global rules of the game (Chapter 10). Traditional sovereignty and absolute noninterference, he contends, is unsustainable in a world marked by intensified flows of all kinds. He thus calls for a reworking of sovereignty attentive to global interconnectedness. The central concept is “sovereign obligation”: what sovereign states owe each other. For Haass, this is not an idealistic dream but rather what realism demands in an age of globalization. The key elements of his proposed “World Order 2.0” include the nonacquisition of territory by force, noninterference within sovereign territories (with exceptions for genocide and some large‐scale human rights violations), case‐by‐case support for self‐determination, the unacceptability of terrorism, the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (but no military intervention to roll back proliferation), cost sharing of states’ efforts to combat and adapt to climate change, a global arrangement on cyber activities, coordination to support and sustain global public health, and so on (pp. 234–252). Haass knows none of this will be easy, that it will take decades of diplomatic heavy lifting, and that standards of legitimacy cannot be compelled but rather rest on consent. But he believes agreement on the principle of “sovereign responsibility” can at least fix the terms of debate and lay the foundation for progress. Haass then sets this thesis aside, as he offers guidance for U.S. foreign policy in the world's different regions (Chapter 11). A World in Disarray concludes with recommendations for how the United States can put its domestic house in order so that it has the resources and will needed to create and maintain World Order 2.0 (Chapter 12).         "
"8","Haass is a well‐informed, serious participant in and observer of international affairs, and A World in Disarray reflects those virtues. If you are looking for a crash course in post–Cold War U.S. foreign policy, look no further. You could do far worse than an instructor with the smarts and passion of Richard Haass. If you want a trip through the mind of the Republican foreign policy establishment, circa 2016 BDT (Before Donald Trump), you could not have a better tour guide than Haass, who is one of that establishment's leading voices.         "
"9","However, A World in Disarray also reflects the problematic assumptions of establishment thinking. Its tone of anxious urgency is rooted in a misleading historical narrative that contrasts a coherent, well‐ordered past, marked by interstate competition within well‐marked limits, with a chaotic, disorderly present, in which the rules of the game are themselves in dispute. Yet Haass's portrait of international affairs before the 1990s is romanticized, even nostalgic, and the present compares at least a bit more favorably when put up against a less idealized, more accurate historical reference point. Well before the Cold War came to an end, states honored the principle of noninterference in the breach, intervening to protect ethnic brethren, to reshape local economies, and to upend hostile governments. Certainly subordinate states in hierarchically organized regional systems—say, Latin America—saw little evidence that noninterference was the norm. Even powerful states at times became the target of intervention based solely on their internal organization and policies: the Bolsheviks were too busy in the early years trying to set up communism at home to spread the revolution abroad, but Western states nevertheless saw the Bolsheviks as an ideological threat and embraced anticommunist forces.         "
"10","There was, moreover, little agreement beyond the thin semiconsensus on sovereignty. If the post–Cold War United Nations has suffered from a legitimacy crisis because it has not kept up with the distribution of global power or because its institutions depart from democratic principles, the Cold War United Nations suffered from a legitimacy crisis because it became paralyzed by superpower competition and deserved its reputation as little more than a talk shop—at least in the arena of international security. The institutions of the liberal order, meanwhile, hardly commanded universal assent or legitimacy: they largely excluded the Soviet Union and its allies, and the “Third World” saw them as instruments of Western imperialism and control. What counted as a “human right” remained deeply contested, and the “Washington consensus” of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund was not shared in the developing world capitals that these institutions bent to their will. Very little was truly settled before 1991. Few policies or institutions enjoyed broad‐based, global legitimacy. States of course asserted the legitimacy of their actions, but that was a deeply political act: they were trying to create legitimacy, to forge a consensus around their favored norms."
"11","International cooperation, Haass argues with justification, is often more aspirational than actual. In many important arenas, critical transnational challenges, from climate change to the governance of cyberspace, go unsolved, because of both international distrust and hard conflicts of interest. But that is hardly a new problem, reflecting some unusual level of dissensus in global politics. After all, the central questions of international relations theory have been why war erupts and why international cooperation is so elusive, even when the costs of failure are high. Theorists have therefore devoted substantial attention to explaining the strategies and structural conditions that impede or conduce to cooperation. Holes in the fabric of interstate cooperation are, and have long been, awfully common."
"12","At the same time, and contrary to Haass's narrative, the notion of “global governance” has never seemed more apropos. In many ways, amid the perceived chaos, there is today more normative consensus than ever before in the global arena. After 11 September 2001, the international community endorsed a common definition of terrorism, which had eluded it for decades. Few today defend an absolute conception of sovereignty: the Responsibility to Protect has become widely accepted as a principle, even if its doctrinal details are lacking and if the Libyan intervention did it some damage. Legal institutions and discourses increasingly dominate our world, and there are more international courts, tribunals, and arbitration bodies than ever. International regulatory regimes and agencies govern vast arenas of modern life, without too much challenge but also without democratic input."
"13","The bipartisan U.S. foreign policy establishment is essentially liberal, and so are the key premises underlying A World in Disarray. Haass claims to be a realist, and his realist predilections are reflected in his attention to structures and dynamics of power, his keen awareness of the limits of American influence, and his skepticism of international institutions. But Haass's deeper assumptions and inclinations are often more aligned with liberalism. Like a good liberal, Haass mourns the alleged demise of global order because he presumes that such an order is necessarily a common good—in the interests of all. But no order is politically neutral. Any set of normative and institutional arrangements generates losers as well as winners. Any particular rules of the global game are in alignment with a certain vision of international political life and at odds with others. Like a good liberal, Haass conceives of an enlightened American national interest in expansive terms and as being in no serious tension with the global good. What's good for the world is good for America—and presumably vice versa. Like a good liberal, Haass seems to dream of a global arena that is eventually stripped of fundamental political contest. In a world of “sovereign responsibility,” everyone understands their obligations, accepts them, and reaches agreements in accord with them. In line with the liberal tradition's impulses, World Order 2.0 aspires to consensus, imagines that reason trumps power, and seems to envision, in the end, a world governed by technocrats enforcing rules. But the history of global politics is one of the continual clash of contending interests, backed by power.         "
"14","In A World in Disarray, Richard Haass seeks to inspire future generations of U.S. decision makers to strive for World Order 2.0. But legitimate world order has been rare, if not nonexistent, in international politics. That may come as bad news for the aspiring order maker. But it is good news for everyone else.         "
