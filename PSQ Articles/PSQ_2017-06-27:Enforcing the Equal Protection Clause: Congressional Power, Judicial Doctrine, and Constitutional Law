"1","William D. Araiza offers a timely doctrinal analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment's enforcement clause. He opens the analysis with a convincing argument about why this clause deserves a closer look. As he notes, this provision presents something of a puzzle, a grant of legislative authority among rights that generally empower courts. Moreover, understanding this power is particularly urgent given narrow judicial interpretations of the commerce clause and federalism that limit congressional authority—limits that are likely to be maintained and perhaps extended now that President Donald Trump has appointed Justice Antonin Scalia's successor."
"2","In addressing this puzzle, Araiza does not call for wholesale changes to Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence but rather shifts in its application to make it more coherent, predictable, and legitimate. While no brief review can do justice to an argument that is developed over 10 chapters, the gist is relatively straightforward. Araiza argues that the core of the Fourteenth Amendment requires laws to be rational and not motivated by animus toward particular groups. Over time, it has also placed sharp limits on racial classifications and laws that impinge on fundamental rights. Araiza contends that Congress is typically better suited to enforce these principles than courts because of its “comparative competence and expertise” (p. 11) and the fact that “Congress, with its continual electoral renewal and broad national foundation, is the most legitimate voice of Americans’ moral sensibilities” (p. 12). In this view, the courts have a role to play, but it is largely a deferential one."
"3","Araiza's argument is persuasive provided that one accepts his assumptions about Congress's relative competence and legitimacy. However, these “pillars” of the analysis (pp. 11–13) are controversial. Scholarship, including some of the work cited by the author, such as Malcolm M. Feeley and Edward L. Rubin's Judicial Policy Making and the Modern State, doubts that institutional competence is a blanket concept. With respect to rationality, for instance, the Fourteenth Amendment requires assessing whether lines drawn in statutes are reasonable. Why would members of Congress, who are elected from states and narrow districts and subject to intense lobbying, necessarily be better at this than federal judges, who are appointed for life and trained to apply statutes? With respect to animus, it is extremely difficult for anyone to ascertain a law's motivations because Congress is a “they” and not an “it.” Accordingly, laws can reflect a variety of purposes and motivations. It is unclear why members of Congress are typically better at this problematic task than judges, especially when divining legislative intent is a staple of judicial decision making.         "
"4","Scholars also question whether Congress enjoys heightened legitimacy because of its electoral status. While elections clearly matter in any democracy, they do not guarantee Congress will represent “the people” given many common features of today's elections, including low voter turnout, gerrymandering, and unregulated campaign financing. Even if individual members of Congress were perfectly representative of their constituents, no assurance exists that they will be able to act given the American legislative process's many veto points. By the same token, federal judges are not heedless of public opinion simply because they are appointed for life."
"5","The point is not that the analysis is wrong. To the contrary, it is powerful and clearly stated. It is only that a careful examination of its analytic pillars might have strengthened an already strong argument. The bottom line, however, is the same: Araiza's thoughtful analysis should be read by anyone who is interested in constitutional law and, indeed, American politics."
