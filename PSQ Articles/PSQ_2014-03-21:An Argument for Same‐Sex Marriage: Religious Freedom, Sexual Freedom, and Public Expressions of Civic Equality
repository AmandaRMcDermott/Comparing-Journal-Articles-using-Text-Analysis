"1","This timely book, as its straightforward title announces, provides an argument for same‐sex marriage based on the author's reading of the contemporary legal and social landscape, with a particular eye to understanding the prohibition of same‐sex marriage as a public expression of civic inequality. As the preface lays out, Emily R. Gill began thinking about same‐sex marriage within the context of United States Supreme Court decisions in the wake of the endorsement test that Sandra Day O'Connor proposed in Lynch v. Donnelly. If the government ought not classify some citizens as outsiders because of a policy that seems to endorse certain religious beliefs over others, why should the government play the role of creating insiders (those who can) and outsiders (those who cannot) when it comes to marriage? For Gill, the answer is simple: it should not. Throughout this book, Gill stresses the similarity between religion and sexuality.         "
"2","While the pairing of religious freedom and the freedom to marry might sit uneasily for some readers, in Gill's adept hands the analogy is successful. The concept of neutrality and the government's role in maintaining it is at the core of Gill's argument. In her hands, the seemingly straightforward notion of neutrality is a complicated and nuanced one, so much so that the book's second chapter is devoted to “The impossibility of neutrality.” This key chapter lays out the premise that advocates for same‐sex marriage and, more broadly, for sexual minorities in general, should use the comparison between religion and sexuality to argue for the acceptance of a variation of sexual orientation based on the precedence of the acceptance of a variation of religious belief."
"3","One of the great strengths of this book is the clarity and sensitivity with which Gill treats a wide range of views on this subject. She identifies four positions on same‐sex marriage (traditional opponents of same‐sex marriage; traditionalist proponents of same‐sex marriage; skeptics about marriage; and liberal rights advocates of same‐sex marriage) and sketches out the core arguments within each category. Ultimately, she aligns her own thinking with the final category. In so doing, Gill prioritizes the value of autonomy as “the correct grounding for the rights of consenting adults to intimate lives of their own choosing” (p. 98). From the autonomy argument flows her contention that freely chosen emotional and sexual relationships are deserving of respect, that citizens in a liberal democratic polity have the right to decide what intimate relationships they wish to participate in, and that laws that abridge autonomy also serve to stigmatize and stereotype individuals in the targeted group."
"4","With all the space devoted to various philosophies concerning equality, neutrality, the establishment clause, and same‐sex marriage, Gill stakes out her own position with authority. When she analogizes the free exercise of religion to the ability of same‐sex couples to marry (which she does throughout the book but especially in chapter 5), she directly addresses and refutes possible objections to her employment of the analogy. While she surely will not please those who maintain a religious objection to same‐sex marriage, her careful attempt to acknowledge and engage with potential critics is effective indeed."
"5","This book has a broad potential audience, due to its subject matter and the wide range of subtopics that Gill touches on under the rubric of advocating for same‐sex marriage. For political philosophers, her reliance on John Stuart Mill's On Liberty will prove rewarding. For those more concerned with the contemporary cultural climate, her concluding chapter highlighting the culture wars will be particularly apt. Gill's close readings of Supreme Court decisions such as Thomas v. Review Board and Romer v. Evans will intrigue legal scholars. And for the general reader energized by the recent rulings in Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor, Gill offers a clear, succinct, and reasoned argument in support of same‐sex marriage.         "
