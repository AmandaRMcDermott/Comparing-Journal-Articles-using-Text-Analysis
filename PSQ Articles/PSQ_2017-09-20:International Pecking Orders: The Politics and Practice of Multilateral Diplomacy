"1","In the international system, every sovereign state is formally equal, but when it comes to exercising influence in international organizations, some appear to be more equal than others. How does such hierarchy persist under conditions of formal equality? Rejecting traditional materialist explanations that reduce interstate hierarchy to the military and economic capacity of different states, the author offers an alternative account grounded in intense fieldwork and a detailed engagement with the everyday social practices of diplomats at NATO and the United Nations (UN). Pouliot argues that the “pecking order” among diplomats who serve in the permanent country missions at these multilateral organizations emerges from the efforts of those diplomats to “turn the country's externally defined attributes into diplomatic capital” (p. 84). The practice of diplomacy is thus conditionally autonomous from the distribution of material capabilities, and state wealth and power alone do not suffice as an explanation for negotiated international outcomes."
"2","Drawing on the practice theory of Pierre Bourdieu, Pouliot reconstructs the “field”—the structured arrangement of positions, norms, rules, and procedures—that defines what it means to be a competent diplomat in each of these multilateral settings. As diplomats “struggle for practical mastery” (p. 58) of the locally specific game of representing their state most effectively, they reproduce the standards that they are trying to live up to—standards by which status is unequally distributed according to a complex combination of factors ranging from the size of a country's permanent mission to the specific role that a country strives to play on the world stage."
"3","The pecking order in a specific site at a specific time is also highly contingent on specific organizational practices, such as the culture of consensus at NATO and the struggle for votes at the United Nations. As such, the pecking order in each site is an emergent social product specific to that site, as diplomats work to gain and exert influence over one another. Deploying an impressive array of tools ranging from qualitative interviews to the quantitative technique of “multiple correspondence analysis,” Pouliot traces the ways that status is acquired and preserved by diplomats at NATO and the UN in the course of their practical, professional activities.         "
"4","Overall, the book is a fascinating “journey to the engine room” (p. 272) of international affairs. And what a strange engine it is: Pouliot shows that the everyday substance of multilateral diplomacy actually consists of and, importantly, is organized—structured—by status hierarchies that are endogenous to the game of multilateral diplomacy itself. Pouliot refers to this as a “relational mode of explanation” (p. 210) and hastens to point out that this is not the kind of “explanation” that we are used to seeing in neopositivist social science: he is not looking to isolate the causal impact of one factor on another (say, “size of a country's delegation” on “diplomatic standing of a country”) but to describe, in quite precise ways, how these factors and others are related to one another in the field of diplomatic practice.         "
"5","It is the locally specific field as a whole that exerts a causal impact on outcomes, impact that Pouliot illustrates with chapters on the 2010 NATO Strategic Concept negotiations and the movement for Security Council reform at the UN. But even here, the kind of causality is distinct from what we would find in a regression equation or a standard set of comparative case studies because there can be no general law connecting fields and outcomes. Instead, and appropriately, Pouliot offers us situationally specific configurational accounts of how diplomatic games centered on status and influence are imbricated in organizational outcomes that are not reducible to the material capabilities of the states involved. The practical politics of everyday diplomatic life are thus placed front and center, a welcome theoretical move that brings international studies out of an abstract statistical stratosphere and back down to earth.
