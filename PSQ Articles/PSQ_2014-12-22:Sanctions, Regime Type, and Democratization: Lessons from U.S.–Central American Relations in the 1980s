"1","SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR, sanctions have become a popular tool for states (the United States, in particular) to press authoritarian regimes to democratize and to respect human rights. Between 1990 and 2007, half of all new international sanction episodes were for these ends. For the United States, the figure is even higher, with 80 percent of U.S. sanction cases in this period including demands for reform toward a more‐democratic form of government.1 Sanctions are, in short, a major tool in both international and U.S. efforts to advance liberal political order abroad in contemporary international politics.         "
"2","Despite the popularity of sanctions, we still know very little about how and when they work toward these particular ends. The conventional wisdom tells us that sanctions destabilize authoritarian regimes (and presumably advance democracy and human rights) most effectively when targeted against powerful sectors or elites in certain kinds of authoritarian regime types.2 More specifically, personalist dictatorships are most prone to capitulate and move toward more liberal ends, while military regimes adjust to sanctions in ways that make them more immune to sanction pressure.3 While the turn here to regime type is important, these arguments miss the mark in ways that carry important implications for efforts to advance democracy and human rights. Some find, for instance, that elite loyalty to a personalist dictator is a far more likely outcome than elite defection, even when patronage/sectoral benefits dry up.4  Sanction cases reflect this. During the Cold War, for instance, U.S. sanctions imposed massive costs on the personalist Duvalier, Trujillo, Somoza, and Batista regimes. All the same, elites remained loyal, especially in the Nicaraguan and Cuban cases, where the military fought to the end for the dictator. Military regimes often prove equally puzzling, given the conventional wisdom. While these regimes indeed resist sanction pressure at times, many capitulate to sender demands and liberalize in order to gain or regain access to sanctioned goods or aid. This was the case again during the Cold War, with U.S. sanctions against countries like Bolivia and Guatemala.         "
"3","My claim is not that the conventional wisdom is entirely wrong: sanctions might indeed destabilize military regimes less often than other authoritarian states. But, how do we explain the elite unity in personalist regimes that allows dictators to sometimes defy targeted sanctions, or the divisions in military regimes that sometimes make sanctions effective in advancing democracy and human rights? This question is more than academic. It holds important implications for policy. Successor regimes to personalist dictatorships, for instance, tend to be more ideologically radical and/or non‐democratic in their own right, largely because of the fight‐to‐the‐end tendencies of personalist states.5 Understanding the elite loyalty, then, that prevents even heavily‐sanctioned personalist dictatorships from collapsing before opposition elements radicalize is critical for understanding the best strategies for long‐term promotion of human rights and democracy.         "
"4","To explain the impact of sanctions on the emergence of liberal order, this article offers a different conceptualization of regime type from the conventional wisdom.6 Hence, regime type is my key explanatory variable; it proves a necessary and sufficient condition that determines sanction effectiveness. But, instead of the narrow sectoral/patronage dynamics of the conventional wisdom, this article focuses on the collective forces or characteristics—such as the unifying ideologies, institutional structures, or competing views of the national interest—that shape and bind elite interactions across different types of regimes. These collective forces tend to make some authoritarian regimes more susceptible than others to sanction pressure for liberal ends. More specifically, costly targeted sanctions in times of crisis tend to splinter elites in more‐factionalist regimes, like military governments. When this happens, capitulation to sanctions that demand liberal change becomes more likely. For more‐cohesive regimes, like personalist dictatorships, the story is different. Facing costly sanctions, regime dynamics tend to mute factional (including sectoral/patronage) differences in personalist states. As a result, personalist dictatorships tend to defy sanction demands for liberal change, often choosing to fight to the end rather than reform.         "
"5","This article assesses the argument in cases of U.S.‐led sanctions on military and economic aid against three Central American states—Nicaragua (personalist), El Salvador (military) and Guatemala (military)—in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These kinds of sanctions targeted both an important (perhaps the most important) sector of authoritarian elites—the military—and the state, a collective entity with a collective set of institutional arrangements and goals. I look at these three target states not only for their comparability (see below), but because if we see predicted regime type effects here in small, weak countries, we can expect the same, if not more, from stronger and more independent targets.         "
"6","In the following, I discuss the current sanctions literature, detail my argument on regimes, and explore the case studies along with plausibility probes into several other Latin American cases. The article concludes with suggestions for additional research and policy implications. On the latter, the findings here indicate that effectively advancing human rights and democracy may require different strategies based upon target regime type. These suggestions are vital to a number of current day and recent efforts to advance liberal change in places as varied as Syria, Libya, Burma, and Turkmenistan."
"7","I define sanctions as a state(s), or sender, reducing, terminating, or threatening to terminate/reduce the flow of economic or military grants, loans, and/or military sales to a country, or target, for the expressed goal of altering target behavior.7 For the sake of this article, I define sanction success as target capitulation to a “significant part” (generally, total or near total) of sender demands resulting to a sizeable degree from sanction pressure.8 For cases in this article, these demands focus (with some variation, as explored below) on changes to domestic political order and practices in a more liberal direction (i.e. human rights improvements, elections, and constitutional order).9 My claim is not that sanctions alone cause targets to alter political order and practice – domestic factors always affect these changes. While recognizing this, this article seeks to better understand how the sanctions part of the equation matters here – an under‐analyzed topic in the democratization literature. Finally, we know that sanctions (including those for democracy and human rights goals) do not succeed that often.10 Yet, we also know they sometimes do work. Hence, in line with others, my focus is on how and when, not if or how often, sanctions matter.11 In this vein, how do we explain the outcomes of U.S. sanctions against Nicaragua (no capitulation); El Salvador (capitulation) and Guatemala (capitulation) in the 1970s and 1980s?         "
"8","Scholars offer several alternatives that differ from the collective regime type account I develop to answer this question. One batch of explanations focuses on military aid, inter‐allied relations, and binary (democracy vs. non‐democracy) regime types. Robert Pape argues that while purely economic sanctions generally do not work, military sanctions often do against strategically desperate targets.12 Scholarship on allies is similarly optimistic: allies are more likely to concede when sanctioned by another ally, as opposed to an enemy.13 Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua were U.S. Cold War allies, making this a strong alternative. Finally, a large literature on regime type claims sanctions succeed against democratic states, but fail against non‐democracies.14"
"9","Each of these arguments faces a common problem: namely, they offer leverage over some, but not all cases in this study. On Pape's military sanctions argument, for instance, El Salvador responded as expected, but Somoza's decision to fight on against incredible odds makes little sense. Guatemala capitulated, furthermore, to purely economic sanctions—the kind that Pape says do not work. The argument about allies faces similar problems. Guatemala and El Salvador behaved as expected. But, again, Nicaragua makes little sense. Of the three, Somoza's regime had the longest and closest alliance with Washington—it was the most likely to fold according to the ally argument, but did not. Finally, binary regime type explanations cannot explain why democracy came to El Salvador and Guatemala. Authoritarian states may, indeed, capitulate less to sanctions, but this does not help us understand why they still sometimes do so."
"10","Sender resolve offers another possible alternative. Maybe sanctions fail when senders do not completely terminate aid/trade/military privileges, or when the sender does not speak with one voice. Representative Charlie Wilson (D‐TX) and others with budgetary authority pushed Congress and the Carter administration to soften Nicaraguan sanctions in 1978—perhaps, this undercut the impact of sanctions. Overall, this argument also faces problems. Sanctions rarely involve a full termination of goods/privileges, and voices in the sender often appear divided.15 Yet, sanctions still work sometimes. Despite early equivocation, the United States applied, in the end, tighter sanctions against Nicaragua, than either Guatemala or El Salvador. In September 1978, Carter ended all military aid under congressional pressure to Nicaragua, and suspended nearly all economic aid in January 1979 (aid to the poor being the exception).16 Broad congressional and administration resolve from this point forward seemed to eclipse the conflicting signals from Charlie Wilson and others. Yet, Somoza's regime stood firm. Even more puzzling, Guatemala ($20 million annually in economic aid, some pipeline military aid) and El Salvador ($150 million annually in economic aid, $25 million or more annually in military aid after 1981) faced far‐looser sanctions than Nicaragua, yet capitulated.17 Here, it was not just the voices of a few, but the entire U.S. Congress (along with the administration of Ronald Reagan) showing lack of resolve. In sum, the resolve argument offers little leverage over these cases.         "
"11","Finally, scholarship in line with the conventional wisdom discussed at the outset offers an important alternative. Sanctions are effective when they curtail rent payments to ruling elites, or harm important economic sectors (the military being especially critical in authoritarian regimes) within the state apparatus. Some go further here and claim that this rent‐driven pathway of change is most common when personalist, as opposed to military regimes, face sanctions.18 For the cases in this article, then, elite rebellion motivated by a desire to recover lost rents or sectoral advantages should be the leading cause of democracy and human rights reform under sanction pressure, especially in personalist dictatorships. As detailed more in the case studies, there are important shortcomings here, though. Sanctions bankrupted Somoza's personalist regime in Nicaragua to the point that his military was literally left with no military hardware by 1979, yet elites never rebelled as sectoral‐patronage accounts expect.19 By contrast, in Guatemala and El Salvador, the military led the way in capitulating to sanctions, despite the continued flow of sectoral rents to the military in both cases. In fact, elites here actually moved, in part, to end corrupt, rent‐seeking practices, not take advantage of them. Overall, I agree that pain imposed on elites is vital to sanction success. But, we need to know more about regime type in order to get the entire story. I turn to that now.         "
"12","A large literature has emerged in recent decades on the ways that regime type affects and determines different pathways to democratization. I draw from this literature to develop a theory (or, better yet, a partial theory given space limitations) of how regime type shapes sanction effectiveness, especially as it relates to sanctions that demand changes to domestic political order. I explore two types of regimes—personalist and military—that either mute or accentuate factional differences in ways that determine how and when sanctions matter.20 Table 1 captures my expectations by regime type given costly sanctions.         "
"13","Personalist regimes (also called “sultanistic” or “patrimonial”) mute factional differences the most. While history and sources of cohesion vary from one personalist regime to the next, dictators usually retain the loyalty of elites through some combination of coercion, personal favors and material rewards. Elites are frequently rotated or jailed to avoid factionalism. The military is usually a de‐professionalized instrument for the dictator's power, holding no sense of independent institutional identity. Divisions between so‐called hard‐liners and soft‐liners are virtually non‐existent in personalist regimes.21"
"14","Sanctions can carry significant costs here by fueling legitimacy problems for the dictator at home, encouraging opposition forces, and increasing the costs of social control.22 Regardless, personalist regimes virtually never capitulate directly to sender demands, but often turn more brutal and fight to the end, even if it means “the destruction of the nation's economic and political structures.”23 The reason for this turns on factionalism: personalist regimes rarely fracture along sectoral lines under sanctions pressure (or crisis of any sort for that matter). Fear is critical here. Lacking any form of social legitimacy and closely monitored by the dictator, elites hold excessive fears of social retribution and the dictator's wrath in these regime types. Consequently, elites fear that liberal change (or the suggestion of it) will cost them their lives. Hence, they “have little option but to cling to the regime, to sink or swim with it.”24"
"15","Because a dictator's fight to the end often results in his/her loss of power, some observers may consider this type of outcome a success for sanctions. But it is important to remember here what we are trying to understand, – namely, sanctions effects on liberal political order, not regime destabilization. On this point, the consequences of fight‐to‐the‐end tendencies are often devastating. Specifically, when dictators take up arms, democratization scholars find that it often leads to outcomes like political transitions without a government‐opposition pact and/or the radicalization of opposition forces. Neither is good for liberal political goals. In fact, unpacted transitions and/or a radicalized opposition usually produce non‐democratic, human rights–violating successor regimes to personalist dictators.25 This reinforces my central point: the inability of targeted sanctions to generate elite defection in the personalist state is a critical issue. In short, it prevents dictatorial regimes from either negotiating a pact to leave power or collapsing before opposition elements radicalize. In the end, then, if sanctions are the only tool for promoting liberal political order against personalist regimes, a no‐win situation sometimes emerges: do nothing, and dictators could survive; help push dictators out with sanctions, and their successors will probably be no better. Neither may be good for democracy and human rights (see implications section below).         "
"16","Democratization scholars find that elite relations in military regimes are different from personalist governments. Here, a group of officers usually rules through a rotating system of power intended to prevent the type of personalism noted above. Rather than devotion to a single leader, military regimes place great value on the institutional autonomy of the military and protection of the nation's integrity.26 Differences between groups within the military over how to achieve these goals are common, making military regimes inherently more factionalist than personalist regimes. These factions often turn on divisions between hard‐liners and soft‐liners in the regime. At the center of these divisions stand differences about how to structure state–society relations and confront security challenges. In general, hard‐liners tend to advocate long military rule as well as the use of all means necessary, with little regard for human rights and democracy, to maintain order. Soft‐liners, by contrast, generally support shorter military rule and more‐liberal social and political reforms.27"
"17","Because of these factionalist divisions, I anticipate that costly sanctions will have more varied effects on military regimes than they do on personalist states. Namely, the potential for capitulation to sender demands increases here. Costly sanctions tend to delegitimize hardline policies as worries arise about national security and military vitality.28 Soft‐liners step into the political space created by crisis and, in the process, the sanctions become a chit in the political game as soft‐liners present renewed benefits from the sender as a cheaper way to deal with the crisis, preserve the military institution, and return the military to the barracks. Out of a desire to maintain military unity, hard‐liners will often give soft‐liners the space to pursue this course of reforms, especially if the sender loosens or drops sanctions. This allows space for democracy and human rights changes to be adopted and implemented.29"
"18","This article makes no predictions about how long or what types of sanctions work best against military regimes. Hard‐liners do not let go of power easily, and the practices they promote do not always fade quickly, either. Sometimes, military regimes may try to avoid capitulation, at exceedingly high costs. 30 But, I expect, in general, that these costs eventually accentuate factionalist differences, increasing the likelihood of policy changes that accede with sender demands, in our case toward liberal political reform.         "
"19","For research that focuses on how and when (rather than how often) sanctions matter, case studies are optimal.31 This article argues that regime type is the necessary and sufficient condition that determines when costly sanctions will generate democratization. The study turns, then, on variation here. On this point and others, Latin America offers a good place for case selection. The region has been populated in the past with a mix of military and personalist regimes. Focusing on Latin America allows me, then, to select cases that vary on the explanatory variable (regime type), while holding region constant. The selection of the Nicaraguan (personalist), Guatemalan (military), and Salvadoran (military) cases allows me to hold other factors constant as well, including sender, type of sanctions, time period, domestic turmoil inside target states, and strength of target economy.32 The cases also have similar deep histories—namely, a long, multi‐decade period of unreformed authoritarian rule prior to sanctions—which is good for comparability. Furthermore, it is important to note that in each case, the United States used sanctions and diplomacy alone. It never issued a direct threat of impending military or covert action, nor prepared or utilized military or covert force against any of the target regimes.33 Finally, the Central American cases hold the advantage of being settled history, meaning that experts have closely investigated the factors at work in each through field work and interviews. This is especially important given the domestic political dynamics of both the regime‐type argument and the alternative explanations. The case studies draw from this extensive expert literature. Overall, the selected cases and plausibility probes offer a baseline to measure the impact, if any, from the combined factors of costly sanctions and regime type.34"
"20","All the same, some may wonder about a special relationship in these cases that biases my findings. Specifically, given the long history of U.S. dominance over and intervention in Latin America, these might be easy cases for my argument, places where U.S. sanction pressure carries weight it otherwise might not. In reality, there appears to be little evidence of this. There were many cases during this period (some of which are assessed here) in which authoritarian regimes in Latin America resisted sanction‐backed demands by the United States for domestic political reform. In fact, leading examples here involved regional states (Nicaragua, Cuba, and Haiti, for instance) that were among the most highly dependent on the United States, and with some of the most‐pronounced histories of U.S. intervention in their domestic politics. This not only seems to undermine the easy‐case argument, it makes the study of cases like these a good place to start for understanding other sanction episodes. If regime type matters in weak, impoverished targets laid bare by crisis and sanctions while facing the extreme degrees of dependence on the United States that these states had as sender, we gain confidence that the same regime‐type effects exist with stronger, more‐independent targets such as Syria, Burma, or Libya. In short, coupled with the above benefits of cross‐comparison, we arguably learn more here (especially for initial assessments of regime‐type theories) than we would by starting with cases involving larger, more‐independent authoritarian states scattered across different regions of the world."
"21","Drawing from definitions in the democratization literature, I label a regime “personalist” if a single dictator or family sets the rules and is essentially the only central political figure(s) in a certain state. Military regimes are states in which the military as an institution dominates politics, and, within this, in which power is either held jointly in a junta or transferred (via coups, elections, or some other means) between members of the military.35 I rely upon coding by democratization scholars and the work of regional experts to determine where the authoritarian states selected for this article fall in terms of regime type. For the three cases and two plausibility probes, the historical record here is, in fact, settled and uncontroversial. Democratization scholars process trace across time to explore factions within regimes. I do the same. Specifically, I process trace at time t‐1, t‐2 and so forth prior to and then during the sanction episode in order to show the presence of factions and their impact, if any, on outcomes.         "
"22","This section turns to an assessment of cases intended to assess the regime‐type argument and alternatives. It also considers potential counter‐arguments and a set of plausibility probes into other cases from Latin America."
"23","Following increased repression in January 1978, Washington demanded that the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle improve human rights, negotiate with the moderate opposition for elections toward a change of government, and depart from Nicaraguan politics. Through all of this, the administration of Jimmy Carter wanted to avoid “another Cuba,” by preventing the leftist Sandinistas from coming to power.36 The United States. backed these demands with sanctions: an initial reduction of military and economic aid (February and September 1978 respectively) and eventually a full suspension of both (September 1978, mid‐January 1979, respectively).37"
"24","In the end, the United States got almost the exact opposite of what it wanted. Bolstered by elite loyalty, Somoza turned to repression to retain power. The country burst into open protest in early 1978. Insurgents seized the National Palace during the summer, and then, made substantial military gains in September. Rather than meet U.S. demands for compromise and moderation, Somoza unleashed the National Guard, leading to the deaths of approximately 5 thousand unarmed civilians in September alone. During October through December, he was intransigent in Organization of American States–sponsored negotiations with the opposition. This allowed the Sandinistas to surge to the fore of the opposition in 1979; more‐moderate or liberal elements were entirely eclipsed. The Sandinistas led a final offensive in May, overwhelmed the Guard, and forced Somoza to flee on 17 July 1979.38 From there, the new Sandinista regime established a human rights–violating, non‐democratic government that proved a strategic thorn in the U.S. side. Democracy in Nicaragua had to wait for another decade.            "
"25","Why did sanctions fail here? Sectoral and patronage accounts offer little leverage. U.S. and international economic sanctions helped send the Nicaraguan economy into a tailspin: massive capital flight, an empty national treasury by September of 1978, and inability to service international debts following U.S.‐led suspension of International Monetary Fund loans in October of 1978. The shadow of the future for patronage rents and the regime appeared bleak; elite defection, not loyalty, made more sense by patronage accounts.39 On the sectoral side, the Sandinista‐led offensive in September of 1978 brought a weapons‐depleted Guard to its knees. “The Staff were very worried because, militarily speaking, they could not maneuver,” Somoza later noted, “Due to the attacks in so many different areas, our troops were simply pinned down.”40 As the military faced even more‐desperate supply problems in 1979 due to Israel ending arms supplies under U.S. pressure, Guard officers did not revolt, but instead regularly informed Somoza when U.S. officials talked to them about possible end games for the regime. In short, sanctions were well‐targeted, but failed to split the elite, leading the U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua, Mauricio Solaún, to complain repeatedly about the “irrational loyalty” of those around Somoza, suggesting the importance of regime‐type dynamics for the success or failure of U.S. policy.41"
"26","Somoza's Nicaragua was a classic personalist regime. Starting with Anastasio Debayle's father in 1936, the Somoza family established a firm hold on power through large stakes in the Nicaraguan economy and the corrupt diversion of public resources to family and friends. Family members held key government posts; courts were corrupt; and the constitution changed regularly to aid the Somozas. Most importantly, the Somozas established a tight grip on the National Guard, using social isolation of the Guard and an extensive spy network to institutionalize fear and maintain loyalty.42"
"27","Regime type helps to explain how sanctions de‐stabilized Somoza's regime. Scholars agree that when the United States distanced itself from Somoza in 1977 and 1978, it shook the public foundation of the regime's right to rule in important ways. One scholar notes, “The human rights policy of the United States helped to create” the 1978 protests.43 Solaún records that Somoza repeatedly appealed for the resumption of military aid because “this was one of the signals from Washington that he felt would stabilize his rule.” Elites within Somoza's government saw the social effects of sanctions as well. “You are responsible for the current violence and chaos,” a general in the Guard told Solaún.44"
"28","Regime type also explains government intransigence regarding sanctions. Fear of both social retribution and the dictator's wrath accounts for elite loyalty in the case of Nicaragua. Somoza admitted that he feared giving up power.  “But once I leave power, no one guarantees anything to me,” Somoza told the Venezuelan president, Carlos Andrés Pérez, in 1978. For Somoza, staying in power meant staying alive.45 More importantly, the National Guard and other elites stood by Somoza for the same reason. “You know that the Guardia will be the ultimate victim [if revolution succeeds]—we will be shot as in Cuba,” General Iván Alegrett said, “Politicians can escape, but we will be destroyed; probably this is what keeps us under discipline.” As the most‐independent‐minded of Guardsmen, even Alegrett, felt constrained by social retribution: “I know that change is needed and inevitable [referring to Somoza] … [but] I know that I am not acceptable to the opposition.”46"
"29","Fear of Somoza mattered, too. As Nicaragua fell into greater disarray, Somoza crushed latent or potential elite independence. Following the National Palace incident, for example, Somoza purged 85 members of the Guard.47 Likewise, Alegrett later died mysteriously in a plane crash, presumably a victim of his disloyalty, according to Solaún. The President of the Nicaraguan Congress, Cornellio Hueck, faced a similar plight. He was removed from his post by Somoza after unauthorized conversations with Solaún. Things like this “confirmed the belief among Somoza's team of the hopeless risk of showing independence from the boss.” It also reinforced self‐monitoring among the elite. Hueck, for instance, was “totally ostracized by the Somocistas,” with several noting that he was “too ambitious and deserved his ousting.”48"
"30","U.S. allies faced the same problems in trying to split the Nicaraguan elite. In the winter of 1979, the Venezuelan and Costa Rican Presidents met privately with Luis Pallais, Somoza's cousin and President of the Nicaraguan Congress. They proposed that Pallais get Congress to name him President and then open negotiations with the Sandinistas for a democratic transition. Pallais responded with classic Somocista loyalty: “I wish I could do that, but I don't know what Somoza would do if I mentioned this possibility.”49"
"31","Pallais, like many other Nicaraguan elites, chose to ride Somoza's ship to the bottom. These are the dynamics of personalist regimes. Where factions are few, regimes usually refuse to capitulate; democracy and human rights suffer as a result. Nicaragua bears this story out."
"32","In 1972, the Salvadoran military imposed a brutal reign over the country to quell a growing insurgency. U.S. sanctions came in two major phases. The first lasted from 1977 until early spring 1980. The United States terminated all new military assistance and cut economic aid from $20 million to $10 million annually. The Carter administration sought improvements in human rights, the implementation of land reforms, and (after October 1979) a civilian presence in the regime. The United States ended sanctions in the spring of 1980 and increased aid substantially into 1981, a move that probably contributed to increased death squad activity in El Salvador during this period, as hard‐liners reconsolidated power. In response to the violence, Washington re‐imposed sanctions in late 1982, cutting military aid by more than half and threatening further sanctions. It demanded, again, human rights improvements, continued land reforms, and democratic presidential elections.50 In both phases, sanctions generally succeeded, especially in the latter, with free and fair elections in 1984 that brought the Christian Democrat, Jose Napoleon Duarte, to office.            "
"33","Regime type offers the best account of how sanctions worked here. El Salvador was a military regime, where factions were prominent. By the 1980s, there was “no unity within the 800‐man [Salvadoran] officer corps,” split between soft‐liners, hard‐liners, and pragmatists.51 Softline reformists came largely from the ranks of young officers. This reformist faction led successful coups in 1944, 1948, and 1960 against hardline governments. In each case, they established military–civilian juntas. Following the fraud of the 1972 elections, young officers led an unsuccessful coup that laid the foundation for liberalization a decade later.52 While less ideological than reformists, pragmatists would follow any group that “enjoyed the blessing of the United States.”53"
"34","During phase one of sanctions, violence under General Carlos Humberto Romero galvanized the liberal/pragmatist faction in the military, which balanced hard‐liners in numbers by the decade's end.54 Riding this wave of softline growth, a group of liberal officers led a successful coup on 15 October 1979 that sought to end “corruption and gross social and economic injustice.”55 As expected with military regimes, this surge of soft‐liners gave the United States significant influence. Washington helped to determine the mixed civilian–military composition of the post‐coup regime, pushed the regime to dissolve the paramilitary organization, Organización Democrática Nacionalista (ORDEN), and foisted a three‐stage agrarian reform program on the junta that began in March 1980 with the nationalization of Salvadoran banks and the first phase of land redistribution.56 The United States also prevented a May 1980 coup attempt by Major Roberto D'Aubuisson, an ultra‐rightist and former leader of ORDEN. “The coup did not take place … because of the extraordinary pressure the United States placed on the military and oligarchy.” 57 One officer commented that “we agreed” to the civilian composition of the post‐coup junta “because we needed American support.”58"
"35","Hard‐liners pushed back, however. Death squad activity continued at a staggering rate after the 1979 coup. Most liberal initiatives, including land reform, were squelched by 1981. Civilians also left the regime in protest to violence, whereas military soft‐liners lost leverage in the junta.59"
"36","Two things happened to reverse this trend and to press El Salvador toward democracy. First, Washington turned up the sanctions pressure. After re‐starting aid in May 1980, Washington re‐imposed sanctions the following year. The U.S. Congress set the tone when it lowered military aid from $82 million in 1982 to an average of $33 million across 1983 and 1984 (the Reagan administration requested five times this amount). It also threatened further aid cuts in the absence of human rights progress. Though reluctant at first, Reagan eventually followed the congressional lead. In March, April, May, and July of 1981, along with points across 1982 and 1983, senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Alexander Haig, warned Salvadoran officials of “serious consequences” for military aid if Duarte (who entered the junta as President in 1980) was toppled and elections did not occur. Second, the regime continued to factionalize to the advantage of soft‐liners, especially pragmatists. Insurgency growth stood behind these developments. Repression increased Frente Farabundo martí para la Liberación Nactional (FMLN) strength from a few hundred guerillas in the mid‐1970s, to over 8,000 by late 1981, and more than 10,000 by mid‐decade (in relative terms, between one‐quarter and one‐half the size of the Salvadoran army). By 1983, insurgents controlled nearly one third of the country.60"
"37","Renewed sanctions and FMLN growth had dramatic effects on Salvadoran politics. “The costs of militarization … undermined nationalist political and military ideas,” observed a group of authors. “Factions supporting a more antinational … view of how to deal with the internal conflict consolidated power.”61 As expected with military regimes under crisis, pragmatists (especially Defense Minister José Guillermo García) stepped into the policy void and pressed liberal political reforms as a means of sustaining and gaining access to more U.S. aid. Piero Gleijeses observed the following of pragmatists in the post‐1981 period: “Confronted by a credible U.S. threat, and fully cognizant of their own military weakness, the Salvadoran officers would not react with suicidal pride and defy the ‘Yanquis.”’ 62"
"38","This was evident at several important points. First, the regime chose not to adopt a scorched‐earth policy, like that of Nicaragua. Hard‐liners advocated that the government drop the “human rights psychosis,” adopt “total conflict,” and turn to Israel for arms as the Romero regime did from 1977 to 1980.63 Regime type precluded this option, however. Edward Best captured it well: “many shared the view of the far right that, if not for all the political confusion and constraints, they could wipe out subversion in a matter of months” [italics added].64 Under softline influence, the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry began to dial down ties with Israel in 1980 in order to avoid a pariah image that could damage relations with Washington.65 In sum, factionalized politics prevented a return to the tactics of the Romero regime, making capitulation to U.S. demands the only option open to the Salvadoran government.            "
"39","The politics that followed Constituent Assembly elections in March 1982 reflected Washington's growing influence. Right‐wing parties won a surprise victory in the elections. The United States moved to prevent a government headed by D'Aubuisson. With the U.S. ambassador and members of Congress threatening a full aid termination, soft‐liners gained the upper hand. “The U.S. embassy successfully pressured García to deny the interim presidency to D'Aubuisson,” note Martin Diskin and Kenneth Sharpe, and forced “the right to accept a government of national unity.”66 Cynthia Arnson captures the reasons behind García's capitulation: “he did not want … to jeopardize military aid and therefore took the lead in hammering out an agreement that would be acceptable to the U.S.”67 There was further fall‐out for hard‐liners. Backed by the United States, García stood firm against a hardline coup later in the year, leading to the demotion and transfer of several rightist officers.68"
"40","Pragmatists really started to get the upper hand in 1983. Strategic crisis and the need for more U.S. arms opened the door here. The military continued to perform poorly, with insurgents making some of their greatest gains in late 1982 and 1983. Furthermore, deep factions were emerging among officers in the field as soft‐liners in several units started to refuse to kill civilians. Citing incompetent leadership, pragmatists successfully toppled García as Defense Minister in January of 1983. Although he was replaced by a hard‐liner, Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, pragmatists gained influential posts in the government. In the end, the pragmatists overwhelmed hard‐liners in the regime: they removed officers associated with the death squads, reduced human rights abuses, and protected the integrity of the electoral process through 1984. The initiative was meant to please the United States, especially a still‐leery U.S. Congress. Armed Forces Chief of Staff Adolfo Blandon (a pragmatist) said in 1984: “We knew that public opinion in the United States and the view of many Senators and congressmen opposed to military aid for El Salvador was largely due to our bad image because of the death squads.” Demonstrating the extent of pragmatist influence, even the hard‐liner Casanova repeated this theme: “We know that improving our image is worth millions of dollars in aid for our country.”69 In short, sanctions coupled with crisis brought liberal change.            "
"41","In 1984, Duarte won the first relatively free and fair presidential election in El Salvador since 1931. While still not perfect, human rights abuses dropped substantially in the months leading up to and following Duarte's election; political murders decreased from 10,000 annually in 1981 to 108 by 1990. One observer noted, “This change is due almost entirely to American efforts.”70"
"42","Extensive human right abuses in the Guatemalan military regime's longstanding counterinsurgency war led the United States to impose sanctions on military and economic aid in 1977.71 Economic assistance was cut from nearly $50 million in 1976 to around $20 million annually through 1985; new military aid was terminated entirely. Washington sought improvements in human rights and democratic reforms.72 After years of extreme repression, the regime capitulated to sanction pressure and oversaw free and fair presidential elections and a non‐military‐appointed civilian head of state for the first time since 1951.               "
"43","Regime type helps explain how sanctions worked here. Guatemala had a deep history of factionalism that contributed to a rotation of military heads of state from the 1950s forward. Factions here were noticeably different from those in El Salvador, though. For reasons that most scholars attribute to backlash against “leftist extremism” that split the country and military under Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán from 1951 to 1954, no leftist faction (like the Salvadoran junior officers) existed within the ranks of the Guatemalan military. 73 In 1960, the military purged leftist officers entirely. There was a greater degree of ideological cohesion, then, across Guatemala's military factions. Accordingly, scholars use a range of phrases, like “fiercely united” and “remarkable degree of unity,” to describe the military in this period.74"
"44","Nonetheless, factions existed, and understanding their presence is important to understanding sanction impact. By the mid‐1970s, hard‐liners and developmentalists comprised the two most‐noticeable factions. Both represented variations on conservatism, meaning that they shared a disdain for civilian‐led democratic government, preferring military rule instead. Where they differed was on how to end the nearly three‐decade‐old leftist insurgency. Hard‐liners mirrored their counterparts in El Salvador, especially in their advocacy for and use of overwhelming force as the only means to preserve social order and defeat the insurgency. They also saw little need for civilian participation in government.75 Developmentalists differed in important ways: steeped in counterinsurgency theory from foreign (especially Taiwanese and Israeli) training programs that started in the 1960s, developmentalists in the military advocated more “civic action” in the form of development programs as a tool for combatting insurgency.76 Defeating insurgents meant addressing “basic socio‐economic shortcomings,” in tandem with military initiatives.77 As one developmentalist general noted, “You defeat the guerrillas not just with guns, but when you kill the hunger of the peasant.”78 Developmentalists, then, advocated an approach that involved a two‐pronged effort at military gains in conjunction with massive development programs—roads, housing, better farming techniques, even direct hand‐outs of food—to win hearts and minds, particularly in rural areas.               "
"45","The hardline general, Romeo Lucas García, was president of Guatemala when the United States applied sanctions. Lucas responded with a nationalistic backlash. Driven by a “primitive anticommunism that … [identified] reform with subversion, ” the Lucas regime felt “heightened resentment” at the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter and lashed out publicly against so‐called “communists” in the State Department and in the U.S. Congress.79 Instead of capitulating, the regime turned to Israel for alternative arms supplies and launched a massive campaign in the Guatemalan highlands to crush all forms of resistance. Civilian political parties were banned, and death squad activity in the cities increased exponentially.80"
"46","The campaign produced effects opposite to those intended. In addition to enhancing Guatemala's pariah status internationally, the brutality galvanized the opposition. The indigenous populations in the highlands turned in droves to support the insurgency, and aside from the small ruling oligarchy, nearly all other social groups in the cities turned against the regime as well. By 1980, the insurgency numbered half the size of the Guatemalan military (relatively speaking, twice as large as the Sandinista forces at their height against the National Guard), and were active in all provinces of the country. The violence took a toll on the economy as well, which left the regime cash‐strapped and struggling to pay for weapons. The Reagan administration panicked at the prospects of regime collapse and tried again to press reform. It offered Guatemala weapons on credit in exchange for steps toward democracy. Lucas defiantly refused (he complained of “Carterism without Carter” in the Reagan administration) and continued the violence, while pressing the case for his hand‐picked successor in the 1982 elections.81"
"47","The ineffectiveness of the government, along with reports of widespread corruption, brought pressure from the developmentalists. Like others, developmentalists took the view that the 1982 elections were “our last chance, and everyone knows it.”82 When Lucas rigged the elections to his advantage, a group of junior officers led a coup in March 1982 to end corrupt patronage politics. Their stated goal was to address “corruption … and the loss of national prestige.”83 They appointed Efrain Ríos Montt to head the junta. Ríos Montt immediately sounded developmentalist themes. “We [the military] are here to complete the mission: institutionalize the state and channel resources and benefits to those in need.”84 He then announced a new counterinsurgency plan, Victoria 82 or “guns and beans,” that would couple military defeat of the insurgency with development projects to win over peasants.85"
"48","The Reagan administration pressed the regime to go farther by improving human rights and moving toward democracy as a means to loosen sanctions.86 But Ríos Montt took a different course. Instead of folding to U.S. sanction demands, he expanded the military, imported more weapons from Israel, and imposed a state of siege that allowed the regime to “kill legally” as he said. A scorched‐earth campaign followed in the highlands.87 The results were astonishing: 150,000 people killed, 440 villages completely destroyed, and a million persons displaced. In less than a year, the regime killed the same number of people that the Salvadoran regime at its worst would kill in 15 years or more.88"
"49","For developmentalists, the slaughter itself under Ríos Montt did not seem too disconcerting. We need to remember how this regime differed from that in El Salvador. Ideological cohesion here was higher in the absence of a left‐leaning military faction. On this score, scholars note that the junior officers from the 1982 coup bore little resemblance to their 1979 counterparts in El Salvador; they were “extremely anti‐communist” and identified “reform with subversion.”89 Likewise, Susanne Jonas observed that behind the genocide stood a “unity and single‐minded determination” across the military that labeled “the Indian population ‘subversive’ by definition.”90 Slaughter was a necessary, even good, policy at times—a point on which developmentalists seemed to agree.               "
"50","What bothered developmentalists, instead, about the genocide was the added devastation to the economy and the international pariah status that came to damage the most‐prized feature of the developmentalist agenda, namely, development. Here, U.S. sanctions finally began to bite. By the mid‐1980s, the Guatemalan government was virtually bankrupt after nearly a decade of unmitigated terror coupled with other trends in the global economy. The country was wracked by major food shortages, massive rural unemployment, depressed market conditions, and capital flight in the range of $1.5 billion. Over 3,000 businesses closed between 1984 and 1985 alone. Foreign capital from multilateral banks dried up as well.91"
"51","With the economy in shambles, the developmentalist faction in the military saw international funding as the only hope to move to the final development phase of the counterinsurgency plan. This meant acceding to U.S. sanction demands. Political liberalization became the pathway to clean up “the country's international image … [to] attract foreign aid.”92 In short, the developmentalists in Guatemala came to look like El Salvador's pragmatists. They were willing to take steps that they might not necessarily agree with (that is, toward civilian‐led democratic government) in order to gain access to much‐needed aid, which was tied to sanctions.               "
"52","Hence, the developmentalist general, Oscar Mejía Victores, toppled Ríos Montt in August of 1983. In doing so, he immediately announced future presidential elections. In an important move, he barred the military from running candidates—something that had not happened since the 1940s. The goal was to please the United States. “I agree it is necessary to improve our image abroad, and everything we are doing now is aimed at that,” Mejía said, “All measures proposed by the new government are certainly aimed at further improving our image.”93 Verifying the importance of this, Mejía repeatedly harped in public on the connection between international image, foreign economic aid, and democratization in the months following the coup.94 Scholars agree that sanctions mattered. “The Guatemalan military … recognized the need to adjust their counterinsurgency strategy,” notes Jonas. “They preferred an elected civilian government because after being an international pariah for many years, the Guatemalan government needed international legitimacy in order to obtain foreign aid to deal with the economic crisis.”95"
"53","Mejía stuck to his word. In 1985, free and fair presidential elections brought a civilian, Vinicio Cerezo Arévalo, to office. While Cerezo's authority remained highly circumscribed and human rights conditions poor (though far better than in prior years) during Cerezo's term, the election initiated Guatemala's slow climb toward democracy. Scholars uniformly agree that U.S.‐led sanctions stood behind it all.96"
"54","Before moving to implications, it is important to consider a pair of related counter‐arguments to the explanation developed above. First, perhaps, armed insurgency makes elites fear social retribution, cohere more, and, subsequently, resist sanctions. So, in Nicaragua, armed insurgency explains Guard loyalty, while the absence of armed insurgency in a case like the Dominican Republic, for example, loosened elite cohesion and allowed space for military leaders to assassinate the personalist dictator Rafael Trujillo."
"55","The problem with this specific counter‐argument is three‐fold. First, there were radicalized, armed resistance movements in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Yet, the leadership in the latter stepped out of power, the former did not, meaning the presence of armed insurgency alone cannot account for variation across these cases. Second, even when facing armed insurgency, elites in personalist states often have the opportunity to negotiate with other, less–radicalized opposition forces for immunity. Yet, they frequently choose not to. The Nicaraguan National Guard could have done this into early 1979, but stood by Somoza instead. Why? Regime‐type loyalty caused elites to cohere. Third, in an important way, the Trujillo case is not comparable to Nicaragua. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency provided arms for and then “encouraged, organized, and planned” the assassination against Trujillo. The Dominican Republic does not appear to be a case of sanction success, but instead non‐sanctions‐based coercion by an outside actor. The main point is this: like Nicaragua, the sanctions alone were not sufficient to move the generals against Trujillo. 97"
"56","Second, perhaps, the presence of a moderate opposition affected outcomes in these cases. In essence, the stronger the moderates, the more comfortable elites will be in negotiating reforms (that is, they will fear social retribution less). The problem here is with intra‐ and inter‐case outcomes. There were relatively strong moderate elements in El Salvador and Guatemala. But El Salvador accommodated them more quickly and with far less violence than did Guatemala, where the junta's early 1980s rampage included severe repression of moderate political parties. The moderate‐opposition argument seems hard‐pressed to explain this. In Nicaragua, the fact that moderates were eclipsed in the opposition by the more‐radical Sandinistas in early 1979 might have enhanced Guard loyalty somewhat. Yet, it hardly seems the determining factor. As noted, an active, well‐organized moderate opposition existed in Nicaragua across 1977 and 1978; in fact, it was far more prominent than the Sandinistas. If the moderate opposition argument works, Nicaraguan elites should have abandoned Somoza prior to 1979, but they did not. Again, regime type explains why. Regardless of moderate opposition, cross‐temporal elite loyalty is expected with personalist dictatorships."
"57","Between 1958 and 2000, approximately 12 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean faced similar sanctions for similar reasons as did Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. In at least four of these cases, sanctions bore few costs to the target.98 Consequently, sanctions played little part in these states' eventual democratization.99 I return to this point below. This section explores plausibility probes into other cases in which sanctions were more costly. These probes suggest further strength for my argument.            "
"58","The plight of U.S. sanctions against Fulgencio Batista y Zalvídar's personalist regime in Cuba tells a story similar to that in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. In February of 1958, the United States suspended all military aid and sales to Batista (including pipeline aid), demanding that the regime hold free elections and improve human rights. Facing an insurrection led by Fidel Castro, the sanctions proved costly. Batista turned to some alternative arms suppliers, but also appealed at several points to Washington for a resumption of arms, especially as the economy faltered and the military situation grew more dire during the year. Regardless, Batista refused to democratize. Instead, he suspended constitutional rights; tightened press censorship; increased torture; and rigged elections in 1958. As Batista's military fell back amidst mounting losses, the dictator fled on 31 December 1958.100 As in Nicaragua, the successor regime proved radical and non‐democratic.               "
"59","Batista's was a classic personalist regime. It was arbitrary, centralized, non‐ideological, and corrupt. The military was de‐professionalized and, along with the police, kept in check by Batista through favors, coercion, and fear.101 These personalist dynamics affected the impact of sanctions. First, the United States faced the unyielding roadblock of Batista himself. “I must carry on,” the dictator said, when the United States suggested others to take his place, “I have a duty to remain at my post.”102 Even more importantly, there was no one around Batista to force him to capitulate. Like Somoza, Batista maintained tight control of the state and military. The dictator surrounded himself in Havana with his most‐loyal officers and regularly purged potential defectors. This personalistic structure proved impenetrable for the United States. By December of 1958, Washington abandoned efforts to coax Batista to reform and tried to find a second option. But, with so many officers in prison, U.S. officials admitted they could not “identify any prospective leadership in the Cuban Army competent to overthrow the Batista regime.”103 Washington even tried to use a large bribe to free its preferred candidate, Colonel Ramón Barquín, from prison. Batista's personalist grip proved too tight, though; the sympathetic warden of the prison was “transferred” before the bribe could be made, and the plan failed. Overall, Batista's regime was “more sultanized than ever” by the end. That ultimately seemed a decisive factor in dooming U.S. sanctions to failure.104"
"60","In addition to El Salvador, the United States imposed costly economic sanctions on several other military regimes in Latin America [Suriname, Haiti (1990), Ecuador, Argentina, and Bolivia]. Aside from Argentina, sanctions seemed to work in each case, substantially contributing to democratization. This section explores one of those cases: Bolivia."
"61","The United States applied/threatened sanctions on several occasions against military regimes in Bolivia. With declining growth and double‐digit inflation, the Bolivian economy was in an “endless downward spiral” from the mid‐1970s. U.S. sanctions deprived the regime of much‐needed aid and tarnished Bolivia's reputation, which dried up other international funding sources.105 Washington sought a return to a constitutional process.               "
"62","U.S. sanctions played into the hardline–softline factionalism of Bolivia's military establishment. As anticipated, the end result was democratization. Bolivia had a long history of deep military divisions. Hard‐liners led the 1970s regimes sanctioned by the United States. Prior to this, however, several leftist soft‐line regimes ruled from 1969 to 1971. By the 1970s, “democratic and authoritarian camps” clearly existed in the military, according to one observer.106 U.S. sanctions emboldened soft‐liners. Following his 1978 coup, for instance, Colonel Juan Pereda Asbúnd cancelled upcoming elections and continued to jail political opponents. He dramatically changed course, though, after touring the barracks following U.S. sanctions. “The position of the U.S … had persuaded a majority [especially in the La Paz garrison] that further elections should take place.107 Pareda folded. He announced elections and released political prisoners, among other liberalizing steps.               "
"63","Colonel Alberto Natusch Busch followed a similar course. He seized power amidst the confusion that followed the 1979 elections, but a new round of U.S. sanctions again brought change via factions in the military. “Decisively ambushed by Washington,” notes James Dunkerley, “the army command had no desire to worsen an already‐critical situation.” Soft‐liners in the military forced Natusch to resign and appoint a civilian interim president, prompting the United States to restore aid. From that point, soft‐line junior officers used additional U.S. threats of aid cuts to stave off several hard‐line coups and preserve the momentum toward the 1980 elections.108"
"64","Finally, General Luís García Meza seized power and pledged a Pinochet‐type regime that would rule for 20 years. He lasted only 18 months, due in large measure to new sanctions amidst economic chaos. The aid suspension by Washington caused “internal competition” and “substantial disunity.” Soft‐liners pushed García Meza out and, in 1982, ushered in elections that, at long last, set Bolivia on a path toward more‐consistent democratic government.109"
"65","Regime type is important for understanding sanction success. Overall, this article indicates that targeted sanctions alone may not work that well against personalist states, but that against military regimes, they are sometimes effective. What this means theoretically is that collective regime‐type dynamics, like those discussed by democratization scholars, may condition or determine, at times, patterns of patronage–sectoral pressures in ways that affect when sanctions matter. Too little attention has been paid to these collective features of target regimes."
"66","This article is certainly not the last word on this topic. The findings here need further testing and development. Cases assessed, for instance, in this study, by no means, exhaust the range of possible regime types. Single‐party and hybrid regimes need attention. There are questions about intra‐regime dynamics as well. Some military regimes could be more cohesive, others more pluralistic, either of which could affect sanction impact.110 The cohesiveness of Guatemala's military, that is, the more‐bounded ideological range across factions—may help explain, for example, why the regime held out with such resolve against U.S. sanctions longer than the more‐pluralistic‐looking Salvadoran military government. This kind of distinction might also explain why sanctions failed against Argentina (a country in which, some argue, the military was similar to that of Guatemala in terms of its ideological cohesion) and Panama, where certain personalist dynamics of General Manuel Noriega's government seemed to dampen pluralistic tendencies within the military establishment. 111 Further study may also uncover more‐cohesive and pluralistic personalist regimes. In essence, varying institutional/historical/cultural dynamics across personalist states may create different levels of dictatorial control over elites. This, and not simply patronage, rent‐seeking politics, may help account for at least some of the elite splintering that scholars such as Abel Escribá Folch and Joseph Wright find in their assessment of sanctions against personalist states.112 Only further study will tell.         "
"67","Given what we know from the findings in this article, important policy suggestions follow for using sanctions to advance democracy and human rights. The Democracy Index of the Economists Intelligence Unit indicates that there are approximately 55 “authoritarian states” today world‐wide. About 19 of these are personalist regimes and 5 are military regimes.113 Some scholars might think these numbers are small, making the content of this article less relevant. In reality, some of the most high‐profile international sanctions cases of late include Burma (military), Turkmenistan (personalist), Libya (personalist), Uzbekistan (personalist), and Syria (personalist). Furthermore, the military often represents the strongest institution in developing world states. Consequently, military governments are most likely to appear in times of political turmoil, like that in the Middle East today. Understanding military regime dynamics is a wise policy move, then. So, what policy lessons does this article offer?         "
"68","First, regime‐type dynamics aside, the findings here suggest that sanctions must be costly in order to work. This is nothing new for sanctions scholars, and probably explains why so many sanctions generally fail, especially against targets with larger, more‐diversified economies. Once costly, sanctions require a calculated application that depends on regime type."
"69","Start with personalist regimes. Since personalist states do not generally bend to sanctions that demand significant liberalization, multiple forms of pressure are required to completely re‐align sender relations away from the dictator and toward opposition forces within the regime. First, senders should apply a full array of sanctions against the regime. Although this will probably not dislodge the regime, it might help to de‐legitimize it domestically (that is, a sign of sender support for the opposition cause) and curb, through higher costs, the regime's capacity for violent repression. Second, the sender should demand publicly that the dictator leave power. Senders should be cautious about encouraging negotiations between the dictator and opposition for a transition of power. Negotiations are often futile; dictators simply use them to buy time. Abandoning the dictator altogether works best, then. Third, depending on the tightness of the dictator's terror network, the sender should try to identify elite defectors. Encouraging them to move against the regime will require material support and perhaps coordination by the sender (sanctions alone will not yield defection). Threats of outside military intervention might even be necessary. Finally, senders should throw their full support (including humanitarian and even military aid) behind non‐state opposition forces, especially political moderates. This offers the best chance for preventing the kind of radicalization of the opposition that led to non‐democratic successor regimes in places like Nicaragua and Cuba. Overall, while potentially costly to senders, this policy approach is the best way to deal with entrenched dictators."
"70","These suggestions for dealing with personalist states prove nowhere more important than in recent and current policies toward Libya and Syria. The successful 2011 North Atlantic Treaty Organization/United Nations (NATO/UN) approach to move Libya toward democracy included all of the above elements, from sanctions to the use of force. Muammar el‐Qaddafi's resilience testified to the fact that personalist regimes are especially difficult to dislodge. Regardless, the policy was the right one, offering the best chance for democratic change in Libya."
"71","The same cannot be said of the international approach to current‐day Syria, however. Here, some may blame the Syrian regime's resistance to a democratic transition on the failure to apply tighter sanctions and/or the shortcomings of diplomatic initiatives from the Arab League and United Nations. These, however, are not the central issues. Regime type is. Tighter sanctions may help. But, facing a major armed rebellion and what are already crippling international sanctions, the regime of President Bashar al‐Assad has shown the kind of cohesion that this article expects with personalist states. Assad has utilized his deft control of power, fears of potential retribution against the ruling Alawite minority, and conspiracies about foreign intrigue (a common feature with personalist regimes) to sustain loyalty within his ruling coalition and beyond.114 At this point, he shows all the personalist tendencies to fight to the end, rather than accept a pacted transition out of power. Meanwhile, the opposition appears headed in a more‐radical, Islamist direction.115 None of this, in short, is good for a democratic future in Syria. If the international community hopes to reverse this course, it needs to recognize the limits of direct negotiations with Assad, throw full support to the opposition by increasing the nascent military aid currently being provided to the rebel movement, and, perhaps, eventually apply force directly. This is certainly a more deeply engaged and costly policy than that followed to this point in Syria. But, if a stable democratic transition is the end goal in Syria, this more‐forceful approach with the Assad regime represents the best course of action.         "
"72","Compared to personalist states, policy prescriptions against military regimes are more straightforward and, perhaps, less costly to the sender. Rather than abandoning the target regime, senders in these cases should work through the military government to engage the opposition in a transition to democracy. In some instances, this may have drawbacks in terms of continued military authority after democratization. Returning to the above point about cohesion, it might also take a while for costly sanctions to work. But the overall benefits, in terms of a stable and progressive transition from military rule at lower cost to the sender, will outweigh these negatives in most cases. The strategy here revolves around shoring up the place of soft‐liners in the regime. This should involve, first, the aggressive application of costly sanctions in order to help split the regime and give soft‐liners a voice. Second, as part of this process, the sender should make it clear publicly and repeatedly (so that hard‐ and soft‐liners alike hear) that liberal reform will bring the renewal and perhaps even a significant increase in aid. Few other steps work to the benefit of soft‐liners more than this. Third, if the target takes steps toward capitulation, it may be wise to loosen the embargo some in order to show that the sender is serious about these inducements. This can be risky, as was seen in El Salvador in 1980. But small amounts of aid, coupled with promises of much more after democratization, give the sender more credibility with the target and move the process of liberalization forward."
"73","Today, Burma may be emerging as a perfect example of this approach. A top‐down process of democratic reform has begun in Burma that led to stunning victories for long‐time democracy advocate, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her political party in recent parliamentary by‐elections. It appears that two‐decade‐old international sanctions, combined with the impoverished, backward state of the Burmese economy, stand behind these changes. While Burma is still a long way from a democracy, moves by the United States and European Union to loosen sanctions are correct.116 There probably will be setbacks ahead, but continued sanctions and threats of sanctions may yet help produce a democratic outcome in Burma.         "
"74","Overall, studying sanctions through the lens of regime type creates a range of possibilities for understanding how sanctions work. Many issues, of course, still need to be explored, including the impact of regime type in policy domains other than democracy. We also need more precision about sanction costs; when are costs “high” or “extremely high” and what best produces these? Further research could also look at sanction type, like economic versus military sanctions, to determine which works best for different regime types in terms of pressing liberal political order. Combined with continued refinement of our understanding of different regime types, addressing these issues will only enhance the precision of the above policy suggestions all the more. In sum, the range of questions is great, the field is rich for study. This we know, at least: the lens of authoritarian regime type opens important new doors for understanding how best to promote democracy and human rights."
