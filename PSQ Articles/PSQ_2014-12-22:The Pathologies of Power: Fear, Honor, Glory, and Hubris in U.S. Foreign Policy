"1","Books about improving U.S. foreign policy are a dime a dozen. But in The Pathologies of Power, Christopher Fettweis offers an unusual take on what he sees as the subpar foreign policy performance of the planet's sole superpower. Fettweis claims that U.S. foreign policy is driven by four pathological beliefs—fear, honor, glory, and hubris—that lead to poor policymaking. The book devotes a chapter to each of the beliefs that Fettweis contends account for foreign policy disasters like the Iraq war and the Vietnam war.         "
"2","Foremost among the pathological beliefs is fear, which is behind the views that the world is full of enemies and that we are living in dangerous times. According to Fettweis, America's paranoia about communism led to costly U.S. involvement in various “geopolitically irrelevant backwaters” (p. 14) during the Cold War. The (neo)conservative view of ever‐present danger is unfounded today. The empirical reality is that “there has never been a more peaceful, less violent period of time than the post‐Cold War era” (p. 33)."
"3","The second belief is honor, and while it seems archaic, Fettweis says its more‐contemporary cousin, credibility, is important and contributed to U.S. involvement in the First World War and Vietnam. He claims that honor can inhibit cooperation and is irrelevant in an international system without existential threats to member states."
"4","The third pathological belief is concern about national glory, status, or prestige. According to Fettweis, America's desire to be the best is generally seen as unproblematic and a basic element of the national character, but it can lead to counterproductive outcomes."
"5","Finally, there is hubris. The United States perceives itself as the sole indispensible nation and an exception to common norms. For Fettweis, America's hubris convinces its leaders that the nation's goals are both right and attainable. Thus, the superpower foolishly tries to act like a superhero."
"6","Again, Fettweis contends that these beliefs are pathological, in that they are not grounded in reality and have contributed to various foreign policy failures. Yet his book is not merely descriptive; he contends that American foreign policy can be improved if the beliefs are changed. Fettweis concedes that such change will be difficult, for two reasons. First, the beliefs fit together into a self‐supporting system that screens out or defines away information that might otherwise call them into question. Second, they are based not just on reason but also on emotive or cultural elements that are constitutive of political identity and hence not easily altered. Nevertheless, Fettweis believes that the four beliefs can be changed by a persistent application of reason: “Like a piece of popcorn stuck between teeth, reasoned analysis can sometimes be impossible to ignore, and eventually has to be addressed” (p. 23)."
"7","Fettweis says that the pathological beliefs could be replaced by others that would better promote U.S. interests, namely prudence, an awareness that morality does not reside solely in any one country, and a sensitivity to the implications of unipolarity. He suggests that these alternative beliefs stand some chance of being adopted, inasmuch as each has a long pedigree and is “drawn from the realist handbook” (p. 242)."
"8","The descriptive aspects of Fettweis's book are interesting, and while one could argue with certain aspects of his discussion of any of the four beliefs, his overall account is plausible. However, Fettweis's prescription for normative improvement is somewhat less compelling, or at least less‐well‐developed. Reason is, of course, a popular prescription for a variety of ills, but the beliefs that Fettweis describes are entrenched and not easily altered."
"9","The book should be of interest to a variety of scholars of American foreign policy and international relations, and it is sufficiently accessible to be suitable for graduate and advanced undergraduate students."
