"1","From streams theory to the punctuated equilibrium model to the advocacy coalition framework, “policy change” is one of the most heavily theorized topics in the subfield of public policy. Elaine Kamarck's How Change Happens—Or Doesn't: The Politics of US Public Policy provides an insider's view of policy change, forgoing rigid empiricism in lieu of a more applied investigation. How Change Happens is essentially a “how to” guide for policy entrepreneurs, identifying the various political levers, players, norms, and processes that drive or stunt large‐scale reform. Kamarck argues that policy change is an inherently complex and unpredictable process—often resulting from sheer luck—that cannot be explained via a single unifying academic model.         "
"2","Kamarck contends that successful entrepreneurs must have the capacity to survey and interpret the “policy battlefield,” a concept that “refers to the various factors that determine the outcome of policy ideas” (p. 9). The policy battlefield encompasses six distinct but interrelated sectors: the problem, the solution, inside players, outside players, political strategy and the scope of conflict, and the role of elections. The book devotes an entire chapter to each sector. It also includes an additional chapter exploring the policy implications of unexpected events. While the relationship between these forces and policy change is well established, How Change Happens does an excellent job synthesizing these fairly disparate topical areas and underscoring the flaws in conventional wisdom. What is more, the policy battlefield analogy offers a very accessible heuristic for conceptualizing policy change. In this regard, the book provides a useful contrast to some of the discipline's more theoretical works.         "
"3","The book's rich case studies are its greatest strength. Drawing from her years of experience in government, Kamarck presents a diverse collection of cases, including health care, environmental policy, military reform, immigration, and gay and lesbian rights. Case material helps to contextualize the battlefield framework, and Kamarck's first‐rate “storytelling” makes for a very enjoyable read."
"4","Despite her criticism of extant theory's explanatory power, Kamarck integrates an eclectic mix of theoretical concepts in support of her overarching argument that policy change is complex and unpredictable. While this literature lends structure to the chapters, many readers will find its integration a bit haphazard and, at times, insufficient. For example, Kamarck references many of the dominant theories of policy change and conflict expansion but makes only a passing mention of the vast literature on problem definition and political language. This particular omission is striking, inasmuch as the definition of problems and alternatives is widely seen as one of the important drivers of policy change."
"5","Moreover, Kamarck is, to some extent, guilty of making the same sorts of generalizations rejected in her preface and in the opening chapter of her work. Chapter 3 goes so far as to present three categories of “problem types,” which are then used to make inferences into the nature of preferred solutions and, in some instances, into the degree of political conflict. This categorization scheme differs little from the work on policy typologies, which was explicitly born out of a desire to reduce political complexities to a set of predictive and parsimonious concepts."
"6","Kamarck's desire to meld scholarship with applied and real‐world experience is laudable and reflects her own background in government and academia. Although How Change Happens provides few groundbreaking insights about the policymaking process, it represents a happy medium for those hoping to learn more about policy change without getting too bogged down in academic debate. This contribution is hardly trivial, given public policy's longstanding commitment to engaging both scholars and practitioners alike.         "
