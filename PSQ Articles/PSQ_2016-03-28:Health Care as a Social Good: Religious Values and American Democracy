"1","Taking a novel and helpful approach to health care policy debates, David M. Craig explores how religious language and values shape political visions about how to provide health care to citizens. He aims to clarify points of dispute by examining three dominant “moral languages” about health (private benefit, public right, and private choice) and proposing that a fourth (social good) might open space for consensus. By carefully documenting how our complex and fragmented health care “system” currently functions, how the intricate web of policy was woven, where it breaks down entirely, and how each component is tied to fundamental American values that are often misaligned with our public rhetoric, Craig demonstrates that health care already functions “as a social good much more than Americans recognize” and that “religious values can strengthen Americans' commitment to making health care a more complete social good” (p. 185). Ultimately, Craig argues that Americans need an increased sense of solidarity to undergird a new vision of because “health care only works if everyone is in it together” (p. 214)."
"2","The book is divided into two sections. In the first section, Craig explores three moral languages that govern how Americans think about health care and exposes the essentially religious syntax of each language. Craig argues that the first language, that of private benefit, dominates how most Americans view heath care. This language grew up alongside the system of health care delivery that tied insurance to employment. Conceiving of health care as a private benefit means that individuals deserve whatever care they have earned through privately made contracts with insurance companies that are made available as an employment benefit in addition to their wages.         "
"3","The private benefit moral language extends to Medicare, which most Americans falsely believe they have paid for through their payroll taxes. But Craig points out that the rhetoric of private benefit does not match the reality because both employer‐provided insurance and Medicare are both heavily subsidized by taxpayers through income tax deductions and direct payments. In this sense, we treat health care as a social good but speak of it as a private benefit. Craig argues that the other two moral languages, that of health care as a public right or as a private choice, which dominate among political liberals and conservatives, respectively, also fail, both in describing the way health care currently functions in the United States and in making visible the fundamental commitments already embedded in the assumptions Americans make about who should have access to which forms of health care.         "
"4","In the second section of the book, Craig mounts an argument that religious communities play an important role in establishing and communicating the values that are at the heart of why health care should be understood as a social good. These religious values are crucial for transcending partisan divides and for developing the sense of solidarity that will make developing good health care policy politically feasible."
"5","The book is thoroughly researched and approachably written. It will appeal to readers who want to look beyond stock partisan rhetoric to understand the deeper structures of how and on what basis our current health care policies developed. One great strength of the book is that it outlines in accessible detail how truly complex our current system is and what a patchwork of values are embedded in it. For many readers, simply the opportunity to understand how DSHs (disproportionate share hospitals) are compensated, what it means to be a Federally Qualified Health Center, how POSHs (physician‐owned specialty hospitals) may draw resources away from charity care hospitals, and how similar Medicaid and Medicare are in their funding structures will be an enormous benefit. Paired with insightful ethical and religious analysis, this tour of our current health care system offers readers an unusual opportunity to rethink how and why we organize health care delivery as we do."
