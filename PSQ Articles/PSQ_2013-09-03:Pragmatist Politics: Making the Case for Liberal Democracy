"1","Some contemporary pragmatists might well object to this book at the outset. Richard Rorty and Richard Posner, for instance, deny that pragmatism has any political implications. So the claim that John McGowen insinuates in his title—that a distinctively “pragmatist politics” exists—is itself contentious. One initial surprise, then, is that McGowen himself seemingly agrees with something resembling the skeptical view (pp. 34–35). Of course, McGowen might simply be adopting a pluralist stance—asserting that pragmatism does not entail any unique set of political ideals or institutions. That, however, generates questions. On the one hand, McGowen stipulates that he mostly is unconcerned with institutions (p. xvi). On the other hand, he endorses pragmatist intellectual commitments—fallibilism, anti‐skepticism, consequentialism—that arguably sustain a broad (and, even among pragmatists themselves, still contested) conception of truth. John Dewey, at least, thought that conception of truth has obvious political implications. It entails extending experimentalism—despite widespread reluctance to do so—from scientific and technical domains into social and political relations. Having done that, it also entails that we relinquish, indeed actively subvert, dogmatism. These entailments, Dewey insisted, signal “a great change in the seat of authority and methods of decision in society” (Reconstruction in Philosophy [1920], Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1948, p. 160). A pragmatist conception of truth, in other words, underwrites a commitment to processes of democratic argument and reflection. This, I suspect, is something that McGowen might accept.         "
"2","Here, further questions arise. McGowen characterizes pragmatism as “a philosophy of possibility” (p. xii). This is a central—and, to my mind, extremely salutary—theme in his argument. It converges with the pluralist impulse just mentioned, pressing us to imagine alternatives beyond the tightly pinched horizon recognized by political realists or fundamentalists. McGowen elaborates on this theme by casting pragmatism as an ethical position, one that “stresses the processes of negotiation about meanings and values over any particular result” that those processes might generate (p. 101). Consequently, his stance “places a huge emphasis on ‘conversation,’ on the intersubjective links people forge through talking and interacting with one another” (p. 106). Those familiar with recent discussions of pragmatism and politics will find this unexceptional. But it sits uneasily with the reticence that McGowen, like many other pragmatists, displays toward political institutions. For in politics, our negotiations and conversations require institutional structure. Political talk may not require any particular institutional incarnation, but it requires some institutional incarnation. Otherwise, it risks remaining diffuse or shot through with asymmetries or inefficacies in ways that subvert the democratic impulse McGowen aims to reconstruct.         "
"3","Democracy, after all, is about self‐government and so involves making collective decisions. That means it is implausible to divorce consideration of a “democratic ethos” —however we might specify it—from the way in which it (unavoidably) must find institutional embodiment. That is my view. I believe it is Dewey's as well. More importantly, I think it follows too from how, in his final chapter, McGowen characterizes our democratic politics as “comic.” His treatment of this theme is subtle. In short, however, the “comic attitude strives to return us to the things of this world, to overcome the ever present temptations to avoid the difficulties of the here and now in favor of imagined perfect realms” (p. 156). The pressure is on McGowen, and the rest of us, to bring our treatment of democratic values and ideals into contact with the material realities of workable political‐economic institutions. It is a considerable virtue of this book to make that difficult task apparent."
