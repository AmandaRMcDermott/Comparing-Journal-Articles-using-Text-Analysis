"1","Michael Nelson's book will be required reading for any historian or political scientist seeking to understand the 1968 presidential election and its importance for the development of contemporary American politics. In Resilient America, Nelson provides compelling and rich descriptions of the leading personalities and issues of one of the most tumultuous elections in American history. Despite the “great strains” that America endured during the 1968 election, Nelson argues, the nation's “conventional political processes” provided it with the flexibility necessary to remain resilient (p. xiv).         "
"2","Tracing the process from the 1964 presidential election, Nelson successfully recreates the complex and fluid political context of the 1968 election. The majority of the book focuses on the battles for each party's nomination and the general election campaigns, culminating in an analysis of the final outcome. Capturing the unpredictability of this unusual election and the efforts of the candidates to cope with the day‐by‐day changes, Nelson offers a host of unique insights."
"3","Each candidate's campaign is given detailed attention and placed within the complexity of the nomination process before the McGovern‐Fraser reform. That these were the last of the brokered national party conventions makes Nelson's masterful accounts of the backroom maneuvering for nomination delegates essential reading for political scientists. Even for scholars who have a deep familiarity with this election, Nelson's descriptions of the personal conflicts between individual candidates will be particularly fascinating. While most will know of the mutual animosity between President Lyndon B. Johnson and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the growing hostility between the two antiwar candidates—Senators Eugene McCarthy and Kennedy—is a less familiar but no less important subtext in the race for the Democratic nomination (Chapter 3). Meanwhile, Nelson shows us how Richard M. Nixon's challenges with Nelson Rockefeller on the left and George Wallace on the right provided him with an opportunity to lay claim to the mainstream of his party, positioning himself well for the general election (Chapter 4)."
"4","The book also puts to rest two lingering questions about the election: would Robert Kennedy have won had he lived, and could Vice President Hubert Humphrey have won the election had he run a better campaign? While Kennedy might well have won more primary elections, Nelson shows that his campaign was poorly positioned to win the favor of leading party operatives and that in the party‐brokered convention system that dominated the process in 1968, Humphrey would have been the party's candidate even had Kennedy lived. Moreover, Humphrey's poorly organized campaign is described as a major factor in his loss. Humphrey's surging poll numbers in the final five weeks of the campaign, after he broke with the president over Vietnam, show that he might have won had he been better organized and asserted his independence from LBJ earlier."
"5","While Resilient America will surely become the primary reference on the 1968 election, the book raises more questions than it answers in seeking to understand its long‐term importance. Nelson points to the emergence of divided government and party polarization as important developments that this election foreshadowed (pp. 244–250). However, he forgoes a full analysis of the Republican majority that emerged in 1968 and of the potency of the blue‐collar appeals and the “Southern strategy” that were central to the Nixon and Wallace campaigns. Was the 1968 election an indicator of deeper shifts in a party system that had been stable since the New Deal? In what ways did it usher in a new dynamic in presidential elections? How large a role did the social movements of the 1960s play in opening the nation's politics to new participants on the left and the right? Nelson's book provides us with the best analysis of the 1968 election to date, offering us new reasons to raise these and other questions about this important election. For now, Nelson's observation of the political system's resilience provides us with a new starting point in thinking through these developmental inquiries.         "
