"1","Few aspects of economic policy arouse such vehement criticism as government bailouts of large financial institutions, rationalized by government as essential for preventing costly systemic developments. The principal thesis set forth by Vern McKinley in Financing Failure: A Century of Bailouts is that government consistently exaggerates the prospective costs of bankruptcy of financial firms and underestimates the costs of bailouts, dearly costing taxpayers. McKinley bases this conclusion on a study of three major crises: The Great Depression, the 1980s bailout of Continental Illinois Bank, and the Great Crisis of 2007–2009. In this latter period, government bailed out or arranged life‐saving mergers for Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wachovia, and AIG.         "
"2","In contrast to other books dealing with the recent crisis, McKinley's focuses less on personalities of key players (Ben Bernanke, Henry Paulson, Tim Geithner, etc.), and more on the decision‐making process. A major contribution of the book is its documentation of pertinent information obtained through lawsuits filed by the author against the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Federal Housing Finance Agency under the Freedom of Information Act. McKinley's efforts resulted in the release of hundreds of e‐mails and other documents pertaining to decisions sometimes made only minutes before the opening of key markets. Information obtained is cited via copious footnotes, making this work an interesting and important contribution to our understanding of policymaking in crisis."
"3","McKinley criticizes policymakers' failure to explicitly quantify prospective costs and benefits of bailouts. He believes policymakers vastly underestimate the moral hazard costs of bailouts—the consequences of increased risk‐taking by large financial firms that now feel protected from failure. For example, McKinley plausibly asserts that the government‐arranged J.P. Morgan purchase of Bear Stearns in March 2008 signaled top management of Lehman Brothers that it also would be saved, thus reducing incentive to reduce its risk exposure or aggressively seek a buyer."
"4","In fairness to the government, any quantitative estimate of the consequences of a decision to let Bear Stearns or AIG fail would be subject to enormous uncertainty. These firms had written credit default swaps with huge potential payoffs to a multitude of important corporations, ensuring them against losses on mortgage‐related instruments. Given the bankruptcy of Bear or AIG, such contracts would be worthless. The market's collective reaction to the announcement of bankruptcy would be inherently impossible to estimate. McKinley ignores the world‐wide panic that ensued immediately upon Lehman's bankruptcy filing in September 2008. Crucial interbank and commercial paper markets froze, a run on money market funds ensued. Arguably, only a series of innovative and aggressive actions by Bernanke prevented Great Depression II. Bernanke's heroics go unappreciated."
"5","Finally, McKinley endorses the bogus claim that the U.S. government caused the Great Crisis of 2007–2009. In reality, private‐sector forces were predominant. The irrational view that house prices could not fall became pervasive, leading to an enormous ramping up of leverage by homebuyers and private‐sector lenders. Massive securitization of mortgages by private‐sector investment banks eliminated the incentive of amoral mortgage lenders to scrutinize the financial condition of mortgage applicants. A widespread degradation of lending standards ensued. Private‐sector credit‐rating agencies negligently stamped mortgage‐related securities “AAA.” Enormous world‐wide demand for these ostensibly safe bonds meant that the supply of funds available to homebuyers was virtually unlimited. Wall Street firms granted bonuses based on immediate rather than long‐term profits, feeding speculation. Privately owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, its top officers driven by the same avarice as other players, ramped up leverage and risk in pursuit of quick profits and bonuses. While government was culpable for its laissez‐faire posture toward regulation and supervision, its role paled in comparison to private‐sector forces."
