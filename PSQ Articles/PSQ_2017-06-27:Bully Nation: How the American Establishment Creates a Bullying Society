"1","Bullying has become a cause célèbre in the contemporary United States. Egregious instances of bullying and its often devastating effects are a mainstay of news headlines, and numerous public figures—from athletes and musical artists to first lady hopefuls—have stepped up as celebrity spokespersons for a burgeoning anti‐bullying movement. Every U.S. state has enacted anti‐bullying legislation in the last decade, and a series of bills to improve anti‐bullying measures in public schools, colleges, and universities nationwide have been considered in recent sessions of Congress."
"2","Although bullying is seemingly on the rise, Bully Nation authors Charles Derber and Yale R. Magrass posit that it is, and has long been, endemic to American politics and society. Theirs is a decidedly sociological argument. In contrast to prevailing psychological explanations, which conceive of bullying as an aberrant individual behavior driven by personal nature and circumstances, Derber and Magrass contend that it is in fact an outgrowth of a system of political, economic, and other societal institutions that promote and reinforce the tendency to exploit power differentials through repeated acts of harassment and intimidation. They emphasize further that bullying is not merely a childhood activity, as commonly understood, but one that infects relationships among adults in a wide range of settings.         "
"3","To make this case, the authors take a broad survey of American economy, politics, and society. After establishing the utility of a sociological framework for understanding the prevalence of bullying in the United States, each of the book's internal chapters tackles a different arena in which bullying is pervasive. These include the modern capitalist economy, environmental stewardship, the military, educational institutions, and the family unit. The last full chapter considers the nascent anti‐bullying movement, which, Derber and Magrass note, has not been systematically documented in social science research. Rather than attempt to fill this gap in the literature, however, the authors resort to a “partly speculative” consideration of counter‐bullying forces (p. 195), casting them as an outgrowth of the countercultural movements of the late 1960s and suggesting that this genealogy limits their capacity to tackle the root causes of bullying in America. The book concludes with a brief epilogue that draws on the Scandinavian experience to sketch out an alternative political economy that is less susceptible to rampant bullying and, somewhat incongruously, an appendix that applies the authors’ sociological paradigm to Middle Eastern terrorist groups and the State of Israel."
"4","Throughout the book, Derber and Magrass treat bullying as an umbrella category, encompassing a very wide range of behaviors—including the archetypal schoolyard bullying but also racial profiling, bellicose foreign policy, contingent employment in academe, military boot camp, the treatment of animals on factory farms, and ISIS‐sponsored honor killings (among others). This expansive conceptualization certainly gives the reader pause. It also begs the question, however: what is sacrificed by lumping such diverse practices into a single category? Does tagging them all with the “bullying” label mask important differences in the etiologies and prospects for their mitigation?"
"5","In any case, Bully Nation is a thought‐provoking text that invites readers to reflect on the structural forces that drive individuals to engage in bullying behaviors and highlights the need for further, and more systematic, research on the development of bullying in the social media age, the rising tide of anti‐bullying activism, and the effectiveness of the anti‐bullying measures that have been enacted in recent years.
