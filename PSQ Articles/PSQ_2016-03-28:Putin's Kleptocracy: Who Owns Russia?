"1","Karen Dawisha has compiled the most comprehensive catalog imaginable of criminal allegations against Russian president Vladimir Putin: his purported embezzlement of state funds, use of violence against political enemies, and links to organized crime. She cites sources in English, Russian, Spanish, and German (including Russian material that disappeared from the Internet, now reposted on her Web site at Miami University of Ohio), as well as archival documents and her own personal interviews. Its comprehensiveness alone makes the book an invaluable resource for scholars, journalists, and the general public."
"2","Her narrative also provides potential answers to some nagging puzzles about Putin's rise to power. How did Putin gain a key position in reformist St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy Sobchak's office in 1990, when his work as a midlevel KGB officer in East Germany ended following German reunification? We read in a footnote (p. 178) that Sobchak's assistant at the time, Yuriy Shutov, “alleged that Putin had used kompromat [compromising personal information] against Sobchak” to accomplish this.         "
"3","Dawisha similarly sheds light on another conundrum: how did the demoralized KGB of 1991—whose leaders spearheaded a failed putsch against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and then faced such fragmentation and underfunding that many employees were reduced to moonlighting as security guards—reemerge a decade later with its personnel occupying the most powerful and lucrative positions in the country? The book argues that Putin and his cronies managed this by stealing money from the Soviet Communist Party and the city of St. Petersburg, hiding it abroad, cutting deals with international crime gangs, and using other dirty tricks of their trade."
"4","Dawisha painstakingly explicates each claim she includes. The sheer volume of collaborating material is so overwhelming that it adds credence to her arguments. But the book has one major weakness: Dawisha does not consider alternative explanations for the accusations made against Putin. Cambridge University Press infamously declined to publish Dawisha's manuscript due to concerns over British libel law. Any university press could equally have been concerned that the one‐sided nature of Dawisha's arguments makes the book a bit unscholarly."
"5","As the book was picked up by one of New York's largest publishing houses, Dawisha is undoubtedly crying all the way to the bank (as the entertainer Liberace once said of himself, in response to his critics). Yet the book's weakness is important because Dawisha's narrative actually does provide a potential counterexplanation that she neglects. She portrays Putin and his friends as the winners in a long‐standing factional battle waged within Russia's security services, noting, for example, the pitched competition between Putin and the late Yevgeniy Primakov (at one time director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service; p. 186)."
"6","What if some of the accusations against Putin are false kompromat, with “evidence” invented and planted by Putin's political enemies who want to undermine him or get revenge? In one obvious example, throughout the book Dawisha cites claims made by the late Boris Berezovsky (a media oligarch who ran afoul of Putin), even though she notes that a British court “characterized him as someone who regards ‘truth as a transitory, flexible concept’” (p. 154). Beyond this one example, all evidence, no matter the source, needs to be challenged by opposing interpretations in order to be truly convincing.         "
"7","Putin's Kleptocracy is nevertheless a good read, and it is an indispensable contribution to the growing literature on Putin—especially if the reader (as Dawisha urges should be done with Berezovsky's testimony) takes it with a grain of salt.         "
