"1","This book provides a very welcome contribution to the literature on bargaining within military alliances. In The Supply Side of Security, Tongfi Kim presents a market theory of alliances in international politics and makes a compelling case that alliances are not only responses to threat but also means of exchange. In this view, the price that states pay for obtaining security is a function of supply and demand, and states may choose to rely on another country to provide some or all of their security in exchange for other goods—including but not limited to basing access and economic compensation. Kim focuses on two factors that he argues can explain significant variation in bargaining leverage between allies: the distribution of power in the international system (polarity) and the domestic politics of allied partners.         "
"2","Kim challenges conventional wisdom and argues that bipolarity puts great powers at a disadvantage in bargaining with weaker states. In bipolar systems with two great powers, the leading states do not have the ability to ally with other great powers as they do in multipolar systems with many poles, and thus they have little choice but to seek weaker states as partners. Moreover, unlike in unipolar systems with only one great power, bipoles still have a competitor who can also supply security. Thus, when making commitments, bipoles have less freedom in choosing whom they ally with and cannot impose as many conditions on their protection. Kim supports these propositions using statistical tests showing that alliances during the Cold War lasted longer and were less likely to be abrogated than those in multipolar systems. Similarly, he shows that the United States formed fewer new alliances during the post–Cold War era than during the Cold War and that these alliances have carried both fewer risks for the United States—in the form of clearly defined obligations and foreign‐deployed troops—and more costs for allies in the form of compensation for U.S. bases and support for U.S. military operations."
"3","As for domestic politics, Kim argues that when alliance cooperation is costly for a state's leader, that state's ally will have to make more concessions in exchange for cooperation. Leaders facing strong opposition to the alliance can use their domestic audiences as a means of threatening abandonment in exchange for concessions, while leaders who are personally skeptical of the alliance can use the possibility of abandonment to the same end. However, if a pro‐alliance leader's hold on power is secure, then the ally has less incentive to make concessions than if the pro‐alliance leader's hold on power is tenuous, as in the latter circumstance concessions may be the only way of propping up the pro‐alliance leader and currying favor with potential successors. As evidence for these propositions, Kim conducts case studies of three U.S. allies: Japan, South Korea, and Spain, selected for the significant variation they display on the independent variables. The case studies are brief but compelling and shed light on the ways in which domestic politics influence alliance bargaining."
"4","One aspect of the argument that could benefit from further discussion regards the matter of which great powers can be considered credible security providers. Kim argues that the Soviet Union represented an alternative security provider for U.S. allies during the Cold War and that China may become one in the coming decades. However, it is unclear to what extent the market analogy applies when the potential provider is in fact the country that threatens the allies in question. In such cases, alliance with the threatening great power could be considered capitulation rather than an exchange of security."
"5","Kim's book is a significant contribution to scholarly understanding of intra‐alliance dynamics and one that is likely to prove quite useful for future researchers."
