"1","RAISE THE SUBJECT OF TAIWAN WITH ANYONE from the People's Republic of China (PRC)—whether the person is a government official or an ordinary citizen—and you will probably get a vehement and passionate articulation of China's sovereign claim to the island. But Taiwan is not just an emotional hot‐button issue in China; rather, it is considered the PRC's most sensitive security issue."
"2","Indeed, Beijing views Taipei as a major rival, or at least as posing a serious security threat. Certainly there are other political entities that China sees as rivals—the United States and Japan come swiftly to mind. It is easy to understand at a glance why Beijing would perceive Washington and Tokyo as rivals—in terms of the magnitude of the economic and military clout of each, as well as the geographic and demographic size of the United States and Japan. In contrast, to the casual observer, Taiwan would not seem likely to be perceived by China as a rival. The balance of power across the Taiwan Strait is extremely lopsided in favor of China. While the island is an economic dynamo and global trading power of considerable significance and possesses a credible defense capability, all these are dwarfed by the gargantuan capabilities of its cross‐strait neighbor. Given this glaring asymmetry in the balance of power between China and Taiwan, why would Beijing characterize its relationship with Taipei as a rivalry?"
"3","The answer is that Taiwan is the one issue that goes to the heart of the domestic and international legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to rule China. The CCP claims to be the only group that was capable of unifying China and making it strong enough to stand up to the bullying of Western powers and imperial Japan. Communist propaganda claims that the CCP inspired and engineered a 1945 Chinese victory over Japan in World War II (known in China as the “Anti‐Japanese War” with a start date of 1937). Communist propaganda also asserts that the CCP emerged as victors in the Chinese Civil War in 1949 by soundly defeating the Kuomintang (KMT—also known as the Nationalist Party or Guomindang)."
"4","The existence of Taiwan as an autonomous political entity which is de facto independent of the PRC calls into question these claims. Taiwan was officially annexed by Japan in 1895 and although the Japanese occupation ended in 1945, the PRC has never actually governed or even controlled the island. The CCP victory in China's civil war was not total—and its adversary, the KMT, withdrew to Taiwan to regroup and proclaim the continued existence of the Republic of China (ROC). The ROC was formally established on the mainland in 1912 following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty, and then transplanted to Taiwan in 1949. The ROC has insisted that it is the rightful heir to the first republic and its first president, Sun Yat‐sen. This heroic figure is considered to be the father of modern China by all Chinese, including both the KMT and CCP. For decades after 1949, Beijing waged a diplomatic struggle to replace Taipei as the regime representing China in international organizations and vied to persuade countries to switch recognition from the ROC to the PRC."
"5","Thus, since 1949, Taipei has, in Beijing's eyes, constituted a rival Chinese regime—one that has long claimed to represent the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Since 1971, when the PRC achieved rapprochement with the United States and Beijing supplanted Taipei in China's seat on the United Nations Security Council, the PRC has seemed destined to defeat its rival diplomatically; since 1979, when Beijing adopted a policy of systemic economic reform and opening to the outside world, the PRC has seemed destined to defeat its rival economically; since 1990, when Beijing began to ramp up defense modernization with double‐digit annual growth in defense spending, the PRC has seemed destined to emerge victorious against its rival militarily. And yet, in the face of all of these daunting adverse developments, Taiwan has declined to capitulate or even concede. Taipei continued to survive diplomatically by being pragmatic and resourceful; Taipei thrived economically by becoming a major force in the global trading system and a hub of high technology research and development (while relocating its manufacturing base to the mainland); although Taipei struggled to keep up militarily, in the final analysis, it has relied heavily on its superpower patron, the United States, for both weaponry and security assurances."
"6","Although Taiwan has yet to capitulate formally to China, based on the foregoing discussion of trends, an observer might understandably conclude that the rivalry is now essentially over. It seems that Beijing has won, or, at least, that Taipei has lost. In other words, the game is up—and China ought to be able to declare victory and get beyond Taiwan. In some ways, Beijing is starting to move beyond a focus on Taipei: China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), for example, has started to explore a host of other scenarios, roles, and missions.1 And yet, fundamentally, Beijing cannot get completely beyond Taipei.2"
"7","So why does the China–Taiwan rivalry persist? Because the island's most‐potent weapons of recent decades in its rivalry with the mainland appeared not in the diplomatic, economic, or military spheres, but in the political arena: democratization. The significance of these political armaments cannot be understated and hence can be dubbed Weapons of Mass Democratization.3"
"8","Initiated by President Chiang Ching‐kuo, Chiang Kai‐shek's son and political successor,4 the process of political reform and liberalization eventually led to democratization and the first ever popular vote for national office in Chinese history: the presidential election in Taiwan in 1996, won by the incumbent, KMT candidate, Lee Teng‐hui. Lee was vilified by the PRC as a separatist and accused of being a traitor. Thereafter, quadrennial presidential elections on the island became focal points for Beijing's anxiety about its Taipei rival. Of particular alarm was the candidacy of opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui‐bian. Beijing watched with trepidation as Chen emerged victorious in 2000, because he was widely considered a pro‐independence candidate from a nativist Taiwan party. Everything Chen did was viewed with deep suspicion and presumed to be part of a larger nefarious scheme to move Taiwan further and further down the path of independence. Beijing was also very concerned over Chen's reelection bid in 2004 and what Beijing viewed as a concomitant populist effort to take further steps toward independence.         "
"9","The democratic outcomes in Taiwan are manifestations of the evolution of a distinct cultural and political identity for the inhabitants of the island. The result of the appearance of a Taiwanese identity as distinct from a mainland Chinese one was a game changer. While the cross‐strait rivalry was clearly not new—Beijing and Taipei had been rival regimes since 1949—what had changed by 1995 was the nature of the rivalry. The rivalry had shifted from a contest for control of Chinese territory to a competition for control of China's identity. Here, national identity is defined as “the relationship between nation and state that obtains when the people of that nation identify with the state.”5 In this case, there are two states: the PRC, headquartered in Beijing, and the ROC, headquartered in Taipei. The foregoing definition explicitly identifies the key relationship as being between the people and the state. Implicit is the importance of the nature of this link, specifically the type of political system. Political transformations such as democratization would therefore meaningfully alter the very relationship between people and state, and significantly impact national identity.         "
"10","The change of identity in Taiwan appeared to be sudden. While certainly dramatic, the change was actually evolutionary, taking place gradually in three phases over a period of decades. Lowell Dittmer and Samuel Kim suggest that national identity can have two dimensions. One dimension is the “substantive content with which people identify” and the other is the “act of identification.”6 The former had evolved as a result of Taiwan's political, social, and economic division from the mainland and the island's separate development. The latter dimension—the explicit expression of this different identity—did not become readily apparent until the advent of democratization and open multiparty elections in the 1990s.         "
"11","The first phase of cross‐strait rivalry lasted from 1949 until the 1980s. In this phase, China and Taiwan were formally engaged in a civil war over territory. Although there were hostilities, actual military conflict was largely limited to skirmishes, artillery barrages, and symbolic saber rattling. By late 1950, Beijing had given up on a military seizure of Taiwan, and Taipei gradually lost hope of recapturing the Chinese mainland. Still, the rivalry was ostensibly over territory, inasmuch as each claimed to be the sole legitimate government of one China. The second phase, lasting from the 1980s until the mid‐1990s, was a transitional period in which both sides agreed that the combat phase of the civil war was over. Beijing no longer spoke of “liberating” Taiwan and instead urged “peaceful unification” and promised the island a “high degree of autonomy.” Taipei officially rescinded martial law in 1987 and established a set of mechanisms to manage the growing economic and social cross‐strait interactions with the mainland."
"12","However, neither side would concede defeat or display a willingness to negotiate a peaceful resolution. During this period, both Beijing and Taipei still more or less agreed that the issue was one of a divided nation; however, the two sides differed on how to resolve the matter. Nevertheless, as David Kang notes, the CCP and KMT had each held political power on one side of the Taiwan Strait for decades and maintained “similar goals: both parties wanted to rule all of China.”7"
"13","The third phase witnessed the biggest change in the rivalry as the contest switched from territory to identity. The change was due to an identity shift in Taiwan “[w]hile China's conception of itself remains roughly the same … .” The act of identification was most visible in the process of Taiwan's democratization. Taiwanese leaders articulated a new vision of Taiwan that was at odds with the Chinese identity espoused by the PRC's communist rulers. Taipei saw itself as a democratic pioneer, in contrast to the foot‐dragging dictatorial Beijing regime. Beijing, meanwhile, viewed the change of identity articulated in Taipei as a direct challenge to the PRC's Chinese identity. For Beijing, the change meant that Taiwan was openly espousing and pursuing separatism, putting it in direct conflict with the PRC's national unity project. This challenge was one that the CCP could not ignore. “When two nations have competing national identities,” observes Kang, “the solutions are either imposed though force by one side over the other or require a new conception of identity that allows for compromise.”8"
"14","From the perspective of Beijing, this newly articulated Taipei identity was entirely fabricated by troublemakers such as Lee Teng‐hui, Chen Shui‐bian and other “splittists.” For the vast majority of CCP leaders and Taiwan analysts on the mainland, the possibility that a separate Taiwan identity emerged entirely naturally and would almost certainly have appeared with or without the machinations of Lee or Chen was unfathomable. Of course, these leaders may have accelerated the spread of this identity or manipulated it to serve their own political ends; however, this does not mean that the genesis of a distinct Taiwan identity was not a genuine expression of popular sentiment fueled by a set of common experiences. Moreover, Beijing does not seem to have considered that its own rhetoric and actions may have been construed as hostile and threatening by the people of Taiwan and, hence, may have contributed to the growth of an island identity separate from a mainland one. In the final analysis, perhaps a change of identity in Taiwan is considered secondary in importance to the continuity of the PRC's identity as a “divided nation.” Indeed, central to the political legitimacy of the CCP remains its long‐stated commitment to complete the unification of China.9 Since the retrocession of Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999, respectively—loudly trumpeted as momentous events in the annals of Chinese history—Taiwan is the sole remaining separated component of the Chinese nation in Beijing's eyes. Any trends on the island that appear to directly challenge the CCP's schema of Chinese national identity are cause for grave concern.         "
"15","This article examines two political events in Taiwan from the perspective of Beijing. Both events are island‐wide votes: the 1996 presidential election and the 2004 presidential election and referenda. Popular elections were selected because these would seem to test directly the relationship between the nation and the state—or “national identity”—because the act of voting is perhaps the most‐concrete measure of the degree to which a people identify with a state. Each event seemed to challenge directly Beijing's unchanging conception of China's national identity and hence produced a strong reaction from the PRC, insofar as it felt threatened. Indeed, as Suisheng Zhao observes, contemporary Chinese nationalism is most accurately characterized as “state nationalism,” and this nationalism is a central pillar of political legitimacy for the communist party‐state. Taiwan has powerful “symbolic value” within the CCP's conception of national identity, and defending Chinese nationalism is “at the heart of [the] CCP's legitimacy.”10"
"16","And yet, in the first episode, the lead up to the 1996 election escalated into a significant crisis, whereas in the second episode, the lead up to the 2004 election, although it witnessed some cross‐strait tensions, produced no serious crisis. What explains the different outcomes? Several variables seem key to understanding how each episode played out: first, the posture of the rival's superpower patron vis‐à‐vis the rival and China; second, the posture of the rival vis‐à‐vis China and the international community; third, the “balance of rivalry”' between China and Taiwan."
"17","Generally speaking, while Chinese domestic political dynamics are certainly not unimportant, these seem more reactive to external stimuli than to be the impetus for Taiwan policy initiatives. This is not to say that domestic politics do not play a key role in Taiwan policy; rather, the domestic political environment tends to serve as an inhibitor or barrier to progress on Taiwan rather than a catalyst. There is a discernible tendency toward overall policy inertia where Beijing's Taiwan policy is concerned. Because the island is viewed as highly sensitive and a vital national security issue, most leaders and organizations tend to avoid anything but restatements of official policy positions and adhering to officially approved activities vis‐à‐vis Taiwan. Indeed there is a fear that what someone says or does may be construed as appearing soft on Taiwan."
"18","In this sense, every leader is a hardliner on the issue of Taiwan because there are no ‘softliners’ where Taiwan is concerned. As Thomas Christensen observes, every Chinese leader, “must appear tough on Taiwan independence… to protect their current positions against potential rivals within the party, but also … [to defend against] … popular criticism … [of] the government's inability or unwillingness to stand up to foreigners and to Taipei.”11 The existence of this dynamic heightens the prospect of rival outbidding. As a result, Chinese leaders are extraordinarily sensitive to the posture of the United States vis‐à‐vis Taiwan and China and the posture of Taiwan vis‐à‐vis China and the international community. It is in the context of these two variables that Beijing assesses its own position relative to Taipei in what can be called the “balance of rivalry.”12 The balance of rivalry can be assessed on a variety of dimensions involving both hard and soft power. While hard power is clearly important and can be disaggregated into economic and military aspects, soft power, which can be divided into diplomatic and identity elements, may be equally or even more important in tipping a balance of rivalry.         "
"19","Although CCP leaders sincerely hope for a positive‐sum outcome between China and Taiwan, because of the origins and history of cross‐strait relations, they cannot help but assess the evolution of the overall relationship as well as specific events and episodes from a zero‐sum perspective. This translates into a process of constantly trying to assess on balance which side is winning and which side is losing the rivalry."
"20","In the summer of 1995, the private visit of the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng‐hui, to the United States escalated into the most‐serious crisis in the Taiwan Strait in more than three decades.13 The crisis has been extensively analyzed by existing studies (including one by this writer). Therefore, this event is sketched out only briefly here. Deserving of special mention here is that democratization in Taiwan triggered a vigorous process of outbidding between rival political parties on the island. Specifically, the incumbent head of state, Lee Teng‐hui, launched a series of initiatives to demonstrate that the ruling KMT was just as tough if not tougher on the PRC than its domestic political rival, the DPP, and quite adept at waging a campaign of cross‐strait rivalry in the international arena.            "
"21","Since 1993, Taiwan had initiated an annual symbolic effort to re‐enter the United Nations (UN). A handful of UN member countries would sponsor a resolution supporting Taiwan's admission to the organization. The effort was simply a gesture to demonstrate the commitment of Lee's administration to raise the island's international status, since all of the sponsoring countries knew that there was no chance of success; only a dozen or so countries at most would back the resolution and it was absolutely certain that China would exercise its veto if, by some remarkable twist of fate, the effort picked up more votes. The effort was important as a way to defend Taiwan's national identity. In 1994, following similar logic, Lee Teng‐hui undertook an unofficial tour of Southeast Asian countries in what became known as “golf diplomacy.”"
"22","But what really got Beijing's attention was the visa that was granted to Lee by the United States in 1995. For both Beijing and Taipei, the visa signified validation by Washington that Taiwan possessed a national identity of its own. China had reportedly received assurances from the United States that the Bill Clinton administration would not grant a visa to Lee. However, Clinton caved to congressional pressure and issued the visa. Lee came to the United States as a private citizen, not as a foreign head of state. The ostensive purpose was to attend a reunion at his alma mater, Cornell University, where he had received a doctorate in agricultural economics many years earlier. While he did not meet with any officials of the Clinton administration, Lee was received by three sitting U.S. senators and considerable publicity."
"23","What really seemed to raise the ire of Chinese leaders was the June 1995 speech that Lee gave in Ithaca in which he proudly and repeatedly recounted the accomplishments of the “Republic of China on Taiwan.” Significantly, Beijing did not react vehemently toward Taipei until after the Cornell speech.14 The Taiwan leader claimed that the political system on the island had ushered in “the most free and liberal era in Chinese history.” He expressed the hope that “our achievements on Taiwan … [could] help the process of economic liberalization and the cause of democracy in mainland China.” In Beijing's eyes, Lee was directly attacking its national identity by claiming that Taiwan was the authentic representation of China's identity. Moreover, by emphasizing Taiwan's democratization, Lee was introducing the concept of “popular sovereignty.”15 Lee's rhetoric and actions triggered a spirited round of rival outbidding in China. Military elites took the lead in demanding a harsh response by Beijing. After forcing a change of policy toward Taipei, soldiers then seized the limelight by talking in vocal and hawkish terms, clearly outdoing their civilian counterparts in displaying their staunch nationalist credentials to the Chinese people. Thus, China reacted with virulent condemnation and missile tests in the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait in July 1995.            "
"24","China reprised its mid‐1995 saber rattling during the leadup to the presidential election and referenda of March 1996, with additional missile tests and military exercises in the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait. Unbowed, two months later, in May 1996, in his presidential inaugural address in Taipei, Lee Teng‐hui went even further than his Cornell speech 11 months earlier. Lee drew a parallel between the importance of the northern central plain (zhongyuan) in development of a great civilization several millennia earlier and the key role of Taiwan in the contemporary era in revitalizing a moribund national enterprise. Lee made the case that just as the Wei River Valley had served as the cradle of traditional Chinese culture, so the island of Taiwan could serve as the “new central plain” (xin zhongyuan) or cradle of a modern Chinese revival. This vision turned Taiwan from the periphery of Beijing's contemporary Chinese national identity to its very core.16"
"25","The declaration of this new Taiwanese identity directly challenged the PRC's identity. Arguably, Lee was not advocating independence for Taiwan; rather, he was championing China's national unity. It is possible that Beijing “misperceived” Lee's rhetoric when it condemned him as a “separatist”; it is also possible that that Lee's pro‐unification rhetoric was all too well understood. Whatever the truth, the upshot was the same: a direct assault on the national identity espoused by the CCP. If the Taiwanese leader was advocating independence for the island, this flew in the face of Beijing's national unification project; if instead, Lee was calling for the unity of all Chinese, he was directly assailing the CCP's version of one China with a different one. If the latter reality was grasped by CCP leaders, then so too was a realization that the balance of rivalry was being decisively tipped in Taiwan's favor. Indeed, this would mean that the PRC had lost control, with the terms of national unification shifting from Beijing's to Taipei's terms. Indeed, even if this had been understood by senior communist leaders it would certainly not have been to their advantage to openly admit that the nature of the rivalry over national identity had qualitatively changed. It would be much simpler and less dangerous to assail Lee Teng‐hui as a ‘splittist.’17"
"26","Lee won the 23 March 1996 presidential election with a clear majority of the votes cast. Fifty‐four percent of the voters selected the victorious KMT candidate. The remaining ballots were split among several opposition candidates, with the DPP candidate garnishing only 21 percent of the votes. While the result was no cause for celebration in Beijing, the result was something that CCP leaders could live with, at least grudgingly."
"27","The impending presidential election and referenda in March 2004 raised tensions in the Taiwan Strait, but these tensions did not escalate into a crisis.18 Vital in contributing to the lessening of tensions was the dramatic back‐pedalling of a publicly stated position by President George W. Bush regarding U.S. support for Taiwan. With President Chen Shui‐bian of Taiwan widely viewed both in Washington and Beijing as a troublemaker, the U.S. President moved from making a declaration in April 2001 on live network television that the United States would do “whatever it takes” to defend Taiwan, to announcing in a joint Washington press conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in December 2003—two and a half years later—that the United States opposed “unilateral change” in the Taiwan Strait. Bush pointedly singled out for criticism, “comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan … [which] indicate that he may be willingly … unilaterally to change the status quo … .”19"
"28","Hence, Beijing deemed the posture of the rival's superpower patron pro‐status quo in the Taiwan Strait. In fact, relations between Washington and Taipei seem quite strained. As a result, the PRC seemed relatively confident that the United States was not encouraging or orchestrating Chen's reelection campaign or referenda initiatives."
"29","Meanwhile, Beijing monitored events in Taiwan very closely. Already deeply distrustful of Chen Shui‐bian, Chinese leaders viewed an August 2002 speech by the Taiwan leader as “confirmation” that his goal was to engineer the island's full independence. Addressing the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations, Chen declared that there was “one country on either side” of the Taiwan Strait.20 What was especially troubling for Beijing were Chen's efforts to make referenda a permanent part of the island's political infrastructure. As Shelley Rigger notes, “the concept of a referendum—in which the people of Taiwan directly determine their fate—suggests a level of sovereignty that Chinese leaders are reluctant to concede.”21 This initiative, which gained momentum in early and mid 2003, seemed to have less to do with any clear‐cut design to move the island closer to de jure independence and more to do with political maneuvering by Chen to improve his electoral prospects in March 2004. Nevertheless, Chen's rival outbidding on Taiwan provoked anger and alarm in China. Three issues were especially popular candidates for referenda: Taiwanese participation in the World Health Organization (opposed by China), the fate of the island's fourth nuclear power station, and the size of the legislature. These specific issues themselves did not distress Beijing, and the CCP leadership was more alarmed about the possibility of a referendum being held to ratify a new constitution. CCP leaders viewed constitutional reform—suggested as a referendum topic in September 2003—as particularly worrisome because in their eyes, it signified a serious step toward independence. But Beijing's nightmare scenario was undoubtedly the specter of a vote on the very question of independence being put directly to the people of Taiwan.22"
"30","The possibility of a plebiscite to accompany the presidential election scheduled for March 2004 seemed to have been averted in November 2003, when opposition legislators ensured that the Legislative Yuan passed a law approving referenda but requiring time‐consuming preparation. However, there was one loophole by which these onerous steps could be circumvented—in a crisis situation, if Taiwan's sovereignty was deemed to be under threat. Chen quickly declared that the hundreds of missiles deployed by the PLA across the Strait targeting Taiwan constituted a threat to the island's sovereignty. On this basis, Chen announced that he would set referenda concomitant with the presidential election scheduled for March 2004."
"31","On 20 March 2004, the people of Taiwan were asked to vote on two issues. The first question asked whether Taiwan should “acquire more advanced anti‐missile weapons” if China persisted in threatening Taiwan with ballistic missiles. The second question asked whether the island should negotiate with China to produce a “stable and peaceful framework” for interactions across the Taiwan Strait. Both questions were overwhelmingly approved by more than 90 percent of the votes cast. However, thanks to a boycott organized by the KMT and its allies, the referenda results were ruled invalid because neither of the two questions was voted upon by at least 50 percent of the eligible electorate. While it might be tempting to label the outbidding enterprise a failure or fiasco for Chen and the DPP, this conclusion would be a mistake. Chen did win re‐election for another four‐year term as Taiwan's president and the enabling legislation and precedent for referenda were firmly in place.23"
"32","Assessing the posture of the United States and Taiwan relative to that of China meant that from Beijing's perspective, the “balance of rivalry” was less daunting and dangerous than it had been eight years earlier. Although CCP leaders did not trust Chen Shui‐bian, they were more confident that the efforts of the Taiwanese leader could be managed and contained. Because the United States appeared to distance itself from Taiwan, the flurry of activity on the island did not elicit another round of outbidding in China. The experience of the 2000 election—which witnessed the first victory of Chen Shui‐bian—had enabled Beijing to put developments in better context and not overreact the way it had in 1995–1996."
"33","What about the balance of rivalry? Were there any drastic changes in the cross‐strait balance between the two episodes? Let us examine the dimensions of hard and soft power on both sides. As far as economic and military power are concerned, there were not real dramatic changes to alter the balance significantly. In both areas, China continued to retain the decisive edge. Hard power trends unmistakably reflected China's seemingly inexorable global rise, which appeared destined to further outpace Taiwan's hard power. Moreover, economically, China and Taiwan were drawing ever closer together, with the island becoming far more dependent upon the mainland. In contrast, although China continued to see its economy becoming increasingly intertwined with that of Taiwan, Beijing's trade and investment patterns were much more diversified than those followed by companies from Taipei.24"
"34","Militarily too, China's growing power was more evident and ominous. Certainly, since the mid‐1960s, when it became a nuclear power, China began to gradually pull away from Taiwan in terms of military power. Although the island did pursue its own nuclear program, the United States pressured Taipei to close it down. Starting in the 1990s, China began to pull ahead more militarily, with a concentrated buildup in ballistic missiles deployed across the Taiwan Strait in an effort to intimidate the island. The cross‐strait balance in military manpower and submarines—to take two other examples—remained more or less constant between the two episodes. In 1995, the PLA reportedly had 2.93 million men and women in their armed forces, whereas the Taiwanese military had an estimated 376,000 personnel. By 2003, numbers on both sides of the Strait had fallen, but the overall balance remained relatively unchanged: 2.25 million soldiers in the PLA, whereas Taiwan had downsized its manpower to 290,000. In terms of submarines, the balance also favored China, and this only increased during the same period. In both episodes, Taiwan possessed 4 submarines, whereas the number of submarines in China's Navy reportedly rose from 52 in 1995 to 69 in 2003.25"
"35","What about the balance of soft power? If one examines diplomacy and political development, a somewhat different picture emerges. In terms of the number of states extending full diplomatic recognition to each side, China clearly dominated Taiwan, and there was no change in the absolute number of states recognizing Taiwan as a country. Twenty‐seven capitals contained an ROC embassy in both 1995 and 2003. In comparison, approximately 170 countries held ambassador‐level ties with the PRC during these same years. But comparing the number of countries visited by each side's head of state in the year preceding the onset of the crisis suggests greater parity between the two sides, at least in 1994. In this year, PRC President Jiang Zemin visited eight countries, whereas ROC President Lee Teng‐hui visited seven states. By contrast, in 2002, the PRC president visited a total of 13 states–more than three times the number visited by the ROC president (just four states) during the same year.26 Indeed, the overseas travels of the ROC president in 1994 got considerable media attention, marking a concerted initiative by Lee to raise Taiwan's international profile. This, of course, was followed in 1995 by the high–profile, much‐coveted trip to the United States.         "
"36","Finally, in terms of the politics of identity, Taiwan's challenge to China rose dramatically with the approach of the first popular election for head of state in a Chinese political system. Moreover, Lee Teng‐hui insisted on emphasizing the historic nature of the event. This was followed by the first victory of an opposition candidate—Chen Shui‐bian—in a presidential election in 2000 and his reelection four years later. The candidate of course also happened to represent a political party strongly identified with seeking Taiwanese independence. The same candidate also engineered the holding of two referenda to be held concurrently with the March 2004 election date. One would expect this to escalate the tensions with China to an even higher level than in 1995–1996. And yet the latter situation did not escalate."
"37","As noted earlier, the key dimension explaining the difference between the outcomes of the two episodes was the disposition of the United States vis‐à‐vis Taiwan and China. Beijing was incensed by several surprise actions by the United States in 1995 and 1996 that seemed to indicate an upgrading of the relationship and increasing level of support by Washington, whereas in 2003 and 2004, the disposition of the United States was seen as cool toward Taiwan or even pro‐China."
"38","What was the mix of internal (domestic politics) and external (interstate politics) stimuli in the dynamics of their rivalry? The primary stimuli in the cross‐strait rivalry—at least in the period examined in this article—are exogenous. It is the posture of the primary patron of Beijing's rival and the posture of its rival vis‐à‐vis the primary patron and the international community that seem to prompt China to react. The endogenous or internal variables seem largely dependent on the exogenous or external variables. Of particular importance to China were the actions of the United States that proved crucial to how Beijing responded in each episode. While the actions of Taiwan were also important they proved secondary to U.S. actions in Chinese thinking."
"39","In the first episode, it was the apparent about‐face of the Clinton administration in issuing Lee Teng‐hui a visa to visit the United States that set into motion a sequence of events that escalated into a full‐blown crisis. Subsequent rhetoric and actions by the Taiwanese leader—notably his speech at Cornell University and his inaugural address, taken together with his earlier moves—that escalated the balance of rivalry in China's eyes. Washington again surprised Beijing in early March of 1996 when the Clinton administration dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to the western Pacific."
"40","And yet the crisis seemed to subside just as suddenly as it had escalated. As the March election passed, China's saber rattling ended and the two U.S. naval flotillas swiftly departed the area. The key reason that the crisis dissipated so quickly was that Beijing judged that Washington's posture vis‐à‐vis Taipei had moderated. When President Jiang Zemin and President Bill Clinton held a summit in New York City in October, the two leaders had a cordial and good natured dialogue. At least the PRC concluded that the crisis had left the United States chastened and more sensitive to China's views on Taiwan. Implicit in this judgment was that this would translate into U.S. pressure on Taiwan to apply the brakes to its forward motion down the road to de jure independence. While this was a highly subjective assessment by Beijing, one lesson for Washington was the high priority that Beijing attached to the issue of Taipei and that this required the United States to monitor far more closely Chinese rhetoric and actions toward the island.27 Thus, in the first episode, although an adjustment of Taiwan's own posture was important, it was perhaps not as decisive as U.S. posture in altering China's assessment of the balance of threat.         "
"41","In the second episode, by late 2003, it was clear that the Bush administration was not in favor of Chen Shui‐bian's activities and at the very least was not aiding or abetting his efforts. This was reassuring to Beijing and increased the likelihood of a moderate reaction by China. Moreover, in the second episode, Taiwan's external initiatives vis‐à‐vis the international community were relatively low profile and quite limited. This was especially in contrast to Taipei's flurry and scope of efforts in the first episode—in the years and months leading up to the March 1996 election."
"42","The very different postures of the rival's patron and the rival itself help explain the different Chinese reaction in each episode. In 1995, China's top leaders were caught off guard when the Clinton administration issued Lee a visa. And President Jiang Zemin and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen looked soft on Taiwan and became vulnerable to rival outbidding. As the foreign minister later remarked, “I was assured a visa would not be issued. Imagine what I thought and what was thought of me when the visa was granted.” Military leaders led the charge in demanding a forceful response. The result was civilian leaders hardening their stance to get in line with the hawkish soldiers.28 By contrast, in 2003, China's top leaders, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, felt relatively secure because the public and private stances of the Bush administration vis‐à‐vis Taiwan were clear and the actions of Taipei beyond the island were limited. While incomplete leadership transitions in Beijing characterized both episodes, political rivalry emerged only during the first. Once again, while Taiwan's own disposition was not unimportant to China, of at least equal if not greater importance was the disposition of the United States.         "
"43","As noted earlier, domestic politics was a predominant influence, in the sense that it significantly constrained Chinese policy on Taiwan. This tended to put Beijing in a reactive mode, responding to external stimuli rather than being proactive. The one exception to this tendency was that a new paramount leader was permitted some latitude in putting his personal stamp on Taiwan policy by launching a new initiative early in his tenure. However, these initiatives tended to be relatively modest, and incremental in nature (with the exception of Deng Xiaoping's innovative “peaceful reunification” policy under the “one country, two systems” principle promoted in the early 1980s)."
"44","But when internal politics did play a strong role—in response to external triggers—the effect tended to lead to an escalation of rivalry hostilities. In both cases, the process of leadership succession was incomplete. In 1995–1996, Jiang Zemin was still cementing his position as China's paramount leader; in 2003–2004, Hu Jintao was still establishing himself as China's top ruler. To explain the different outcomes, one must look to the second external level and the disposition of Taiwan's superpower patron. In the former case, Washington's perceived sudden warming to Taipei blind‐sided Beijing; by contrast, in the latter case, Washington's posture was viewed as in near‐complete accord with that of Beijing. The result was problems in the 1990s for Jiang but not eight years later for Hu. Domestic dynamics played a key role in the first episode because there was intra‐elite division over the situation. By contrast, there was swift elite solidarity in the second episode. As a result, there was an intrusion of domestic politics that led to escalation only in the first episode."
"45","Taiwan figures prominently in terms of China's national identity and remains a central irritant in U.S.–China relations.29 Beijing considers Taiwan a domestic matter for two reasons: first, because this is considered China's internal affair; and second, because the island is an issue that the Chinese people feel very strongly about and expect the ruling CCP to vigorously defend.         "
"46","The island remains the only territory claimed by Beijing that maintains its independence from the PRC in the twenty‐first century. Governed by an authentic Chinese power structure with its own military capabilities, Taiwan possesses an ocean buffer sufficient to provide the island with options that were unavailable to Hong Kong and Macao.30 Moreover, the island possesses a trump card: a superpower patron offering security assurances. Taiwan also figures in the enhancement of China's stature internationally, because the island is considered a constant thorn in its side. In Beijing's thinking, by competing with China for the diplomatic recognition of small states in the Third World and pressing for entry into organizations from the United Nations to the World Health Organization, Taiwan subjects China to repeated embarrassment. These are constant reminders of the challenge Taipei makes to Beijing's yet‐to be‐fully‐realized national identity project. Moreover, if Taiwan seizes the path of de jure independence and the PRC is not seen to do a successful job of thwarting the move, then CCP leaders fear they will endure the full wrath of the Chinese people—widespread unrest or worse.         "
"47","But it is the posture of the United States vis‐à‐vis Taiwan that figures most prominently in mainland China's rivalry with island China. Washington's rhetoric and actions directly impact the cross‐strait balance of rivalry in both hard‐ and soft‐power dimensions. In terms of the hard power, U.S. arms sales and security assurances work to counter‐balance China's on‐going military buildup. And in terms of the soft‐power part of the equation, the words and deeds of prominent Americans, along with U.S. diplomatic verbiage and initiatives, matter greatly to the PRC. Such moves out of Washington are viewed as lending considerable credence to Taipei's aspirations for national identity and/or directly assailing or at least undermining Beijing's own national identity project."
"48","As we approach the mid‐point of the second decade of the twenty‐first century, cross‐strait relations are the best they have been in many years. Yet the underlying rivalry has submerged, not disappeared. Taiwan's presidential election in March 2008 saw victory for the KMT candidate, Ma Ying‐jeou, and Chen Shui‐bian left office two months later. Ma then won reelection in January 2012. Meanwhile, on the mainland, Xi Jinping replaced Hu Jintao as general secretary of the CCP in November 2012, and then formally became president of the PRC in March 2013. China's succession was relatively smooth and orderly but by no means open or democratic. This predictable and managed leadership change in Beijing was in clear contrast with the colorful, raucous, and unpredictable three‐way election campaign between major‐party candidate Ma, DPP nominee Tsai Ying‐wen, and third‐party candidate James Soong. In China, Xi had no official challenger. Indeed, his most‐visible competitor in the PRC may have been Bo Xilai, who was not even permitted to vie for high office. In fact, Bo was considered a significant threat to China's consensus‐based, stage‐managed elite‐succession model precisely because he acted more like a brash populist politician operating in a democracy than as one of the drab self‐effacing apparatchiks who populate the higher echelons of the CCP. Bo, of course, was purged, ostensibly for official corruption, after being given a high‐profile show trial in August 2012, and was then convicted and sentenced to 22 years behind bars the following month.31"
"49","While relations have at least temporarily stabilized, the rivalry is far from resolved. Ma and the KMT have proved both more adept at managing cross‐strait relations and more palatable to Beijing than their predecessors, but the rivalry persists. Taiwan Strait interactions have expanded greatly and have become more routinized. For example, cross‐flow of people has increased substantially since 2008 with the advent of direct commercial flights between mainland cities and Taiwan. Moreover, the relationship has become more structured through the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, which went into effect in January 2011."
"50","Whether the global diplomatic truce between Beijing and Taipei will continue to hold has become an open question since late 2013. In mid‐November, the President of Gambia announced that his government was severing ambassador‐level ties with Taiwan. This marked the first time since 2008 that a state had broken off diplomatic relations with the island. It is unclear whether China was involved behind the scenes—Beijing has denied this—and, as of this writing, this African state had not established full diplomatic relations with China.32 What is clear is that past switches by small countries from one side of the Taiwan Strait to the other have been prompted by bribes and promises of aid packages—what has been dubbed “check book diplomacy.”33 Gambia's announcement came on the heels of an agreement signed days before between China and Sao Tome and Principe. Under the terms of the agreement, Beijing would establish a trade mission in the small African state 16 years after it had severed ambassador‐level relations, because Sao Tome and Principe established official diplomatic ties with Taipei.34 It remains to be seen whether these developments signal a major change in Taiwan policy by China's new slate of leaders selected at the 18th Party Congress in November 2012.         "
"51","Although China may have emerged victorious in the “balance of rivalry” in the diplomatic, economic, and military arenas, this has not translated into overall victory. This is because the fundamental dynamic of rivalry has been qualitatively changed by democratization and the emergence of a distinctly Taiwanese identity. Dueling national identities have produced a potent rivalry: “[a] … clash between a democratic, capitalist, wealthy, and industrialized Taiwan deciding its own fate versus an authoritarian, quasi‐capitalist, semi‐traditional China attempting to control the fate of Taiwan.”35 Popular elections have transformed Taiwan from authoritarian afterthought to the cutting edge of Chinese democracy. In sum, since the 1990s, Beijing has confronted a cross‐strait rival armed with a potent force: weapons of mass democratization. This soft power arsenal has proved difficult to balance against.*"
