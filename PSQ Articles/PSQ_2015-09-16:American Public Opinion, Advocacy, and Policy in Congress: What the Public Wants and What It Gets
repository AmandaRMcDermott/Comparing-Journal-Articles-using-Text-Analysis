"1","The title of this book sums up what it covers. Paul Burstein addresses the fundamental question of representative democracy: does the public get what it wants from government? He is not the first to do so, but he is the first to do what he does in this book. Burstein identifies a random sample of policy proposals introduced in Congress and then assesses the influence of both public opinion and interest group advocacy on their passage. Do members of Congress represent public opinion when acting on the sample of policy proposals? Do they respond to interest group pressure? Burstein provides surprising answers that challenge the way we think about democracy in America."
"2","It is an empirical book, and the methodology that Burstein employs is its real strength. His approach involves defining and measuring “policy proposals” as distinct from bills, as each proposal can be introduced in different bills, and then sampling from them—that is, he lets public opinion pollsters or interest groups or his own judgment define which proposals he examines. Having produced a sample of 60 policy proposals, Burstein turns to the effects of public opinion and, especially, interest group advocacy on the advancement of those proposals."
"3","Burstein identifies polls corresponding to each policy proposal. There is not a precise matching in each case, as there is not a poll on each particular proposal. Burstein finds that this is true mostly in areas that the public considers to be nonsalient. It is important, he argues, because it implies a certain bias in studies of policy responsiveness—that is, results of analyses relying only on those areas in which we have polls exaggerate the representational relationship."
"4","So how do the polls relate to congressional action? Burstein finds that there is consistency between the two in half of the cases for which he has polls. Of course, these results all pertain to the 60 percent of proposals for which we have polls; for the remaining 40 percent, we just do not have indicators of public preferences and so cannot assess consistency. Considered as a percentage of all proposals—those with and without public opinion polls—consistency is predictably lower, about 33 percent overall. The public still matters based on Burstein's analysis, just not as much as we might think a priori and even based on previous research on issues for which we have polls."
"5","Do interest groups fill the gap? Burstein focuses on advocacy by “interest organizations”—their public expressions of support and opposition for policies. He finds that there is no advocacy at all on more than half of the proposals, and more than half of all advocacy was on but a handful (3) of proposals. Interest groups just do not show up for most of the proposals Congress considers."
"6","Burstein also examines what happens when groups do advocate and finds that they have little impact on what Congress does. Indeed, none of the various types of advocacy undertaken influences the progress of proposals or their ultimate enactment.         "
"7","Public advocacy and lobbying are not the only means of interest group influence, of course, and Burstein also considers the influence of information in the policy process. His reasoning harkens to Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones's work in The Politics of Information. For the analysis, Burstein focuses on committee hearings and finds that interest organizations are active in this part of the process, although not dominant. Burstein also finds that testimony—both in support and against—has effects on policy enactment. Not all testimony matters, however. In a result that will surprise some scholars in the area, and in other areas of political science, attempts to prime and reframe issues have no effect on what happens to policy proposals. Arguments about the effectiveness of proposals does matter, and in both directions—that a proposal will have the intended effect and also that a proposal will not.         "
"8","In the end, the book solidifies the growing understanding that public opinion does not influence policy on many issues (and does not do so completely even when it does have influence). The book also supports other research that provides a strong challenge to conventional wisdom about the role of interest groups in American politics. Burstein reflects on his findings and their implications in the concluding chapter. If the public has little influence in American politics because they simply do not have opinions on many things government does and because interest groups just do not participate on most policies, do we still have representative democracy? Or is it, as Burstein suggests, democracy reconsidered?"
