"1","For a self‐avowedly forward‐looking society, always bounding toward the next big thing, we Americans spend a lot of time lost in gauzy nostalgia. Recently, though, perhaps prompted by the seething 2016 campaign, recurrent controversies over Confederate memorials, or the most basic observations about the criminal justice system, thoughtful observers are reexamining national myths to properly see the importance of race in American history. In the end, we find that the nostalgic gauze has not just been filtering the light—it has been covering a wound."
"2","In this spirit, Paul Frymer's excellent new book interrogates our most enduring myth—the “Taming of the West”—and in its place delivers a rich analysis of how U.S. leaders decided which territories and peoples would be included in the American civilizational project. His account puts original insights about space and race (rather than liberty, democracy, or even capitalism) at the center of our national story."
"3","Rather than spontaneous, individualistic, and inevitable, U.S. expansion into the “open space” was meticulously regulated by officials who were very worried about security. Without many formal resources, wary of conflicts with other powers on the periphery, and fearful of domestic slave rebellions, officials strategically concentrated white settlers to demographically overwhelm other local populations. Such patterns did not emerge naturally. Rather, national institutions shaped settlement, constraining it in bursts so that newly occupied territories could achieve majority whiteness before the next area opened. This strategy was employed repeatedly at both the micro and macro levels throughout the nineteenth century. Like a savvy player in a real‐life game of Risk, government actors sought to consolidate incremental settlement gains rather than allow settlers to autonomously diffuse across the region."
"4","The technique and motives behind this process are illustrated historically in the positive cases (instances when areas were brought into the Union) and given persuasive causal weight in the negative cases (when areas were not incorporated or faced considerable delay). Mexico (south of the Rio Grande), Cuba, the putative state of Sequoya, nineteenth‐century New Mexico, and Hawaii: all were considered as possibilities for incorporation and rejected because they were not white enough. In this light, the long‐deferred incorporation of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia to this day are not exceptional—this is how the United States has consistently operated at the moment of statehood.         "
"5","Through these accounts, Frymer demonstrates that these strategic government actors—from frontline officials to our most respected statesmen—were constantly thinking about the racial character of the nation, and they were nearly all white supremacists of limited humanist imagination. Frymer has previously written about the racial paradoxes of political parties, law, and organized labor. Here, he cuts even closer to the core of Americanism and finds even more tensions. Contra a common Manichaean understanding of American racial politics, this era was not principally characterized by a sectional contest between liberal egalitarians and an aberrant slave power; rather, it was a constantly shifting debate between different versions of white supremacy. Perhaps projecting their own vices onto others, policymakers were convinced of the impossibility of peaceful interracial coexistence, and they pursued projects we would almost certainly call ethnic cleansing today. For decades, even Abraham Lincoln and many other abolitionists publicly preferred mass deportation of African Americans to integration and appropriated significant federal money to the project. In the end, these men's palpable racial nationalism may have limited American global imperialist aspirations as much as it inspired them."
"6","It is a good sign when a history forces reconsideration of the past and resonates with the present. To that end, what might we learn from this study about the place of the United States in our current historical moment? The book's title references the explicitly imperial ambitions of the nation's founding generations, especially Thomas Jefferson's famous “Empire of Liberty.” Frymer's story is one of American racial history, but perhaps we learn just as much from reading it alongside those of nineteenth‐century contemporaries in land grabbing (say, Britain, France, Russia, Brazil, and Australia) and nation building (Germany, Italy, and France again). U.S. expansion was like these, but also distinctive. Indeed, the very process of political incorporation that gives Frymer leverage to see how central race was in American expansion also demonstrates American exceptionalism: Jefferson and his inheritors were trying to simultaneously build a republic, a nation, and an empire, albeit only for whites.         "
"7","While Frymer's narrative of weaponized demography can help us make a certain kind of sense of the far‐right's chorus of “Blood and Soil!” (illustrating a continuity in racist political thought), the very shock the contemporary reader might feel at the frank racism of Frymer's sources reveals a real (if partial, contested, and never assured) transformation of American national identity. Frymer might argue that midcentury liberals who identified a civic creed of democracy and rights as the core unifying principles of a culturally diverse nation were empirically historically wrong, but they were certainly persuasive. The immigration reforms and civil rights advances of the 1960s have indeed changed America forever."
"8","Jefferson's panic about emancipation proved unfounded, and his dream of an all‐white nation is dead: there are nonwhite majorities in our two largest states, and there are probably more nonwhite Americans today than there were nineteenth‐century Americans in total. The more pressing question today seems to be how well whites can adjust to sharing democratic power in the twenty‐first‐century American empire."
