"1","Moving beyond party politics, Seth Dowland articulates the recurring importance of family politics in the American political arena. While many who study the Christian right start with its more obvious rise in the 1970s, Dowland looks back to the history of values in American politics and the ownership of family values rhetoric by the Christian right starting in the 1960s. The main premise of the book is that while individual issues come and go from the political arena, family values have become (p. 9) and remain (p. 228) an important component of American politics."
"2","In order to make this case, the book is broken down into a discussion of the political issues facing three broad areas of the family for conservative Christians (p. 17): children, mothers, and fathers. Enrollment in private Protestant schools more than doubled from 1970 to 1980 (p. 23). Christians were unhappy about Engel v. Vitaleem (1962), but they were equally unhappy about forced busing, the lack of respect for authority, and the general sense that secularism had invaded America's schools. Thus, Christian schools (Chapter 1) and homeschooling (Chapter 3) became prominent ways for those among the Christian right to fight against a shifting culture. Christians also fought against textbook changes that were deemed un‐American. A growing disdain for experts (p. 63), coupled with rhetorical strategies making those who were not entirely in agreement with the Christian right out to be liberals (p. 57), paved the way for long battles over what was in textbooks for public school children across the nation (p. 58).         "
"3","The second section of Dowland's book focuses on the role of women in the family values movement. Ironically, given its salience in electoral politics among the Christian right today, abortion is one issue that evangelical leaders were ambivalent on for much of the 1970s (pp. 119–122). Dowland then moves on to gender roles through a discussion of the Equal Rights Amendment and gay rights. Finally, Family Values looks at the increased role of evangelicals in the military as well as defending a muscular foreign policy in the 1980s (p. 194), and he concludes with a discussion of the mostly apolitical Promise Keepers movement in the 1990s.         "
"4","Dowland's work elucidates the underbelly of the Christian right movement and clarifies the importance of many topics to this group, but a weakness of this book, for a political science audience, is the book's lack of overt connection to politics or political science research. For instance, Dowland's discussion of the Equal Rights Amendment places emphasis on its failure on the Christian right, when Jane Mansbridge's Why We Lost the ERA points to a more complicated picture. Another example is the final chapter on Promise Keepers. This group rose quickly to prominence in the 1990s among evangelical Christians, but, as Dowland states, the Promise Keepers movement was intentionally apolitical (p. 209) and took positions that challenged conservative orthodoxy on race relations (p. 216).         "
"5","One may also argue that Family Values has too strong of a focus on leaders in the Christian right movement, with very little connection to how this impacted mainstream evangelicals and conservative Christians in the United States. For a movement that is largely anti‐intellectual (if one buys Mark Noll's thesis in The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind), this book focuses almost exclusively on elite leaders of the Christian right.         "
"6","Even with these two minor critiques, this is a very useful addition to our understanding of the Christian right in American politics. For those with minimal background knowledge of this movement, this book can help expand understanding and aid in the creation of testable hypotheses, but it also provides great case studies for those with a deeper knowledge of the Christian right."
