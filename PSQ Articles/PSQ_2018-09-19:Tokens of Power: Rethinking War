"1","Ann Hironaka explores why states choose to fight in spite of an international history so riddled with costly military disasters. The title of the book, Tokens of Power, gets at one possible answer—that the material elements of war are secondary to the symbolic value of victory and the high international status that victory can provide. Much of the analysis in the book points to another answer: that decision makers are routinely duped by the belief that war provides an accurate measure of relative power and that they can therefore learn lessons from the past in order to become more powerful and invincible in the future. The book attempts to weave these two seemingly disparate answers together by arguing that the pursuit of status, which so often takes the form of military competition, arises because power and the meaning of war are ambiguous.         "
"2","This book joins a number of recent works on the topic that argue that the extreme costs of war are often outweighed by the value states place on being assigned a higher position within the status hierarchy. Hironaka argues, like Scott Sagan, Lilach Gilady, and Barry O'Neill before her, that states often pursue material objects, such as nuclear weapons and aircraft carriers, not for their strategic value but because these material factors are markers of the status a state seeks to hold. In these arguments, the book does not exactly break new ground."
"3","It is with its description of the ambiguity of war and power that the book's argument becomes, as Hironaka suggests, more “radical.” While past accounts of war have accepted that war can be messy and error‐prone, Hironaka goes farther, arguing that the pursuit of military historians to learn from past wars is essentially futile. In her telling, victory in war represents a flip of a coin, arrived at just as likely through luck and favorable environmental conditions as through any military cunning the victors might possess. Past success is rarely a solid predictor of future victory. Yet states continually attempt to learn something from these military outcomes in the hope that they will optimize their chances in the future."
"4","Why do states not recognize that their efforts to learn from the past are in vain? This is where the book attempts to draw connections with status arguments. Hironaka suggests that decision makers rely on the past in part because they are socially constructed to do so. States pursue the strategy or the technology—nuclear weapons, for instance—they believe to be responsible for the most recent great‐power victory because that is what states that identify as great powers do. Similarly, states attempt to defeat great powers in war because such acts offer a surefire path to great‐power identity. The book leaves the exact nature of this relationship between the ambiguity of power and war and the status ambitions of states somewhat vague. In some places, it is described as almost causal, with states turning to status competition because it is impossible to define an objective hierarchy based on relative power. In such a case, the need for hierarchy would appear to be almost innate. In other places, the relationship is described as more epiphenomenal, with great‐power status competition emerging as only one possible form of international order.         "
"5","Regardless of this ambiguity, the book highlights an important and relatively unexplored relationship between the ambiguity of power and status competition. Moreover, it provokes further discussion about what lessons can be learned, if any, from war."
