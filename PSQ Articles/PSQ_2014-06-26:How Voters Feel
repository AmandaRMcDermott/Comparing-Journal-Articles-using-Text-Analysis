"1","Stephen Coleman offers a thoughtful examination of the subjective narratives offered by the people he speaks with as they ponder the act and meaning of voting. The interviews reveal the complexities that people encounter when they confront moving into the civic realm of politics. Coleman is adept at the art of listening and gently probing as he explores how the people who live in and around a northern British city understand themselves. These extensive interviews reveal much about the subjective meaning of the experience of voting. His perceptive observations as he talks politics with his chosen array of people in Britain reveal the many ways in which the act of voting is, as he puts it, simultaneously the expression of ideals, the manifestation of ritual and of routine, and, finally of pathology. He is especially deft at noting the various ways in which hierarchy permeates and animates sensibilities that often provide disincentives to securing the egalitarian confidence and security necessary for democratic contestation. His interviewees include many found in a diverse population: people young and old, male, female, privileged and liminal, experienced and novice in the realm of politics, well‐off and poor, among many other differences. How Voters Feel is a worthy and valuable addition to the literature on voting and on democratic life.         "
"2","Interest in how the public understands their role in civic affairs is not new. This book stands apart from the efforts by many scholars, ancient and modern, that cast doubt on the ability of the public to participate in the sovereign exercise of authority. Along with others, Coleman advances a contrary tradition. Much as did William Gamson in Talking Politics, Coleman examines how people account for themselves and finds support for his conclusion that democracy requires a foundation of cultural as well as institutional practices that enable people by giving them the expectation and secure confidence that civic actions are honored and available to one and all. Moreover, he persuasively argues that such engagement, in addition to requiring a manifest array of sustaining cultural and institutional practices, must generate an array of sensibilities that enable allegiance to the civic whole, that sustain partisan engagement to secure and protect, as well as those experiences that sustain the many “micro” elements of political speech and action (think here Ervin Goffman's corpus). Much as does Hugh Duncan in his too‐little‐attended Communication and Social Order, Coleman presents social actions, both assertive and submissive, as governed by the logic of dramatic impulses, most importantly including powerful forces that hover over, around, and within each us to secure obedience to their interests. While the logic of modern democratic life is such that it promises an egalitarian domain in which we treat each other as equals, Coleman's research demonstrates that this domain exists alongside domains that are hierarchical in form and function and that infuse subjective sensibilities of deference and submission.

"3","As rich as the material of subjective self‐report is, there are, as with all research strategies, limitations. Two are worth noting. First, careful examination of the those selected for interviews, while serving as useful exemplars, gives little insight as to whether they represent many or but few. Second, one of the most interesting trends in political psychology is the systematic scientific examination of brain processes that are influential on judgment and action but that are not evident in subjective states. Notwithstanding those cautions, How Voters Feel adds considerable insight, and I recommend it to all who have an interest in the civic life of democratic publics.         "
