"1","One of the most‐prominent sinologists in the United States has written an important book on the global impact of China's rise. This first‐person account draws upon interviews with senior officials and leading scholars in China and around the world. The author not only spent considerable time inside China but also made research trips to countries in almost every part of the globe except Africa and the Middle East. The result is what David Shambaugh calls a “horizontal” analysis that surveys six dimensions of China's global activity: perceptual, diplomatic, economic, cultural, security, as well as China's involvement in global governance. Each is addressed in thematic chapters, and collectively, they provide a highly readable and comprehensive snapshot of China's engagement with the rest of the world in the early twenty‐first Century."
"2","David Shambaugh sensibly argues that Beijing is not a full‐blown superpower but a “partial” one. “China,” he writes, “is a global actor without (yet) being a true global power (p. 8).” His findings will probably surprise the general reader who has heard the hype that China has already become a superpower and is on the brink of overtaking the United States to become the world's most‐dominant power. The reality, Shambaugh argues, is quite different: China only exercises “global influence” in select areas, including trade, energy and commodity markets, international tourism, luxury goods consumption, and cyber hacking (p. 8).         "
"3","But Shambaugh's findings will come as no surprise to many China specialists. Indeed, his findings are consistent with a number of other recent studies, including one co‐authored by this reviewer (Andrew J. Nathan and Andrew Scobell, China's Search for Security, Columbia University Press, 2012). Nevertheless, China Goes Global is a valuable complement to the array of recent books that chronicle and analyze China's rise. Shambaugh's measured and pithy assessments, combined with numerous anecdotes and quotes, provide a wealth of insights. For example, the author astutely observes that the United States and China do not seem to cooperate on world issues. Sometimes the two countries “bump up against each other” and at other times they may work toward the same goal but usually “in parallel” rather than in cooperation (pp. 75–76).         "
"4","Shambaugh concludes that China is essentially a regional power deeply preoccupied with internal problems. Indeed, despite Beijing's noteworthy global presence, it remains overwhelmingly absorbed with domestic affairs and focused on its own Asia‐Pacific neighborhood. Of course, this is also a key finding of several other studies, including China's Search for Security. Nevertheless, Shambaugh's assessment goes beyond existing analyses by providing additional evidence and insights. “China does not lead” in international diplomacy or other realms (p. 45), according to the author. Moreover, Beijing is rarely proactive on matters of global governance. Invariably China follows or free‐rides.         "
"5","Perhaps China's greatest contribution to global governance, according to Shambaugh, could turn out to be addressing its problems on the home front. A China in disarray or delinquent in resolving daunting domestic problems—environmental pollution and cybercrime to name two—is dire news for the world. If Beijing performs well on this more‐modest but still important stage, then China can be considered a responsible member of the community of nations. In short, China going global could simply mean getting it right at home."
