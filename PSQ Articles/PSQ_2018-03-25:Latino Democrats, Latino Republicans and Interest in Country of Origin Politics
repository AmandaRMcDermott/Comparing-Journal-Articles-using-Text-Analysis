"1","WHY ARE SOME DIASPORANS, but not others, interested in their country of origin politics?1 This question, which has important implications for transnational politics, immigrant integration, and political dynamics in the United States, is increasingly relevant. Political transnationalism encompasses cross‐border voting and campaigning, diaspora lobbying on behalf of the country of origin, or protesting injustices committed there.2 Diasporans can promote economic development in their country of origin3 and are sometimes blamed for contributing to violent conflict in their country of origin.4 Diaspora groups can impact their country of origin culture and society5; they can attempt to promote political changes in their country of origin or affect its foreign policy.6"
"2","National governments have responded with institutional reforms, such as the granting of dual citizenship rights and/or absentee voting rights.7 In particular, Mexico, Colombia, and other Latin American countries have sought to encourage remittances and promote economic development and/or have granted voting rights to citizens living abroad.8 DeSipio et al. find that between 10 percent and 15 percent of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Salvadoran, and Dominican immigrants reported voting in country of origin elections and that small but noteworthy percentages had been contacted by a country of origin representative to become involved in home country political and cultural affairs.9"
"3","Our analysis focuses on a crucial political linkage for these activities: the extent to which diasporans remain cognitively engaged with country of origin politics. Individuals who are not interested in their country of origin politics are unlikely to vote in country of origin elections or to participate in country of origin politics. For example, Escobar, Arana, and McCann show that interest in Colombian politics is a key determinant increasing the likelihood that expatriate Colombians intended to participate in Colombian elections.10 Indeed, political interest is the pivotal mediator of participatory acts of all kinds.11 We examine why some U.S. Latinos12 but not others maintain an interest in their country of origin politics. We argue that partisan identities adopted in the United States shape cognitive engagement by immigrants and their descendants with politics in their country of origin. Specifically, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to maintain an interest in country of origin politics. What matters is not only whether immigrants and immigrant‐origin individuals integrate in the United States and adopt an identification based on U.S. politics but also how they integrate and which identification they adopt. We build on the literature that argues that partisanship affects not only American domestic politics but also foreign policy views.13 We expand this approach in arguing that partisanship also shapes interest in domestic politics abroad in one's country of origin.         "
"4","While we argue that adopting a Republican identity tends to reduce interest in country of origin politics in general, additional insight can be gained by further disaggregating political transnationalism. Political transnationalism and diaspora politics can involve diasporans participating in country of origin elections or seeking to contribute to cooperative bilateral ties between their country of origin and their country of residence. Political transnationalism can also involve diasporans opposing an authoritarian regime in their country of origin or lobbying their country of residence to impose sanctions on the country of origin. Some instances of the latter form of transnationalism (a notable example is lobbying by Cuban American groups for U.S. sanctions on communist Cuba) may be consistent with a Republican partisan identity.14"
"5","Thomas Faist argues that most definitions of the term “diaspora” incorporate three characteristics: migration or dispersal, cross‐border experiences with the homeland, and “some sort of cultural distinctiveness of the diaspora vis‐à‐vis other groups.”15 A crucial element of what constitutes being a member of a diaspora is having an interest in the country of origin, highlighting the importance of why some individuals maintain that interest while others do not. We do not expect that all immigrant or immigrant‐origin individuals identify as diasporans or engage in transnationalism;16 for example, an American of Mexican origin does not necessarily identify with and maintain an interest in Mexico. We empirically examine why some potential diasporans but not others are interested in their country of origin politics. The study of second‐generation transnationalism is generating a rapidly growing literature.17 Our analysis complements these studies because we focus on nonimmigrants as well as the foreign born. Questions such as who should be considered a diasporan, and how long after emigration we should expect diasporic attachments to last, can be more easily addressed by considering data on long‐term destination country residents as well as on recent and other immigrants.         "
"6","Questions of immigrant integration and transnational ties are politically salient in many immigrant‐receiving countries.18 Scholars debate the impact of immigration and ethnic diversity on social welfare programs and on social trust and political engagement levels,19 as well as what immigrant integration or assimilation should entail.20 Baron points out that diasporans sometimes face accusations of dual loyalties that are perceived as a potential security threat.21"
"7","In the next section, we present our argument in more detail. In the third section, we situate our argument in the literature. In the fourth section, we describe our data set and indicators. The fifth section includes statistical analyses results. The final section concludes."
"8","In making our argument, we build on the literature on public opinion on foreign policy. Almond and Lippmann argue that public opinion does not have a significant impact on foreign policy.22 This view is challenged by Page and Shapiro, who argue that a rational public forms opinions about foreign policy by evaluating foreign policy events.23 For example, the public is less likely to support wars that lead to a high number of casualties.24 In contrast, Berinsky claims that international developments matter, but that the way in which the public interprets them is shaped by partisanship.25 Partisan leaders take positions on international developments, while partisan identifiers use those positions as cues in forming their own foreign policy preferences. Berinsky argues that partisan differences shaped Americans’ views of World War II and other wars.26 Moreover, differences between partisan elites sharpened considerably in the early 1980s27 and accelerated following the end of the Cold War.28"
"9","Our argument is related to Berinsky's in that we claim that partisan cleavages in the United States have international implications.29 However, we argue that in addition to influencing the views of Americans on war and foreign policy, partisanship shapes the level of interest by Americans in domestic politics in other countries—in particular, their country of origin. The extent to which diasporans are involved in country of origin politics is not random and incoherent, nor is it only a function of developments in those countries. It is also shaped by how partisan elites in the United States view immigrant integration and American national identity (that is, the extent to which such conceptions embrace multiculturalism and dual identities). We argue that interest in country of origin politics is a function of the type of partisan identity, Democrat or Republican, that individuals adopt in the United States. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to pay attention to country of origin politics.         "
"10","It is important to point out that we can think of partisanship as a continuum rather than a dichotomy. Scholars of American politics have examined differences between strong and weak Democrats and Republicans and between individuals in those categories and independents. We follow such an approach and examine the impact of variation on a continuum from strong Democrat to strong Republican rather than treating partisanship as a dichotomous variable."
"11","Partisanship affects interest in country of origin politics because of differences across partisan elites and identifiers regarding two interrelated issues: conceptions of American national identity and immigration and immigrant integration."
"12","Views on policies and norms that directly implicate immigrants in the United States are increasingly polarized. DeSipio points out that the Democratic Party is more likely to take pro‐immigrant positions than the Republican Party.30 On the question of providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, elite‐level debate is sharply partisan. For example, Wallace argues that Republican‐controlled state legislatures are more likely to introduce restrictive bills regarding undocumented immigration (similar to Arizona's SB 1070).31 De la Garza and Yang make similar observations about partisan differences in state‐level immigration policies.32 This partisan clarity is mirrored among the general electorate. Republican identifiers are substantially more likely than Democrats to say that granting legal status would “encourage more to come here illegally,” “be a drain on government services,” “reward illegal behavior,” and “take jobs from U.S. citizens.”33 These sentiments are echoed in policy‐specific opinions as well.34"
"13","More generally, Republicans and Democrats increasingly hold divergent views on cultural integration. Democrats are likely to have a more positive view of the preservation of group identities and interests connected to one's country of origin than Republicans, who are likely to emphasize a more uniform American identity shared across individuals. Between 2002 and 2012, not only did Republicans become more restrictionist in their immigration opinions, they also became far more likely than Democrats to think that immigrants represent a threat to “American customs and values.”35 Democrats are more likely than Republicans to embrace multiculturalism and the maintenance of ties by individuals to multiple countries as opposed to having one national identity.         "
"14","We expect that because of these differences regarding how American national identity should be conceived and regarding immigrant integration, a Latino U.S. citizen who adopts a Democratic identification will be more likely than a Republican counterpart to maintain an interest in ancestral country politics. We do not claim that partisanship is the only factor that shapes attitudes toward American national identity or toward political transnationalism; other factors, such as individual‐level variation (for example, in education) or country of origin attributes (for example, democratic or authoritarian) should also be accounted for. However, we expect that partisanship is an important determinant of political transnationalism."
"15","In a large country with a two‐party system, both parties represent broad camps incorporating a variety of positions and interests. This fact helps address direction of causation issues. We argue that becoming a Republican tends to decrease interest in home country politics. Could it instead be the case that interest in home country politics decreases the likelihood that one will become a Republican? That is unlikely because there are many other bases for Latinos’ partisan choices: opinions on abortion, school vouchers, affirmative action, and government health insurance, among others.36 It is highly unlikely that a large percentage of Latinos choose their partisanship based on whether they are interested in their country of origin politics. Furthermore, we will show that partisanship only affects interest in country of origin politics. Essentially nonpolitical engagement, such as visiting the country of origin, is unaffected by partisanship. Thus, the effect of partisanship is confined to political transnationalism; it does not significantly shape nonpolitical orientations and behaviors toward the country of origin.         "
"16","How do Latinos in the United States choose whether to identify with Democrats or with Republicans? Although not a great deal is known about Latino Americans’ opinions on U.S. foreign policy,37 other research has identified several variables that shape such decisions: the county of origin's regime type,38 level of Latino group identity,39 and immigrants’ (notably, Mexican immigrants to the United States) pre‐emigration ideological and partisan attachments.40 Cain, Kiewiet, and Uhlaner find Fiorina's model41 especially applicable to the acquisition and strengthening of partisanship among Latinos: second‐ and third‐generation Latinos are more strongly partisan than first‐generation counterparts. Parental transmission of partisanship is weaker (or nonexistent) for immigrants.42 Thus, political experiences play a more prominent role.43"
"17","Cain, Kiewiet, and Uhlaner's model is supported by research showing that bases of partisanship that are important among Anglos—notably, income44—play a less significant role in shaping party identification among Latinos.45 Given that political experiences with the parties are more important for Latinos than for non‐Latino whites, and given the more multiculturalist stance of Democrats and the less multiculturalist stance of Republicans, it is plausible that, all else being equal, Democratic Latinos will be more open to transnational politics than Republican Latinos.         "
"18","The sociological literature defines assimilation as “the erosion of differences between groups, between the majority population and minorities, and between immigrants and the native born individuals.”46 We emphasize that embracing a partisan identity defined by U.S. politics is an important element of integration. We extend the debate between classical assimilationist and other views, described later, by arguing that what shapes political transnationalism is not only whether individuals adopt an identification associated with American politics but also which identification (Democrat or Republican) they adopt.         "
"19","The classical assimilationist argument assumes that people have only one national identity and views the country of origin identity and the destination country identity as substitutes. According to this perspective, immigrants who assimilate necessarily leave their country of origin identity behind. The classical assimilationist argument predicts that interest in country of origin politics declines with assimilation.47 In particular, from an assimilationist perspective, one would expect interest in country of origin politics to decline with an increase in the extent to which immigrants use English rather than Spanish,48 with time spent in the United States, and with an increase in the extent to which they pay attention to U.S. politics.         "
"20","A related argument views political transnationalism as a tool used primarily by the disadvantaged and the marginalized. In this view, immigrants who are marginalized in the destination country are more likely to turn their interest toward country of origin politics than immigrants who are well integrated and economically successful in the country of origin.49 This argument predicts that as acculturation to the destination country increases and as income and education increase, interest in home country politics declines.50"
"21","Alternatively, classical theories of political participation assert that political participation tends to rise with increases in social status, access to resources, and/or in the level of education.51 This prediction is the opposite of that described in the foregoing paragraph: interest in country of origin politics and interest in destination country politics should both increase with education.52 According to this perspective, involvement in country of origin politics and involvement in destination country politics are complements, not substitutes.53"
"22","In the analysis that follows, we complement and inform this growing scholarship. We argue that, while it matters whether immigrant and immigrant‐origin populations are integrated, it also matters how they are integrated. More specifically, and in the context of U.S. politics, it matters whether Latinos embrace Republican or Democrat partisanship.         "
"23","Attributes of the country of origin, such as regime type, can affect political participation or preferences of immigrants.54 Country of origin policy choices, for example, in terms of diaspora engagement, could matter as well. Finally, interest in country of origin politics may be a consequence of individual experiences prior to migration or of individual‐level variation in nonpolitical engagement with the country of origin. In their study of Mexican emigrants to the United States, Waldinger, Soehl, and Lim find that emigrants who were involved in political activity in Mexico before emigrating are more likely to pay attention to Mexican politics once they are based in the United States.55 Migration from Central America to the United States has partly been driven by conflict (for example, the Contra War in Nicaragua),56 which may influence how migrants from Central America view their country of origin politics.         "
"24","There is variation across Latin American countries in terms of diaspora engagement. Colombia has actively sought to reach out to its diaspora, for example, by reserving some of the seats in the legislature for expatriates. Meanwhile, Mexico has allowed voting by absentee ballots by Mexicans based abroad.57 On the other hand, Smith argues that while Mexican migrants have had successes in becoming a part of Mexico's political community, “steps have also been taken to control and limit the influence of these measures of inclusion.”58 As some Latin American countries have gone further than others in encouraging political transnationalism by their diaspora, this may shape the extent to which communities with different national origins participate in ancestral country politics.         "
"25","What about the role of personal ties to the country of origin, for example, maintaining contact with relatives there? Plausibly, individuals who maintain such personal ties may be more likely to maintain or develop an interest in country of origin politics than individuals who do not have such contacts. This perspective provides an alternative to our claim that political transnationalism is driven by a political logic that is to an important extent independent of nonpolitical ties to the country of origin."
"26","Technological change and the advent of the internet may facilitate transnational politics.59 Geographic proximity may also facilitate political transnationalism. In the U.S. context, individuals who reside in a state that borders Mexico may be more likely to maintain an interest in destination country politics than individuals who reside further away from Mexico and other Latin American countries.         "
"27","Our data are drawn from the 2012 American National Election Study (ANES).60 The 2012 ANES included an oversample of 875 U.S. citizen Latinos61 age 18 or older.62 U.S. Latinos are a large and diverse population; that diversity is advantageous in constructing research that studies transnational politics.         "
"28","The Latino community consists of immigrants (that is, the foreign born) as well as individuals whose families have resided in the United States for generations. This variation allows us to examine whether and how political transnationalism differs across immigrants and nonimmigrants. Including U.S. citizens in the analysis serves to complement the existing literature, which focuses on foreign‐born (and in some cases only noncitizen) populations. The 2012 ANES includes foreign‐born and native‐born individuals, allowing us to extend the scope of the analysis."
"29","While the ANES data set contains a wealth of information and allows us to analyze some of the most recent available data, it also has relevant limitations. As mentioned earlier, the sample consists only of U.S. citizens. Therefore, we cannot explore differences, for example, between naturalized and non‐naturalized, or documented and undocumented, immigrants. Future research should address such questions, as well as continue to study diaspora transnationalism among non‐Latinos and in contexts other than the United States."
"30","The Latino community is also diverse in terms of national origin (for example, Cuban, Mexican, and so forth). This variation allows us to test whether and how variation in national origin affects transnationalism. For the majority of the respondents (55 percent), the country of origin is Mexico; Puerto Ricans and Cubans account for about 13 percent and 6 percent of the sample, respectively.63 About 30 percent of the respondents are foreign born. Nearly three‐quarters (74 percent) of the sample, including some of the native born, have at least one foreign‐born grandparent. In terms of our key independent variable, partisanship, about 59 percent of the respondents identify with the Democrats, about 21 percent identify with the Republicans, and about 19 percent describe themselves as independents (descriptive statistics for all variables used in the analysis can be found in the appendix).         "
"31","Our key dependent variable is a four‐value ordinal based on the response to the following survey question: “How much attention would you say you pay to politics in [your ancestral country]?” The response options were “none at all,” “a little,” “some,” and “a lot.” We also analyze an additional dependent variable, a seven‐value ordinal that measures frequency of visits to the country of origin (return visits), our main indicator of nonpolitical engagement with country of origin.64"
"32","The independent variable we emphasize is party identification. It includes five categories that range from strong Democrat to strong Republican.65 As we point out earlier, we can think of partisanship as a continuum, and differences, for example, between strong and weak Democrats may matter in addition to differences between Democrats and Republicans.         "
"33","As described in the appendix, we use responses to the ANES question, “Which Hispanic group are you?” to create dummies measuring whether respondents self‐identify as “Puerto Rican,”66 “Cuban” (including “Cuban‐American”), or “Mexican” (including “Mexican‐American” and “Chicano”).67 The omitted category consists of Latinos with “other” backgrounds.         "
"34","We use four indicators of integration. First, a Latino linked‐fate variable measures pan‐ethnic group identity.68 Second, we measure the extent to which respondents use Spanish (versus English) in their daily lives. Third, a dummy variable captures whether the respondent was born outside of the United States. Finally, we include a dummy variable for whether an individual has at least one foreign‐born grandparent. Individuals with no foreign‐born grandparents are the ones whose families have resided in the United States the longest.69 Also, we control for the extent to which respondents maintain “contact with family and friends” in their ancestral countries.         "
"35","An additive scale measures interest in U.S. politics. The scale is based on how often the respondent pays attention to “what's going on in government and politics” and the respondent's level of interest in “the campaign so far this year.” Following Zaller's work on the role of cognitive engagement, a simple fact‐based four‐item scale measures knowledge of U.S. politics.70 A dummy variable measures whether respondents “connect to the internet from home.”         "
"36","Our models control for background demographics: income, educational attainment, age, and sex. Finally, a dummy variable measures residency in a border state (California, Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas). Respondents in states closer to Latin America might be more likely to visit their home countries (and perhaps attend to country of origin politics as well)."
"37","We examine the determinants of attention to country of origin politics by performing an ordinal probit analysis. Table 1 displays the results.         "
"38","The results indicate that as the extent to which a respondent identifies with the Republican Party increases, the extent to which he or she pays attention to country of origin politics decreases (–.135, z =–2.06). This result is statistically significant and consistent with the argument proposed in this article. Moreover, this effect is robust, persisting with the inclusion of other significant predictors.         "
"39","The results also indicate that the passage of time and generational changes, in and of themselves, do not significantly weaken diasporic attachments (at least in terms of differences between first generation immigrants and their immediate descendants); Tamaki finds a similar pattern regarding Latino transnationalism.71 Interest in country of origin politics is higher among immigrants than among nonimmigrants, but this result is not statistically significant. There is also no statistically significant difference between the individuals whose families have resided in the United States the longest (that is, no foreign‐born grandparents) and other individuals in terms of interest in country of origin politics. These results may indicate that, among Latinos, diasporic attachments can last longer than the conventional wisdom would assume and that their relevance may extend beyond recently arrived immigrants and individuals with immediate immigrant backgrounds.72"
"40","Among other predictors, education is strongly and positively associated with higher levels of interest in country of origin politics. This pattern is consistent with the predictions of classical theories of political participation and inconsistent with the idea that transnational politics is the realm of the marginalized. Meanwhile, the relationship between income and attention to country of origin politics is weak: higher‐income individuals are about equally likely to follow country of origin politics as lower‐income individuals."
"41","The results strongly indicate that those with higher levels of cognitive engagement with U.S. politics are more likely to pay attention to politics in their countries of origin as well. This finding is consistent with DeSipio's analysis.73 The coefficients on the interest and knowledge covariates are strong, suggesting that engagement with U.S. politics and attention to country of origin politics are complements and not substitutes. This pattern fits the predictions of classical theories of political participation, but it does not fit the predictions of classical assimilationist theories.         "
"42","Classical assimilationist predictions fare somewhat better in terms of being consistent with the language usage effect (.221, significant beyond .01). Individuals who tend to use Spanish rather than English are more likely to be interested in home country politics than individuals who tend to use English rather than Spanish. Thus, assimilation in the sense of relying on the dominant language in the country of residence rather than the dominant language in the country of origin is associated with a lower level of attention to country of origin politics. Meanwhile, pan‐ethnic group identity is not significantly related to the likelihood of paying attention to country of origin politics."
"43","Latinos who have contact with family and friends are substantially more likely to also follow ancestral country politics. This coefficient (.484) returns the strongest z‐statistic in the model (z = 7.49). Yet, after taking this effect into account, partisanship maintains a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable.         "
"44","The internet finding runs counter to the conventional wisdom: individuals with internet access at home are less likely to be interested in country of origin politics. This variable might capture generational effects as older individuals may be less likely to use the internet."
"45","Bueker argues that Cuban Americans tend to have high voter turnout rates in part because of the strength of ethnic Cuban networks and organizations.74 Our findings suggest that these networks foster increased interest in the domestic politics of Cuba (.780, significant beyond the .01 level). Furthermore, this finding may indicate that future research could productively disaggregate political transnationalism and examine how partisanship may affect its different forms. For example, a Republican identification may be consistent with political activism that seeks to sanction an authoritarian country of origin. Table 1 reports a significant positive effect among Mexican Americans75 as well (.324).         "
"46","In sum, controlling for the effects of several variables that inform the scholarship on assimilation and political participation—language usage, interest in U.S. politics, internet access, and education—party identification emerges as a key element in the story. Furthermore, an additional analysis indicates that partisanship's effect, as our argument suggests, is specific to political transnationalism and does not lead to a general lack of engagement with country of origin."
"47","Table 2 displays the ordinal probit results that were obtained by regressing frequency of country of origin visits on the same array of independent variables used in the first analysis.         "
"48","With the sole exception of a strong link between contacts with family and friends and the dependent variable, the patterns of effects in the two models are quite different. Unlike the relationship between partisanship and political transnationalism, the propensity for return visits is not significantly related to party identification. To be sure, the effect is again negative—Republicans are less likely to visit the country of origin than Democrats—but the coefficient (–.055) is weak and the effect is not statistically significant. This supports the thesis that stronger identification with the Republican Party does not lead to a significantly lower general interest in the country of origin or in the well‐being of family and friends at home. The effect seems to be specific to political transnationalism.         "
"49","While the focus of our article is on political transnationalism and a detailed examination of determinants of return visits is beyond its scope, we briefly outline the determinants of return visits. Individuals of Cuban origin are less likely to visit their country of origin. This is not surprising, given that travel restrictions have made it difficult for U.S. citizens to visit Cuba. Border state residents, again not surprisingly, are significantly more likely than non‐border‐state residents to make return visits."
"50","Some patterns regarding determinants of return visits are consistent with prior research. For example, Tamaki studies data on visits to the country of origin by Latino and Asian individuals in the United States. She finds that for Latinos, generational status (first or second generation in the United States) does not strongly affect the likelihood of return visits and that individuals of Cuban origin are relatively unlikely to visit Cuba.76 Our analysis also supports Tamaki's finding that English language proficiency is not a key determinant of return visits77—we find that individuals who tend to speak Spanish rather than English are not more likely to engage in such visits.         "
"51","Our other findings are less consistent with prior research. For example, Tamaki finds that Latinos’ propensity for return visits is less affected by variation in access to material resources than is the propensity for return visits of individuals of Asian origin.78 She explains this by pointing to the geographic proximity to the United States of many countries in Latin America. Similarly, Foner discusses continuous immigration and relatively cheap air travel as factors that may encourage second generation transnationalism among U.S. Latinos.79 Our analysis, by contrast, shows that income has a significantly positive effect on the likelihood of return visits. Future research should examine these patterns further; in this article, our focus is primarily on political transnationalism.         "
"52","Just how different are paying attention to country of origin politics and return visits? Those with stronger Democratic partisanship, greater interest in and knowledge of U.S. politics, and higher levels of education are more likely to follow country of origin politics. None of those variables strongly affects the likelihood of return visits. Party identification, in particular, shows no statistically meaningful relationship with return visits.80"
"53","Indeed, it is the specific, not general, effect of party identification that has been our focus in this article. Table 3 demonstrates the distinct effect of partisanship on political transnationalism and its weaker, insignificant effect on return visits. Table 3's columns display, across values of party identification, the probability of paying no attention to home country politics and the probability of never visiting the country of origin (the modal categories of each dependent variable). Probabilities were calculated at the mean values of all other independent variables in Table 1 and Table 2. All else being equal, there is a probability of .379 that strong Democrats do not pay any attention to country of origin politics. This probability increases in increments of about .05, reaching .592 among strong Republicans. Across the range of party identification, the probability increases by .213. Contrast this effect with the much weaker marginal changes down the column of visits to ancestral country. Here the probabilities rise in smaller increments, from .260 among strong Democrats to .336 for strong Republicans, creating a total effect of only .076.         "
"54","In this article, we show that partisanship shapes political transnationalism. Among Latino U.S. citizens, Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to pay attention to country of origin politics. By contrast, the propensity to visit the country of origin is not significantly affected by partisanship. The effect of partisanship is specific to political transnationalism. Diasporans’ general interest in their ancestral countries, as evidenced by making return visits, is unaffected by party identification. This finding demonstrates that what matters is not only whether an individual is integrated in the country of settlement but how he or she is integrated."
"55","Our findings build and expand on the literature on the public opinion regarding foreign policy. Our findings are consistent with claims that partisanship has international implications.81 Furthermore, we show that the effects of partisanship go beyond influencing foreign policy views; they also influence engagement with domestic politics in other countries, specifically in one's ancestral country of origin. Future research should disaggregate political transnationalism (for example, distinguish between efforts to cooperate with or to sanction the home country government) and examine how the impact of partisanship may consequently vary.         "
"56","Diaspora transnationalism is an increasingly important issue in countries of origin. A number of countries in Latin America and elsewhere have a significant diaspora in the United States, seek to encourage remittances and use those funds to promote economic development, and/or allow their expatriate citizens to vote abroad in country of origin elections. Our findings illustrate that the type of integration (Democrat or Republican identification) in the U.S. political system influences the likelihood that individuals will remain engaged with country of origin politics."
"57","Finally, our results indicate that interest in country of origin and country of residence politics are complements and not substitutes. Therefore, concerns about divided loyalties that, for example, inform some criticism of allowing dual citizenship rights appear to be weakly grounded in evidence. Paying attention to country of origin politics and paying attention to country of residence politics do not appear to constitute a zero‐sum game. We also show that not only does integration matter, but so does the partisan form (Democrat or Republican identification) that integration takes. Understanding integration dynamics and their political implications is an important issue in many countries with immigrant populations.*"
