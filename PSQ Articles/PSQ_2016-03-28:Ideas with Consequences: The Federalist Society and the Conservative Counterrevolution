"1","Since its inception at Yale Law School in 1982, the Federalist Society has become the principal hub for conservative and libertarian legal thought in the United States. Despite its presence in academia, the legal profession, and beyond, there has been surprisingly little scholarly examination of its origins and influence."
"2","Ideas with Consequences sets out to change that. Using rich archival research and interviews with legal elites, Amanda Hollis‐Brusky sheds needed light on the Federalist Society. Her analysis shows how it not only helped organize the conservative legal movement but also affected the language and direction of key judicial decisions. The result is a convincing argument that the ideas formed in the Federalist Society have had, and continue to have, serious consequences.         "
"3","Central to this book is the concept of the “political epistemic network” or “PEN.” The Federalist Society is an ideal PEN in that it is, among other things, composed of like‐minded professionals with a shared vision of political and social life as well as shared beliefs about how to bring about that vision (p. 13). As a PEN, the Federalist Society has successfully affected the development of legal doctrine across a range of issues, with assistance from “signals” from supportive judges (p. 157)."
"4","To guide her study, Hollis‐Brusky presents three themes central to the Federalist Society's vision: the state exists to preserve freedom; the separation of powers is central to the Constitution; and the courts should say what the law is, not what it should be (p. 5). Hollis‐Brusky focuses on gun ownership rights and campaign finance reform to illustrate this first theme. By analyzing several high‐profile U.S. Supreme Court cases, she shows how the Federalist Society subtly crafted preferable legal outcomes on these issues. As for the second theme, Hollis‐Brusky shifts her attention to broader constitutional debates. Here, she emphasizes how the Federalist Society has successfully resurrected legal doctrines once thought dead: a limited reading of the commerce clause and an empowered Tenth Amendment."
"5","Regardless of issue, much of the Federalist Society's work incorporates the argument that courts should not be in the business of rewriting laws or discovering legal rights—instead, they should simply enforce existing constitutional provisions and promises. Hollis‐Brusky argues that the Federalist Society has promoted this in two complementary ways: “first, by carefully selecting, training, and vetting potential judicial nominees, and second, by acting as a vocal and vigilant ‘judicial audience’” (p. 155). This process has encouraged adherence to a specific vision of the Constitution, which has given the Federalist Society significant influence in American law."
"6","Ideas with Consequences is an ambitious yet simple project. It is ambitious in that it explains how an organization has shaped the legal debate at all levels of the American judiciary, using conference presentations and speeches, amicus briefs, judicial opinions, and more to illustrate this idea diffusion. At the same time, though, the book is refreshingly simple in its argument and structure. By organizing around issues and broad themes—and highlighting a handful of cases to illustrate points—the book refrains from getting lost in the complexities of its arguments and the sheer number of sources on which it draws.         "
"7","The Federalist Society boasts tens of thousands of members, including four U.S. Supreme Court justices. But, as Hollis‐Brusky convincingly argues, its greatest strength is more than sheer numbers: it is the ideas its members promulgate. Because of the sustained influence of the Federalist Society on the American legal stage, Ideas with Consequences should be valuable reading for those interested in the past, present, and future of law and politics in the United States.
