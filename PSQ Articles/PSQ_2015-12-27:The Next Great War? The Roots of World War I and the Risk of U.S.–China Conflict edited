"1","To mark the centenary of World War I, an impressive array of distinguished scholars and practitioners have produced an edited volume revisiting the origins of this momentous conflict and drawing implications for the early twenty‐first‐century rise of China. This is a welcome development because a large body of international relations scholarship has emerged from research on the causes of Europe's “Great War.”"
"2","However, this volume is not another presumptive effort to project Europe's past as Asia's future. In fact, the contributors tend to shy away from seeking to identify clear parallels or direct analogies between Europe then and Asia now. There is no attempt, for example, to depict Xi Jinping's China as Wilhelmine Germany, nor is there any effort to cast the current great power rivalry between Washington and Beijing as a latter‐day contest between a London and a Berlin."
"3","Rather, contributions are thoughtfully arranged around three topics. Each grouping reassesses the voluminous scholarship on the causes of World War I and offers a few observations on contemporary East Asia. The first topic is the influence of the international system. A strong theme running through this grouping and many chapters, as Steven E. Miller notes, is the “entrapping” nature of alliances (p. xxi): Germany, for example, was dragged into war by its ally Austria. This worry over weak allies drawing in more powerful patrons has considerable contemporary relevance, as ongoing tensions between China and Japan and frictions between China and the Philippines threaten to escalate and embroil treaty ally the United States. As several contributors note, many observers in early twentieth‐century Europe refused to believe that the great powers of the day would actually go to war. Moreover, if the unthinkable erupted, many anticipated that any ensuing conflict would be short and contained because leaders realized that prolonged major war was not in anyone's interests. Similar dubious conventional wisdoms appear in many assessments of contemporary Asia‐Pacific security."
"4","The second set of essays considers the so‐called Thucydides Trap—a variant of the security dilemma. The judgments of several contributors about the ability of contemporary Asia‐Pacific political elites to avoid the trap that brought war between Athens and Sparta seem excessively optimistic. Is it safe to assume that that twenty‐first‐century leaders will always “think creatively” (Graham Allison, p. 79) or act in an “intelligent” fashion? (David Richards, p. 89)."
"5","The third group of essays explores the impact of domestic political dynamics. The attention to the European political systems on the eve of World War I highlights the disposition of key militaries—notably, those in Germany and Austria. Many generals of the era not only held tremendous sway over civilian leaders but also appeared to view war as an attractive option (assuming victory would be swift). Moreover, early twentieth‐century European armies embraced doctrines that revered offense and presumed that the instigator held the advantage in any conflict. In twenty‐first‐century China, by contrast, according to David Richards (pp. 82, 86), Etel Solingen (p. 142), and Stephen Van Evera (pp. 172–173), People's Liberation Army (PLA) generals are under the tight control of—or synonymous with—the civilian Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Because CCP leaders believe that conflict is bad for business and the PLA does not possess a “cult of the offense” like their European counterpart militaries of a century earlier (Van Evera, p. 149), war might seem extremely unlikely. Nevertheless, this state of affairs is no guarantee of peace, as research on the post–World War II era indicates that invariably it is Chinese statesmen rather than their counterparts in uniform who tend to champion war (interestingly, similar findings hold for the United States)."
"6","Minor quibbles aside, this volume is highly recommended for those who desire a magisterial overview of the road to World War I combined with thoughtful observations about the future trajectory of U.S.–China relations."
