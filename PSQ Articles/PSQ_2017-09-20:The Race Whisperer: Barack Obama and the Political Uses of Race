"1","On 10 January 2017, Barack Obama delivered his farewell address. He defended his record and preached American gospel—as he had come to divine it. The first black president praised individual pursuit of the American dream while stressing the “imperative to strive together” “to achieve a common good, a greater good.” These communitarian impulses also defined his statements on race. He implored minorities to connect their “own very real struggles for justice” to the struggles of others, including “the middle‐aged white guy” who “has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change.” He beseeched whites to recognize that “the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't suddenly vanish in the ‘60s.” Obama exclaimed the power and responsibility of citizenship and the enduring the truth of our creed, which is, in his words, “Yes, we can.”"
"2","Melanye T. Price's The Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race attempts to make sense of this man and his moment. By interrogating the president's speeches, Price hopes to decipher the origins of his racial rhetoric. For her, his biracial personal history allowed him to “strategically employ diverse racial narratives to attach multiple and sometimes divergent groups” (p. 161). Yet the way he framed his story reinforced white predispositions instead of attacking white supremacy. In one illuminating chapter, Price argues that Obama's references to his white grandfather's service in World War II “asked the beneficiaries of the ‘greatest generation” to see him as one of them instead of focusing on . . . his Blackness” (p. 90).         "
"3","Despite several interpretative insights, this text perilously merges normative critiques with descriptive and causal claims. For example, Price insists that, when in front of black audiences, Obama, to curry white favor, highlights “African American cultural pathology” (p. 3). She uses his remarks on the Zimmerman verdict to illustrate this “black blame.” A closer reading of Obama's words, however, exposes more nuanced ruminations. He indicates that young black males are “disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence” while acknowledging the historical roots of these tragedies. Obama also articulates the African American sense that “if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.”"
"4","Contrary to Price, Obama's sociology of race emphasizes both structure and behavior. It also has roots in black political thought. In the 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/CNN survey on race, 42 percent of African Americans cited “lack of motivation and unwillingness to work hard” as a “major” reason for contemporary challenges facing the black community. Thirty‐five percent called this a “minor” reason. Sixty‐one percent of African Americans cited the “breakup of the African American family” as a “major” reason, and 25 percent considered it “minor” reason. Although Price acknowledges these attitudes, she insists that Obama crafted cultural arguments for the benefit of a “white audience.” Yet “white audience” is never treated with analytic rigor. She assumes racial motivations and ignores partisan polarization. Consequently, it is unclear why the president's purported attempts to calm white racial anxieties produced electoral victories for him and more racial division.         "
"5","Ultimately, Price unwisely abstracts Obama's sentiments from an extended parable that consistently underscores, to borrow from W.E.B. Du Bois, the president's “two‐ness—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body.” After reading this book, I am struck not by Machiavellian whispers: I am astounded by an ardent devotion to compromise and a boisterous, evangelical, and perhaps naive belief that contending forces within the body politic could be arbitrated by appealing to our better angels."
