"1","For professors of international relations (IR), the first day's lecture is often devoted to distinguishing between two words that most students use as synonyms—“anarchy” and “chaos.” The former implies nothing more than the absence of a singular, ultimate authority to restrain behavior and enforce the law in relations between countries. But life in anarchy need not be chaotic, and in fact it rarely is—indeed, much of the discipline of international relations is about evincing the stable orders and patterns of behavior that commonly occur in a world of unsupervised, often competing sovereign states."
"2","Randall L. Schweller, one of the leading international relations scholars of his generation, made his reputation advancing IR theory in this tradition. So when he writes a book “about how and why international politics is transforming from a system anchored for hundreds of years in enduring principles, which made it relatively constant and predictable, into something far more erratic, unsettled, and devoid of behavioral regularities” (p. ix), it is more than simply provocative, it demands attention."
"3","The central metaphor of Maxwell's Demon is entropy—of things coming apart. For the young Alvy Singer in Annie Hall, that “the universe is expanding” was an invitation to nihilist despair. Schweller's perspective is nearly as pessimistic, anticipating that the international order will become “disordered, messed up, chaotic and unpredictable” (p. 10), but his enterprise is productive and rewarding. And while the echoes of old arguments about the retreat of the state come to mind, Schweller, with the apostate's trained eye for where the bodies are buried, offers keen insights and builds a strong argument.         "
"4","This is not the first book to observe that power is diffusing away from the United States. The instinct of IR theory in this context is to observe the increasing capability of other states and calculate the implications of the shifting balance of power. Schweller does not set aside such analysis, anticipating that international cooperation will decline as U.S. hegemony erodes. But the larger point of Maxwell's Demon is that the capabilities of states in general—especially of productive capabilities (that is, the ability to build things up as opposed to knock them down), is in secular decline. This suggests a slightly rose‐tinted view of the past—not every conflict was once settled with an exchange of phone calls between superpowers. Despite the fact that blood was often and easily shed, the Cold War order was, ultimately, orderly.         "
"5","Moreover, Schweller argues convincingly that global power is not just diffusing; it is becoming “less usable” (p. 42). As the last decade or so has punishingly illustrated, massive and unchecked American military power was historically unprecedented, but it was not sufficient for the United States to impose its political will on even very weak states. Power and influence have become less tightly linked—and political influence is everything."
"6","Schweller shakes off comfortable distinctions between liberal and realist schools of thought. He easily sides with the former in marking the forces that are driving contemporary world politics, and he embraces without qualification the idea that war between the great powers is unthinkable. But, ever the realist, he explains why those factors and forces are, paradoxically, dangerous. One silver lining of the horrifying great power wars was that they did (eventually) restore stable orders. Now, instability and disequilibria fester unattended. And “new actors—regional and global organizations, local militias, global crime and terrorist networks, nongovernmental organizations, and large corporations—are emerging to compete with states, each exerting a different kind of power” (p. 55). Globalization and instant access to incomprehensible masses of unmediated information further fragments identity politics, as subnational and cross‐national actors shop for their preferred versions of reality, leaving the world less governable still."
"7","Maxwell's Demon pushes its metaphors past the breaking point, and its chapters can seem loosely knit. But Schweller has thrown down the gauntlet at the feet of IR theory, and he has done so with élan.         "
