"1","Environmental regulators must sometimes decide whether to install rules absent full information about either a risk's or a precaution's costs. In Europe, recourse is had to a “precautionary principle” that warrants intervention notwithstanding epistemic gaps. While debate persists about how to formulate the precautionary principle, American scholars have leveled withering criticism of its strong form's incoherence. “Take every precaution,” they argue, is infeasible, even paralyzing, counsel."
"2","Constitutions, Adrian Vermeule notes, are tools for managing risks. Vermeule detects precautionary reasoning across American constitutional thought. He finds it in Chief Justice John Marshall's sweeping repudiation in McCulloch v. Maryland of states' authority to tax federal institutions such as the Bank of the United States. More recently, Vermeule argues, precautionary logic has underwritten narrow construction of the President's recess appointment power. In both cases, government power is constrained based on fear of future abuse. Generalizing, Vermeule suggests that precautionary logic is typically employed to underwrite “narrow construction” (p. 53) of government powers. How often such logic is crucial is, however, unclear. As Vermeule candidly notes, arguments for specific constitutional rules may “appear” precautionary (p. 29), but once judicial rhetoric is scraped away, may rest on more‐nuanced reasoning. McCulloch's reasoning, for example, may have rested on accurate observation of states' aim of strangling the Bank, rather than mere hypothetical worries.         "
"3","Part I of The Constitution of Risk is an exercise in intellectual askesis aimed at expurgating strong forms of precautionary logic from constitutional theory and jurisprudence. No less than in the regulatory context, Vermeule powerfully contends, it makes scant sense to take every precaution, for, as in the regulatory context, risks often arise on all sides. Hence, state abuse of taxation must be weighed against federal overreaching. The risk of presidential abuse of recess appointments must be analyzed alongside the risk that veto‐gates in Congress can be dangerously exploited. Displacing precautionary reasoning, Vermeule proffers a (immodestly labeled) “mature” position (p. 52) of optimizing across all relevant risks.         "
"4","The command “only optimize” is underdetermined for two reasons. First, as Vermeule acknowledges, the vast literature on welfarism and cost‐benefit analysis reveals a bewildering plurality of methods to implement that command; some might even allow some weaker variant of precautionary reasoning. Second, I suspect that many of those critiqued would happily concede Vermeule's point. But they would say that countervailing risks either are outweighed or exculpate themselves (in the case of judges interpreting constitutional text), by pointing to an anterior legal text that prioritizes one risk over others. Recognizing the gap between constitutional drafters and, subsequently, implementers, Vermeule nonetheless is silent on when the former should do the optimizing in a way that produces rules that work asymmetrically over varied risks."
"5","So a need persists for precise identification of the analytic gains from Vermeule's position. On this measure, the book's second part, comprising four case studies, disappoints. It ranges from an exegesis of James Bryce on public opinion in American politics to a consideration of agencies' use of experts. These case studies have an occasional cast. As a result, they cannot cash out Part I's rigorous, finely argued critique."
"6","Toward that goal, a more‐comprehensive topology of precautionary constitutionalism would be useful. This would account for precautionary logics that expand government power in texts such as Federalist 78—which employs Vermuele's mature position to counter precautionary polemics against judicial review—and precautionary logic's recent deployment to expand national security powers. It must be hoped that Vermeule rounds out his worthwhile project by interrogating these phenomena."
