"1","Christina Gerken makes a critical contribution to our knowledge of the debate over immigration reform in the recent past. Her detailed and richly documented analysis of the content and social implications of the debate that led to critical changes to the American immigration system provides the most‐detailed discussion to date of the immigration reform discourse of the mid‐1990s. Through the lens of critical‐race theory and neoliberalism, Gerken analyzes how the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the Personal Responsibility Act, and the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act during the administration of Bill Clinton profoundly reshaped the rights and responsibilities of immigrants in the United States. Gerken argues that, taken together, these three acts ushered in a way of thinking and talking about immigration that differed substantially from previous efforts to exclude certain categories of people. Politicians, the media, and mainstream Americans embraced a new multicultural paradigm that negated the centrality of race, gender, class, and sexuality to social processes and reduced immigration to a cost–benefit analysis. Although the discourse about immigration reform remained on the surface about security, assimilation, and family values, “the driving force behind the 1995–96 immigration reform discourse was a concern about immigrants' economic impact” (p. 4). The United States, like other countries that have espoused neoliberal ideas, reorganized immigration laws in accordance with economic objectives."
"2","For Gerken, the debate over immigration reform in the Clinton years provides a microcosm of the shift of neoliberalism from a purely market ideology to a mainstream social and political philosophy that characterized the 1990s. Within this framework, Gerken demonstrates that politicians successfully rooted their proposals to develop a nationwide immigration system that identified “legal” and “illegal” immigrants with welfare legislation in neoliberal justifications about terrorism, economic security, and family structure. Moreover, in an effort to appear nondiscriminatory, politicians developed an elaborate, abstract way of talking about immigrants without directly addressing the dynamics of race, gender, and sexuality. Rather than openly expressing their anxieties about immigrants' race and gender, politicians contrasted past immigrants' eagerness to assimilate quickly with the unwillingness of contemporary immigrants to fit in and give up their own heritage, religious beliefs, and languages. Ultimately, Gerken contends, the reluctance to discuss openly latent anxieties about immigrants' race, gender, class, and sexuality has proved much more damaging than the rare instances of outright racism."
"3","Although Gerken successfully demonstrates that the ideological underpinnings of the immigration reform discourse changed during the Clinton administration, it is not entirely clear how the immigration reform discourse of the mid‐1990s ushered in a way of thinking about immigration that differed drastically from previous discourses. As the author herself explains, advocates for more‐stringent immigration reform blamed immigrants “as one of the principal causes of the nation's high poverty rate, the increasing costs of social welfare, [and] a decline in traditional values” (p. 2). None of these accusations is new. They represent the catalog of restrictionist attacks from the first efforts to restrict immigration in the nineteenth century to the present. To paraphrase the author, it might be that the way of talking has changed, but it doesn't appear that the way of thinking has. The useful tension that the author sees between neoliberal assumptions and hidden anxieties about race, class, gender, and sexuality complicates rather than supports her central argument."
"4","Despite this criticism, Model Immigrants remains a major contribution to the study of immigration reform in the United States, and Gerken should be applauded for addressing hard questions. Readers will appreciate the straightforward structure, vivid examples, and energetic prose. This book is a must‐read for those interested in the recent developments in American immigration and restriction, the evolution of neoliberalism, and the complexity of American multiculturalism at the turn of the twentieth century.
