"1","After the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to issue a ruling on same‐sex marriage in what would become the Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) decision, there were a number of calls for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg to recuse herself from the case because of previous statements she had made publicly suggesting her sympathy for marriage equality. Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan had also faced calls to remove themselves from the first Affordable Care Act case, NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), although, like Ginsberg, neither agreed to step aside. These widely publicized disputes have resulted in increased public interest in the long‐established judicial principle of recusal, in which a judge removes himself or herself from considering a case because of some actual or perceived conflict of interest.         "
"2","Louis J. Virelli III's new book is therefore timely and addresses a topic that has been all but ignored by political scientists. While the same cannot be said of the legal academy, where one finds a number of important law reviews on the topic, the social science literature on recusals can charitably be described as thin. This oversight is particularly unfortunate given the fertile ground it presents for the consideration of a host of important political, legal, and constitutional questions, as the author ably demonstrates."
"3","Virelli's book begins with a fascinating overview of the history of judicial recusals, a practice that dates back to early Roman and Jewish law and has long been a part of the Anglo‐American tradition. Given the lack of scholarly attention paid to recusal laws and behavior, much of this history was new to me, and it is likely to be so for many other readers. Moving quickly to the American context, the author discusses and interprets a significant line of cases and statutes developing recusal law, demonstrating a keen tension between Congress and the courts over which branch ought to be determinative in requiring when and under what circumstances judges must step aside."
"4","With this set‐up, Chapters 3 and 4 present the bulk of Virelli's argument that the ultimate decision of when recusal is appropriate should be made by the justices of the Supreme Court themselves and not members of Congress. This point is well supported by a thoughtful and very thorough consideration of the powers granted in Articles I and III of the Constitution, as well as much of the relevant case law. Chapter 5 then offers the details of Virelli's proposed standard for justices to determine when recusal is appropriate, based on the values established by the due process clause weighed against relevant First Amendment concerns of free speech. The final two chapters of the book offer some of the author's thoughts regarding how this constitutional approach to recusal decisions can be applied to lower federal and state courts and some of the broader implications that his proposal suggests for separation‐of‐powers issues more generally."
"5","Overall, Virelli presents an excellent overview of the history of recusal law, proposes an interesting solution to the current deadlock between Congress and the courts over the issue, and provides a novel constitutional framework applicable to many other areas of law. Some social scientists and law and courts scholars more accustomed to strict behavioralist approaches to studying the judiciary may be disappointed with the work's lack of a rigorous empirical model, although this is not what Virelli, an attorney by training, has set out to do. What he has done is started a conversation about an important procedure that has vast potential for future study."
