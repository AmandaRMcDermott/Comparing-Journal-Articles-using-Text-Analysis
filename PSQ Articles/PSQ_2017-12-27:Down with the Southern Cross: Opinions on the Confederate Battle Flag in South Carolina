"1","A HORRIFIC MASS SHOOTING IN A BLACK CHURCH in Charleston, South Carolina, became the mobilizing force for taking down the Confederate battle flag from the State House grounds in Columbia. In this article, we chronicle disputes over the Confederate flag in the American South and then turn our attention to the case of South Carolina. Using survey data from the Winthrop Poll (WP), we evaluate the opinions of South Carolinians toward the Confederate flag before and after the Charleston shooting. Before this senseless massacre, our findings show, there was a palpable racial divide in opinions toward the Rebel flag and sharp divisions among whites on the basis of certain demographics and sociopolitical attitudes. After the shooting, our analysis indicates, the Charleston tragedy galvanized opinion, black and white, in favor of taking down the Confederate flag."
"2","On the evening of 17 June 2015, 21‐year‐old Dylann Roof of Eastover, South Carolina, went to the “Holy City” of Charleston to commit an unspeakable tragedy. Around 9:00 p.m., Roof murdered nine black parishioners at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, about an hour after he was welcomed to participate in a Bible study.1 This horrific hate crime was quickly connected to a divisive political issue in South Carolina and other southern states: the Confederate battle flag.2"
"3","As is true in other Deep South states, particularly Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, South Carolina has endured a tumultuous history for flying a Confederate flag on its State House grounds, originally atop the Capitol dome in 1962 in July 2000, the Rebel flag was relocated to fly at a Confederate memorial.3 The Charleston shooting proved a galvanizing political event that swiftly mobilized the forces of opposition to the racially polarizing symbol of the Confederate flag.4 Led by Republican governor Nikki Haley, both chambers of the South Carolina Legislature voted in favor of removing the Confederate flag from the State House grounds (with unanimous Democratic support), and less than a month after the Charleston massacre, on 9 July 2015, the consignment of the Rebel flag to a museum became official.5"
"4","In this article, we make use of surveys administered by the Winthrop Poll for the purpose of gauging South Carolina opinion on the removal of the Confederate flag from the State House grounds in Columbia before and after the shooting. Specifically, we ask, what individual‐level factors explained support for the South Carolina Confederate flag prior to the Charleston tragedy? How did these individual‐level factors change, if at all, following the shooting? This account is perhaps the final chapter in the long‐running saga over the Confederate flag in the Palmetto State. As such, we proceed by discussing previous research on the Confederate flag controversy in the South more generally and then more specifically in the case of South Carolina. Then we narrow our focus to works that have assessed public opinion toward state‐sanctioned flying of the Rebel flag. Next, we discuss our data and methods and then present the results of our analysis of opinions regarding the Confederate flag and its removal in South Carolina. Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion of the significance of this event within the context of southern politics."
"5","For the handful of generations who came on the political scene after the Civil War, both northern and southern politicians were complicit in waving the “bloody shirt,” reminding voters above the Mason‐Dixon Line that the Grand Old Party (GOP) had preserved the Union and that down in Democratic Dixie, the Confederate battle flag symbolized the valiant but lost cause of extricating the South from northern tyranny. At least in the late 1800s, the Confederate flag was primarily associated with the “War Between the States,”6 and it was only tangentially tied to the inescapable fact that the preservation of slavery was the impetus for secession.7 Indeed, the only state‐sanctioned embrace of the Confederate flag occurred in Mississippi, which began flying its version of the Southern Cross in 1894.8"
"6","The renaissance of the Confederate flag took place during the civil rights era, especially after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954. The rebirth of the southern version of the St. Andrew's Cross coincided with the rise of white “massive resistance”9 to black‐led efforts to end the South's oppressive system of Jim Crow segregation.10 For instance, during South Carolina governor Strom Thurmond's insurgent States’ Rights Democratic Party presidential campaign in 1948,11 the Rebel Cross was prominently displayed by his Dixiecrat supporters.12 Indeed, the “strongest icon of ‘the massive resistance’ was the Confederate battle flag.”13"
"7","In 1956, Georgia altered its flag to include a version of the St. Andrew's Cross,14 and in 1962,15 ostensibly as a centennial commemoration of its involvement in the Civil War, South Carolina began flying a Confederate battle flag above the dome of its state capitol.16 Both of these state's actions were met with controversy,17 which only grew stronger as time passed and more recent generations of residents with less tolerance for a divisive symbol spoke out. Partisan change in southern politics became an interesting component of the feud over the Confederate flag. When Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina literally elevated the Rebel flag in the mid‐1950s and early 1960s, the Democratic Party was dominant in state politics. In the absence of viable two‐party competition, the growing number of black Democrats and their co‐racial officeholders lacked the clout to force these state legislatures to take down the Confederate flag.         "
"8","By the 1990s, however, the Republican Party was ascendant in southern electoral politics, and black influence had increased within the ranks of the Democratic opposition.18 In a role reversal, it was now Democrats who became increasingly restless with state sanctioning of the Confederate flag. Perhaps more than any other single opposition group, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) invested heavily in efforts to pressure Deep South states to discard official displays of the Confederate battle emblem. In 1993, a court order in the 1992 ruling in Holmes v. Hunt forced Republican Alabama governor Guy Hunt to remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol building.19 In Mississippi, the NAACP brought a lawsuit in 1993 to take down its version of the Confederate flag because it was a “racist symbol,” but the state supreme court “rejected that argument, holding that the flag ‘does not deprive any citizen of any constitutionally protected right.’”20 Nonetheless, in an interesting twist, the court found that “Mississippi had not possessed an official state flag since 1906” and “[a] governor‐appointed bipartisan commission decided that a state flag referendum would occur on April 17, 2001.”21 Upholding Mississippi's tradition as the most racially divisive state,22 perhaps it was no surprise that 64 percent of Mississippians,23 almost all of whom were white,24 voted to retain their 107‐year‐old Confederate state flag, which still flies today.         "
"9","In Georgia and South Carolina, the most recent and contentious battlegrounds over flying the Rebel Cross, governors engaged the issue at their electoral peril. In these states, it had become clear to Democratic and Republican governors alike that the Confederate flag was bad for business.25 In 1992 and 1993, conservative Democratic governor Zell Miller made a push to have the Georgia flag changed ahead of his state's hosting of the 1994 Super Bowl and the 1996 Olympics.26 The effort failed miserably, and it is thought that taking on the flag issue “reduced . . . [Miller's 1994] reelection margin to 51 percent.”27 Roy Barnes, Miller's Democratic successor, won the 1998 gubernatorial election. Near the end of his term, in the absence of much fanfare, he executed some backroom deals28 to have the legislature approve a new state flag that reduced the former version to one among several flags arrayed below the Georgia state seal.29 Among other things (such as incurring the wrath of teachers with the passage of education reforms), Barnes's leadership in altering the state flag apparently contributed to his defeat in 2002 at the hands of Sonny Perdue,30 the first Republican governor of Georgia since 1872.         "
"10","On the campaign trail, Perdue promised to revisit the flag issue, and after considerable legislative maneuvering, the Georgia General Assembly placed a referendum before the voters for approving a new flag that removed the St. Andrew's Cross.31 Given the choice between the current 2001 flag approved by Governor Barnes and the alternative 2003 flag offered by Governor Perdue, in early March 2004, “voters approved the 2003 flag by a 3‐to‐1 margin.”32 The Confederate flag controversy was finally laid to rest in Georgia, despite a core of “flaggers” who felt that Governor Perdue had betrayed them by offering a new flag that removed the Confederate battle emblem. Indeed, a county‐level analysis reveals strong evidence that an unusual coalition of Georgians most likely secured approval of the 2003 flag: “many supporters of Republican gubernatorial candidate Sonny Perdue joined black and white liberal voters in rejecting the 2001 flag.”33"
"11","In South Carolina, the Confederate flag has considerable meaning. The Civil War began in Charleston, where Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter on 12 April 1861. More recently, the salience of the flag took on heightened interest because of the state's “First in the South” status in Republican presidential primary contests.34 Presumably motivated by the desire to shed the Palmetto State's “Old South” image and cognizant of the need to attract business to the state, in a somewhat surprising move, in November 1996, Republican governor David Beasley pushed for the removal of the Confederate flag from the State House.35 Unfortunately for the governor, Republican legislators were decidedly against such a move and bottled up any proposals intended to take down the flag. As the 1998 gubernatorial election neared, Governor Beasley vowed to never again meddle with the flag issue, but he still lost reelection to his Democratic challenger, Jim Hodges. Under Hodges's tenure, the flag issue became even more heated. It came to the fore when the NAACP called for a tourism boycott in July 1999, which would take effect at the start of 2000 and last until the Confederate flag was removed from the State House grounds.36"
"12","The 2000 Republican presidential primary brought even more attention to the flag controversy as GOP contenders were pressed to weigh in. The combination of interest group pressure and national media attention mobilized enough support to broker a legislative compromise that relocated the Rebel flag from the Capitol dome to a Confederate memorial located within the confines of the State House grounds, where it remained from 1 July 2000 until 9 July 2015. The flag controversy in 2000 demanded the attention of yet another governor, and its salience led the Associated Press to award it the “top South Carolina story of the year.”37 In the 2002 election, Governor Hodges lost reelection to his Republican challenger, Congressman Mark Sanford.         "
"13","The NAACP never accepted the flag compromise—the tourism boycott was to remain in effect until the Confederate flag no longer flew anywhere on the State House grounds. Since the summer of 2000, the presence of the Rebel flag flying at the Confederate memorial continued to simmer and fester opposition. Although it may have been true of the compromise that “[m]ost politicians . . . have declared victory and moved on,” it is doubtful that “South Carolina seems to have accepted the outcome on the flag.”38 Instead, for 16 years, the flag controversy was in a semi‐dormant state, with political avoidance overtaking the necessary political leadership to revisit and reengage such a divisive issue.         "
"14","As was true in 2000, when the compromise position was reached, likewise in the summer of 2015, a catalyzing event expanded the scope of conflict and favored the mobilization of groups opposed to the status quo.39 In 2015, it took a heinous act of racially motivated violence to remove the official display of the Rebel flag from the South Carolina State House grounds. Soon after the Charleston massacre, editorial boards across the country, including both the Washington Post and the New York Times, began to call on South Carolina's elected officials to remove the flag. For example, remarking on the flag, the Post's editorial board said that “the message it sends is clear—and directly in contrast to the lessons on tolerance and forgiveness that the people of Charleston have been teaching the nation since last week's atrocity.”40 Closer to home, the Greenville News argued that the flag debate was about “whether our state can recognize the scars that still linger from one people having enslaved another, from one people having terrorized another, from one people having denied the most fundamental rights of life and liberty to another.”41 The editorial board of Charleston's Post and Courier expressed a similar sentiment, saying that for some South Carolinians, “the flag has nothing but dire associations that reflect the race hatred and lawlessness of those, such as the Ku Klux Klan, who appropriated it for their own purposes.”42"
"15","In the next section, we discuss previous research on public opinion toward the Confederate flag and how it ties into our current examination of this subject with respect to the views of South Carolinians."
"16","A considerable literature has examined opinions on the Confederate flag. Although by no means exhaustive, Table 1 displays a sampling of studies that have empirically assessed attitudes toward the Confederate flag since 1997. Listing the studies from earliest to most recent, this scholarship can be divided broadly into works that evaluate county‐level votes on Confederate flag referendums, those that consider state legislators’ votes on changing the Confederate flag/relocating it/removing it, and those surveying opinions on certain variants of the Southern Cross. The last set of studies are most germane to our current analysis since we rely on survey data to assess the opinions of South Carolinians before and after the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the State House grounds in Columbia. Not surprisingly, because most of the contemporary fights waged over the Confederate flag have occurred in Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina, these studies typically focus on some population in these states.         "
"17","Regardless of the specific type of analysis, it is apparent that race, whether measured at the district level (for state legislators), the county level, or the individual level, registers a large effect on opinions toward the Confederate flag. Larger black populations in aggregate‐level analyses correlate with opposition to Confederate symbolism43 because African Americans strongly oppose the Confederate battle flag,44 and lawmakers representing substantial black constituencies vote against pro‐Confederate legislation.45 We also suspect that white politicians have played the “race card” by supporting the Confederate flag without specifically mentioning the racial history associated with this powerful symbol.46 Given the close connection between race and partisanship, Republican legislators are often found to be more supportive of the Confederate flag,47 but not always (some studies find no difference between white Democrats and white Republicans voting on Confederate flag legislation).48"
"18","Most of the survey‐based studies omit black respondents because it is taken as a given that they will be unanimously opposed to Confederate symbols. Nonetheless, the inclusion of a dummy for a respondent's race provides insight into just how polarized black and white attitudes are.49 A shortcoming of some of these studies is the sampling frame, which limits the generalizability of the findings. For instance, Clark50 relied on a mail survey of white Georgia campaign donors; Orey's51 study was limited to white college students enrolled in Mississippi universities, and, similarly, Ehrlinger et al.52 surveyed Florida undergraduates (but included black respondents). Putting aside the issue of representativeness, these studies are rather illuminating. One would expect social desirability to mask racially prejudiced attitudes,53 but in fact, the respondents in these surveys exhibit a very high propensity to favor the Confederate flag (or to oppose Barack Obama/African Americans because of exposure to the Confederate flag in the experimental study by Ehrlinger et al.54) because of either racially conservative beliefs55 or downright racist attitudes.56"
"19","In fact, in a representative sample of white Georgians, under a blatantly racist framing of the Confederate flag (using an experimental survey design), white male respondents were most supportive of the emblem and less likely to identify with the Democratic Party.57 By contrast, white female respondents did not exhibit notable variation in their opinion of the Confederate flag based on their exposure to different frames.58 In another survey of white Georgians, separating out the effects of a measure of southern identity/heritage from an index capturing racial attitudes revealed that the latter variable proved highly significant in affecting opinion on the Georgia flag.59"
"20","In light of these previous studies of opinions toward the Confederate flag, we use survey data to account for many of the leading factors expected to influence views on this divisive issue. Like others,60 we see value in controlling for a respondent's race before moving on to an assessment of white attitudes toward the Rebel flag. In the case of white respondents, because of the vast changes in partisan politics in the American South, we anticipate that several variables should condition attitudes toward the Confederate flag, particularly measures of partisanship, ideology, racial conservatism, religion, southern identity, and education. To elaborate on these relationships, we now turn to our data and methods for evaluating South Carolinian opinions on the Confederate flag.         "
"21","For about a decade, from 1992 to 2001, the University of North Carolina administered the Southern Focus Poll (SFP), which was conducted biannually in the spring and fall and contained a representative national sample of southern and northern respondents.61 The SFP routinely included a smorgasbord of questions tapping into southern cultural identities. For a handful of polls, the SFP posed the following question:            "
"22","Some people say the Confederate flag reminds them of white supremacy and racial conflict. Other people say the Confederate flag is a symbol of Southern heritage and pride. Do you think the flag is more a symbol of racial conflict or of southern pride?"
"23","The response options were “1. Racial Conflict; 2. Southern Pride; 3. No Opinion/No Answer.” This question was asked of respondents in four SFPs administered more than 20 years ago. Omitting the third response option, we pooled the answers to this question across four groups: white southerners, black southerners, white South Carolinians, and black South Carolinians."
"24","We found that 85.4 percent of white southerners said the flag was more about southern pride than racial conflict, but just 38.9 percent of black southerners agreed. In terms of whites, the story is quite similar in South Carolina: 86.9 percent of whites said the flag was more about southern pride than racial conflict. However, we discovered a more substantial difference comparing black respondents in South Carolina with black southerners more generally: just 10 percent of black South Carolinians said the flag was more about southern pride than racial conflict."
"25","To determine how opinions may have changed after the Charleston shooting, we included this question on the September 2015 Winthrop Poll. The WP is a representative probability sample of South Carolina residents that is conducted up to four times per year and uses professionally trained callers so that both landlines and wireless phones may be sampled (automated polls may not call wireless phones, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 52 percent of South Carolina adults live in a wireless‐only household).62 We discovered that 70.8 percent of white South Carolinians said the Confederate flag was more about southern pride than racial conflict. Recall that 86.9 percent of white South Carolinians answered southern pride based on the SFP results. Although we want to be cautious in comparing the results from opinion polls taken more than 20 years apart, it appears that fewer white South Carolinians were making a heritage argument following the Charleston shooting. There did not appear to be a big change in how black South Carolinians answered this question, however. According to the WP results, only 13.5 percent of black South Carolinians said the flag was more about southern identity than racial conflict.         "
"26","Given the significance of the Charleston tragedy and its swift political ramifications, the September 2015 WP placed a heavy emphasis on questions gauging opinions on the Confederate flag and its removal from the South Carolina State House grounds. We are also fortunate to have Confederate flag questions from the November 2014 WP, when the issue was comparably dormant. Both WP surveys (November 2014 and September 2015) were based on representative samples of South Carolinians. In Table 2, we display the descriptive results for responses to five questions assessing opinions on the Confederate flag: “(1) positive/negative view in 2014 (2) continue flying/not continue flying in 2014 (3) continue flying/not continue flying in 2015 (4) approve/disapprove flying before summer in 2015 (5) wrong decision/right decision to remove flag in 2015.” The data are confined to blacks and whites and show overall opinion and opinions according to race.         "
"27","In 2014, 54 percent of respondents held a negative view of the Confederate flag, but we find substantial racial polarization, as 58 percent of whites held a positive view versus 82 percent of blacks harboring a negative view. The next two questions in 2014 and 2015, respectively, were worded very similarly and thus offer a revealing contrast in the movement of public opinion. Prefaced with the brief historical context of the Rebel flag being moved to the site of a Confederate memorial on the State House grounds, in 2014, respondents were asked whether the banner should or should not continue flying.63 In 2015, respondents were then asked whether they personally thought the Confederate flag should continue flying after its removal from the State House grounds. In 2014, 65 percent of respondents favored the flag continuing to fly over the Confederate memorial on the State House grounds, with 77 percent of whites holding this view versus 69 percent of blacks opposed. About a year later, in the wake of the Charleston church massacre, only 34 percent of respondents thought the flag should continue flying after the legislature had it removed, with 54 percent of whites and fully 95 percent of blacks favoring its removal. Clearly, the tragedy in Charleston mobilized opinion against flying the flag. Notice, however, that when the question was prefaced with “before summer,” more respondents approved of the flag flying (61 percent of whites) even though this question was asked in September 2015.64 Finally, we asked whether respondents agreed with the legislature's decision to remove the flag. Here we find the most opposition to the Confederate flag, as only 31 percent of respondents opposed the decision to remove the flag with 57 percent of whites and 96 percent of blacks favoring its removal.         "
"28","Based on the summary statistics in Table 2, we go a step further by conducting multivariate analysis of opinions toward the Confederate flag. Although we modeled responses to all five questions, we present only the models evaluating responses to the two questions about whether the Confederate flag should continue to fly on State House grounds (questions 2 and 3 in Table 2).65 As a reminder, one question was asked in 2014, before the Charleston church shooting, and one question was asked in 2015, in the wake of the shooting. In the following analyses, we scale the dependent variable in multiple regressions as follows: 1 = continue flying, 0 = do not continue flying. Hence, our dependent variable is coded in a pro‐flag direction. In total, we run four regressions because for each dependent variable, we evaluate opinions with and then without African American respondents (a full model and whites‐only model). We do this in order to first assess racial polarization in the full models and then examine the variation in opinions among white respondents.         "
"29","With the exception of the race variable (White: 1 = white, 0 = black), in every model, we include the same covariates: Racial Conservatism; Ideology (1 = extremely liberal to 7 = extremely conservative); Party Identification (1 = strong Democrat to 7 = strong Republican); Born Again (1 = yes, 0 = otherwise); Native Southerner (1 = yes, 0 = otherwise); Converted Southerner (1 = yes, 0 = otherwise); Tea Party Approve (1 = approve of Tea Party, 0 = otherwise); Female (1 = female, 0 = male); Age (in years, ranging from 18 to 99); and Education (1 = less than high school, 2 = high school graduate/GED equivalent, 3 = some college, 4 = two‐year technical college graduate, 5 = four‐year college graduate, 6 = postgraduate).         "
"30","Some of these variables need further explanation. Racial Conservatism is based on the following question: “[D]o you feel that generations of slavery and discrimination do or do not make it difficult for Blacks to work their way out of the lower class? Do you feel that way Strongly or Somewhat?” The variable is coded 1 = strongly DO make it difficult, 2 = somewhat DO make it difficult, 3 = somewhat do NOT make it difficult, 4 = strongly do NOT make it difficult. A higher value equals a more racially conservative response. Similar to previous research,66 this proxy for racial attitudes should exhibit a substantial and positive influence on the dependent variables (that is, a more favorable opinion toward the Confederate flag).         "
"31","We also include two variables that tap into regional identity: Native Southerner and Converted Southerner, with the omitted comparison category being Non‐Southerner. Respondents native to the South should be more favorable toward the Confederate flag, although the evidence that this is the case in past studies is mixed.67 We also distinguish between respondents who relocated to the South/South Carolina and embraced their new culture by identifying as a Converted Southerner versus those who migrated to the South/South Carolina from a northern state and continue to view themselves as a Non‐Southerner. It is likely that southern converts hold more positive views of the Confederate flag compared with northern in‐migrants who do not feel a cultural affinity with the South.         "
"32","Regarding the expectations for the other variables, because of the modern partisan realignment of southern politics,68 we expect that Republican affiliates will be more favorable in their opinions toward the Southern Cross. Likewise, because of the tight linkage between ideology and partisanship,69 conservatives should harbor more positive impressions of the Confederate flag. However, because religious groups were active in lobbying for the removal of the Rebel flag (including the politically influential Southern Baptist Convention70), born‐again respondents may exhibit more negative views of the emblem.71 Since the Tea Party movement is aligned somewhere along the far‐right fringe of the Republican Party,72 these individuals may be more favorable toward the Confederate flag. Moreover, one of the flag's biggest supporters in the South Carolina Legislature was Senator Lee Bright, a Tea Party favorite.73 As for female respondents, given the split in opinions among white male and white female Georgians,74 we anticipate that in our models confined to white respondents, women will be less supportive of the Confederate flag.         "
"33","Based on prior studies, in the case of white southern respondents, age has exhibited both favorable75 and unfavorable76 opinions toward the Confederate flag; Cooper and Knotts77 found that older non‐southerners were more opposed to the flag, but age did not influence the views of southerners. Reingold and Wike78 offer two explanations why older southerners (whites only) were more opposed to the Georgia state flag. Rather than reiterate their reasoning, we expect older South Carolinians will also have more unfavorable views of the Confederate flag, but for an entirely different motivation: “flag fatigue.”79 It strikes us that older Palmetto State residents may be tired of the fight over the flag and therefore should be more welcoming of its removal. Finally, consistent with previous research,80 and since education is correlated with greater racial tolerance,81 the higher educated should be significantly more opposed to flying the Confederate flag.         "
"34","To explore perceptions about the Confederate flag in more detail, we estimated a probit model including the aforementioned independent variables: white, racial conservatism, ideology, party identification, born again, native southerner, converted southerner, tea party approve, female, age, and education. In addition to presenting the model coefficients and accompanying standard errors for each regression, we also present predicted probabilities of the likelihood that an individual favored flying the Confederate flag based on the observed value approach.82"
"35","Recall that our first research question was to explore the individual‐level factors that explained support for the South Carolina Confederate flag before the Charleston church shooting. Table 3 displays the results for our estimates of support for the Confederate flag before the Charleston tragedy. The results of our full model appear in the second column of Table 3. Race is certainly a factor in opinions about the Confederate flag, as whites are significantly more likely than blacks to favor the flag flying. In 2014, the likelihood of favoring continuing to fly the flag is .49 for blacks versus .73 for whites. The effect of being a native southerner also has a strong effect on flying the flag, moving from .57 for non‐southerners to .72 for native southerners. Likewise, party identification and ideology are also significant predictors of support for continuing to fly the flag. Across the range of party identification, the probability moves from .59 (strong Democrats) to .76 (strong Republicans). Conservative respondents support the flag at higher rates as well, moving from .50 (extremely liberal) to .79 (extremely conservative). Racial conservatism also has a positive effect on continuing to fly the flag: the least racially conservative respondent has a .60 probability compared with .71 for the most racially conservative. Lastly, the effect of education is negative and significant: going from .78 (least educated) to .60 (most educated) with respect to the likelihood of favoring continuing to fly the flag.         "
"36","The fifth column in Table 3 displays our probit estimates for the whites‐only model. The findings are quite similar to what we discovered in the full model. The significant predictors of continuing to fly the flag are native southerner status (+.18 change in probability), ideology (+.36 change in probability), racial conservatism (+.11 change in probability), and education (–.18 change in probability). We should note, however, that this is the only model in which party identification fails to register a significant effect on opinion toward the Confederate flag.         "
"37","Table 4 displays the results for the likelihood of continuing to flag the flag after its removal in 2015. These results help us explore our second research question, determining the individual‐level factors that explain support for the Confederate flag after the Charleston church shooting. In the full model, the probability difference between blacks and whites is .31, with a 10 percent chance that African Americans agree to continue flying the flag versus a .41 probability among whites. Again, we see substantial effects with respect to ideology, party identification, racial conservatism, native southerner, and education. Unlike the findings in Table 3, we now see that older respondents are much less likely to agree that the flag should continue flying, moving from a probability of .45 for the youngest respondent (18) to just .27 for the oldest respondent (99). Also, compared with the results in Table 3 in 2014, in Table 4 in 2015, support for continuing to fly the flag is markedly lower irrespective of the particular variable of statistical significance. Indeed, only in the case of the least educated do we find a probability above .50 (at .55).         "
"38","Not surprisingly, and true for all of the models limited to white respondents, support for the Confederate flag is higher than in the full models that include African Americans. For the predicted probabilities in the whites‐only model in Table 4, at the highest levels of racial conservatism (.51), ideology (.56), and party identification (.50), at least half of these respondents favor the flag continuing to fly above the State House grounds. Interestingly, and in keeping with our expectation that born‐again individuals would be less supportive of the Confederate flag continuing to fly, this is in fact the case (a −.08 decline in probability for born‐again individuals). Lastly, the youngest respondents (at .57) and least educated (at .66) are much more in favor of having the flag continue to fly, with maximum probability differences registering −.26 and −.38, respectively.         "
"39","Finally, in order to highlight the marked decline in support for flying the Confederate flag in South Carolina before (in November 2014) and after (in September 2015) the Charleston church shooting, we present Figure 1. Figure 1 displays the predicted probability of support for flying the flag according to the six variables (respondent race, racial conservatism, party identification, ideology, native status, and level of education) in which opinion toward flying the Southern Cross registered statistical significance in both the 2014 and 2015 full models (as shown in Tables 3 and 3, respectively). Most of these variable classifications are categorical, and here we show differences for the minimum and maximum values. For instance, we display predicted probabilities for the far‐left (strong Democrat) and far‐right (strong Republican) positions on the seven‐point party identification scale. Mobilization of opinion in favor of removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House grounds is palpable. Whereas almost every type of respondent in Figure 1 favored continuing flying the flag in 2014 (the exception being African Americans and extremely liberal respondents who split 50/50), in 2015, only the least educated still favored flying the Southern Cross.         "
"40","Drastic Decline in Support for Flying the Confederate Flag in South Carolina between 2014 and 2015"
"41","Note: Data display the predicted probability of supporting the flying of the Confederate flag in South Carolina for each type of respondent based on the full model results displayed in Table 3 for 2014 (before the Charleston church shooting) and Table 4 for 2015 (after the Charleston church shooting).                     "
"42","In the 1944 case of Smith v. Allwright, which ruled the white primary unconstitutional, it was the Deep South states that worked the hardest to deny black suffrage even after the U.S. Supreme Court had spoken.83 More recently, the historian David Goldfield84 penned a book titled Still Fighting the Civil War. The Deep South states have clung to their “Old South” past longer and tighter than the others,85 and the fight over the Rebel flag is perhaps the most prominent example. In 2017, Mississippi held the distinction of being the only state to display the St. Andrew's Cross on its flag.         "
"43","The Civil War only lasted four years, but a flag representing the southern side of that fight has divided black and white South Carolinians for more than half a century. The Confederate battle flag has taken on many meanings, but southern unity is not one of them. The racial split over the symbolism of the Southern Cross has proven intractable, but an inexplicable and gruesome crime became the catalyst for rendering the Rebel flag a museum piece."
"44","In this article, we have documented several political histories of the Confederate flag and looked specifically at South Carolinian opinions toward it, including its removal from the State House grounds. It took more than 38 years to move the flag from atop the Capitol dome to a Confederate memorial and then another decade and a half to discard it all together. Public opinion shows strong splits on the Confederate battle flag, both in terms of its meaning and state‐sanctioned display. Not only does this divide manifest in black and white, but also it splits whites with respect to demographics and sociopolitical attitudes. There is massive irony in the fact that the Rebel Cross now generates more favorable impressions from those aligned with the Republican Party, the same party a defeated Confederate South raised this flag against. Furthermore, it was the Republican leadership of Indian American governor Nikki Haley that ensured the flag would be removed."
"45","It appears that the Charleston church shooting sparked a significant change in views toward flying the Confederate flag.86 It was just the kind of event capable of galvanizing opinion decidedly in one direction as a consequence of elites taking a strong stand against the Southern Cross.87 Our surveys indicate that prior to the Charleston church shooting, 77 percent of white South Carolinians thought the Confederate flag should continue flying over the State House grounds. After this senseless tragedy, 57 percent of whites agreed with the legislature's decision to take down the Southern Cross (see Table 2). Most important, even if there remains nowhere near a consensus position among the mass public in the Palmetto State,88 its elected leadership put the flag issue to rest. In our view, if only symbolically, this political action represents closing another door on the racially insensitive “Old South” and more fully embracing the promise of a racially tolerant “New South.”*"
