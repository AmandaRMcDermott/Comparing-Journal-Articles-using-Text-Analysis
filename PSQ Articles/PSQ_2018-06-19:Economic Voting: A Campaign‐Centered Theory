"1","This book is a worthwhile contribution to the literature on elections. It begins with an important question: why do economic models of elections fail so often? Austin Hart focuses on why voters seem to base their votes on economic conditions—but only some of the time. He aims to explain aggregate election outcomes while drawing on data and ideas about individual voters—a tricky enterprise, but executed well in this book. The analysis is theoretically informed, and it presents an excellent model for how to research and write about American electoral politics in a comparative context. It is clearly written and presented in a straightforward manner, making it an ideal choice for graduate or advanced undergraduate courses as well as an important read for scholars in the field."
"2","Hart's main argument is that campaigns can “activate” economic considerations in the minds of voters. Candidates and their campaigns can also choose to deemphasize messages about the economy in favor of other considerations, such as democracy (as in Mexico's 2000 election) or candidate traits."
"3","The real strength of this book is that the author leverages subnational, cross‐temporal, and cross‐national comparisons to test the theory. This allows him to address challenging questions of whether campaign messages make a difference in how voters evaluate candidates. The author exploits the difference in advertising across states to assess how the Bill Clinton campaign primed economic voting in 1992. Diving into another puzzling U.S. election, Hart concludes that the “strength of the economic vote” declined over the course of the campaign as a result of the candidates’ messaging choices. Al Gore's electoral fortunes, as a consequence, were not driven by the state of the economy or voters’ perceptions of it."
"4","Hart also includes the 2000 and 2006 elections in Mexico. The accounts of the campaigns and their context provide a solid picture of on the specific and sometimes idiosyncratic features of campaigns while also pulling out the systematic factors to be compared. Specifically, the 2000 election in Mexico was unique because of its historic nature: it ended 70 years of PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) dominance of presidential politics. The 2006 election happened in the “long shadow” of the previous contest, at a time when partisan alignments were more fluid than is typical in a more consolidated democracy. In 2000, campaign advertisements did not prime the economic vote, focusing instead on themes of change. In contrast, in 2006, an abrupt change to an economic message activated the economic vote, and likely determined the outcome."
"5","Beyond these cases, the author looks at economic campaign messages and voting in three other contexts: South Korea, West Germany (1972), and Canada. He finds that “candidates’ economic messages systematically condition voters’ willingness to hold incumbent‐party candidates responsible for past economic performance” (p. 142). In sum, Hart contributes to the debate about whether campaigns matter or elections simply turn on economic conditions by suggesting that these theories are complementary rather than at odds. Economic conditions are important to voters, but campaign communication affects how much these considerations will be brought to bear on vote choice."
"6","This analysis goes a long way toward helping us understand the relationships among campaign dynamics, voter psychology, and national strategies and outcomes. It brings to light theoretical commonalities across very different electoral contexts. The book also leaves open a number of questions, especially about the contemporary electoral environment. The elections included in the analysis leave off before the financial crash of 2008, the highly polarized U.S. political environment of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama years, and the development of a new and fragmented media world."
"7","First, what are the limits on economic priming? Is there a certain point past which economic conditions are too poor—or too good—for voters to neglect them? Hart illustrates that priming matters under a range of conditions, from fairly favorable to quite unfavorable economic conditions. Further tests on more contemporary (as well as historical) elections would help test the breadth of this range."
"8","Hart also expresses some doubt that the precise content of the message matters. However, work on recent politics challenges this contention in several ways. First, should we expect similar effects for different kinds of campaign communication—for campaigns conducted via email and social media as well as television ads? Or for television ads in a more fragmented media environment? In the U.S. case, the media environment has changed a great deal since the elections of 1992 and 2000. A related question is whether partisan polarization limits the impact of economic priming. Marc Hetherington and Thomas Rudolph's Why Washington Won't Work: Polarization, Political Trust, and the Governing Crisis (2016) illustrates how partisanship shapes evaluation of government performance, a fairly recent phenomenon. Hart's analysis tells us how economic priming works in an environment of loose partisan attachments—but less about its effects in a highly partisan electorate.         "
"9","Finally, Economic Voting describes a political universe in which campaign issues are distinct and neatly separable. However, recent research (see, for example, Katherine Cramer's The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and The Rise of Scott Walker) challenges the assumption that voters view issues that way. This question seems especially potent as scholars debate the 2016 election, in which issues of identity, health, and economic concerns were seemingly intertwined. Going forward, we may need to develop studies and analytical tools that can assess how economic priming interacts with other issue messages.         "
"10","Economic Voting answers some questions, opens new ones, and will help scholars think about how to address these issues in future work. This is a rigorous and enlightening book.         "
