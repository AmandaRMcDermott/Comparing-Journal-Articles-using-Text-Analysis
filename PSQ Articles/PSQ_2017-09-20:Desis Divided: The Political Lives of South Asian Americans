"1","Since America reopened its gates in 1965, new immigration has been a central driver of racial and ethnic diversity in the country. Yet while most celebrate the fact that today's new immigrants hail from a number of different nations across the globe, Sangay K. Mishra's book Desis Divided also reminds readers that even within one particular migration stream—in this case, immigrants from South Asia—there exists significant class, religious, and ethnic diversity that is often overlooked by scholars. A core objective of this book is to show how this diversity is reflected in the political mobilization strategies employed by South Asian groups. Desis Divided thus offers a distinct approach to studying immigrant political engagement. Rather than focus on the common political agendas shared by all South Asians, the book documents the important political variation that exists within this community.         "
"2","Mishra's central claim is that a collective racial identity is not necessarily the best political strategy for all immigrant groups to address their needs. His argument is put in direct contrast with the more dominant argument, which contends that because American politics functions as a majoritarian system, the best mobilization strategy for minority groups is to exert a “strength in numbers” approach by mobilizing a unified collective identity and then strategically fighting for issues that serve the entire community. However, Mishra points out that this political strategy often suppresses the important diversity that exists within a group, oftentimes marginalizing certain segments."
"3","The book documents how subgroups within the South Asian community have been politically successful by focusing on more narrow interests specific to the concerns of that subgroup. South Asians therefore tend to organize on behalf of their specific national origin group (such as Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi) or by specific professions or interests (such as the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin or Indus Entrepreneurs). Mishra challenges readers to consider this strategy as a more politically empowering one given that it is better able to incorporate the nuanced needs of specific groups."
"4","This central claim is, in many ways, not a common argument but one that reflects the reality of how some immigrant groups choose to engage with the political system. It is indeed the case that immigrant groups oftentimes prefer to work within their national origin group rather than build bridges across pan‐ethnic lines. In this way, Mishra's portrayal of South Asian politics is a more specific case that reflects the challenges faced by all diverse, pan‐ethnic groups. While this view is compelling, the reader at the same time begins to wonder whether the choice to organize for more narrow professional or national origin interests is a more politically powerful strategy or the more expedient one? Mishra carefully acknowledges that the pattern he documents reflects the political choices made by the wealthier and better educated professional segment of the South Asian community. In contrast, those in lower‐skilled occupations tend to become involved in broader labor movements that also incorporate non–South Asians. Thus, the book highlights an important resource dimension of South Asian politics: immigrants of different classes engage with the American system in distinctly different ways. This resource dimension is an important, fresh take on the study of immigrant political behavior."
