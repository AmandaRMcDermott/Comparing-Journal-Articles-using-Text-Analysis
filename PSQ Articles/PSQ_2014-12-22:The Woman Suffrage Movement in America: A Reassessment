"1","Previously, women's historians have endeavored to keep women central in the story of personal politics. Corrine M. McConnaughy, however, focuses on the inner workings of state legislatures that have had the most power to define the electorate, and shows that analysis of partisan politics in state legislatures fills the gaps in previous histories without pushing women out of women's history. Women's ability to build coalitions with groups outside of their initial identity group, which took considerable effort, began to bear fruit by the early 1900s. She describes two scenarios under which male state legislators considered expanding the voter base to include women: strategic enfranchisement and programmatic enfranchisement. The former implied that a major political party would find it advantageous to add women voters to the rolls. McConnaughy debunks this approach because female voters could not guarantee any political party their vote as a bloc.         "
"2","Programmatic enfranchisement, then, represented the perception of politicians that a sizable part of the male voting constituency, through coalitions between the suffragists and third‐party challengers (for example, farmers' groups, labor organizations, fraternal benefit societies, socialists, Greenbacks, populists, and Progressives), favored women's suffrage, and this scenario proved a successful model for suffragists. In times of vulnerability, politicians were more willing to consider enfranchising women. McConnaughy selects five different state suffrage campaigns to emphasize the value of programmatic enfranchisement. The author points to issues of race, anti‐prohibition, and machine party politics as the disrupters of building coalitions for the suffragists. In Colorado, the rise of the Populists in the early 1890s delivered women a suffrage victory. In Michigan, suffragists found that their alliance with anti‐alcohol groups brought them no such returns, and the battle lingered into the twentieth century. Illinois suffragists learned to leverage Progressive Party support at an opportune time of major‐party vulnerability to achieve the vote. In Louisiana and New Mexico, race politics were key to undermining women's suffrage. The sizable Spanish‐American population in New Mexico, guaranteed their civil liberties upon statehood, saw white women's suffrage as a threat to their power. In Louisiana, the Democratic Party, synonymous with white supremacy, ensured a one‐party system impenetrable by third parties. In both of those states, race politics effectively shut out any hope for programmatic enfranchisement for women."
"3","Relying on a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative data, McConnaughy demonstrates whether the numbers tell a different story than the rhetoric in each state over time. She explores national and state constitutional law in relation to the electorate (maintaining that the electorate was constantly being redefined), constitutional conventions, the primary and secondary sources of the suffrage movement at city, state, and national levels, legislative processes, including committee work, voting rolls, and referendums, political campaigns at the state level, and U.S. census records. Important to her quantitative data are compositions of the populations in rural and urban areas, of farmers and union members, proportions of liquor dealers and taxes on liquor, strength of area machine party politics, New South limitations on black male voters, and political affiliations of the voters who might give coalitional politics added steam."
"4","McConnaughy's book adds a valuable insight into the complexities of the women's suffrage movement, but it is not a study for general readership. The author provides quantitative data that appeal to the political science field. Still, this study challenges views about the nature of women's political past."
