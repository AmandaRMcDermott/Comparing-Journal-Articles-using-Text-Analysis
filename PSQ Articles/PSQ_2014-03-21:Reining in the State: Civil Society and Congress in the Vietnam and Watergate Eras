"1","In the very first pages of this detailed work, readers are struck by how timely it is. With recent news stories about leaks about NSA activity from Edward Snowden and the ongoing story of WikiLeaks, it becomes evident that this is a must‐read for anyone who wishes to be a part of the contemporary debate. Katherine Scott goes back to the 1950s to begin telling the tale of a government and its people struggling over the roles of national security, privacy, and the public's right to know in a democratic system. Scott makes clear that this debate is central to the question of democratic governance in a dangerous world that requires a government to take steps to protect its people."
"2","Having been around for much of the time frame covered by Reining in the State, but only a teenager by the time of Watergate, Scott recalls for me the events that were going on around me but only registered at the level of the subconscious. We all hear of the McCarthy Era and the overreach by one elected official into the lives of average citizens, but perhaps do not recall that the U.S. Army was actively involved in surveillance and counterintelligence work during the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War protests. Scott details a number of courageous individuals in elective office or retired from the Army who came forward to expose these activities. Whatever now‐disreputable positions he may have been known for earlier, Senator Sam Ervin emerges as one of those courageous individuals in the earliest efforts to stop our national security structure from infringing on our constitutionally protected freedoms—speech, assembly, and privacy. It also becomes clear from Scott's retelling of the events that Ervin was uniquely qualified to head the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Practices with his broad experience in attempting to restrain the government's use of executive privilege to keep its surveillance and counterintelligence activity away from scrutiny. Captain Christopher Pyle also emerges as a somewhat unsung hero by blowing the whistle on what he and his Army colleagues did in the name of national security. According to Scott, Pyle went on to work for Ervin (in his pre‐Watergate role) to help find other ex‐Army officers who might testify about their activities. Accumulating this evidence was crucial to the effort, since the administration was still using “executive privilege” to stonewall the press and Congress.         "
"3","Scott takes the story forward through the 1970s, and though she leaves her particular part of the tale incomplete with the caveat that “[u]nder the leadership of President Reagan, who favored a strong national security state and a powerful executive, institutions like the CIA, FBI, and NSC would find a climate more favorable” to them and with a Republican majority in the Senate, a Congress less willing to exercise the same oversight role it had to that point. Certainly, as a result of the events of September 11, the wars begun under President George W. Bush, and the rise of a political faction favorable to an expanded role for national security agencies, these same issues have risen yet again. At the same time, there is a vocal faction in politics seeking the reduction in size and scope of government on a number of fronts, thus placing this kind of debate front and center in American politics. Scott's work reminds us that those who fail to learn from history are, in fact, doomed to repeat it. On the plus side, it means that there will always be fertile ground for this type of work."
