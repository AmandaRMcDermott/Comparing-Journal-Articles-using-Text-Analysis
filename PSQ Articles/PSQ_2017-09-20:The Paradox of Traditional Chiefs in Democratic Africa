"1","This is a book worth reading because it deviates from received wisdom in an intelligent and engaging way. In doing so, Kate Baldwin explores a fascinating paradox, namely, that “the empowerment of unelected traditional leaders often improves the responsiveness of democratic governments” (p. 5). The particular democratic government in question is Zambia, but the author makes a credible argument that her findings can be generalized to other democracies on the continent."
"2","The problem of chiefs ultimately stems from the fact that all colonial powers in Africa were confronted with a similar dilemma. They wished to control vast stretches of territory but had to do so with few resources and little manpower. The “solution” to the dilemma of implementing colonialism on the cheap was to rule through the traditional leaders they found already on the ground or, in some locales, to create them where they did not exist. To be sure, the colonial powers all had different ideological and theoretical justifications for how they handled the customary authorities they found in place, but at the end of the day, the solutions usually resembled something akin to the British variant known as “indirect rule.” This meant that the alien power would rule through the already existing structures of governance. The primary responsibility of the chiefs, from the perspective of the colonial power, was to provide labor and taxes. In implementing this oppressive system, the colonialists often gave far more power to the chiefs than they had previously enjoyed. While some did genuinely try to protect their subjects from the harsher aspects of colonial rule, eventually the colonialists caught on, and they were often removed for what the Belgians called incapacité notoire (notorious incapacity).         "
"3","It caused little surprise, therefore, when one of the first orders of business of any number of African states after achieving independence was either to abolish the chieftaincies or, at the very least, to restrict their power because they were often seen as hated holdovers of the colonial era who were out of step with the aspirations of the leadership of the newly independent and modernizing states. Ironically, however, the new states were faced with some of the same dilemmas of governance that had bedeviled the colonialists: immense territory, few resources, and weak state institutions. When the 1990s saw the advent of a wave of democratization in Africa, one result was that in rural areas the population often had more contact with unelected traditional rulers than they did with their elected representatives."
"4","The paradox that Baldwin cogently explores is that the chiefs tend to rule for life and therefore have an interest in seeing to it that some developmental progress is made in their societies. Elected parliamentarians find that if they are to deliver developmental benefits or democratic “pork” (for example, schools, roads, water) to their constituents, the help of traditional rulers is invaluable because they alone can mobilize the collective labor necessary to bring about infrastructural progress. Baldwin centers her analysis on this, and she deserves great credit for her deft and methodologically sound analysis."
"5","Nonetheless, I have two quibbles that perhaps Baldwin will address in subsequent studies. The first is that the work has a distinctly Anglophone flavor; Africa's French‐speaking countries are underemphasized. The second is that the question of political legitimacy, both of the elected representatives and of the nonelected chiefs, needs to be examined. That said, this is a fine book that makes a genuine contribution to our understanding of politics in democratic Africa."
