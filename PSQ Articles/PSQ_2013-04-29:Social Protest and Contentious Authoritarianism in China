"1","Western media attention on the political situation in China invariably focuses on state–society contestation. This relationship tends to be depicted one‐dimensionally: a repressive authoritarian regime aloof from and unaccountable to its people. The people are therefore increasingly alienated and driven to express their discontent in demonstrations, protests, and riots all across the vast country. The image of hundreds of millions of irate Chinese out in the streets leads to speculation about the longevity of Communist Party rule. Official Chinese statistics do reveal that the numbers of protests and demonstrations have been growing since the early 1990s, but rumors of the regime's imminent demise appear greatly exaggerated. Indeed, several scholars have suggested that the Chinese political system has considerable staying power. Perhaps the most widely read piece on the subject was written by Andrew J. Nathan [“Authoritarian Resilience in China,” Journal of Democracy 14:1 (2003): 6–17]. A decade later, we have the benefit of scholarship based on extensive field work, which provides considerable detail about some of the factors contributing to regime resilience.         "
"2","Xi Chen's volume is one such study. It offers a nuanced and multidimensional portrait of state–society interactions in China's heartland. Chen examines a city and a county in the inland province of Hunan. He focuses on the time‐honored system of xinfang, whereby citizens can petition authorities for a redress of their grievances. As Chen notes, this practice dates back to imperial China and was also a feature of Mao Zedong's China (1949–1976). His research suggests that the authorities actually encourage or at least facilitate this process. China's political rulers seem to find it a useful way to control discontent and channel participation. In the absence of other effective participatory and representative mechanisms, xinfang provides an institutionalized system for the management of popular grievances.         "
"3","Contentious Authoritarianism reveals that contemporary Chinese politics defies simplistic descriptions of peasants and workers as powerless pawns at the mercy of tyrannical and unscrupulous officials. Certainly injustice is rife in China, and official corruption appears endemic. But indignant and angry ordinary people are willing to speak up and act out in the quest for justice. Although Chen's research reveals a rather modest success rate, there appears to be a widespread belief that petitioning is legitimate and that under this pressure, the system can be made to work. Just as many Americans continue to believe that with hard work and perseverance anyone can become wealthy, so many Chinese continue to think that justice is attainable in their country's existing system if only a person is willing to press hard enough.         "
"4","But as Chen notes, aggrieved groups recognize that playing strictly by the rules is often ineffective, so they turn to creative types of collective action to raise the profile of their grievances. Most of these efforts appear to be shrewdly calculated to push the envelope of activities just far enough to get the attention of officials but not so far as to prompt a crackdown. Through a careful analysis of official provincial and county‐level reporting, Chen is able to provide a wealth of detail about the types and frequency of petitions and protests in one province."
"5","This book is a must‐read for anyone seeking a better understanding of contemporary Chinese politics and society and the remarkable staying power of the Communist Party. It is also a must‐read for anyone interested in the larger issues of social protest and collective action and in learning about the many varieties of authoritarian regimes around the world, which are proving to be surprisingly resilient."
