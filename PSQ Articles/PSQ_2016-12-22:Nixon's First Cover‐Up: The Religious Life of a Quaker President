"1","It is well known that throughout U.S. history, members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, have often engaged in political discourse and policy debate over war, antislavery, and human rights, yet there has been little scholarship on Quakers and presidential leadership. H. Larry Ingle's new book, Nixon's First Cover‐Up: The Religious Life of a Quaker President, provides an intriguing account through impeccable research and even better writing of one of the most enigmatic and controversial presidents in U.S. history—Richard M. Nixon—and his underlying Quaker faith. Ingle draws on and challenges Nixon biographers, who, he argues, misunderstood the impact of religion in Nixon's decision‐making process, by reinterpreting Nixon's own published works and personal and political correspondences. Ingle uniquely focuses on Nixon's often ignored, or just completely forgotten, “Quaker heritage,” which arguably informed his personal character, leadership style, and broader political life.         "
"2","As a Quaker historian, Ingle takes on Nixon's well‐known legacy of engaging in secretive politics by revealing how and why the former president, and “birthright Friend,” infused religious ideas into his politics and policymaking activities. Scholars have always known about Nixon's tendencies toward secrecy. However, Ingle uncovers Nixon's surreptitious reliance on his Quaker background based on his mother Hannah M. Nixon's orthodox Quakerism and piety, which allowed Nixon to broaden his evangelical Christian circles in 1950s and beyond while making rhetorical statements around traditional Quaker testimonies—pacifism and peace. Ingle makes a straightforward argument that Nixon strategically implored his “Quaker heritage” whenever it served his political purposes to do so or enhanced other aspects of his ambitious career (p. 129)."
"3","Ingle exposes Nixon's deep‐rooted pious fiction, which fundamentally explains many, if not most, of Nixon's seemingly ambiguous actions: from his anticommunism in the 1940s and 1950s and involvement with the House Un‐American Activities Committee crusade against fellow Quaker Alger Hiss, to his 1960 masking of his religious faith during his first presidential run against Catholic John F. Kennedy, to his later “pledge to create a ‘structure of peace’” (p. 160) while escalating the Vietnam war and the 1970s Watergate cover‐up. Although Nixon was a lifelong member of East Whittier Friends Church in California, he and his family attended, on occasion, evangelical Presbyterian and Methodist churches while in Washington, DC, when he served as vice president and later president. He associated with powerful and nationally known evangelists—Norman Vincent Peale and Billy Graham—who would attempt to impute, or at least revive, faith into Nixon's life (Chapter 7). Yet Nixon kept religion and his Quakerism far from his public image."
"4","At the center of Nixon's strategic, and perhaps unprincipled instrumentalist, use of his “Quaker heritage” was what Ingle calls his “two‐ness,” which seemingly supported Nixon's use of generic terms such as “That I believe” or “I grew up in a tradition” (p. 162) that were often inconsistent with his Quakerism: a strong self‐confidence and uncanny ability to “draw on his own inner resources to overcome the trials and tribulations he faced” (p. 210) throughout his long political career while also privately believing in a God that watched over his every move in an existential/metaphysical way. Thus, Nixon reinterpreted his Quakerism as affording him a flexibility to navigate between occasional religious pronouncements—implying a nonviolent, peaceful, and pacifist posture rooted in the “inner light” of God—and actions that were more aligned with his long‐term political aspirations and need for policy or strategic victories no matter the consequences."
"5","Nixon's First Cover‐Up is a must‐read if you want to understand the myriad ways religion shapes politics and vice versa. Ingle's book is a model of interdisciplinary scholarship: integrating Quaker history and theology into presidential and broader American political history.         "
