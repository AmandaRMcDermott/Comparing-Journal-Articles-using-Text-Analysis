"1","William Zimmerman's book is admirable for its scope and ambitious attempt to explain why Russia is not a “normal” country. Zimmerman is a longtime analyst of the Soviet Union and Russia, and Ruling Russia draws on his extensive knowledge of early Soviet history in particular to argue that at certain junctures, the “selectorate”—that is, the group that chose Soviet and then post‐Soviet leaders—expanded and then contracted at various times to make the system more and then less open over time. He uses the term “normal” in the way that Mikhail Gorbachev and post‐Soviet leaders such as Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin have used it—European and democratic.         "
"2","Zimmerman's approach is to trace the narrowing of the selectorate for Russian leaders from Lenin through Putin, although he is careful to note (quite correctly) that Russian history is not linear and that too many observers of contemporary Russian politics attempt to draw a straight line from Vladimir Lenin to Joseph Stalin to Leonid Brezhnev to Putin. As Zimmerman argues, and documents extensively, there is considerable “within‐system” variation in the development of Soviet and then post‐Soviet politics, such that under Stalin during the great purge, the system was closed and clearly totalitarian, but later in the Soviet period, under Nikita Khrushchev and then Gorbachev, the selectorate widened and was more open. He carries this argument into the post‐Soviet period to argue that Putin has narrowed the selectorate considerably since 2008 in particular."
"3","Zimmerman notes, however, that a nondemocratic outcome due to steady erosion of the legitimacy of elections by 2008 and Putin's presidential/prime ministerial “castling” with Dmitry Medvedev was not historically predetermined but politically orchestrated. The subsequent large public demonstrations in the fall of 2011 following Putin's announcement that he would return as Russia's president, Zimmerman argues, show that the selectorate had widened under Medvedev, such that United Russia needed a fraudulent electoral boost to win the 2011 parliamentary elections, and Putin almost did not win the required 50 percent of the popular vote needed to avoid a run‐off. In the end, he did win in the first round, and he subsequently moved to pass laws limiting public demonstrations, severely constraining the activities of opposition figures such as the blogger Alexei Navalny, and declaring administrative war on civil society organizations engaged in any remotely political work—again to limit the selectorate and thus to ensure himself the Russian presidency until at least 2018, Zimmerman concludes."
"4","Zimmerman's book is a welcome addition to the literature on comparative authoritarianism, and it is a unique contribution to the study of contemporary Russian politics in particular because of his inclusion of the Soviet period in attempting to understand the present. This is not merely a study of Soviet leaders in comparison to Putin in particular, and there are none of the overdrawn pseudopsychological insights into Russia's current president that we too often see in analyses of Russian contemporary politics. Instead, Zimmerman successfully uses the lens of intra‐elite and elite/society relations to understand the variations in the types of autocracy we see first under Lenin, when more internal debate was allowed, a narrowing of this under Stalin as the regime sunk into full‐blown totalitarianism, and then a broadening of the selectorate under subsequent leaders until Gorbachev's efforts at relatively free and fair elections for everyone but himself. The book is much heavier, and therefore stronger, on the Soviet period than on the post‐Soviet period, but here, too, the idea of an expanding and narrowing selectorate is a useful way of conceptualizing and understanding the variation we have seen in how Russia has been ruled by Yeltsin and then Putin in the last two decades."
