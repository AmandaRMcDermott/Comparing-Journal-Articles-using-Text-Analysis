"1","ONE PERSISTENT FEATURE OF POLITICS is the widespread motivation of politicians to carefully cultivate their personal reputations. A sizeable literature in comparative politics addresses how politicians in a variety of institutional arrangements build “the personal vote” through activities such as constituency service and pork‐barrel politics.1 In the context of the United States, Mayhew famously shows that legislators are driven to claim credit, advertise, and take positions to shape their personal reputations and feed their reelection imperative.2 Although Mayhew suggests that legislators have an easy time claiming credit for particularized benefits such as “sprinkling a district with dams,” credit has limitations and is not available everywhere.3 The divided nature of the separation of powers system fosters a credit‐claiming gap in that citizens have considerable difficulty understanding just who is responsible for policy outcomes, especially when such policies are not particularistic in nature. As a result, individual legislators develop incentives or a demand for credit‐claiming activity designed to inform citizens of their policy achievements and facilitate constituent support.         "
"2","We take the literature in a different direction by arguing that presidents can use credit attribution in signing statements to reward members of Congress (MCs) who are hungry to build their personal reputations. The signing statement—written commentary issued by a president when a bill is signed into law—offers the president a rhetorical opportunity to actively shape perceptions of who bears responsibility for a new law.4 While presidents use a variety of tools and settings to engage in rhetorical activity, signing statements serve as a great starting point for an analysis of credit attribution because of their location at the very end of the legislative process. President John F. Kennedy once hinted at the importance of giving credit during signing ceremonies when he said, “It's a painless way to get on the good side of an important committee chairman, to give life to a supporter who's up for re‐election, or to recognize a friend in the other party. Who could do as much with a sword?”5 In this same vein, we argue that presidential credit attribution can be used as an important political tool to reward legislators for past support or a chit for the future. Given the paucity of research on the interbranch dynamics of credit claiming, the article asks two critical questions: when, and to whom, does the president attribute credit?         "
"3","The scholarly literature on presidential signing statements has focused on explaining the occurrence of signing statements, the purposes that these statements can serve, and their contribution to presidential power. However, there is a natural intersection with signing statements and Congress that some scholars have just started to rigorously explore.6 For example, scholars have looked at the relevance of signing statements as reflecting an important manifestation in the constitutional struggle for power,7 how they can be used to signal congressional oversight,8 and how legislative coalitions can shape the occurrence and valence of presidential signing statements.9 Yet there remains relatively little work with an explicit focus on why signing statements are important to political actors outside the presidency. Our work moves the literature on signing statements in the direction of MCs and the literature on credit claiming toward the president by analyzing what we call attribution signing statements.         "
"4","Attribution signing statements specifically name or identify members of Congress in order to give credit for legislation that the president signs into law. We argue that presidents strategically employ attribution signing statements to deliver on the credit‐claiming demands of individual MCs. Presidents may offer these rhetorical rewards to particular members as a payoff for being key coalition partners (or future coalition partners). In addition, as presidents have become increasingly reliant on copartisans to pass their initiatives, attribution statements have disproportionately benefited members of the president's party."
"5","The analysis explicitly focuses on two questions. First, we explore the “when” of attribution signing statements—what political conditions help explain when presidents attribute credit to members of Congress in the signing statement? Second, the analysis uncovers the “who” of attribution signing statements—what are the characteristics of the individual MCs who receive credit from the president?"
"6","Regarding the first question, the evidence suggests that the attribution of lawmaking credit varies systematically with political conditions that affect the president's ability to legislate in Congress. For example, presidents are significantly more likely to attribute credit to legislators under divided government. The analysis also shows that the occurrence of attribution signing statements is inversely related to presidential approval—the deterioration of approval increases the president's incentives to attribute credit to MCs. Moreover, presidents show a propensity to attribute credit to MCs on landmark policies and legislation of major significance. Thus, presidents target policy credit to MCs as a coalition‐building reward, especially under conditions that make legislating in Congress more difficult, and on nationally salient legislation, which may be more difficult for individual MCs to claim credit for on their own."
"7","On the second question, the results reinforce the idea that members critical to coalition building are appreciably more likely to be named in attribution signing statements compared with other members. Although the ideological location of individual members (relative to the chamber median) matters, other factors are far more important in explaining who receives credit from the president. For example, the individual‐level analysis shows that the likelihood of credit attribution increases significantly for the president's copartisans and for senators (relative to House members). Even more, presidents are significantly more likely to attribute lawmaking credit to party leaders than to the rank‐and‐file membership. House leaders are far more likely to receive credit compared with Senate leaders, illustrating the varying importance of, or rather the limits of, party leadership for coalition building."
"8","Modern presidents are in an enviable position to win their share of policy battles with the veto pen or to circumvent the legislative process altogether through unilateral action,10 yet they remain heavily dependent on the support of winning coalitions in Congress to pass their legislative priorities. Coalition building is one important example in which presidents can actively trade favors or benefits to gain support from individual members with heterogeneous interests.11 Presidents hold an advantage relative to Congress in coalition building because individual MCs will, more often than not, allow their individual interests to trump broader policy interests or the collective interests of the institution. Legislating, after all, follows the old adage of sausage making, and presidents exploit the great variety of congressional interests that go into such policymaking endeavors.         "
"9","Indeed, Richard Fenno's rich work reminds us of the importance of collective action in shaping the behavior of individual members in Congress. According to Fenno, “The performance of Congress is collective; but the responsibility for congressional performance is not. Responsibility is assessed member by member, district by district.”12 The passage of policy requires the collective cooperation of a large number of members, but representation in the United States imbues MCs with considerable preference heterogeneity over policy.13 This frames a critical collective action problem for legislating in Congress, where majorities are necessary to pass legislation but usually only a subset of members want to claim credit for a given policy. Thus, MCs possess varying incentives to reap outsized rewards by claiming responsibility individually for policies that are most beneficial to their political and reelection goals.         "
"10","MCs seek to cultivate constituency support for reelection by providing constituency services, taking policy positions, and claiming credit for policies.14 The work on particularistic policies and spending suggests that such activities are tools used by MCs and political parties to build electoral support.15 An underlying assumption in much of this literature is that there is a direct linkage between federal spending programs and constituents’ level of support for an incumbent.16 This assumption rests on the premise that constituents know about district spending, attribute responsibility for it, and reward the incumbent for programs. Such an analytical leap has made explaining the connection between particularistic policy and an incumbent's support at home problematic because constituents tend to know very little about federal spending programs.17 Moreover, constituents who directly benefit from federal programs do not connect the benefit with government spending or fail to attribute the benefit to their representative.18 Frances Lee suggests that even members themselves have difficulty tracking the flow of federal funds because their districts are not “administrative units” in the federal system.19 Not surprisingly, the literature on particularistic spending by and large shows a weak correlation between the level of spending in congressional districts and credit that goes to members as measured by constituent support.20"
"11","The inability of constituents to account for federal programs and attribute responsibility is not without consequences. In particular, a credit gap emerges for constituents.21 This void creates a demand on the part of members of Congress to produce credit‐claiming messages. Research by Justin Grimmer, Solomon Messing, and Sean Westwood demonstrates the critical role of credit‐claiming messages in explaining how MCs benefit from federal policies.22 Their analysis shows that credit‐claiming messages (as measured by press releases) can effectively cultivate voter support and that the number of messages matters more than the specific spending amounts involved.23"
"12","Importantly, though, it is not only MCs who want, or need, to claim credit. Presidents are also driven to claim credit for federal policies in order to get reelected (at least once) and to establish their policy legacy. Presidents also influence particularistic spending. They direct federal spending to advance their own electoral interests24 and the electoral interests of copartisans in Congress.25 The political fates of the president and his copartisans have become even more intertwined in the increasingly polarized political environment.26 Presidents share in the incentive to reward copartisans by attributing credit. Such credit from the president can help facilitate the reelection of his copartisans and provide political capital he can employ for future coalition building around his policy prerogatives. For both the president and members of Congress, the incentive for credit claiming and sharing is an underlying force shaping interinstitutional behavior and leads to our research questions regarding the “when” and “who” of credit attribution.         "
"13","The literature analyzing credit claiming remains centered on the role of Congress. Our work takes one small step in broadening the focus of credit claiming to presidents, not by exploring how presidents claim credit for themselves but by looking at how they can help facilitate credit claiming for others. As we have suggested, MCs have strong electoral incentives to connect themselves to, or take credit for, policies that are politically advantageous to their constituencies. Presidents likewise have both legacy and coalition‐building incentives to use their rhetorical stage to supply members of Congress with credit‐claiming opportunities. It is important to note that we are not suggesting that signing statements are widely read by the public; rather, they reach the public through the media or through legislators’ communications with constituents."
"14","To answer the question about when presidents attribute credit to MCs, we focus on a few key features of the political context that can significantly shape the president's prospects for successful coalition building in Congress. The basic argument is that presidents use credit attribution as a reward to coalition partners or as capital to facilitate future coalitions. Presidents attribute credit to members as side payments or selective incentives in forming winning policy coalitions.27 In particular, presidents should have larger (or smaller) incentives to issue attribution signing statements depending on political conditions that make coalition building or legislating in Congress more (or less) difficult.         "
"15","We expect the president's strategies in rewarding credit through attribution signing statements to respond to variation in political conditions such as divided or unified control of government, presidential approval, and elections. For example, divided party control tends to be a significant impediment for presidents in terms of building successful policy coalitions in Congress, whereas unified control makes the president's task relatively easier.28 Moreover, the president's agenda‐setting powers in Congress are significantly reduced when his partisan allies are in the minority.29 Therefore, presidents should be more likely to give credit to MCs as side payments under divided government.            "
"16","Hypothesis 1.Presidents should be significantly more likely to attribute credit to individual members of Congress under divided government compared with unified government.               "
"17","Similarly, presidents are better able to build policy coalitions when their approval levels are running high than when they are running low. Popular presidents are more likely to attract congressional support for their policy initiatives compared with unpopular presidents.30 Spurning a president's policy entreaties tends to be more costly to MCs when the president is popular and less so when the president is unpopular. So, higher approval levels make coalition building relatively easier for presidents compared with lower approval levels. This suggests the likelihood that attribution signing statements are inversely related to presidential approval levels.            "
"18","Hypothesis 2.Presidents should be significantly less likely to attribute credit to individual members of Congress as presidential approval increases.               "
"19","We also consider the important role of the midterm election cycle in conditioning the president's incentives to issue attribution signing statements. If presidents employ such rhetorical tools to build coalitions, it would seem particularly useful to do so during midterm election years, when MCs will be clamoring for policy recognition and presidents will be trying to minimize the losses historically associated with midterm elections. In addition, it may be that during the midterm election context, MCs are more interested, on balance, in taking issue positions (for electoral reasons) as opposed to bargaining on and passing policy.31 Midterm elections should make the coalition‐building enterprise more challenging as members increasingly focus on their electoral needs. Together this suggests the following:            "
"20","Hypothesis 3.Presidents should be significantly more likely to attribute credit to individual members of Congress during midterm election years.               "
"21","To this point, we have argued that the “when” of credit attribution in the signing statement should respond to key political conditions that shape the ability of presidents to build successful policy coalitions such as divided party control, approval, and midterm elections. Now we will test these claims."
"22","In order to assess the three hypotheses related to when presidents attribute credit to members of Congress, we have marshaled evidence from the 87th through the 110th Congress (3 January 1961 to 3 January 2009). This includes data from 9 presidents, 24 Congresses, and 1,902 signing statements. After examining signing statements going back to the beginning of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, it quickly became clear that data from the 87th to the 110th Congress represent the most appropriate time frame for studying credit attribution in signing statements. Prior to President Kennedy and the 87th Congress, presidents infrequently and sporadically attributed credit through signing statements. Starting with Kennedy, however, a consistent pattern from Congress to Congress began to emerge in which presidents used attribution signing statements as a regular form of interbranch affairs."
"23","The analysis does not include data from the 111th or 112th Congress. During this time, President Barack Obama issued 22 signing statements, only one of which attributed credit to a member of Congress. We exclude these data from our analysis primarily because signing statements became a political liability to the president, which may have altered the strategic calculus for using the tool.32 While this controversy specifically involves the president's constitutional challenges to provisions of law, the kinds of rhetoric that we are concerned with in this article can often be found in these kinds of statements. Todd Garvey suggests that opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel and Statements of Administration Policy may be more preferable tools in the current context.33 As a result, data from the Obama administration are problematic.         "
"24","The primary sources for identifying the signing statements were the University of California, Santa Barbara's American Presidency Project website34 and the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents. These sources were supplemented by searching the U.S. Government Printing Office's Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States and HeinOnline's Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, Herbert Hoover‐Barack Obama (1931–2009). To facilitate our exploration of presidential credit attribution, we coded a dichotomous dependent variable for each signing statement (the unit of analysis) and collected data on several independent variables concerning the larger political context.         "
"25","The dependent variable represents whether the president's signing statement attributes credit to a specific member or members of Congress. This characteristic is the defining feature of what we label an attribution signing statement. The variable takes the value 1 if the signing statement credits a legislator or group of legislators in which individuals are readily identifiable. In all other cases, the variable is coded 0. The dependent variable measures the presence or absence of credit attribution to MCs by the president. In all, 375 of the 1,902 signing statements during this period (19.7 percent) attribute credit to legislators. One possible criticism of our dependent variable is that it simply reflects valence, and by extension, the statistical results could be an artifact of the positive nature of signing statements associated with attribution. Even though the specific act of attributing credit within a signing statement is fundamentally positive in nature, we do not believe this is a problem for our analysis because the empirical literature shows that statements often include a mixture of positive and negative content overall,35 and we repeatedly encountered attribution in signing statements in that context.36"
"26","Figure 1 shows the variation in the percentage of signing statements that attribute credit to individual members from President Kennedy to President George W. Bush (referred to here as Bush Jr.). As one can see, there are considerable differences over time. Attribution signing statements do not make up a large share of all signing statements for some presidents. For instance, Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H.W. Bush (Bush Sr.) are all under 10 percent. Others show a penchant for attributing credit to MCs—Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Bush Jr. all attribute credit to legislators in more than 20 percent of their signing statements.         "
"27","Percentage of Signing Statements with Credit Attribution by President"
"28","Note: The number of attribution signing statements for each president is given in parentheses. Source: Content analysis conducted by the authors.                     "
"29","The theoretical underpinnings of the hypotheses forwarded in the previous sections suggest that political conditions shape presidential incentives toward attribution rhetoric in signing statements in order to foster the president's ability to build legislative coalitions. As a consequence, we constructed several variables associated with the political environment at the time the signing statement was issued: divided government (dichotomous), midterm election year (dichotomous), and presidential approval. Approval numbers were taken from the closest completed Gallup poll on or before the date of the signing statement.37"
"30","The analysis also incorporates a few controls. There is a strong connection in the literature between credit claiming and member reelection. For example, Samuel Kernell argues that “a politician at risk in the next election will have greater interest in receiving credit than in extending it.”38 In that spirit, we control for the possible aggregate demand for credit by Congress through reelection rates. If policy credit were important to MCs for reelection, one would expect changes in reelection rates to be related to the likelihood of credit attribution. Therefore, we incorporate the reelection rate (percent) of House and Senate members seeking reelection.39 The analysis also controls for the relative percentage of the president's party's seats in both chambers. Each variable represents the balance of power in each chamber at the beginning of each new Congress. The percentages do not track shifts attributable to retirements or party switches, and independents are considered part of the party with which they caucus. If there is a partisan dimension to credit attribution, one might think that greater numbers of the president's copartisans in Congress would increase the likelihood presidents share credit with members of their own party relative to the opposition.         "
"31","We also present two models that include dichotomous measures of the bill's relative importance. One measure is whether Congressional Quarterly considers the bill to be a major piece of legislation. The other uses Mayhew's list of important enactments.40"
"32","Because the dependent variable is dichotomous, we turn to logistic regression with fixed effects for presidential administrations to analyze the data and shed light on the three hypotheses associated with the president's ability to build coalitions in Congress."
"33","Table 1 presents three models that are designed to help us understand when presidents attribute credit to members of Congress for legislative accomplishments. The first model includes all signing statements from Kennedy to Bush Jr., while the second and third models incorporate various measures of a bill's importance and only analyze signing statements from Reagan to Bush Jr.         "
"34","As noted earlier, Hypothesis 1 suggests that presidents should be more likely to attribute credit during times of divided government because they are trying to boost their coalition‐building capacity through side payments. Models 1 and 2 build support for this view. The coefficient for divided government is statistically significant, and the effect is in the expected direction in Model 2 and meets a less stringent standard (p < 0.1) in Model 1. The presence of divided government appears to have a positive impact on the likelihood of credit attribution in presidential signing statements. When looking at Model 2, the probability of the president attributing policy credit to a member of Congress in a signing statement increases by 11.5 percent during times of divided government compared with unified government.         "
"35","In regard to approval, Hypothesis 2 asserts that more popular presidents will be less likely to attribute credit to legislators because higher presidential approval levels tend to provide a more favorable context for coalition building. Because high approval attracts more congressional support for presidential policy initiatives,41 presidents are less likely to share credit. They have their own legacies to build, after all. Across the three models, the coefficients for approval in Table 1 indicate that there is statistical support for this assertion. Higher levels of presidential approval are associated with lower levels of attribution activity. When looking at Model 1, credit attribution to MCs is 17.2 percent less likely when we move from the lowest value of presidential approval (.22) to the highest value (.89).         "
"36","The third hypothesis suggests that presidents should be more likely to attribute credit during midterm election years. Credit claiming is a central part of any legislator's reelection strategy, but it is difficult to claim credit for legislative accomplishments beyond particularized benefits.42 None of the models provides evidence of significant attribution activity during midterms. Although the signs of the coefficients are in the expected direction, they are not statistically significant. Still, we remain tentative with any inference about midterm effects until further study: it may be that demand for credit during midterm years is higher, but there are fewer legislative opportunities for presidents to deliver on the demand because of the greater difficulty in passing legislation at election time. We also ran alternative models (not shown here but available upon request) that replace our midterm elections indicator with one for all election years. Across all models, an election year dummy is not statistically significant, and this slight alteration does not change the other results in meaningful ways.         "
"37","The control variables also provide some insight into the question of when members of Congress receive credit from the president in signing statements. The results for the variables % President's Party (House) and % President's Party (Senate) are both positive, but only the former is significant in Model 1 and at a less stringent level (p < 0.1) in Model 2. Interestingly, this suggests that larger numbers of seats held by the president's party in the House tend to increase the likelihood of attribution statements. Model 1 reveals that the probability of credit attribution appearing in a signing statement increases by 42.8 percent when we move from the lowest percentage of the president's party in the House (33.1 percent) to the highest (67.8 percent). We suggested that the president's share of party seats in Congress captures the possibility of a partisan rationale in the distribution of credit to lawmakers. The data seem to support this assertion (at least for the House). To be clear, this result cannot say whether attributions are going to individual MCs in the president's party, only that a greater number of copartisans in the aggregate increases the likelihood of lawmaking attribution. However, the next part of the analysis at the individual level will inform us whether being a member of the president's party increases the chances of lawmaking credit. Partisan distinctions between the chambers may be the result of the fact that presidents regularly have to reach across party boundaries in the Senate to overcome the filibuster.         "
"38","The models also control for the overall stability of the electoral environment by taking into account aggregate incumbent reelection rates in each chamber. If presidents are using attribution signing statements as a means of building and maintaining policy coalitions, then it would make sense for the administration's strategic calculus to be sensitive to whether members are likely to return to office. Across all models, the coefficients for both variables are positive and in the expected direction. However, reelection rates in the Senate do not appear to be significant, while more evidence exists across the three models to support assertions about the importance of reelection rates in the House. This indicates that presidents are more likely to attribute credit to members of Congress when the electoral environment is more stable in the House. It appears that presidents might be more willing to share credit with MCs when they know they will be around to help in the future."
"39","Lastly, Models 2 and 3 take bill‐level characteristics into account. Each includes a different measure of the bill's overall importance. Major legislation, as measured by Congressional Quarterly, has a positive and significant impact on the likelihood of a president using an attribution signing statement. The probability of credit attribution appearing in a signing statement increases by 17.2 percent when the bill is categorized as major legislation. Likewise, Model 3 uses Mayhew's measure of important enactments. This variable also has a positive and significant impact on the use of attribution singing statements. The probability of seeing credit attribution in a signing statement rises by 24 percent when an enactment is deemed important using Mayhew's measure. Clearly, presidents are treating important bills differently. Given the difficult road that many important bills take through Congress, there is likely more of a need to thank crucial coalition members and more demand from legislators for the president's attribution activity.         "
"40","To whom should the president attribute lawmaking credit, and are those individuals critical to building coalitions in Congress? According to Beckmann's work, presidents have two important paths to legislative success in Congress.43 Presidents lobby party leaders to design an agenda to advantage their legislative initiatives and limit the incentives for opposition in the early game. Presidents also seek to influence pivotal voters in the endgame to cement winning coalitions. We expect to find evidence that the president attributes credit to such pivotal lawmakers.         "
"41","A significant amount of literature on voting, institutions, and bargaining has focused on the critical role of the median voter.44 The chamber median reflects the pivotal voter necessary for the creation of a winning coalition. If presidents employ lawmaking credit in signing statements to individual members of Congress as coalition‐building rewards, one would expect the president's credit‐attribution strategies to vary systematically in relation to the chamber's median member. In particular, we expect a member's ideological proximity to the chamber median to increase his or her chances of receiving credit from the president. This suggests the following:            "
"42","Hypothesis 4.Presidents should be significantly less likely to attribute credit to individual MCs as their ideological distance from the chamber median increases.               "
"43","Political parties have historically played a dominant role in forming coalitions in Congress,45 and their significance for coalition building has grown even more vital over the past several decades. Frances Lee's work suggests that presidential leadership of the legislative agenda has significantly sharpened the zero‐sum conflict between the political parties.46 The heightened party conflict increases incentives for individual members of Congress to cooperate with party leaders to achieve the collective goals of their respective parties. Lee demonstrates that presidential leadership on legislation increases cohesion among members of the president's party and similarly unites the opposition party against the president.47 The president is also widely viewed as the leader of his party, and as a result, the president's political fortunes are tied to those of his party.48 By extending credit to individual MCs, the president helps those sharing his party label and, in so doing, helps himself as the leader of that party. As part of their political legacy, presidents may be motivated to help their copartisans in Congress. Because of the critical nature of the president's copartisans in forming supportive coalitions, we expect that presidents will have incentives to disproportionately attribute credit to members of their party compared with members of the opposition.            "
"44","Hypothesis 5.Presidents should be significantly more likely to attribute credit to individual MCs from their own political party compared with opposition party members.               "
"45","Moreover, Congress has witnessed important changes to the policymaking process over time. During the pre‐reform era, policymaking was largely dependent on committee chairs, whereas during the post‐reform era, policymaking power was ceded to party leaders.49 Party leaders control the agenda and other tools that can be used to induce members to toe the party line. Because party leaders have become increasingly important to legislative coalition building, we expect to find evidence that the attribution of credit is directed at party leaders.            "
"46","Hypothesis 6.Presidents should be significantly more likely to attribute lawmaking credit to individual MCs holding party leadership positions compared with rank‐and‐file members.               "
"47","However, the chambers are not created equal when it comes to coalition building. Supermajority requirements in the Senate make it a more challenging environment compared with the majoritarian House. We expect that variation in the president's attribution activity results from different institutional rules related to coalition size rather than differences in the level of demand for credit from members of the House or Senate, as research shows that MCs “run scared” despite their margin of victory in previous elections50 and that higher levels of credit‐claiming activity translate into higher approval ratings.51 That is to say, intense electoral pressures drive members from both chambers toward Mayhewian behaviors. Thus, if presidents attribute credit for coalition‐building purposes, we might expect the president's attribution of credit to be aimed more at senators than at House members.            "
"48","Hypothesis 7.Presidents should be significantly more likely to attribute lawmaking credit to senators compared with House members.               "
"49","Similarly, the operation of parties and party influence is by no means equal between the chambers because of important procedural and institutional differences.52 Senate leaders tend to wield relatively less power over the agenda and their rank and file compared with House leaders. Although we expect party leaders to be important targets generally because of their key role in coalition building, one might expect presidents to reward powerful House leaders more so than leaders in the more egalitarian Senate. That is, the House leadership's greater ability to coerce members into winning coalitions should make House leaders more likely to receive credit from presidents relative to their Senate counterparts. This discussion suggests one final testable expectation.            "
"50","Hypothesis 8.Presidents should be significantly more likely to attribute lawmaking credit to House party leaders compared with Senate party leaders.               "
"51","With these expectations in hand, we move to test these final claims."
"52","The second part of the empirical analysis seeks to understand whom presidents target in attribution signing statements. Which legislators receive credit from the president? What are their characteristics? We argue that presidents attribute credit in the signing statement as a reward for key coalition partners and to improve future prospects for coalition building in Congress. To tackle these questions, another unique data set was created using the text of the 375 attribution signing statements that were identified from the entire population of all signing statements. Each signing statement was read, and the names of legislators were extracted. These statements frequently contain the names of multiple MCs. The attribution statements named 935 individual members, some of whom were mentioned in more than one attribution signing statement in a given Congress. Members mentioned multiple times in a Congress were counted just once, yielding a total of 705 members who received credit from an attribution signing statement. Cases in which presidents attributed credit to members of a committee or another identifiable grouping of legislators, and instances in which the legislator could not be distinguished from other legislators (typically occurring because of common surnames), were excluded from the data. There were 58 such cases that were dropped from the analysis."
"53","From this, we created an individual‐level data set containing all members from the 87th to the 110th Congress (n = 13,013) so that the characteristics of individual members receiving credit can be compared with those who do not receive credit. The individual‐level data set also records a number of characteristics such as the total number of mentions for each member per Congress and CS DW‐NOMINATE scores to capture the spatial location of legislators.53"
"54","Thus, the unit of analysis is the individual member by Congress. The data cover the same time frame as the previous analysis (87th through 110th Congress). The dependent variable is dichotomous, coded 1 if the individual member received credit from an attribution signing statement during a respective Congress and 0 otherwise."
"55","To assess the prior arguments about key coalition partners and whom presidents should target, we coded a series of dichotomous variables identifying members of the president's party, members holding party leadership positions, and whether members are in the House or Senate. We also created measures to capture each member's ideological location relative to the chamber median."
"56","The basic argument revolves around the idea that presidents attribute credit to members as rewards for their key roles as coalition partners or as chits that could make them more likely to join future coalitions. Over time, members of the president's party have become vital to coalitions in Congress. As a consequence, we expect the rank and file of the president's party to be more likely to receive credit than opposition members. The analysis incorporates a dichotomous variable to discern whether individual members were from the president's party or the opposition. Likewise, because party leaders are vital coalition partners,54 we include a couple of dichotomous leadership indicators that distinguish top leadership positions in the House and in the Senate. We also suggest important differences between the chambers. Barbara Sinclair, for example, has shown the critical role of the Senate filibuster.55 The Senate's contemporary reputation as a legislative graveyard is well earned empirically. That said, coalition building is no panacea, but the hurdles in the Senate are relatively higher and more formidable than those in the House. Therefore, the analysis includes a dummy to designate senators from House members.         "
"57","We also incorporate several additional controls in the analysis, such as a dichotomous variable for divided government and the spatial distance of individual members from their chamber median. As we elaborated earlier, the literature on credit claiming suggests that divided government creates greater uncertainty among voters about who is responsible for policies. Under this scenario, the president's attribution of credit may be particularly important for individual members. The spatial distance variable represents the absolute difference between the individual member's CS DW‐NOMINATE and the chamber median. The idea is to assess the importance of a member's ideological difference from the chamber median in the president's decision to attribute credit. The chamber median is pivotal to coalition building, so the president's rhetorical rewards should be particularly responsive to the median member."
"58","Figure 2 provides a simple overview of the individual‐level attribution data. The figure reveals the total number of MCs receiving credit from the president in attribution signing statements. Figure 2 shows that Kennedy, Nixon, and Ford represent low points, with only a few instances of attribution each (3, 7, and 15 cases, respectively). Yet Lyndon B. Johnson frequently thanked MCs who were influential in the legislative process (65 cases). Credit attribution exploded during the Carter administration, with well over 374 cases, and the Reagan administration continued this practice at a high volume, with 258 cases. Attribution slowed considerably under Bush Sr. (22 cases) but saw a brief renaissance under Clinton's watch (129 cases). Lastly, Bush Jr. (62 cases) returned to approximately the same levels as LBJ.         "

"61","Carter's proclivity for credit attribution is a puzzle upon first examination. His administration is often portrayed as being incompetent when it comes to congressional relations.56 Yet he used the attribution signing statement more than any other president. Paul Light's research may help us understand the forces that shaped Carter's attribution behavior in signing statements.57 In particular, Light outlines what he calls the “no win presidency,” pointing to two forces that are relevant to this discussion.58 First, there was a backlog of legislation from the Nixon and Ford years that increased congressional competition for limited domestic agenda space.59 That is to say, Congress started exercising more control over setting the congressional agenda. Second, the rise of subcommittee government meant that “legislation must now pass through more stops on the road to enactment.”60 Rule changes made it so that more MCs touched a bill as it moved through the legislative process. These forces likely played a significant role in Carter's outlier status.         "
"62","Figure 3 brings ideology into the discussion. The figure shows the ideological distribution of the MCs who received credit from various presidential administrations. All administrations with fewer than 20 cases were excluded from the figure to facilitate comparisons on the same scale. Some interesting patterns emerge in the six cells of Figure 3. Both the LBJ and Carter administrations are skewed toward giving credit to liberal members of Congress. Starting with Reagan, Figure 3 begins to reveal a trend toward more bimodal ideological distributions of credit attribution. These distributions are likely linked to the presence of divided government during all four of these presidencies and increased ideological polarization among the parties in government. Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, and Bush Jr. all felt the pain of having the House controlled by the opposing party at one time or another. These four presidents were forced to reach out to the other side of the ideological spectrum with their coalition‐building efforts in attribution signing statements.         "

"65","In times of increasing polarization, there may be additional benefits to attributing credit to ideologically disparate members. For one, presidents may reap political capital and public support for seeming bipartisan in their attribution strategies. By highlighting the ideological diversity of their coalition partners, presidents may not only parade their bipartisan bona fides but also provide political cover or at least make ideological attacks on such policy less convincing. Whether credit receivers are from the president's party (or not), Figure 3 shows that presidents do not simply give credit to members who are ideologically like‐minded. Rather, presidents sometimes give credit to members who are ideologically distant from their own positions, which is consistent with the coalition‐building argument.         "
"66","Figures 4 and 5 show some support for the assertion that members of the president's party and senators are in a privileged position when it comes to credit attribution. Figure 4 lends some preliminary support to Hypothesis 5 by showing that members of the president's party seem to enjoy more credit from the president in most circumstances. In fact, Figure 4 illustrates that at least a majority of attributions each Congress were from the president's party, with the exception of George W. Bush's last two years (110th Congress), when it seems congressional Republicans wanted to purposefully distance themselves from the toxic approval ratings of the administration. In addition, Figure 5 appears to indicate that senators also enjoy a privileged position (supporting Hypothesis 7). As Figure 5 shows, senators typically make up 40 percent to 60 percent of the president's attribution. When considering the relative size of each chamber (435 House members and 100 Senators), these percentages are more impressive. So, despite the lower chamber's reputation for being the legislative workhorse, it is the membership from the upper chamber that receives a disproportionate amount of attention in terms of presidential credit attribution.

"71","Moving beyond these simple trends, Table 2 presents the logistic regression with presidential fixed effects designed to assess Hypotheses 4–8 and explain who receives credit from attribution signing statements. To begin, the results support Hypothesis 4 and reflect the important pull of the chamber medians on the likelihood of credit attribution. In particular, as the absolute ideological difference of an individual member from his or her chamber median increases, the likelihood of credit attribution decreases significantly. Moving from the minimum ideological distance from the median (0) to the maximum (1.19) decreases the probability of attribution by 1.7 percent. We also ran models with alternative measures of ideological distance (for example, the absolute distance between legislators and the median of the president's party and the absolute distance between legislators and the president). The alternative distance measures yielded very similar findings. That is, the further a MC was from the chamber median, the president's party, or the president, the less likely she would receive credit from the president. Regardless of the alternative ideological distance measures used, the substantive findings from the other variables remained consistent and robust (the results of these alternative models are available upon request).         "
"72","The effects of the president's party indicator are in the expected direction, statistically significant, and support the expectation from Hypothesis 5 regarding the importance of attributing credit to the president's copartisans in Congress. The model shows that being a member of the president's party increases the probability of policy credit from the president by 1.9 percent compared with members of the opposition party. Interestingly, the results for the leadership indicators support Hypothesis 6 and the general proclivity of presidents to target party leaders with lawmaking credit. Holding a House leadership position significantly increases the likelihood of credit attribution; however, the comparative effect for Senate leaders is somewhat less substantively important. That is, the probability of receiving credit increases by 13.2 percent for House leaders but only 3 percent for Senate leaders. These findings support the expectation of bicameral differences for party leadership forwarded in Hypothesis 8. This leadership distinction contrasts notably with the results for Senate rank‐and‐file members. Indeed, there is strong support for Hypothesis 7 regarding House and Senate differences in receiving lawmaking credit. The Senate indicator suggests that being a senator (compared with a House member) significantly increases the probability of receiving credit by 5.8 percent. So, Senate leaders seem not as important compared with House leaders in terms of the president's attribution of credit, but individual senators are more likely to receive credit than House members."
"73","Lastly, divided government was included in the model to control for the larger political context along with presidential fixed effects. Divided government does not play a significant role on whether members received credit from the president during a particular Congress."
"74","Altogether, the logit analysis explaining who receives credit is revealing and strongly supports the argument that the president uses credit in attribution signing statements to target key coalition partners. Not to diminish the many obvious qualities of presidents, these results do not suggest they simply distribute credit out of some inherent goodwill. Rather, these results reflect strategic calculations by the president about who the critical coalition partners are or will be in the future."
"75","We look at one last piece of evidence in order to assess a competing argument that presidents may attribute credit to lawmakers based on those who are most responsible for writing and/or developing the legislation. In other words, it may be that presidents use credit attribution in the signing statements to simply thank the deserving bill sponsors, who tend to have the greatest investment in the legislation. To assess this, Table 3 provides the relative frequency of times that a specific named member in the attribution signing statement was the original sponsor of a relevant bill. The table shows that the percentage of bill sponsors named in attribution signing statements is quite low, ranging from 0 percent during the 102nd and 109th Congresses to 50 percent in the 108th Congress. Clearly, the patterns suggest that the typical percentage of bill sponsors receiving credit attribution by Congress is relatively small, and the overall percentage is only about 13 percent. This suggests that presidents are not simply thanking members of Congress for their legislative work and sponsoring the legislation. Rather, as our earlier analyses suggest, the president's strategy in attribution signing statements revolves around building the president's capacity for coalition and party building.         "
"76","Signing statements provide a unique framework for studying the politics of credit in interbranch relations. These are moments of staged political theater at a time when many in the press and other interested parties are paying attention. There is opportunity in these moments, and both presidents and legislators realize that simple truth. For the most part, analysis of these statements has been confined to the constitutional challenges to provisions of law that presidents often make,61 while the rhetorical uses of the tool have been understudied.62 This is unfortunate because signing statements provide a rich history of interbranch relations apart from constitutional conflict.         "
"77","Our work emphasizes an important rhetorical aspect of the signing statement. Indeed, the analysis presented here suggests that presidents are often willing to share the spotlight with lawmakers and engage in the politics of credit. To better understand the politics of credit between the president and MCs, we asked two simple questions: when is credit attributed, and to whom is credit attributed? To answer the first question, we looked at all known signing statements from the 87th to the 110th Congress. We argued that credit attribution to members of Congress should hinge on conditions that shape the president's ability to form winning legislative coalitions. The results of the analysis largely support that thesis (Table 1). For example, the models in Table 1 show some support that the context of divided government increases the likelihood of attribution signing statements. The models also illustrate an inverse relationship between a president's public standing and the issuance of attribution signing statements. Overall, when conditions are more formidable for coalition building, presidents become more likely to distribute policy credit to members of Congress.         "
"78","Although there are limitations to the analysis, we find evidence consistent with the credit‐claiming literature regarding congressional demand for lawmaking credit.63 Here, we find a positive relationship between incumbent reelection rates in the House and the likelihood that presidents give lawmaking credit to individual MCs. Similarly, the model results from Table 1 illustrate that attribution signing statements are significantly more likely on major legislation. Presidents not only seem to target these major enactments for coalition‐building rewards, but also these tend to be the kinds of broad national policies that are more difficult for MCs to take credit for on their own compared with more narrow particularistic bills. In addition, the logit models from Table 1 show a partisan rationale in attribution signing statements—namely, that presidents are significantly more likely to shower lawmaking credit when their party controls more seats in the majoritarian House.         "
"79","In order to answer the second question (to whom credit is attributed), we closely looked into every single instance of credit attribution that occurred in signing statements during the period under study. The statistical analysis at the individual level identifies the pivotal MCs in coalition building and reveals the importance of changes in the nature of the political parties. This is important because we see that the politics of credit is influenced by who holds power in Congress, especially the party leadership. On this point, the logit model in the second part of the analysis illustrates that party leaders are significantly more likely to receive credit than the rank‐and‐file membership. However, leaders are evidently not treated equally when it comes to distributing lawmaking credit. Although holding leadership positions significantly increase the likelihood of credit attribution across both chambers, the effect of being a House leader on the probability of receiving credit is more than four times that of being a Senate leader. This finding highlights the value of party leaders in coalition building. The results also show that presidents are significantly more likely to distribute credit to senators as opposed to members from the lower chamber. This reflects the reality of the modern Senate, which consistently empowers individual senators and puts up supermajoritarian roadblocks to passing legislation."
"80","In addition, the logit model illustrates that holding a seat in the president's party significantly increases the likelihood of receiving credit. Winning policy coalitions have become more partisan in nature, and presidential leadership of the agenda heightens such conflict.64 Because of this, presidents have turned their credit attribution strategies largely in favor of their copartisans in Congress. Despite the tendency for presidents to target credit receivers toward the chamber median, we can see from the results that polarization in Congress has made other characteristics far more important to the president's calculations. In fact, the effects of individual member distance from the chamber median are the smallest of all the variables in our model. The evidence (especially from Figure 3) speaks to the fact that presidents are not locked in the habit of attributing lawmaking credit to their ideological brothers and sisters. However, the overall story we uncover suggests that the president uses credit attribution as a prod or inducement to pave the way for successful legislative coalitions in Congress and such attribution has increasingly targeted members of their political party. Our analysis shows credit claiming to be a crucial yet understudied interbranch process, one that interacts with the president's desire for coalition building and Congress's hunger for lawmaking credit.         "
"81","Members of Congress face a collective action problem in policymaking. As Fenno reminds us, the business of policymaking in Congress is collective, but the incentive to claim credit rests with the individual.65 Indeed, the literature on credit claiming tends to be almost exclusively focused on reelection‐minded members of Congress. However, this analysis moves the needle toward a richer interbranch discussion, one in which credit is no less important to MCs but that explicitly accounts for the president's leverage in distributing lawmaking credit. There is great demand for policy responsibility, and the context of attribution signing statements presents a powerful opportunity to understand how political conditions shape the president's incentive to reward members of Congress. Perhaps more importantly, the analysis yields a coalition‐building profile of which members presidents value to receive such attribution rewards. In return, presidents have a stronger hand to sway key coalition partners and help members from their own political parties.         "
"82","Future research should delve deeper into how MCs use credit attributed by the president and to what extent such credit can help or hurt their political goals. A larger emphasis could also be placed on incorporating bill‐level characteristics into statistical models of credit attribution to help disentangle more strategic uses of credit attribution from instances in which credit is simply being provided to those who crafted the legislation. For example, additional data on bill sponsorship or veto threats might provide insight. Finally, the interbranch dynamics of lawmaking credit promises to be a phenomenon that reaches beyond American politics. Research in comparative politics clearly shows that legislators seek to cultivate their personal reputations, and we hope that our research will spur interest in how other political actors might help support that mission.66 We suspect that this kind of analysis will be particularly fruitful in other presidential democracies—but these lines of inquiry will wait for another day.
