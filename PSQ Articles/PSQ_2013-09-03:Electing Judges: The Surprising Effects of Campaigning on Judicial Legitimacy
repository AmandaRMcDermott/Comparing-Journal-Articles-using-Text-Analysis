"1","As judicial elections at the state Supreme Court level have changed over the years, some scholars in the legal community and political science circles have reacted with alarm at the changes. Armed with a few anecdotes, these critics of judicial elections have offered wild claims about the harms inflicted on the populace and the courts by judicial elections, claims that are sometimes even less scientifically grounded than Aristotle's theory of spontaneous generation. However, recent books by G. Alan Tarr and James L. Gibson skillfully confront these fears proffered by critics in an unbiased and analytical manner."
"2","In Electing Judges, Gibson uses mostly experimental data to examine the claims that politicized judicial campaigning weakens the public's views of the legitimacy of state courts. Gibson's book is based in part on earlier works he published, though the book expands the scope and depth of these earlier analyses. Much of the study is based on a three‐wave panel survey conducted by telephone in Kentucky before, during, and after the 2006 elections. The crux of the surveys involved experimental vignettes read to respondents on the phone, though other information was also extracted about the respondents' knowledge and views of Kentucky courts, as well as attention to the 2006 judicial elections. As Gibson notes, critics worry particularly about three aspects of campaigns that could cause harm to public perceptions of courts: campaign contributions, attack ads, and judicial candidates' discussion of policy issues that may later come before the court.         "
"3","In chapter 2, Gibson analyzes how participants in the survey reacted to a hypothetical candidate accepting campaign contributions, making policy statements, or engaging in attack ads. Gibson finds that respondents reacted negatively to vignettes in which a judicial candidate accepted contributions from interest groups or potential litigants to the court. In short, fears from critics about the rising costs of judicial campaigns and the questions raised about “justice for sale” could be warranted. On the other hand, Gibson finds no evidence that attack ads or policy discussions on controversial subjects by judicial candidates substantially harms judicial legitimacy. In another wave of the survey, in chapter 3, Gibson shows that extreme policy statements by candidates, such as the specific promise to rule a certain way in abortion cases, could also cause harm to perceptions of courts and candidates. Thus, the findings are somewhat of a mixed bag, but certainly do not vindicate the critics of elections."
"4","The most interesting aspects of the book are Gibson's expositions on expectancy theory in chapter 5 and his findings in chapter 6. Gibson wants his readers to focus on what the citizenry want from courts as a way to understand what is driving peoples' reactions to politicized campaign rhetoric and hence their perceptions of court legitimacy. Gibson finds that generally, many citizens expect the Kentucky Supreme Court “to represent their views on policy issues it decides” (p. 102). But most importantly, the public's views of what courts should do vary widely, and thus not everyone will respond uniformly to politicized judicial campaigning. The most important and striking finding in the book is that the 2006 Kentucky judicial elections actually enhanced the public's overall perceptions of legitimacy. The panel survey allowed Gibson to measure Kentuckians' views of their state Supreme Court before and after the election, and chapter 6 indicates that the 2006 election elevated peoples' views of the Court.         "
"5","Gibson perhaps exaggerates the effects of the U.S. Supreme Court case Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, a decision that struck down state judicial speech codes and liberalized candidate speech. There is no evidence that politicized judicial rhetoric is widespread in lower court elections or that White has done anything to change the tone of lower court elections—for example, Brian Arbour and Mark McKenzie, “Campaign Messages in Lower Court Elections After Republican Party of Minnesota v. White.” And in state Supreme Court elections, while more politicized rhetoric exists compared to 30 years ago, the levels of polarizing rhetoric are often overstated, as Tarr alludes to in Without Fear or Favor. Second, the book can be quite technical at times, which, while necessary if Gibson is to convince us of the veracity of his findings, can also hamper the book finding a wider audience among policymakers. But, these are minor quibbles with what is overall an excellent study.         "
"6","In Without Fear or Favor, Tarr offers a thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the claims and counterclaims made by critics and supporters of judicial elections. In his first two chapters, Tarr puts the debate over judicial elections in historical context. Many state constitutional conventions turned to elective courts after the 1840s, partly as a way to give courts more independence from state legislatures. Tarr notes how those who debate judicial elections fail to appreciate the historical context in which they originated. In later chapters, Tarr outlines the current debate about judicial elections—the search for accountability and independence. He eloquently points out the inconsistencies and problems in the arguments of each side. Tarr concludes that while judicial elections are not without problems, the critics' claims that elections “threaten judicial independence and hence judicial impartiality” cannot withstand scholarly scrutiny” (p. 150). The question, then, is how to address the flaws of judicial elections. In the final chapter, Tarr offers a host of ideas, from reforming disqualification and recusal rules, to possibly implementing the public financing of elections, to offering a single nonrenewable term. All of these reforms, as Tarr notes, have potential drawbacks. He concludes with a rather interesting recommendation of popular constitutionalism as a way of protecting judicial independence while holding judges accountable. Voters should be allowed to hold referendums to overturn certain undesirable decisions of the state Supreme Court without necessarily having to vote the judges out of office—a way of correcting judicial overreach without punishing the judge. Tarr's book is well‐crafted and should be easily accessible to legal academics, policymakers, and the broader lay public. Hopefully, these audiences will read and seriously consider the arguments and recommendations put forth by both Tarr and Gibson.         "
