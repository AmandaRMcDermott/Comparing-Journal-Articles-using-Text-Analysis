"1","Nation building, to borrow a phrase from a bygone era, humbles politicians, soldiers, and scholars alike. In the American experience, so the argument goes, a can‐do spirit, naiveté, and a disdain for local knowledge leads headlong into the morass. The effort to rescue failed states from chaos by reconstituting a government that can exercise sovereignty over its territory consumes blood, treasure, and the best‐laid plans at unsustainable rates. It always seems to end up in the same way, a variation on Rudyard Kipling's epitaph."
"2","In this incisive and empirically rich treatise, however, David A. Lake offers strategically valuable insights into why state building, the effort to reconstitute failed states, is an extraordinarily difficult undertaking. Lake notes that a strategic dilemma inherent in state building often dooms the enterprise to failure. To gain legitimacy, emerging leaders must represent local interests to some extent to create the political economy that can lead disparate groups to “buy into” the emerging government. Outsiders only engage in state building because they have a different set of interests at stake, specifically, their own. As Lake notes, it is only a happy coincidence when these two sets of interests coincide, which produces a hopeless and self‐destructive dynamic. The more an outside party cares about local developments, the less likely they are to let local interests hold sway, preferring to install a leadership that will champion their interests. The leadership installed by outsiders, in turn, inherently lacks credibility and legitimacy with the locals, creating a situation in which the new government becomes highly dependent on its outside patrons. Dependence creates leverage needed to extract more resources from the outside power, which further reduces the local legitimacy of the government, which prompts deeper penetration by the outside power, which further detaches the government from local support, and so on.         "
"3","Because states do not intervene to restore order in failed states when their interests are not heavily engaged, reconstruction efforts that favor local interests rarely occur. Lake identifies the U.S. intervention in Somalia as a case in point: when modest humanitarian intervention turned into state building that ended in a firefight on the streets of Mogadishu, Washington quickly decided that the game was not worth the candle. When local interests do coincide with the priorities of the intervening states, for example, in West Germany and Japan, governments emerge that secure legitimacy. Nevertheless, in Lake's view, this is largely a matter happenstance that rarely influences the outside power's decision to intervene."
"4","Lake alludes to but does not emphasize an additional factor that can lead to success. When failed states face outside threats, domestic factions can coalesce into legitimate governments in the absence of outside intervention. Somaliland and the Kurdish Regional Government brought together disparate groups to form legitimate governments without overt outside intervention. This also characterized the situation in Japan and West Germany in the aftermath of World War II—the Soviet bear and the threat of communism loomed on the horizon, which highlighted the benefits of joining the Pax Americana to local constituents."
"5","The Statebuilder's Dilemma is a rare work in political science because it actually is about politics. It offers a sophisticated explanation of what might best be described as the political economy of foreign intervention. Lake also is an unrepentant realist, forgoing sentimentalism and a knee‐jerk anti‐Americanism to focus on the dynamic that animates all efforts to salvage failed states. The work is strategic in its focus. Instead of offering a linear explanation of failed intervention that focuses on the incompetence or ignorance of the intervening party, Lake explains how competing political preferences lead to suboptimal outcomes, despite good intentions and the expenditure much national treasure. Under these circumstances, greater interest and effort on the part of the outside power only exacerbates the state builder's dilemma, vectoring the long march ever deeper into the swamp. Rarely does one encounter a volume that provides such a compelling explanation of the nexus of strategy where military operations directly effect critical political outcomes and desired political outcomes shape military strategy. One can only hope that before the next failed state rises to the top of agendas, policymakers, and commanders in the field take the time to read Lake's book.         "
