"1","Over the past 20 years, biology has grown ascendant in the social sciences. Spurred by advances in genomics, neuroscience, and evolutionary psychology, a gaggle of scholars are exploring the biological underpinnings of human social and political behavior. Within political science, no one has done more to advance this research agenda than John R. Hibbing, Kevin B. Smith, and John A. Alford. In scores of imaginative experiments, novel studies, and research articles, they have identified numerous biological correlates to political attitudes, particularly ideology. They have truly been at the forefront of introducing a biological perspective on human politics. Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences is their effort to translate this research for a popular audience.         "
"2","And translate they do! Predisposed is that rarity among political science books—a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable read. Hibbing, Smith, and Alford do a wonderful job of transforming a highly complex subject matter into an accessible and compelling narrative. They weave together fascinating vignettes with artful overviews of cutting‐edge research on physiology, neuroscience, and genetics. With great wit and aplomb, they explain everything from how to interpret a correlation coefficient to the dispersal of genetic traits across a population.         "
"3","Most impressively, they avoid the pitfall that plagues so many attempts to popularize research on biology and human behavior: oversimplification. Predisposed is a book that fully embraces the nuances and ambiguities of its subject matter. Biology undoubtedly shapes political attitudes, but it does so in often indirect and circuitous ways. Our genes predispose us toward certain temperaments, but so do our life histories; liberals and conservatives exhibit a remarkable range of physiological and neurological differences, but these are highly sensitive to people's environments. Hibbing, Smith, and Alford rarely succumb to simple generalizations or make overstated claims but, instead, almost always keep the uncertainties of their research well in sight.         "
"4","For of all these virtues, Predisposed is not without its shortcomings. Most of these are inherent in its subject matter. By themselves, biology and politics are incredibly complex phenomena; together, their complexity grows exponentially. For all of the advances in gene sequencing and neuroscience, our knowledge of human psychophysiology is still quite limited. Although the authors make a great case that biology matters for human politics, they are still highly constrained in their ability to specify how. And this, unfortunately, dilutes the book's impact.         "
"5","This is most evident in the book's primary subject: ideology. Hibbing, Smith, and Alford use comparisons between liberals and conservatives as the central thread weaving together their disparate studies. But while biology may divide liberals and conservatives, it is a division that largely separates the narrow tails of the distribution. In other words, most people's political preferences (and phenotypic traits) are not at the extremes but tightly clumped in the middle, often where explicit ideologies have little or no relevance. Where biology is likely to have its biggest impact on politics is not in the varying disgust sensitivities or apprehensions of red and blue elites but in the heuristic and emotional biases of the largely purple masses. Yet research on the biology of judgment and political decision making remains nascent, as is our ability to answer the “So what?” question."
"6","This criticism aside, Predisposed is still a terrific read. It can not only teach you how to think about biology and social science but also keep you engaged and laughing while it does so. It deserves to be on the syllabus of any undergraduate course in political behavior or the nightstand of anyone curious about biology and politics.         "
