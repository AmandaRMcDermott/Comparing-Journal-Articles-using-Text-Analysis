"1","U.S. foreign policy history is experiencing a renaissance among scholars of international relations, who in the past too frequently spurned its rich volumes as either too American or too historical to be suitable for testing their theories. Building on landmark works by Fareed Zakaria and Scott Silverstone, Jeffrey W. Meiser has crafted a valuable study investigating “the puzzle of American underexpansion” between the Spanish‐American War and World War II (p. xiv)."
"2","Anyone who recognizes names like Julius Caesar and Napoleon would likely offer the same answer to the question, what do rising powers do? They use their growing resources to expand their territory; so the conventional wisdom goes, and it reflects most of human history. Yet this pattern was defied by the United States, which—for all its international interventions during the period that Meiser examines—exercised considerable restraint compared with what it might have done. Why did rising U.S. power not produce more expansionist foreign policies?"
"3","With admirable clarity, Meiser explains how institutional characteristics (separation of powers, public opinion, federalism) and prevailing norms (anti‐imperialism) combined to limit the ability of expansionists within the U.S. government to pursue their goals. He tests this theory by examining 34 U.S. foreign policy decisions spanning administrations from William McKinley to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Most of these cases involve opportunities for military interventions in Central American or Caribbean countries, and Meiser describes how institutional and normative constraints often caused U.S. leaders to delay, limit, or even reject those opportunities."
"4","This book makes several notable contributions, and as a result it should be of interest to a wide range of readers. Perhaps its greatest strength is the case studies, which strike an impressive balance between detail and efficiency. Averaging less than seven pages each, they distill the historical literature into readable overviews of many understudied episodes, making the book an excellent primer on this era of U.S. foreign policy. The book should also be significant for those interested in power transitions, widely thought to be uniquely prone to major war. By showing how a rising United States—which Meiser considers a “potential hegemon” during that era—pursued a relatively restrained foreign policy, the book provides fresh insight into the complexity of predicting the future behavior of a rising China."
"5","That said, sharp readers will find lingering questions. Looming largest is the theory's inability to explain the enormous U.S. annexations of territory before the Civil War. Meiser writes this period off as “irrelevant,” saying his theory is meant to explain the behavior of rising powers, which the United States was not until the 1850s (p. xxix), yet this evasive maneuver is unconvincing. Not only was the United States rising from its inception within the North American system (if not the European one), but also Meiser's independent variables (institutional and normative) do not depend on rising power status to activate themselves. The case selection also occasionally raises questions, as when President Woodrow Wilson's 1915 invasion of Haiti is considered “expansion” and FDR's 1934 withdrawal from Haiti “restraint,” rendering the full occupation a net zero on the overall record. Further, the labeling of some cases as “delayed expansion,” while accurate, is misleading because they remain cases of expansion and not restraint in any meaningful sense (think of the 1898 annexation of Hawaii). Indeed, a plausible recoding of the pre‐Depression cases shows 9 restraint, 10 limited expansion, and 9 expansion—still more restrained than was possible, but less so than the book suggests. Such shortcomings are common among studies of the nebulous concept of “expansion,” however, and ultimately detract little from the significance and usefulness of Power and Restraint.         "
