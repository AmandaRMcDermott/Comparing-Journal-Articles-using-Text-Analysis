"1","“I contradict myself/I am large, I contain multitudes.” So wrote our great American poet, Walt Whitman. James A. Morone's new collection of essays, The Devils We Know, reflects Whitman's spirit in contemplating the raucous, contrapuntal nature of American political culture (and two of the 14 essays invoke the quotation).         "
"2","In the opening essay, “Is There an American Political Culture?,” Morone identifies four strands of the American ethos: individualism, reflected in Louis Hartz's famous elaboration of the American liberal tradition; communitarianism and what Morone calls the “search for social capital” (p. 21); ascriptive, or us‐versus‐them politics; and the morality tradition, embodied in the utopian puritanical idea of a “city on a hill.” Morone argues that American culture is all of these strands. We Americans have not forged anything like a consensus about how to live together."
"3","Morone makes his own sympathies clear enough. In his final chapter, reflecting on “Who We Are?” in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, Morone delights in what he found while attending a parade: “every language, every color, every nationality,” reflective of what has always been an ever‐changing “raucous, vibrant and evolving culture” (p. 208)."
"4","Despite that rosy embrace of America's multitudinous nature, Morone has practical, moral, and philosophical concerns. He has written extensively about health care policy debates, and this collection includes versions of several such pieces. Health care, for Morone, is where the rubber hits the road: American political culture complicates and continuously threatens to derail efforts to provide minimally decent health care to all Americans."
"5","For example, the liberal story we like to tell ourselves is that we are a nation of self‐sufficient individuals who need nothing more than to be freed from the intrusive hand of government to realize the American dream. As a consequence, many decry the “rationing” inherent in universal systems as a threat to individual liberty. In fact, however, while “the very notion of rationing alarms people on all sides . . . few health care systems anywhere are as heavily rationed as America's” (p. 45). After all, Morone notes, “the first procedure in any health care setting is the inevitable ‘wallet biopsy’” (p. 45). Indeed, our jury‐rigged social welfare system is maddeningly bureaucratic, intrusive, inefficient, and often simply nonsensical, the very emblem of lumbering government that the liberal tradition compels us to abhor. Indeed, when it comes to health care, other wealthy countries deliver it both more universally and less bureaucratically."
"6","Our multivalent political culture yields other contradictions. We celebrate “limited government” while maintaining the largest carceral state in the world. We denounce “welfare” while jealously guarding those massive government programs, Social Security and Medicare. “We might want to resist seat belts or motorcycle helmets,” Morone writes. “But keeping ‘them’ from liquor or cocaine or deviant sexual behavior is another story” (p. 39).         "
"7","In “Enemies of the People,” Morone shows the connection between recurring waves of moral panic and efforts to curtail policy‐based attempts to extend social welfare. For example, the decades of temperance activism that resulted in Prohibition also coincided with tight controls on immigration, imposed in the 1920s and not rescinded until the 1960s. Morone says that emphasis on personal behavior and morality, although typically couched as a commonsense effort to fight a genuine social ill, is frequently a cover for “status anxiety” and ascriptive politics."
"8","In all, The Devils We Know is a lively, readable collection of reflections on the particular vectors by which we Americans both exalt and lament our national community, part and parcel of a larger paradox—that fractiousness, not unity, seems to be the binding agent of our society.         "
