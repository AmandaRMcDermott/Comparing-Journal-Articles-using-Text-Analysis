"1","AT THE STATE LEVEL, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) represents the increasing role of subfederal governments in the policy intersection of immigration and U.S. domestic policies.1 PRWORA allows each state to determine its own eligibility requirements for legal immigrants to access welfare programs, resulting in a fragmentation of immigrant social rights and immigrant policies across states. As a result, many states adopted restrictive policies or “welfare chauvinism,” defined as a preference for restricting immigrant access to social programs.2 For example, only 19 states granted immigrants arriving after the passage of PRWORA, post‐enactment, access to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) during the federal five‐year ban.3 In the end, the patchwork of immigrant social rights leaves us asking why some states restricted immigrant access to TANF and others did not.         "
"2","Until recently, the differences among the states in citizenship eligibility requirements remained largely understudied, despite the important role that immigration plays in reshaping the American political landscape.4 Previous research has highlighted the central role of public opinion as a measure of states’ willingness to grant social citizenship rights to immigrants and to adopt anti‐immigrant policies. For example, Deborah Schildkraut finds that states with larger immigrant populations and more ballot initiatives are more likely to adopt anti‐immigrant policies.5 Unfortunately, the available proxies and measures of public opinion, such as racial demographics and conservatism, limit our understanding of the opinion–policy linkage to what Rodney E. Hero and Robert R. Preuhs call an ideological interpretation.6 I agree that state legislatures did respond to public opinion when considering immigrant access to welfare programs. But, more importantly, these program reforms, shaped by public mood, are based less on economic and ideological considerations and more on authoritarianism, specifically, concerns over social conformity.         "
"3","Authoritarianism is a general orientation “concerned with the appropriate balance between group authority and uniformity, on the one hand, and individual autonomy and diversity, on the other hand.”7 To the extent that perceptions of social threat from nonconformity underlie anti‐immigration attitudes and preferences for restricting immigrant access to welfare, authoritarianism should influence adopted welfare policies. The components of the PRWORA policy reforms, such as policies designed to enforce social norms by conditioning access to welfare rights on “proper” behavior in order to maintain social order, appeal to authoritarians.8 As a result, welfare policy is “one of the key defining structures of social and political inclusion and exclusion in the modern nation‐state.”9 To test these assertions, I estimate original state‐level measures of authoritarianism using multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP).10 The MRP estimates of authoritarianism are included in statistical models predicting whether states adopted policies restricting immigrants’ access to TANF in 1998. The statistical evidence indicates that states with higher macro levels of authoritarianism are more likely to restrict immigrant access to welfare programs.         "
"4","Despite the fact that welfare programs lack racial and ethnic eligibility requirements, TANF can be viewed as a multicultural policy because the public perceives that minorities disproportionately benefit from welfare programs.11 As a result, one of the more potent domestic political issues to be linked with the immigration debate is whether immigrants should be eligible to receive welfare benefits, a relationship also described as the “new politics of immigration.”12 In the 1990s, the public developed a strong preference for welfare chauvinism. Roughly 68 percent of respondents in the 1992 American National Election Study (ANES) supported a waiting period before immigrants can access welfare benefits (with missing data coded as neutral). Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich summarized this preference by saying, “Come to America for opportunity. Do not come to America to live off the law‐abiding American taxpayer.” Gingrich's statement portrays immigrants as lacking the American social norms of a strong work ethic and self‐reliance. This sentiment views immigrants as being a cost to the U.S. taxpayer by accessing welfare benefits. This idea of limiting access to social programs by some immigrants was incorporated into PRWORA.         "
"5","The passage of PRWORA fundamentally changed the U.S. welfare system by replacing the entitlement program Aid to Families with Dependent Children with TANF. TANF created work requirements, imposed time limits on assistance programs, restricted eligibility requirements, increased the role of the states in policy formation, and created differences in social rights for pre‐enactment and post‐enactment immigrants.13 At the federal level, post‐enactment immigrants are restricted from accessing several social programs. For example, the federal government adopted a five‐year moratorium before post‐enactment immigrants can access TANF benefits. Policymakers argue that such restrictions are necessary to decrease immigrant dependence on government benefits, end the so‐called magnet effect of attracting “undesirable” immigrants to the United States, and encourage the naturalization of immigrants. Ultimately, political advocates of such reforms argue that the policy “promote[s] immigrant self‐sufficiency” and increases the “quality” of admitted immigrants.         "
"6","Previous research has argued for an ideological interpretation that depicts conservative states as more likely to restrict welfare access to immigrants and liberal states as more likely to grant access to welfare programs.14 The ideological interpretation is problematic in that conservative values do not necessarily result in greater intolerance for minority groups and policy preferences supporting the ethnic majority over minority groups.15 In this theory, opposition to multicultural policies, including welfare programs, is founded on elements of the American Creed, such as individualism, or on the perception that these programs benefit minority out‐groups over the in‐group.16 As I will argue later, the perceived failure of immigrants to adopt the values of the American Creed and the prejudicial intolerance of out‐groups is closely related to authoritarianism, not conservative ideology.         "
"7","Conservative values of individualism, laissez‐faire economics, distaste for change, and a preference for small government do not necessarily translate into hostile attitudes toward immigrants and other minority groups.17 Authoritarianism is a distinct concept from conservatism. Like conservatism, authoritarianism is a worldview that influences political attitudes across a wide range of issues.18 Authoritarians support strong authority in order to maintain a higher degree of social conformity,19 defined as “a desire for an orderly and structured world.”20 With social conformity being a central component of authoritarianism, the everyday tension between individualism and cohesion to group norms drives authoritarian preferences for policies that enforce uniformity and hinder diversity. Therefore, authoritarians can support increasing the size and role of government in the economic and social spheres to maintain social order, counter threats to society, and enforce social conformity.21 This can result in policy preferences that sometimes converge or diverge with conservatism.22"
"8","Fears regarding the conformity of immigrants to the American Creed and the cultural differences of immigrant groups trigger authoritarian intolerance and prejudice. Exaggerated perceptions of difference between in‐groups and out‐groups fuel authoritarians’ jaundiced view of out‐groups, justifying the exclusion of out‐groups. Previous individual‐level research has found a strong relationship between authoritarianism and negative feelings and stereotypes of out‐groups, such as African Americans, feminists, immigrants, and homosexuals. In terms of immigration, scholars find that authoritarians are more likely to view immigrants as an economic threat, to believe that immigrants should adopt American values, to view illegal immigrants as criminals, and to oppose a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.23 Based on these views, authoritarians support punitive policies, such as California Proposition 187,24 that restrict the social, economic, and political rights of out‐groups to minimize perceived threats of groups that are viewed as racially or culturally different from “true” Americans.25 With regard to immigrants and Latinos, the authoritarian worldview helps “rationalize and justify governmental practices and policies that stigmatize and punish certain categories of immigrants and their children.”26"
"9","In addition to supporting restrictive immigration policies and policing the borders, authoritarians oppose inclusive welfare programs as a means to prevent undeserving out‐groups, such as immigrants as well as blacks and other minorities, from receiving support. As Markus M.L. Crepaz argues, “If a public perception develops that links the ability of immigrant subcultures to exist independent of the host society as a result of the welfare state, such sentiments should manifest themselves in an acute form of welfare chauvinism.”27 As a result, authoritarians would have a preference for welfare policy to enforce an “operational definition of citizenship,” with policy becoming “aggressive in enforcing social order, defining behavioral expectations, and demanding self‐discipline from the poor.”28 The ability to control who gains access through gatekeeping and sanctions allows authoritarians to extend benefits to individuals who conform to their collective identity while marginalizing out‐group members.29 Therefore, authoritarians are strong supporters of aggressive welfare policies including paternalism and welfare chauvinism, but they are not overly concerned with welfare benefit levels.30"
"10","The influence of the opinion–policy linkage on welfare programs varies under certain conditions.31 First, the masses must be concerned about the policy options. The population needs to be aware of the possible policy outcomes, be concerned about the different outcomes, and communicate their preferred outcome to policymakers. Second, the mass public needs to care about the political issue, meaning that the issue needs to be salient. Immigration, and its relationship to welfare reform, was a highly salient issue in the 1990s.32 The third condition for elite response is that the signal from the mass public should be consistent and mostly one‐sided. When these three conditions are present, the mobilized public shares its concerns with elected representatives, creating clear messages constraining the acceptable policy options available to elites. Representatives are expected to adopt policies to meet these concerns in order to keep and perhaps gain electoral support.33 Politicians concerned with electoral survival should vote with the median voter position on an issue; those who violate this strategy do suffer at the polls by receiving a lower percentage of the votes.34 As politicians adopt policy, the public updates its attitudes and provides electoral support in the future. On average, immigrants are inherently in a weak position to influence policy outcomes because “political activity is the means by which citizens make their needs and preferences known to governing elites and induce them to be responsive,”35 and a large proportion of immigrants are unable to vote because of the requirements of naturalization. The unequal influence goes beyond just voting; voters are more likely to communicate with politicians.36 As a result, “unequal participation spells unequal influence.”37 Or, as Key concluded, “The blunt truth is that politicians and officials are under no compulsion to pay much heed to classes and groups of citizens [and noncitizens] that do not vote.”38"
"11","Authoritarians’ views of immigration and welfare access meet the first two conditions for public opinion to influence policy outcomes. Authoritarians are highly motivated by the perceived normative threat of immigration (issue salience) and concerned about the possible policy outcomes. Media images portray immigrants as an out‐group taking advantage of the social safety net.39 These factors are more likely to trigger a response from authoritarian preferences for restricting access. The third condition for elite response is that the signal from the mass public should be consistent and one‐sided. Mixed signals from the mass public can be viewed as being random or a no‐win situation for political elites. The consistency of the signal from the masses to the policymakers varies from one state to another because of the differences in the attitudes of the state populations. As the proportion of authoritarians in the state population increases, the policy preferences of the masses should become clearer and more one‐sided in the direction of restricting immigration access to welfare. As a result, these states should be more likely to limit immigrant welfare access as elites respond to the message and adopt policies to reflect the will of the majority. Based on the foregoing theory, I hypothesize that states with larger authoritarian populations are more likely to adopt hard boundaries, limiting immigrant access to welfare programs.         "
"12","Motivated to explain the public support for the policies of Nazi Germany and anti‐Semitism, early research on authoritarianism built an individual‐level theory of exclusionary attitudes with macro‐level policy consequences.40 Very few studies have tested the relationship between authoritarianism and policy outcomes. This empirical analysis uses one public opinion survey, the 1992 ANES, to examine the relationship between authoritarianism and the preference for restrictive welfare policies among the mass public.         "
"13","Using a report from the Urban Institute, the dependent variable measures immigrant access to state TANF funds during the federal five‐year ban. The dependent variable is coded as 0 for states that adopted restrictive policies and 1 for those that granted post‐enactment immigrants access to state TANF funds during the federal ban. States granting immigrant access to TANF during the federal waiting period in 1998 were California, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming."
"14","Previous research on immigrant access to welfare programs has relied on measures such as immigrant population estimates or political ideology to test the opinion–policy linkage.41 These studies build on individual‐level research that finds a relationship between immigrant population size, or a change in that population, and public opinion.42 The basic concept is that states with larger immigrant populations are more likely to have masses that prefer more restrictive immigrant policies, but the relationship between population measures and public opinion tends to be inconsistent.43 For example, the influx of immigrants fuels public support for restrictive immigrant policies in some states, such as Arizona, but in other states, the public reacts differently, as in California. The point is that state demographic patterns do not lead inexorably to policy outcomes. Other studies use mass ideology to study the opinion–policy linkage. As discussed earlier, conservative states are more likely to limit immigrant access to welfare programs. I expect that the relationship between restrictive policies and ideology is partially mediated by authoritarianism, a predisposition that is closely related to intolerance and prejudice. To test this prediction, I use the citizen ideology measure developed by William D. Berry and his coauthors.44"
"15","I am unaware of an existing measure of authoritarianism at the state level, a fact that is attributable to the lack of surveys containing the questions to measure authoritarianism with representative samples from each state. The lack of representative samples can result in biases in the state‐level estimates.45 In order to overcome these problems with the data, I use Bayesian multilevel modeling with poststratification (MRP) to estimate mass state‐level attitudes using national surveys in a two‐step process.46 The first step is to estimate a multilevel model predicting authoritarianism. The multilevel model includes basic demographic and geographic variables: sex (male or female), race (white, black, or Hispanic), age (four categories: 18–29, 30–44, 45–64, and 65+), education (four categories: less than a high school education, high school education, some college, and college degree), an interaction of race and gender, and an interaction of age and education. The multilevel model includes macro‐level measures for region (Midwest, Northwest, South, and West), the survey respondent's state residence, a macro religious measure for the proportion of evangelical Protestants and Mormons for each state, and presidential vote. These state‐level measures are found to improve the accuracy of MRP estimates of cultural attitudes.47 Overall, this multilevel model results in 4,704 total possible combinations.48 The primary advantage of this model is that MRP uses respondents to create predictions regardless of location to overcome smaller state‐level sample sizes found in a single national survey. For example, respondents in California are also used to generate estimates for other states in the Western region. In the second stage, MRP uses poststratification to correct for oversampling or undersampling of demographic categories.49 Using census data, the estimates are weighted based on the proportion of the state population for each of the 4,704 total possible combinations.            "
"16","In this article, I use the 1992 ANES to estimate state‐level macro attitudes of authoritarianism using MRP. The dependent variable, immigrant access to TANF, is measured in 1998. The 1992 ANES is the only survey conducted before the passage of PRWORA that contains the survey questions I use to measure authoritarianism, the childhood values measure. At the individual level, this measure of authoritarianism is assessed using an additive index of four questions asking respondents to choose between two desirable values for children.50 The wording of the battery stem is as follows: “Although there are a number of qualities that people feel that children should have, every person thinks that some are more important than others. I am going to read you pairs of desirable qualities. Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have.” Individuals are presented with four sets of childhood values: “being independent or respectful of elders,” “self‐reliance or obedience,” “curiosity or good manners,” and “being considerate or being well behaved.” One value is nonauthoritarian and the other is authoritarian (“respect for elders,” “obedience,” “good manners,” and “being well behaved”). A proportion of respondents voluntarily said that both values are equally important, ranging from 9.5 percent to 20.9 percent. These individuals are coded as .5. The responses are added together, and the average value is calculated for each individual (Cronbach's alpha =.674). The wording of the battery is designed to minimize social desirability bias and tap respondents’ priorities for authoritarian values of order, conformity, and obedience to authority. In addition, the questions are clearly distinct from other political attitudes, such as prejudice, intolerance, and conservatism, it is designed to predict, unlike previous measures of authoritarianism.            "
"17","Because MRP uses logistic regression in the model, the public opinion measures need to be dichotomous. I coded all values .625 or higher as authoritarian (1s) and all values less than .625 as nonauthoritarian (0s). I reestimated the models from this article with varying coding for the authoritarianism measure. The measure of authoritarianism does lose significance when .875 and 1 are the thresholds to be considered authoritarianism. This result occurs for two reasons. First, as the threshold is made greater in the individual‐level data, the number of individuals considered authoritarian decreases. Second, individuals above .750 on the authoritarianism index hold very similar authoritarian policy preferences. I include those results in the online supplementary materials. The result is what I believe to be the first macro estimate of authoritarianism at the state level. Lower values of the measure indicate more nonauthoritarian states (the lowest value is 33.6 percent, Washington), and higher values indicate more authoritarian states (the highest value is 65.9 percent, Alabama). The mean value is 52.0 percent (the closest state is Idaho, with a value of 51.7 percent). The estimate of authoritarianism for each state is reported in the appendix. I hypothesize that as the level of authoritarianism in a state increases, the state is more likely to restrict immigrant access to TANF."
"18","The control variables include political variables, economic variables, state characteristics, and demographics. I include measures of the proportion of Democrats in the state legislature and the percentage of Latinos in the state legislature. Democratic‐controlled state legislatures can result in welfare programs that provide greater benefit levels and greater access to minorities.51 I expect that as the percentage of state representatives who identify themselves as Democrats increases, so will immigrant access to TANF. The final political control variable is the percentage of legislators who are Latino. Research on descriptive representation finds that legislatures with proportionally larger Latino caucuses are less likely to pass restrictive immigrant legislation.52 Data to estimate the proportion of Latino representatives were provided by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. In the end, I expect states with larger Latino caucuses to adopt more inclusive TANF policies.            "
"19","The next set of control variables measure the economic situation of a state, which can influence the means to provide welfare benefits to immigrants. As unemployment increases, so does the need and demand for welfare programs, and states with higher levels of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita are more likely to afford generous welfare programs.53 Therefore, I predict that states with lower levels of unemployment and states with higher levels of GDP per capita are more likely to have more inclusive welfare programs for immigrants and higher benefit levels.            "
"20","The third set of control variables measure state locations. Sharing a border with Mexico is expected to decrease immigrant welfare access because of the greater media coverage of immigration along the border and greater immigration flows.54 The border states include Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas. Previous research has found that the South holds distinctiveness from other U.S. regions.55 For example, southern states provide lower TANF cash benefit levels, adopt more conservative policies, have a proportionally large populations of born‐again Christians, and hold lower levels of social trust.56 The MRP estimates of authoritarianism should account for some of the variance between the south and other U.S. regions, as the measures are weighted based on state demographics and include a region variable in the multilevel model. Nonetheless, I include a control for southern states in the statistical model by creating a dichotomous variable for Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. I expect southern states to grant less access and provide less generous welfare programs.            "
"21","The final control variable measures an important dynamic demographic for each state. Research on group threat shows that minority populations may undermine support for a generous and inclusive welfare state,57 particularly when the size of the minority population increases quickly.58 The salience‐of‐change hypothesis is that natives are more likely to be concerned with large and sudden increases in the local immigrant population. To capture this dynamic, I include the change in the immigrant proportion of the state population between 1990 and 1996.            "
"22","Previous research indicates that politicians are likely to respond to macro attitudes.59 To see whether immigrant access to social welfare programs fits the opinion–policy linkage, I start by comparing the descriptive statistics for states that adopted restrictive policies with those that adopted inclusive welfare policies. Second, I statistically model the relationship between citizen ideology, authoritarianism, and TANF by conducting separate logistic regression models with control variables. Finally, I include a logistic regression with authoritarianism and citizen ideology in the same model.         "
"23","Examining the descriptive statistics provides support for an opinion–policy linkage that shapes immigrant access to TANF benefits. Significant differences exist in the public opinion measures of interest—citizen ideology and authoritarianism—and whether states adopted exclusive or inclusive welfare policies. States that granted post‐enactment immigrants access to TANF programs are significantly more liberal (56.8) than nongranting states (44.7, p < .05), with a difference of 12.1. In a similar finding, states that adopted restrictive policies are more authoritarian, 54.7 percent, than states that granted access, 47.7 percent. The difference between inclusive and exclusive states for authoritarianism is smaller (7 percentage points) but statistically significant (p < .01). For both variables, the states adopted policies matching the ideological and authoritarian mass attitudes of their population.         "
"24","The findings presented so far do not take into account the influence of other variables on the state policy decision‐making process. The results in Table 1 include control variables and the measures of public opinion: citizen ideology and authoritarianism. The overall pattern for the control variables provides little support for the influence of these variables on immigrant access to TANF programs. In all three models, the control variables for economic conditions and state location are not significant predictors of immigrant access to TANF. Change in the foreign‐born population becomes a significant predictor, with a negative coefficient in the models that include authoritarianism. This result indicates that states that had undergone larger growth rates in their immigrant population were more likely to adopt restrictive policies. The inclusion of authoritarianism controls for states, such as Kentucky, that had very little growth in their immigrant population but adopted restrictive policies because of a mass authoritarian worldview. The proportion of Democrats in the state legislature changes from being an insignificant predictor in Model 1A to being a significant predictor in Model 1B. This result is attributable to the exclusion of the correlated citizen ideology variable in the second model (r = .45, p < .01). Excluding the proportion of Democratic representatives in the state legislature does not change any of the substantive findings for citizen ideology presented in Table 1. Additional control variables are included in models reported in the online supplementary models.         "
"25","The results in the first column of Table 1 support the previous research finding that conservative states are more likely to deny immigrants access to welfare programs. The coefficient for citizen ideology is positive and significant. This finding indicates that liberal states are more likely to adopt inclusive TANF policies for immigrants. To provide a better understanding of this finding, I report predicted probabilities and plot the effect size in Figure 1. Using Clarify,60 I estimate the first differences on the probability when changing citizen ideology from its minimum value to the maximum value. I hold continuous variables at their mean values and dichotomous variables at their modal value. A change in citizen ideology from the most conservative to the most liberal states results in an increase in predicted probability of 67.6 percent of adopting inclusive TANF policies for post‐enactment immigrants. This sizeable change can be seen in a graph of the marginal effects of citizen ideology on immigrant access to TANF.         "
"26","The second column in Table 1 confirms the primary research expectation regarding a strong and robust effect of authoritarianism on immigrant access to TANF. Similar to the bivariate correlation (r = –.38, p < .01), states with greater authoritarian populations are more likely to adopt policies that restrict immigrant access based on the negative coefficient (B = –.25, p < .01). The coefficient between authoritarianism and immigrant access to TANF is not altered, in terms of being negative and significant, with the addition of control variables. Using predicted probabilities, a state at the 10th percentile for authoritarianism (37.8, Colorado) is 12.3 percent likely to adopt restrictive TANF policies. On the other hand, a state at the 90th percentile for authoritarianism (62.6, South Carolina) is more likely, 96.5 percent, to limit immigrant access to TANF. A shift from the least authoritarian state (Washington) to the most authoritarian state (Alabama) increases the probability of adopting restrictive policies by 94.1 percent, holding all other variable constant at their mean or mode values.         "
"27","The model in the final column includes authoritarianism and citizen ideology. The coefficient for citizen ideology is no longer significant with the inclusion of authoritarianism. On the other hand, the coefficient for authoritarianism remains significant, and the effect size of authoritarianism is similar to the results from Model 1B. The correlation between authoritarianism and citizen ideology is negative and strong (r = –.43, p < .01), providing evidence of a relationship between the two variables. To show the strength of the effect of authoritarianism, I estimate predicted probabilities with citizen ideology set at its most conservative value and all other control variables set at their mean or modal values. I use this simulation because previous research has found that authoritarianism is more closely related to conservatism than to liberalism.61 A shift from the least authoritarian to the most authoritarian state (30.9 to 65.9) increases the probability of adopting restrictive TANF policies by 81.5 percent. In Figure 2, I show the effect size of authoritarianism on immigrant access to TANF by graphing the adjusted means (marginal effects of authoritarianism while holding all other variables constant). Figure 2 shows a strong relationship between authoritarianism and immigrant access to TANF. As seen, the effect of authoritarianism on adopting restrictive TANF gatekeeping policies is strong and negative. Examples of states with high levels of authoritarianism and restrictive TANF programs include Mississippi, North Dakota, and Alabama. States with larger nonauthoritarian populations, such as California, Hawaii, and Connecticut, are more likely to grant immigrant access to TANF. The figure provides strong evidence for an opinion–policy link between authoritarianism and policies regarding immigrant access to welfare programs. In comparison, citizen ideology is no longer a significant predictor of immigrant access to TANF, and the effect size in Figure 3 is smaller than that in Figure 1.         "
"28","The authoritarianism–welfare chauvinism linkage has a couple of caveats. First, the relationship is based on an opinion–policy relationship that is dependent on how representative state governments are of the population. Factors that decrease representation of the authoritarian worldview can weaken my results. For example, African Americans are more authoritarian, but the authoritarian worldview is less predictive of their policy preferences.62 Potentially, states with larger African American populations would be estimated as being more authoritarian but may not be more likely to adopt authoritarian policies. Second, it is unknown whether the increasing concentration of authoritarians in the Republican Party is resulting in more authoritarian politicians or whether politicians are responding to authoritarians in some circumstances. Unfortunately, the data do not exist to distinguish between these two possible but different political dynamics.         "
"29","The 1996 welfare reforms resulted in a host of significant changes in state welfare policies, including gatekeeping policies regarding social citizenship. This article contributes to our understanding of state level immigration policies by focusing on welfare reforms that create inclusionary or exclusionary TANF programs for immigrants. The decision to grant immigrants access to TANF can be divided into the “means” and the “willingness” to do so.63 My evidence shows a strong pattern that the willingness of state populations predicts immigrant inclusion. Conventional wisdom suggests that individuals who prefer a smaller welfare state, political ideology, should oppose allowing immigrants access to public assistance. I find that authoritarianism is a robust predictor of immigrant access to TANF. In what I believe to be the first state‐level analysis of authoritarianism and immigrant policy outcomes, I find that macro estimates for authoritarianism are significantly correlated with denying post‐enactment immigrants access to TANF. As the authoritarian population increases, the likelihood of supporting hard boundaries, policies restricting immigrant access to TANF, increases. These findings are based on data from the early 1990s in the United States, but the results can be generalized beyond the limited time frame of this study. Authoritarians are found to hold policy preferences across long periods of time64 with expression of these preferences being situational.65 This approach can be useful in predicting future policy outcomes regarding immigrants and welfare programs. States with large authoritarian populations, and not necessarily those with large conservative populations, can be “breeding grounds” of support for welfare chauvinism whenever political rhetoric links immigration to welfare programs.         "
"30","Previous research provides support that authoritarianism can influence individual attitudes and policy preferences and the crucial position of authoritarianism as a predisposing factor, resulting in individuals responding to political cues and eventually a partisan sort creating political polarization.66 As a result of the partisan sort, authoritarians are becoming more concentrated within the Republican Party.67 As Marc J. Hetherington and Jonathan D. Weiler have shown, the cleavage in authoritarian attitudes continues to divide the public and create policy dilemmas for policymakers.68 Policymakers face dilemmas because authoritarians view the world in “black and white” or “right and wrong” terms. Authoritarians are less likely to compromise on issues that are perceived threats to the American society. For example, politicians are particularly divided on the issue of immigration, with authoritarians preferring restrictive immigration and immigrant policies and big business interests preferring more accepting policies.69 The relationship between authoritarianism and policy outcomes is most likely not limited to immigration. Authoritarianism shapes individual attitudes on a wide range of political issues.70 Potentially, authoritarianism can form an opinion–policy linkage that shapes public policy regarding gay rights, foreign policy, civil liberties, welfare paternalism, the death penalty, defense spending, racial issues, and other policies. Future research could explore the partisan variance in the opinion–policy linkage in greater detail with MRP estimates of authoritarianism for Republicans and Democrats.71"
