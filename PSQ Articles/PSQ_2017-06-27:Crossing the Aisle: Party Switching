"1","Historical, behavioral, and institutional research all provide convincing evidence about the important role of political parties in the American political system. Parties are a valuable resource for candidates seeking office and help current officeholders achieve their electoral and policy goals. Given parties’ significance inside and outside of government, understanding why an elected official would change parties is both theoretically and substantively important. In Crossing the Aisle, Antoine Yoshinaka uses ambition theory to develop a compelling explanation for why legislators switch parties.         "
"2","Although ambition theory has been more commonly used to explain candidate emergence and progressive ambition, Yoshinaka is not the first to note its utility in explaining politicians’ calculus regarding partisan affiliation. In Why Parties?, John Aldrich offers a powerful demonstration of how ambition theory can help explain a legislator's decision to join one party over another. Yoshinaka expands on earlier work and demonstrates how ambition theory can explain not only why some legislators switch parties but also why many cross‐pressured members do not. The latter is particularly important because, as Yoshinaka notes, scholars can learn a great deal from investigating why a political phenomenon did not occur.         "
"3","Indeed, one of Crossing the Aisle's contributions is to reaffirm the scholarly benefits of studying rare events. Although legislative studies rarely suffer from a lack of data, there other instances where we observe few “successes.” While congressional scholars have not shied away from these cases, the dichotomy of observed and unobserved often fails to capture the full nuance of the underlying phenomenon. For instance, there is arguably a broad spectrum of potential switchers that includes, but is not limited to, legislators who were recruited by the other party but had no intention of switching, those who considered switching before deciding against it, and those who eventually change parties. Yoshinaka profitably explores this nuance to demonstrate how the costs of party switching keep some prospective switches from occurring.         "
"4","The rarity of legislators changing parties presents a complication for conducting a systematic study. In light of these challenges, Yoshinaka develops a commendable research strategy that utilizes both empirical analyses, case studies, and interviews with legislators. The elite interviews are one of the book's strengths, as they provide insightful details about each component of Yoshinaka's argument. For example, the interviews about the involvement of party leaders and rank‐and‐file members in recruiting party switchers was fascinating and provided an invaluable perspective. One of the most intriguing interviews was conducted “in real time” with a state legislator who changed parties. In Chapter 8 of Crossing the Aisle, Yoshinaka chronicles each stage in the legislator's decision‐making process and the subsequent electoral and institutional consequences of the switch. It is a fascinating read that will no doubt be of interest to both political scientists and nonacademic audiences.         "
"5","The theory and analysis developed in Crossing the Aisle can also serve as a nice foundation for subsequent research on the long‐term consequences of party switching. In particular, it would be instructive to examine how party switching influences a party's future electoral prospects. Indeed, Yoshinaka hints at this possibility when he notes that party switching may “invigorate supporters and activists, locally, statewide, and even nationally” and allow “the receiving party to make inroads in a region where it had been shut out for a long time” (p. 149). While a direct test of this proposition would have been a nice addition to the book, it may not fit as neatly within the book's ambition theory frame and would therefore make for an excellent follow‐up study.
