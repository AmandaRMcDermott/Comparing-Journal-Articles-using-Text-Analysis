"1","Much English‐language analysis of Russian politics reveals more about what interests commentators—rooting out corruption, developing rule of law, establishing secure property rights, and other ways in which Russians might improve their society—than about how contemporary Russia actually works. This is not the case with Aleva Ledeneva's latest book. Apart from a few gestures toward possible paths of change, this book does not suffer from a pedagogical tone: while Ledeneva has chosen “modernization” to frame her argument, she is not in the business of evaluating either how state and business elites in the Russian Federation do their jobs, or how Russian publics should respond to them. Instead, she seeks to make sense of how Russia's network‐based governance system, known as sistema, really functions. Ledeneva takes politics, economics, and society in contemporary Russia on their own terms. The result is a book that shows how actors in a highly complex web of formal rules and informal practices manage to keep a ship of state afloat.         "
"2","Ledeneva's previous work traced late‐Soviet horizontal exchange networks and identified and explicated informal practices that were central to Russian political development in the post‐Soviet period. In this latest work, she turns her keen analytic lens away from ordinary people to focus on the higher echelons of power—namely, on what she terms power networks, or the relationships among the elites who set the terms for governing the country."
"3","A signature and strength of Ledeneva's work is her emphasis on concepts that are commonly used in Russian politics and society. Rather than stretch or transpose concepts from American or British political science traditions to explain how Russian politics works, Ledeneva draws upon local vocabularies to develop experience‐near concepts that resonate in the contemporary Russian context and illuminate otherwise‐obscured processes of political and economic change. These concepts (in addition to sistema, Ledeneva also brings her readers “werewolves in epaulets,” “telephone justice,” and other staples of Putin‐era political discourse) communicate key aspects of Russian politics that terms such as “authoritarianism” simply cannot.         "
"4","Although the book is firmly and exclusively rooted in Russian politics, Ledeneva sets her hard‐won, deeply contextual material in a theoretical framework that should invite comparative analysis. In particular, scholars of other places where informal practices are central to governance will find much to think about in this book. Further, Ledeneva provides thoughtful attention to diachronic comparison, considering how sistema today compares with Soviet‐era iterations of sistema, where the ruptures and differences were, and why that might be so.         "
"5","Studying sistema poses some obvious difficulties for the researcher, not the least of which is the fact that sistema is constituted in large part by unwritten rules and directives. Ledeneva bases her findings and interpretations on a creatively assembled and carefully analyzed combination of original and published interviews, sociological surveys, court records, and, interestingly, material culture. In particular, Ledeneva's account of the transition from Soviet‐era elite phone systems (vertushka) to modern luxury mobile lines (Vertu) as a favored vehicle for ‘telephone justice’—and thus a constitutive feature of contemporary politics—is one of the highlights of the book.         "
"6","Finally, one of the virtues of this book is that Ledeneva calls our attention away from a focus on the person of the President and toward the complexity and flexibility of sistema—as well as toward the broad cast of characters whose participation makes it work. Although leaders influence the shape and breadth of sistema, they do not command it. There are clear implications for this vision of politics: in contemporary Russia, those who think a mere change of head of state will result in major transformation are probably mistaken.         "
