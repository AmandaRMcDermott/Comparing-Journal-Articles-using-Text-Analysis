"1","Michael MacDonald's book may not be to everyone's taste, but it most certainly is to mine. In his opening pages, MacDonald goes through a list of several leading explanations for the American decision to invade Iraq in March 2003, demonstrating that each of them is limited in its ability to capture more than a small part of a much larger story. Thus, he minimizes personal quirks of President George W. Bush (and his relations with his father) or Dick Cheney, geopolitical considerations focusing on Iraqi energy resources or strategic location, the role of the military‐industrial complex, or the pressures of the Israel lobby. Ultimately, his primary explanatory vehicle is a kind of groupthink or collective conscience that had come to possess a good part of the foreign policy elite in Washington by the time of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Put simply, with the Cold War over and America's superpower status unchallenged, the attitude grew that the United States was a power beyond challenge and that it had a blueprint for remaking foreign peoples to its liking—meaning their conversion, should the occasion warrant, into what by the end of the first year of the Bill Clinton administration had become known as the “enlargement” of the zone of “free market democracies.” In other words, liberal imperialism came fully into its own, its “universal appeal” widely acknowledged with the “responsibility to protect” (a concept MacDonald does not discuss), which constituted a new version of “just war.”"
"2","To his credit, MacDonald is his own devil's advocate. How can we believe that such a gigantic mistake as this invasion could have been based on such simple‐minded reasoning and base emotions? Surely some ulterior motive was there that can better explain in more rational terms not simply how the invasion of Iraq was conceived but also what its consequence was expected to be. How, in the aftermath of this disaster, was the major question asked not why such an astounding policy had been decided on in the first place but instead how could the occupation of Iraq could have been more successfully conducted? MacDonald persists nonetheless in returning to his major theme: that a mind‐set was so pervasive among both Republicans and Democrats (not only policymakers but also scholars and pundits), and persisted so long after 2003, that it requires understanding the logic behind the worldview that led to what is, in my mind, the greatest mistake in the history of American foreign policy."
"3","MacDonald is correct to call special attention to the role of the neoconservatives close to the White House and important in leading Republican circles in defining the challenge to America and its solution in the terms that were adopted (Chapter 4). But he is quick to continue the story with a chapter on “Democratic Hawks.” Indeed, with the single exception of Francis Fukuyama, all the essential ideas put forward by the neoconservatives rested on concepts devised earlier, and in more depth, by those on the liberal left. The neoconservative contribution was to sharpen these ideas, popularize them, and insist that they needed to be pushed forward militarily (something the neoliberals, still remembering such misadventures as Vietnam, were more reluctant to envisage). By carrying his illustrations through Hillary Clinton and Anne‐Marie Slaughter (the director of policy planning when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state), MacDonald leaves no doubt as to how broad a consensus there was behind this mind‐set or its staying power long after the Republicans were out of the White House. The “Elite Consensus” that MacDonald places at the core of his argument (which he refers to repeatedly as “the EC”) came to a conclusion that should disturb official Washington far more than other explanations of the folly of the Iraq invasion because virtually no part of this elite is immune from his criticism."
"4","MacDonald is not shy about recounting the extent to which the American defeat came to be self‐inflicted. The primary problem he identifies was Washington's failure to think about how it would organize the political system that would replace Saddam Hussein. The facile belief that this fundamental matter would simply take care of itself and, even more improbably, that it could conceivably engender a liberal solution not only favorable to American interests but also attractive to other Arab states, which, in due course, might follow the Iraqi example (when instead it was Iran that was the greatest beneficiary of events), constitutes a damning indictment of all those who supported the invasion."
"5","I have one serious disagreement with Overreach, much as I applaud the volume. Like so many others, MacDonald defines “liberalism” as the toxic drink that fueled the disaster we call Iraq. He does this by tracing the liberal argument to John Locke then contrasting it with Thomas Hobbes and by assuming that he can read the events of the last 30 years (taking us to Ronald Reagan) back into the entire history of liberalism as one of implicit imperialist utopianism. I am convinced that this is a mistaken interpretation of liberalism as a force in international relations. In a forthcoming book (Why Wilson Matters: The Origins of American Liberal Internationalism and Its Crisis Today, Princeton University Press, 2016), I maintain that a critical break occurred in this school of thought, beginning during the Reagan years but deepening conceptually in the “long decade” of the 1990s (that is, from the late 1980s to 2001). My hope is to redeem at least some of the message of an earlier liberal progressivism in world affairs from the self‐inflicted damage nearly all the major liberals did to the tradition in their triumphalism following the American victory in the Cold War between 1989 and 1991. MacDonald is certainly correct to argue that liberal thinking was the key element not only in justifying the Iraq war but also in continuing to persuade liberals in the Barack Obama administration through at least 2014 that, thanks to this framework for world affairs, they had a key to a successful foreign policy in reaction to the continued challenge in Afghanistan and the Arab Spring. Yet is important to see the construction of such thinking in a way that does not reduce it to be an essentialist element of liberal thought, for it is not difficult to demonstrate that prior to the 1990s, and especially under Woodrow Wilson (generally considered to be the fountainhead of this form of thinking) liberal internationalism had a different cast altogether to it.         "
"6","One may hope that MacDonald's book gets a reading by the American foreign policy elite and that what he labels “the EC” will change as a result. It is encouraging that the book is appearing from a major press and is finding reviews. But his attack is so broad based in terms of the period it covers and the personalities involved that I think it unlikely Overreach will get the attention it deserves. The author and the book risk becoming “radioactive.” This year there will be a presidential election, but unfortunately it is unlikely that MacDonald will be on the foreign policy advisory committee of either party.
