"1","This book explores what it means to be “human” in decidedly inhuman contexts. It poses a simple question demanding a complex and nuanced answer: “What helps people maintain their humanity during wars, genocides, revolutions, and other traumatic political conflicts?” (p. 4). Author Kristen Renwick Monroe and her colleagues draw on a rich corpus of data comprising 18 interviews from former combatants, survivors, and witnesses to such events. Balancing the need to analyze the transcripts from a theoretically informed manner while preserving the voice of the interviewees, the authors employ both inductive and deductive methods to analyze and interpret the data. Analysis reveals six psychological dimensions that influence coping with trauma: belonging to a larger group, the ability to establish continuity with the self, fatalism, cognitive stretching, conceiving happiness, and patterns of assigning guilt and blame."
"2","The main strength of A Darkling Plain is its use of narrative as a means of addressing the research question posed by the authors. The breadth and scope of the transcripts provide the reader with an intimate look into the experiences of the interviewees and how they coped with—and continue to cope with—the traumatic events they encountered. The interview with Tuan, a former South Vietnamese soldier, is especially compelling in this regard. These interviews encompass a wide range of perspectives and experiences with traumatic events. The part on World War II, for example, contains interviews from, among others, an American soldier in the South Pacific, a Holocaust survivor on Schindler's List, a displaced person with a father who was in the SS, and a Japanese American woman who was interned as a teenager. There is a richness to the data provided that I hope will illustrate to readers the value of narrative research. Another strength of the book is the wide theoretical lens adopted by the authors when analyzing and interpreting their data, which includes both the classical work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, as well as more modern theories on post‐traumatic stress disorder.

"3","The book, however, is organized in a manner that undermines its scholarly impact. Adding the raw data—that is, the transcripts—makes for an interesting read, but it leaves the authors with little room to provide the type of in‐depth analysis the subject matter requires. Part V of the book, which contains the bulk of the authors' discussion of their findings, is far too cursory. The transcripts also contain exchanges between the interviewer and the interviewee that seemingly have nothing to do with the topic at hand. Rose, a survivor of the Armenian genocide whose grandfather was murdered by Turkish authorities, spends much of her interview, for example, describing her immigration to the United States. Although interesting on a personal level, these tangential topics often distract from the main topic of the book."
"4","A Darkling Plain tries to provide a scholarly contribution to the literature on coping while also trying to give voice to those who have experienced traumatic events. Social scientists too often overlook the latter. Allowing for participants to speak on their behalf requires a deft touch, however, as it can lead a researcher to cross the line separating social science from journalism. Although it is enjoyable to read, A Darkling Plain does not successfully navigate this boundary.         "
