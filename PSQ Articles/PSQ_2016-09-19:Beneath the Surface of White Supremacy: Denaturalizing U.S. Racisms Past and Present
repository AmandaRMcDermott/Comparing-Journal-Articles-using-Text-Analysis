"1","Moon‐Kie Jung's book begins with an extended discussion of the police killing of an African American teenager in Champaign, Illinois. Jung considers local reactions to the shooting. Whereas black residents criticized the police department and the city's reaction, white residents sided with the city and the police and blamed the black teenager for his own death. This discussion allows Jung to raise two questions that are carried throughout the book: first, why do whites and nonwhites have different views of racism or racist events, and second, how does antiblack racism affect nonblack people of color? Jung posits that we need to conceptualize racism as an ideology and a structure to answer these questions."
"2","The second chapter begins this task by outlining a theory of racism. Jung contends that Eduardo Bonilla‐Silva's structural theory of racism, which endeavors to move racial theories beyond the realm of ideology, requires a more complex understanding of structure and a clearer articulation of how the dominant racial ideology accords with societal power relations. Jung relies on William Sewell, Jr.'s theory of structure for this purpose. Jung redefines racism as “structures of inequality and domination based on race” (p. 49). The structure of racism refers to the “reiterative articulation of schemas and resources through practice” (p. 49). Jung then proposes three schemas that constitute racism: categorizing people based on notions of “collective heredity,” “suitability/insuitability,” and “superiority/inferiority” (p. 49). He proffers that these schemas allow for a deeper understanding of racial ideology and structure than that of color‐blind racism and allow us to see how ideology and structure are articulated."
"3","The third chapter contests the notion that the United States is a nation‐state and instead contends that the country is an empire‐state and a racial state. Jung posits that “the political community to which the state has been coupled has never been the nation” (p. 59) and has always been an empire. Jung makes this point clear when he notes that England established colonies in North America, and when those colonies became a state, the newly founded state continued to colonize the indigenous peoples of North America and then moved on to colonize Hawaii, parts of Mexico, Guam, Samoa, and Puerto Rico. Jung posits that an empire‐state approach to the United States is useful insofar as it bridges the divide between the sociologies of race and empire."
"4","The fourth chapter is concerned with how race figures in assimilation theories. Jung contends that these theories “do not adequately account for race.” Based on this, Jung calls for a “thorough rethinking of research on migrant settlement” (p. 91). In particular, Jung is concerned with how segmented assimilation theory “essentialize[s] poor urban Blacks in the image of the ‘underclass’” (p. 98). Jettisoning assimilation theory for its failings, Jung favors instead the work of Roger Waldinger and Andreas Wimmer, which places politics instead of ethnic similarity (or difference) at the center and includes native‐born minorities in the framework. Nevertheless, he points out that this school of thought would do well to consider how race should be distinguished from ethnicity."
"5","The fifth chapter elaborates a notion of symbolic coercion, and the sixth chapter symbolic perversity, both tools to help us understand how state and structural violence are linked to racism. Jung ends with a thought‐provoking conclusion that engages with the work of James Baldwin. Two of the most powerful points in this conclusion are that antiracist work requires practice, not just ideology, and that racisms against different racialized groups “are inextricably linked but also qualitatively different” (p. 180)."
"6","In sum, Beneath the Surface of White Supremacy is a thought‐provoking book with much theoretical utility for race scholars. The chapters seem at times a bit disjointed from one another, yet the broad range of thinking on race and racism compensates for this.         "
