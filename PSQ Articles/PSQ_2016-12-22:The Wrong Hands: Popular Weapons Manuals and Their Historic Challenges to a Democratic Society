"1","Ralph Waldo Emerson once remarked, “Books are the best of things, well used; abused, among the worst.” Whether and how books may be abused is the question Ann Larabee tackles in The Wrong Hands: Popular Weapons Manuals and Their Historic Challenges to a Democratic Society. Larabee supplies a well‐documented account of the dissemination of destructive knowledge. Dangerous information—how to make dynamite, how to lay an ambush, how to produce poison—migrates in two dimensions. The first dimension is from the elites down to the masses: applied chemistry treatises and army survival manuals are shamelessly copied, repackaged, and distributed by radical pamphleteers, fringe publication houses such as Paladin Press, and, in more recent years, by blogs, chat groups, and peer‐to‐peer file‐sharing software. The second dimension is across the political spectrum. Anticapital anarchists publish tracts on the best way to build a bomb, sometimes seasoning the bland technical details with inflammatory political screeds. Anticommunist reactionaries take their instructions, strip out the Marxist cant, and put in their own, right‐wing bluster; they, in turn, are plagiarized by environmental groups and Islamic radicals, who add their own political flavor. The overwhelming sense from Larabee is that the technical details—sometimes accurate, sometimes not—remain largely the same, only the label—The Anarchist Cookbook, Ecodefense, The Mujahideen Poisons Handbook—changes.         "
"2","But these labels matter. As Larabee argues, government is not even‐handed about punishing those who possess or disseminate dangerous knowledge. In the middle of the twentieth century, communist radicals were condemned for possessing the same kind of explosive knowledge that Klansmen in the South used with deadly effect against African Americans. In the twenty‐first century, bumbling would‐be jihadists go to jail for material that barely qualifies as instructive, while antigovernment militia members, with works like the Improvised Munitions Handbook, walk free with a slap on the wrist and the return of their guns. In Larabee's account, government enforcement is reliably partisan, no matter how protean the information.         "
"3","Protean is also a fit description of Larabee's book, and not in a good way. The Wrong Hands suffers throughout from an aggravating drift. Examples accumulate without illumination; a taxonomy of dangerous instruction offered in the introduction fails to organize the subsequent chapters. Larabee's paeans to free speech seem tacked onto the end of each section, and she comes close to repudiating them in a jarring paragraph written in the first person. One gets the sense that Larabee is not certain whether her book is a work of literary criticism, cultural anthropology, political theory, or history. The Wrong Hands works best as a kind of genealogy of dangerous instruction and an exposé of biased law enforcement. That kind of project is useful, but the subject feels much bigger. The important issues—why would a liberal democracy want to protect this speech, despite the risks, or, what about human nature makes this kind of information so alluring—are left underdeveloped. And so, a book that could have been a bombshell winds up as a mildly intriguing study of pop culture.         "
