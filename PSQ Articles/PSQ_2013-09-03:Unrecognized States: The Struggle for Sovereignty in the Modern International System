"1","International relations theorists are criticized for over‐emphasizing the role of great powers. Unrecognized States is a welcome corrective to that bias, which focuses on entities like Abkhazia, Nagorno‐Karabakh, and Somaliland that live much more precarious lives on the margins of international society.         "
"2","Nina Caspersen opens her book with Kosovo's declaration of independence and the subsequent Russian recognitions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008, which, for her, “announced that after lying dormant for several years, the game of recognition had returned to global politics” (p. 2). Subsequent events, including the military eradication of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka in 2009 and South Sudan becoming the world's newest widely recognized state in 2011, also justify the timeliness of her work."
"3","The author's definition of the term “unrecognized state” (p. 11) is similar to what this reviewer and many others have previously termed “de facto states,” entities that actually control territory, provide governance, have demonstrated perseverance, aspire to sovereign independence, and yet remain largely or entirely unrecognized by the international community. Caspersen identifies 15 such entities in the world since 1991 plus the two “borderline cases” of Kosovo and Taiwan. One can quibble with the inclusion of some of the cases or the dates ascribed to others but this is clearly the most‐recent and comprehensive examination of such entities available."
"4","There are many things to like about this book that make it a welcome contribution to the broader literature on sovereignty and statehood. It is theoretically informed, alive to contradictions, well‐grounded in the existing literature, and written in lucid, lively, and student‐friendly prose. Unrecognized States succeeds in neither vilifying nor glorifying these would‐be states and it is sensitive to variations among the cases considered, noting that “We cannot conclude from Chechnya that all unrecognized states are largely anarchical entities, or from South Ossetia that they all are closely in tune with their patron state” (p. 148).         "
"5","In contrast to some previous work, including my own book, International Society and the De Facto State, which focused more on the external relations of these entities, Caspersen is particularly strong on the interconnections between internal and external dynamics in the development of statehood without recognition. She argues convincingly that “the absence of recognition does not render statehood impossible” (p. 23), but that “statehood without recognition takes a specific form and these entities are not just like other states without the bonus of recognition” (p. 25). Caspersen interestingly highlights how non‐recognition can have both positive and negative effects on democratization (p. 98) and how it may actually help state‐building efforts in some ways (pp. 104–105).         "
"6","Where Caspersen seems most intellectually torn is on the question of unrecognized state viability. On the one hand, she argues that forcible military eradication remains the most likely outcome for these entities (pp. 11, 123, 126), and she maintains that their statehood is “highly unstable” (p. 12), which condemns them to an “ambiguous and largely transient position” (p. 121). Yet, using her own (arguably conservative) figures, the 15 cases featured in her book have an average longevity of 14 years, which increases to 15.53 years if the two “borderline cases” of Kosovo and Taiwan are included. Caspersen almost reluctantly acknowledges that unrecognized statehood is “likely to be sustainable in the medium‐term” (p. 126), but one is left wanting a more‐decisive argument that these entities are or are not viable in the long term."
"7","Without question, though, Unrecognized States is a significant contribution to a growing literature on sovereign anomalies. It is a thoroughly researched and carefully written book that deserves a wide audience.         "
