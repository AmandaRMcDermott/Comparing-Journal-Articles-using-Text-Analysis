"1","THEORIES THAT ASSUME RATIONALITY IN HUMAN DECISION MAKING continue to be applied widely to understand political behavior. This body of theory posits that individuals act rationally to maximize their own interests, basing their actions (including political support) on an evaluation of costs and benefits. While rational action frameworks have been employed to understand the behavior of diverse sets of actors over the years, they have been unevenly engaged to study the support of poor, traditionally marginalized groups for charismatic leaders. Some scholars assume rationality on the part of subaltern actors by focusing on the material and political benefits provided to them by the leaders they endorse. Others implicitly or explicitly frame these subjects as irrational actors who blindly support populist leaders and their programs based on affective ties, manipulation, and raw emotion. The last‐named tendency characterizes much of the media coverage on subaltern subjects in the Global South and thus dominates the public imagination."
"2","This trend is particularly striking when it comes to the treatment of supporters of the “radical” left‐leaning regimes that have emerged in Latin America over the past decade. Venezuela under former president Hugo Chávez (1999–2013) has been at the center of this dialogue, in large part because the movement he established has inspired similar developments throughout the region.1 Both the achievements of the Chávez administration (and like‐minded allies in Latin America) and the nature of his government's political support have been the subject of contrasting interpretations. Authors who emphasize the positive outcomes of the government's social programs and redistribution schemes generally assume a high degree of rationality among supporters, whereas those who feel the government has not produced significant benefits tend to downplay material issues and focus on other factors such as charisma, emotion, and manipulation. Although much has been written from both perspectives, there are few qualitative studies that consider support from the perspective of the followers themselves. Instead, authors tend to draw their conclusions based on quantitative data (with varying interpretations) or apply theoretical frameworks that make assumptions about these actors’ motives and behavior.         "
"3","Drawing on qualitative evidence from Venezuela, this article considers the lived experiences and perspectives of those who support Chávez and his “Bolivarian Revolution.” It argues that their support is based on concrete, tangible benefits that they believe the government provides them. Therefore, they are in fact behaving in a manner that is perfectly rational according to the perspective through which these individuals interpret their interests. There are certain policy areas—particularly those related to the deepening of democracy—for which the state does appear to have considerable influence over adherents of the Bolivarian movement. Yet even with respect to these areas, supporters tend to view political developments with a more critical eye than they are sometimes given credit for. These findings highlight the need to adopt a bottom‐up approach to research that includes listening to those actors about whom we are writing."
"4","Two broad frameworks, although not necessarily mutually exclusive categories, have been applied to understand the political behavior of marginalized actors. Many of the earliest writings on collective behavior drew on the work of thinkers such as Gustave Le Bon, who characterized collective action in terms of the unreasoning and emotional “group mind.”2 Herbert Blumer's influential early work on collective behavior assumed rationality on the part of leaders and elites but viewed the collective action efforts of subaltern subjects as spontaneous occurrences of individuals reacting emotionally to circumstances they could not control.3 Suspicion of “the masses” has remained a common theme in the political science literature. It is the basis of the Schumpeterian perspective on democracy, which depicts the average citizen as prone to “poor judgment” and “irrational impulses” and inclined to use “weak logic” to analyze complex matters.4 In the Latin American context, many authors have understood collective behavior through the lens of populism, which is generally presented as a political strategy based on a direct relationship between a charismatic leader and his or her followers that allows the followers to be easily manipulated.5 This perspective falls within a tradition established by thinkers such as Gino Germani that links the mobilization of the lower classes with authoritarianism and argues that “the masses” blindly support populist leaders without engaging in critical deliberation.6 Taken to the extreme, this outlook strips individual participants of agency and reduces “the masses” to a single homogenous, nonrational unit.         "
"5","More recently, scholars have developed more sophisticated theories that apply a rational choice model to topics ranging from collective action to social movements to voting behavior. For rational choice theorists, people are self‐interested maximizers who have fixed preferences, weigh the benefits and costs of actions, and make decisions based on what is likely to bring them the greatest benefit.7 Voters are therefore likely to support parties and candidates that will respond to their interests by providing them with material benefits.8 A key contribution of rational choice theory has been its focus on human agency, which is too often downplayed by other theoretical frameworks, including those that focus on populism. Rational choice theories have shed new light on our understanding of the collective behavior of marginalized individuals and groups. Samuel Popkin, for example, argues that peasants are not irrational and collectively oriented, as most studies have portrayed them, but rational and self‐interested both in terms of the decisions that affect their material well‐being and their political choices.9 With respect to collective action, Popkin argues that the peasant is primarily concerned with individual costs and benefits. More recent studies have shed light on the rational strategic calculations that subaltern actors make when determining their political support, often drawing on psychology to develop a more complex understanding of behavior.10"
"6","Both of these frameworks have been applied to varying degrees to study the rise of leftist governments in Latin America and their supporters, who are often considered to be drawn from the lower socioeconomic strata. A number of scholars who study Venezuela have directly or indirectly engaged with rational choice theory to understand support and voting behavior.11 Mark Weisbrot has produced reports presenting data that demonstrate that the poor have benefited significantly in various areas, including poverty reduction and increased access to higher education, health care, and pensions.12 Steve Ellner has examined economic redistribution as an explanation for Chávez's success but also looks at the sense of empowerment felt by formerly excluded sectors.13 Identifying Chávez as the first Venezuelan president to declare that assisting the poor was more important than serving the interests of other sectors, Ellner points to significant investments in health care and education and criticizes authors who focus on Chávez's rhetoric over the substance of his government's initiatives.14 Michael Penfold also recognizes that significant resources were redirected to low‐income groups under Chávez and presents empirical evidence on spending and voting patterns that links social spending to political support, although, unlike Weisbrot and Ellner, he frames this spending as “buying votes.”15 Noam Lupu also assumes rationality on the part of Venezuelans, but he debunks the myth that only the poor voted for Chávez, demonstrating that the middle classes have also benefited from the government's economic policies and redistributive programs.16 While all of these studies produce important insights into support for the Chávez administration (and other “radical” leftist governments), they remain focused on high‐level politics—on the practices and goals of the government—with relatively little attention paid to how the people themselves interpret and act on these developments.         "
"7","In contrast, another current of the literature demonstrates (to varying degrees) a mistrust of the lower socioeconomic strata with respect to collective behavior and political support. These perspectives range from an understanding of subaltern subjects as motivated by rational self‐interest yet easily manipulated to those that continue to draw on the populism framework of thinkers such as Germani. In the first camp, authors concede that voters are lured in large part by social policies, but they tend to present supporters as passive and uncritical recipients of government handouts.17 Ricardo Hausmann vaguely acknowledges social spending yet insists that the government's policies have cost the people dearly, implying that their continued support over the years is nonsensical. He attributes public support to manipulation, intimidation, and the use of “creative” discursive narratives.18 While acknowledging that people “vote with their pocketbooks,” Francisco Rodríguez posits that poor Venezuelans have not benefited from the government's social programs. He argues that Chávez's success did not stem from the achievements of his programs or the effectiveness of redistribution efforts but rather from “luck and manipulation,” charging that people were “duped by Hugo” though a well‐crafted public relations campaign.19 Kurt Weyland recognizes that material benefits may have played a role in fostering support for Chávez but argues that support can be explained by psychological effects produced by his charisma rather than by a critical assessment of his performance.20 It remains unclear from these authors’ work how the poor could have been so easily tricked if they had not in fact seen tangible improvements in their standard of living. While not directly engaging with the concept of rationality, these perspectives indicate, implicitly if not explicitly, that supporters are easily manipulated and incapable of critically analyzing the political situation.21"
"8","A handful of authors take this argument even further, arguing that people are charmed into supporting charismatic leaders such as Chávez and his allies. Teodoro Petkoff argues that Chávez supporters are not guided by rational self‐interest but are linked to the former president by “emotional and affective ties that verge on magical‐religious” control.22 Roberto Laserna depicts supporters of Chávez ally Evo Morales (Bolivia) as having low levels of education and being poorly informed, which leads to political support based on “emotional reactions” rather than rational reflection.”23 José Zúquete argues that the Bolivarian movement should be read as a “political religion” founded on a dynamic relationship between a charismatic leader and a “moral community.”24 Many of these interpretations are based on an analysis of the discourse and practices of the leaders. While this may shed light on the discursive tactics of these political actors, it does not tell us much about how the recipients of these messages interpret them and to what extent they influence their support.         "
"9","These negative attitudes have been reproduced and magnified in the mainstream media, both domestic and international.25 A number of studies have analyzed, for example, the role of the media during the 2002 attempted coup against Chávez.26 The thrust of most mainstream media reports constructed two distinct groupings: the rational, organized political subjects who supported the “civic” opposition, on the one hand, and the dangerous masses of Chávez supporters, on the other. The popular classes, from which Chávez's supporters were seen to be drawn, were generally depicted as irrational, dangerous, and simpleminded. Print and broadcast media routinely used labels such as “riffraff” (malandraje), “marginals,” and “hordes” to describe them.27 The same “experts” frequently reappear in the country's private media, suggesting that voters do not really know what they are voting for. Writing shortly after the 2006 presidential election, one frequently cited expert insists that Chávez supporters were not voting “for Twenty‐First Century socialism,” as they could not understand what this means in any case, but for Chávez himself. Supporters of the government are nothing more than a “theatrical fiction,” and “their only purpose is to applaud.”28 The same frames continued to be deployed in the 2012 presidential campaign. In an El Nacional (5 March 2012) editorial, government supporters are described as “the lumpen that makes up the base of chavismo in the barrios.” In contrast, the editorial insists that “supporters of the opposition are made up of peaceful, honest, hardworking people and mothers, both professional women and housewives.”29"
"10","Both those who praise and those who dismiss the economic benefits of the Chávez government for the poor pay little attention how the people experience and interpret redistribution programs. The vast majority of studies are based on quantitative data that are used to interpret the material benefits (or lack thereof) produced by the Chávez regime or statistical analysis tests conducted with large data sets from opinion surveys. For this reason, some authors have called our attention to the need for more empirical research on the Bolivarian phenomenon. Julia Buxton argues that “there is a marked reluctance to bring empirical depth to discussion and analysis of Venezuela during the Chávez period.”30 She notes a particularly striking lack of insight into the popular experiences of the Bolivarian Revolution and argues that much of what has been written about Venezuela has not been based on “facts on the ground.” David Smilde and other authors in his edited volume also argue that there is a need for more fieldwork and concrete cases if we are to develop a better understanding of what is actually happening in Venezuela, particularly from the perspective of the traditionally excluded groups.31 There has been a great deal written about the behavior and perceptions of the “the people” in Venezuela, but few scholars have actually engaged directly with these subjects, which is problematic in terms of our capacity to understand and objectively represent their interests. This article begins to fill this gap by presenting the results of interviews and qualitative surveys conducted with adherents of chavismo.         "
"11","The research reported here is part of a larger project that involves studying the experiences and perceptions of individuals involved in participatory democracy mechanisms in Latin America. A survey was administered to participants in six communal councils in different regions of Venezuela; semistructured interviews were conducted with a subset of respondents in three of these local participatory mechanisms.32 The majority, but not all, of the communal council participants supported the governing United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Given that this article seeks to understand the perspectives of Chávez supporters, only the responses of those who identified themselves as such are reported here, for a total of 152 survey respondents and 42 semistructured interviews. The research was carried out from November 2012 to February 2013.         "
"12","Of survey respondents, 53 percent (n = 81) were women, and most were above the age of 40 (16–25, 5 percent; 26–40, 22 percent; 41–60, 43 percent; 61 and older, 30 percent). With respect to employment and socioeconomic status, the majority of informants can be identified as low income. The largest number of respondents (28 percent, n = 43) self‐identified as informal sector workers (the most common categories within this group include domestic employees and freelance construction workers). Other participants identified as unsalaried homemakers (20 percent, n = 30), educational sector workers (14 percent, n = 21), retired (11 percent, n = 17), and skilled formal sector workers (10 percent, n = 15). A small minority of respondents (2 percent, n = 3) can be classified as professional. In terms of income, a majority (67 percent, n = 102) of informants earned at or below the monthly minimum wage of 2,973 Venezuelan bolivars fuertes.33"
"13","Cases were selected according to the diverse case study method in order to determine a representative sample and to achieve a certain level of variation on a number of important dimensions. This involved the selection of cases intended to represent a range of variables (including regional, ethnic, political, and socioeconomic differences).34 Surveys were distributed to six communal councils: two in Caracas, the country's capital and largest city (Libertador Municipality parishes of Sucre and 23 de Enero); one in urban costal Macuto (Vargas State); one semirural council in Guacara, Carabobo; one in the midsize port town of Puerto Cabello on the coast of Carabobo State (to a communal council with a majority Afro‐Venezuelan membership); and one in the Andean city of Mérida, which has emerged as an opposition stronghold in recent years and also allowed for the inclusion of a case outside the highly populated northwest region.         "
"14","The survey questions discussed here were primarily open ended in order to allow participants the opportunity to reflect on and articulate the reasons for their support, although responses from a few multiple‐choice questions are also presented. The researcher was particularly interested in determining whether the participants alluded to concrete material gains (as rational choice theories would have us expect of rational actors) or whether their motives were more intangible, as claimed by those who argue that supporters are motivated by illogical, magical‐affective ties to their leaders. The semistructured interviews explored these questions in greater depth."
"15","Results of the survey and interviews presented here indicate that those who support chavismo generally do so because of the material, social, and political benefits they believe the government has provided them with. When asked in the survey why they support the government, 82 percent (n = 125) of respondents focused exclusively on concrete material gains and/or increased opportunities for participation in decision making (see Table 1). Of the total number of respondents, 59 percent (n = 90) claimed to support the government first and foremost based on its policies of economic redistribution and the more equitable access to public goods and services provided in recent years. Another 23 percent (n = 35) focused on what they perceived to be an expansion of opportunities for democratic participation. There was also considerable overlap, with a majority (61 percent, n = 21) of those who primarily mentioned democratic deepening also pointing to material benefits as another reason for their support. In all, then, 73 percent (n = 111) of self‐identified chavistas provided material benefits as either a primary or a secondary reason for their support. Only 18 percent (n = 27) of respondents did not mention either concrete gains or democratic deepening but rather employed language that could be deemed partisan, abstract, or of an emotional nature.         "
"16","With respect to the most common set of reasons provided for supporting chavismo (material benefits), nearly all respondents were able to provide concrete examples, and most were able to provide multiple examples. Given the open‐ended nature of the question, the responses obviously vary considerably, yet at the same time, there is remarkable consistency with respect to why respondents support the regime. Examples of responses include “more equitable distribution of wealth,” “our families are better off than we were before,” and “services and infrastructure expanded to everyone,” while many referred to specific instances of new social investment or to a particular social program. The most commonly cited examples include the expansion of health care services and the availability of medical personnel in poorer neighborhoods, improved access to education at all levels, redistribution through income supplement programs, infrastructure improvements to their homes or neighborhoods, subsidized access to basic necessities such as food, and better working conditions (see Table 2). With respect to education, many mentioned improved access for their children as well as related benefits such as subsidized meals in public schools.         "
"17","Within these categories, many respondents mentioned specific programs or services, often referring to one or more of the “missions” established by the Chávez administration. The so‐called Bolivarian Missions are a series of social programs targeted at poverty reduction, food and housing subsidies, and expansion of public goods and services to the poor. Some of the most frequently mentioned in the survey include Mission Barrio Adentro (a program that fosters the establishment of staffed medical clinics primarily in poorer neighborhoods), Mission Robinson (provides basic literacy and math skills to adults), Mission Sucre (provides free higher education courses), Mission Vivienda (targeted at building housing for the poor), and Mission Mercal (provides subsidized food to poor citizens). In the one rural case (Guacara, Carabobo), Mission Zamora, which involves land expropriations and redistribution, was also mentioned frequently. Participants from the six communal councils studied also mentioned infrastructure improvements to their homes or neighborhoods. The most frequently cited benefits include new roofing for their homes, the improvement of deteriorating infrastructure such as drainage, new housing projects, and lots made available for building."
"18","Interviews tended to reinforce the tendency of chavistas to focus on the importance of material benefits. Of the 49 individuals interviewed, most (n = 41) immediately cited general or specific material benefits, and many did so exclusively. Typical of the responses provided include the following comments from respondents in a working‐class barrio in western Caracas:            "
"19","Access to medical care has improved so much with this government. There are clinics in poor barrios and they are free. Ok, they are sometimes understaffed with Cuban doctors and I'm sure the care is better in some of the private clinics . . . but when our kids are sick we want to be confident they will have care and this government has given us that. Do you think [former president Rafael] Caldera and the others cared about building clinics in this barrio? Let me tell you, they didn't."
"20","I remember years ago, every house in this neighborhood was falling apart, our roofs were leaking a lot. Nobody did anything about it, nobody cared, it was up to us to fix it they said. But how could we make expensive repairs with the salaries they want to pay us? This government has created programs to help us . . . every roof on this street has been repaired in the last five years and on top of that, we were able to take charge of this ourselves through our communal council."
"21","A domestic worker in Guacara, Carabobo, stated,            "
"22","A roof over your head isn't just something that is nice to have, it is a human right. Before [Chávez], us poor people had to use most of our earnings just to put a substandard roof over our heads. This government recognizes that families need a decent home to live in but shouldn't have to spend every penny for it, it has given thousands of us affordable housing."
"23","Many respondents provided even more specific examples of concrete benefits, often referring to their children as well. Some stressed that programs and services that may seem inconsequential to “the elites” are important benefits for the poor. Typical of these comments is the following statement made by a homemaker and mother in Mérida:            "
"24","The Bolivarian schools provide two meals for our kids: breakfast and lunch. They provide milk and healthy meals. This is no small thing for us, this takes a big burden off us parents because we want our kids to be well fed but it is costly, even if we use Mercal. It is a relief to send my children to school and know they will eat."
"25","It should be noted that in the interviews, some informants demonstrated a tendency to attribute their material and social gains directly to the president. Many participants thanked Chávez for social gains generally or for a particular benefit that they described as opposed to associating these with the Venezuelan state. For example, a mother in Caracas stated,            "
"26","If you want to know why I support Chávez look at this house. I know it is a humble house, but it is good enough for me and it is mine. I can raise my children here, it is clean and the roof doesn't leak like where I grew up. Chávez gave us this house."
"27","There was variation with respect to this trend, with some informants simply mentioning the president's name when describing benefits they had received, while others more clearly attributed gains directly to Chávez. The researcher noted this type of language in the responses of about one‐quarter of informants."
"28","Democratic deepening, or some variation on this theme, was another frequently cited reason that participants provided for supporting the Chávez administration. Perceptions of the quality of democracy in the country were extremely positive, with 83 percent (n = 126) of respondents either satisfied or very satisfied. This compares with 45 percent of Venezuelans as a whole (a number that is higher than the Latin American average).35 Participants were asked to what extent they felt they had freedom of choice and control over their lives, rating this on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating a great deal of control and 1 meaning no control over their lives. A strong majority of respondents (79 percent, n = 120) felt they had considerable freedom of choice and control over their lives, selecting 8–10. When asked whether they believed that they and their neighbors were able to be heard and to influence political decisions, 78 percent (n = 119) of respondents strongly agreed that they were.         "
"29","Most participants linked this perception of democratic deepening to opportunities for expanded citizen participation through mechanisms established by the Chávez government. This is perhaps not surprising, considering the involvement of the surveyed individuals in participatory institutions, but it attests to the importance that they place on citizen participation in decision making. Many linked social spending benefits directly to citizen participation (stating that participation had led to more equitable access to infrastructure projects or improvements in health and education). Most simply wrote “citizen participation,” “popular participation” (participación ciudadana, participación popular), or “having a voice”; others were more specific (for example, “we can participate in the decision making process” or “democracy now means that everyone has a voice”). Many of these responses compared the current period with the preceding era, during which, most claimed, only a small group of elites held any political influence.         "
"30","An additional open‐ended question was asked in order to asses why participants did (or did not) feel that participation had provided them with a heightened sense of political efficacy. Recognition, having a voice and a say in decisions that affect one's life was most frequently cited, with an overwhelming number (84 percent, n = 128) of those who claimed to feel a sense of empowerment providing some variation on this theme. An equally high number of participants (79 percent, n = 120) cited the experience of participation itself as an important factor in developing confidence and a sense of engagement. Other frequently mentioned themes include the belief that everyone can participate and not only elites can make decisions; that individuals can take initiative and do not have to sit back and wait for things to happen; the perceived ability that citizens can work to change something the community does not like; and more equitable access to public goods and services such as health care, education, and infrastructure improvements.         "
"31","While respondents tended to celebrate the new participatory model, about half recognized important deficiencies of the new institutional arrangements. The most common criticism expressed a concern that the design of participatory mechanisms emphasizes overly practical and technical affairs to the detriment of higher‐level political issues. Individuals who brought this up tended to point out that the stated intention of these mechanisms is both to provide citizens with a greater role in everyday decisions that affect their lives and to expand political participation (broadly defined), yet many felt that although the former had been achieved, the latter goal lagged. They worried that councils would become mechanisms to execute public works projects in a more democratic and participatory manner but that people would lose sight of higher‐level goals. A militant from Caracas expressed these sentiments this way:            "
"32","Power has certainly been transferred to us when it comes to these things [local projects and services] and that is good because these things affect our daily lives. But participatory democracy is about more than that. Some of us worry that people will be satisfied with the achievements we have made and that the councils will just be a way of transferring resources to the people for projects we decide on, but no, we want them to be more, we want to use them to create a new, more equal and democratic society and this means expanding what they do and the issues they deal with."
"33","While supporters of Chávez and of populist movements more generally are often thought to demonstrate authoritarian tendencies, support for democracy is quite high according to this survey. When asked whether democracy is preferable to any other form of government, 81 percent (n = 123) of respondents agreed. In a national survey that asked the same question, Venezuelans demonstrated the highest level of support for democracy in the region in 2013 at 87 percent.36 In the same vein, a strong majority of survey respondents (76 percent, n = 116) felt that democracy works better in their country than in the rest of Latin America, while only 4 percent (n = 6) felt that the quality of democracy in Venezuela is inferior compared with the rest of the region. When asked to select from a list what they believed to be the most important characteristic of democracy, government supporters in Venezuela prioritized citizen participation and socioeconomic equality, factors that do not align with the hegemonic liberal conception of democracy (see Table 3). These perspectives were elaborated in the interviews. Typical of the views expressed is the following comment from a participant in Caracas:            "
"34","It used to be that decisions were made only by a few people in our municipalities. These tended to be people with more money and contacts, projects went to neighborhoods where these people and their friends lived. Now, you don't have to be from one of these families to participate in decisions about your own neighborhood."
"35","A participant in Guacara stated,            "
"36","A lot of people around here don't have a high level of education . . . and aren't very qualified [preparado] but they do have dreams and goals and deserve to have a say. Under the old system only the qualified and professionals had the right to make decisions, now everyone can have a say.               "
"37","It should also be noted that nearly half of female respondents (48 percent) specifically mentioned gender, including a greater respect for women's rights and increased role for women in decision making, as one of the reasons they supported Chávez. Certain common themes emerged from these women's responses. A number of female respondents claimed that representative institutions (national assemblies, municipal councils) are and have always been dominated by men; participatory mechanisms allow women the opportunity to make their voices heard. Several women claimed that they felt more comfortable speaking and participating in a group that includes as many or more women than men, stating that they are more likely to be taken seriously and less likely to have their opinions dismissed and that participatory mechanisms provide such a forum because of high participation rates among women. Female respondents were also more likely to mention services and benefits for their children, such as subsidized meals, health care, and eye care. Interview responses aligned with the written survey comments. Many women linked the various social programs to their role as women and mothers, often claiming that women had been particularly burdened by poverty in the past and that the Bolivarian government's programs allowed them to better care for their children and families."
"38","As stated earlier, a relatively small group of survey respondents (18 percent) provided a response that did not cite any specific material or political gains but was coded as a partisan statement or an abstract perspective directly related to the governing party and its platform. While not necessarily indicative of irrationality, these types of responses arguably come closer to demonstrating the types of emotional‐effective support for the government of which supporters are often accused. Written responses include “the Bolivarian Revolution” or “socialism” as reasons for support (without elaboration as to how this had benefited the respondent), statements that refer to ideological or political enemies (the opposition or foreign imperialists), and statements about Chávez that were uniquely focused on his personal attributes rather than on material benefits or expansion of participation."
"39","These types of reasons also emerged in the interviews, but, as with the surveys, such responses were provided by a small proportion of interviewees (7 out of 49 chavistas interviewed provided this type of “emotional‐effective” response without focusing on concrete benefits). Typical of these responses is the following statement by a shoe salesman from the Caracas parish of Sucre:            "
"40","I support the government because I support the people's revolution led by our Commander Hugo Chávez. We have made a lot of progress but this is an ongoing process, we cannot stop, we cannot back down, we must be vigilant, our enemies are just waiting us to fail so they can go back to the old ways."
"41","A construction worker from the same barrio made a similar statement:            "
"42","Chávez is our leader and we will follow him always, we will not accept another, we will not recognize [opposition leader Henrique] Capriles and his people, we will not let them come back to power."
"43","The following comment, made by an agricultural worker from semirural Guacara, typifies the aggressive sentiment of which chavistas are often accused:            "
"44","Our enemies, they want to stop the revolution, they want to turn it back. All the work we have done, everything Chávez has done they want to take it away. Well, if they try to stop the revolution they will find out who the Venezuelan people really are."
"45","Supporters tended to recognize the flaws of the regime and of the former president. When asked to discuss the weaknesses of the regime, 72 percent (n = 109) of survey participants provided a clear response. Of these, a significant number were critical of Chávez. Only 17 percent did not answer this question, and 2 percent provided a response attacking either the opposition or an external actor (such as the United States) as opposed to criticizing the regime. Written responses tended to focus on tight control of institutions and policy at the central government level. Frequently cited examples include the following: the governing party (United Socialist Party of Venezuela) is too tightly controlled from the top; members want a more active party (with some contending that the “party is Chávez”); there is a lack of transparency in government departments and institutions; there is too much politicization of participatory mechanisms such as communal councils; and the party (and Chávez) have not done enough to control corruption. Others wrote that although they appreciated the services they now had access to, they were not satisfied with the quality and efficiency of many of these programs.         "
"46","Interviews tended to reinforce the tendency to recognize the faults of the regime and its leader. Typical of the comments about the party is the following statement from a teacher in the Sucre parish of Caracas:            "
"47","We want the Party to be a real political party. It has always been the party of Chávez, he runs the party. We have participation here in our neighborhoods; the party should be participatory too because that is where many big decisions are made."
"48","Similar sentiments were expressed by a school principal and a kitchen worker in Guacara:            "
"49","Chávez needs to learn to delegate. He controls everything. He has done a lot for us, but really . . . one person cannot and should not run a country."
"50","There is not enough transparency with this government. I mean, there wasn't any before either and this government has much better policies but we should be able to know how the policies are made, they (the ministries) need to open things up, provide more information about what goes on."
"51","A number of informants also touched on the theme of transparency, often linking it to ongoing corruption at all levels of government:            "
"52","They haven't done enough to make government more transparent, and this allows corruption to continue to poison the revolution. There needs to be greater public accountability [control social] to avoid all of this corruption.               "
"53","Several were critical of the personal leadership style of Chávez himself, as expressed by a homemaker in Mérida:            "
"54","He doesn't always need to be so aggressive, so dramatic. He has done a lot for us and I know he has a lot of pressure, but he needs to calm down sometimes and act more presidential. It is better to talk with those who don't agree than to attack them."
"55","It is also noteworthy that many of the individuals interviewed were surprisingly well aware of how they were portrayed by critics of the regime and were able to respond articulately to some of the more common criticisms. The researcher noted that about half of interview subjects expressed a level of consciousness about how they were perceived by opponents and mainstream media outlets. While some informants attacked the sources of this criticism (private media and opposition actors), most offered an insightful response demonstrating a certain level of engagement with the issues involved. The following statement, made by an elementary school teacher in Caracas, articulates what many informants expressed:            "
"56","The right says that we who support the government are happy with authoritarian government and we don't care about democracy. We need to get rid of Chávez to get democracy back. But what do they mean by this? They say that democracy is all about representative institutions, electing people to decide what is good for us. Well fine, we did vote in various elections. . . . and you know what? We voted for Chávez. So now what's the problem? Now they tell us that's not democracy. We voted for Chávez and they don't like it . . . so now they say that's not democracy either. And we are the ones they say are confused."
"57","A plumber from the same Caracas barrio tied this to the concrete social benefits provided by the government:            "
"58","I know they say we just vote for him [Chávez] because we're being manipulated and we can't think for ourselves. No. We vote for Chávez because he gives us things that nobody else will: housing, food, education, health care but more importantly dignity and a voice. Look, these things are important, no? Is it illogical to support a government that gives you these things when you know the others will not? Would it be more intelligent to vote for the opposition, which represents the rich and will just ignore us?"
"59","It should also be noted that satisfaction was not absolute and uncritical. Participants were aware of deficiencies in both areas (social programs and participatory institutions) but did not believe that they negated the benefits. They viewed participatory democracy as an evolving process and hoped that some of the weaknesses would be addressed over time by citizens in collaboration with supportive state actors. Many pointed out that it is impossible to transition from a system of representative to participatory democracy in less than a decade and that a full transformation would require far more time and would likely involve many mistakes. As one respondent stated “our representative institutions have been around for almost 200 years and they still don't work, nobody can expect to build a perfectly functioning participatory democracy in ten years.” Another insisted,            "
"60","We are building a participatory democracy but we need more than 4 or 6 years. Even so, it is remarkable what we have accomplished in so little time . . . but we have to be patient or we will ruin what we have gained."
"61","We have seen that to varying degrees, the domestic media and some academic authors frame chavistas as ignorant and easily manipulated at best and as a dangerous horde at worst. This follows a tradition in one current of the academic literature that perceives the lower strata as prone to irrational impulses and incapable of critical analysis in their assessment of politics. Others contend that these subjects are rational actors whose support is based on self‐utility maximization, yet they have rarely provided qualitative evidence to back up these assumptions. The research presented here supports the latter perspective and finds limited justification for the former narrative."
"62","While a minority of respondents did use language that aligned with the negative characterization, the vast majority articulated specific reasons for supporting the regime based on tangible economic and material benefits as well as instances of participation at the local level, benefits that were not provided by previous administrations. These individuals clearly know exactly why they support the regime, and their reasons for doing so are consistent with the theoretical literature that ascribes rational motives to actors as utility maximizers who offer political support in exchange for concrete benefits. These types of benefits are sometimes dismissed as insignificant by media and by some academic observers. This position is characterized by an often‐cited editorial in Caracas's El Nacional newspaper, which dismisses Chávez supporters as “the same lumpen as always, brought in from the interior of the country” and “willing to sell themselves for a lump of bread and a bottle of rum.”37 While the benefits provided to the poor may appear minor to some, participants do not view them in this way. From their perspective, these policy outcomes have improved their lives, and they appear clear on where these benefits come from.         "
"63","This is not to say that the negative trends depicted in the media and some academic writings did not manifest themselves in this research. For example, some participants did tend to overemphasize the role of the president in the provision of these benefits (often associating him directly with them); this reflects a reality of the Venezuelan political system (personalism and clientelism) rather than an uncritical, unsubstantiated support for Chávez. Furthermore, these perspectives were not expressed by the majority of supporters. This research finds little evidence of emotional‐effective ties between supporters and the former president distinct from the concrete material and political benefits they believe he has provided them. In other words, their support stems not from some type of mystical connection but rather from a rational desire to obtain what they perceive to be the best possible outcomes for themselves and their families. Of course, these findings do not invalidate the arguments put forward by critics with respect to the flaws of the regime. The state—or at least certain branches of the state—may very well have attempted to create “magical” and emotional ties between the leader and “the people,” but the evidence does not support the assertion that these efforts were entirely successful."
"64","Observers often accuse chavistas of demonstrating undemocratic tendencies or a preference for authoritarianism. Respondents demonstrated support for democracy as high as the Venezuelan population as a whole. However, their conception of democracy looks somewhat different. Responses suggest that these individuals share a more “radical” Rousseauian understanding in which economic and social equality are essential components of democracy, in sharp contrast to the dominant liberal model, which gives primacy to procedural quality, representative institutions, and individual rights. This is essential in terms of understanding the perceptions of participants and why they are generally quite satisfied with the quality of democracy in their country. The criteria they use to assess democracy are based on citizen participation and social rights; they believe that these things are better guaranteed in their country than in much of the rest of the region. They place less importance on the functioning of procedural democracy, on party systems, on individual rights, and on representative institutions, which they believe have not served them well in the past, and therefore they are less concerned about these things. Despite a perception of democracy that diverges from the liberal representative model favored by the West, these responses demonstrate a support for what they perceive to be a more inclusive, participatory democracy and a rational, considered assessment of the state of democracy in Venezuela. Furthermore, contrary to their portrayal as uncritical supporters of chavismo, the vast majority of respondents clearly recognized the flaws of the regime. When asked to discuss problems and criticisms, a significant majority were able to provide clear answers, and there was a great deal of consistency, suggesting that many chavistas have similar grievances. Supporters are not uncritical but feel that the benefits they have received outweigh the problems they have identified. Supporting a regime that provides them with benefits that they did not receive before (and, in their minds, would not receive under another government) suggests rational self‐interest; the material benefits are tangible, and the liberal brand of democracy that elites claim has been lost is not."
"65","All of this is not to say that the Venezuelan state does not influence and shape the views of supporters, particularly with respect to their perceptions of democracy. The fact that new participatory institutions integrate Rousseauian concepts of participatory democracy on paper clearly does not mean that these translate into practice. Respondents generally commended the positive achievements of the participatory democracy agenda, and while some were critical, for the most, part participants' perceptions reflected an alignment with discursive strategies of the state (and of Chávez) around the nature of citizenship and democracy. While this alignment does not necessarily mean that supporters have been brainwashed into integrating and reproducing state discourse, it does suggest that considerable influence is being exerted over how citizens conceive of these concepts. There appears to be significant optimism that the ideals will eventually become reality, although the evidence does not yet support this conclusion. Few fully recognized the parameters established around citizenship and democratic participation with respect to both acceptable forms of engagement and the mechanisms through which this should be exercised. Respondents, for example, are almost exclusively focused on local politics, which may be read as an attempt by the state to refocus popular participation at that level to insulate the central government from demands it cannot meet. Still, a significant majority of respondents were critical of their government and not unaware of efforts on the part of some political actors to channel participation through state‐sponsored mechanisms, a realization that defies a simple binary understanding of supporters as either duped or not. Thus, while the findings do not negate the possibility that some sectors of the government's support base can occasionally be manipulated and used by the administration for political purposes, the fact that a group of actors supports the policies of the administration does not mean that this support is provided uncritically."
"66","It should also be noted that many respondents used the past and former governments as reference points, particularly that of the Rafael Caldera administration (1969–1974, 1994–1999) that preceded the Chávez era. Thus, while they may not be entirely pleased with their economic and material status (or with the state of the Venezuelan economy in general), they perceived a marked difference between the pre‐Chávez era and the present with respect to the material gains provided to them by the Venezuelan state. This support is not necessarily unconditional and indefinite, however, but is dependent upon perceived benefits. Thus, while some questioned the feasibility of chavismo without Chávez, these findings suggest that the government of President Nicolás Maduro will continue to enjoy the support of many sectors of Venezuelan society for as long as he is able to provide these material and political benefits. Responses from supporters also indicate that Maduro may still have time, as they tend to view the Bolivarian Revolution as an evolving process."
"67","One issue that future researchers must consider is how theoretical frameworks that seek to understand collective behavior and political support are applied to different social groups and classes. The inherent bias in the application of these different frameworks may produce a skewed picture and does not ultimately improve our understanding of political support and behavior, particularly in polarized contexts such as that of Venezuela. The reproduction of the narrative that has dominated the public imagination and some currents of the academic literature denies individuals from the lower strata the right to be heard, strips them of human agency, and, more generally, produces a distorted perspective. In order to develop a deeper understanding of support for nonhegemonic political movements, it is important to understand the supporters by listening to them before making assumptions about actors' perspectives and behavior. The inclusion of these voices allows us to better understand the perspectives of these subjects and ensure that their actions and aspirations are adequately and fairly represented in the public sphere and in the academic literature."
