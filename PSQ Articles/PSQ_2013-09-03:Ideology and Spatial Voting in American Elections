"1","How do voters choose which candidate to support? Spatial voting theory offers a simple and parsimonious explanation: voters choose the candidate who is closest to them on the issues. Stephen A. Jessee's new book develops the best data available with which this simple proposition can be put to the test. Spatial voting theory mostly passes that test."
"2","Jessee's key methodological innovation is the use of general population surveys with many specific issue‐position questions, questions for which candidate stances are known. The dataset includes voters' responses to 27 actual Senate roll call votes for the analysis of the 2004 election, and 10 specific policy statements for the 2008 election. Jessee then uses dimensional scaling approaches developed to infer the ideological locations of legislators from roll call votes to identify the locations of voters and presidential candidates on a common ideological dimension. He finds that most respondents have views that fit well within the framework of a single ideological dimension."
"3","Spatial proximity theory implies that voters support candidates who are closer to them on the issues, and the survey results strongly support this contention. Voters supported the ideologically closer candidate 84 percent of the time in 2004 and 87 percent in 2008. These figures are considerably higher than has been achieved using less‐extensive approaches to measuring ideological/spatial proximity in prior studies."
"4","The rest of the book explores extensions that enable the model to account for some of the 13 to 16 percent of votes not explicable by spatial proximity alone. Party loyalty, it emerges, drives many of these spatial voting errors. Partisans tend to require that an opposite‐party candidate be substantially closer to them on the issues before proximity will outweigh party loyalty."
"5","The analysis of partisans points toward a fusion of the Downsian and Michigan approaches to explaining voter behavior that is mediated by political information. Voters care about ideology, but they also are swayed by partisanship, particularly when they lack the sophistication and knowledge required to cast ideological votes. Indeed, although better‐informed voters cast votes that are quite closely guided by ideology, partisans with low levels of political information are more likely than not to vote against an opposite‐party candidate with policy views identical to their own.         "
"6","Although they yield substantial insights, Jessee's analyses do have significant limitations. Most critically, the data used are incapable of untangling the causal relationship between partisanship and ideology. Although Jessee makes a plausible case that ideology should be granted primacy, this case is unlikely to convince all readers. In addition, an analysis of only two presidential elections leaves open important questions about generalizability. Eventually, it would also be nice to see an extension to more‐complex versions of spatial voting theory that include the possibility that voters think strategically about status quo locations and probable policy outcomes across a full set of ballot choices."
"7","Ideology and Spatial Voting in American Elections provides potent support for a unified spatial theory of politics in which citizens, their representatives, and policy alternatives are all modeled and analyzed within a common issue/ideological space. Jessee's analysis is already being extended to other races (for example, all competitive House of Representative elections) with surprising success. In the wake of this book, any analysis of vote choice in American politics that leaves out valid measures of issue or ideological spatial proximity should be interrogated for ignoring a central ingredient of voters' decision calculus.
