"1","If democracies are to conduct effective foreign policies, they must be able to simultaneously keep secrets and secure public consent. U.S. foreign policy successes from Operation Overlord during World War II to the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 relied on secrecy. At the same time, argues Michael P. Colaresi, they were possible because the U.S. government had broad public support. These examples notwithstanding, it is not easy for democracies to achieve this balance. Indeed, they confront a dilemma: secrecy is vital for foreign policy effectiveness, but it is also an impediment to generating widespread and enthusiastic consent because publics cannot be sure governments are acting in their best interests."
"2","Colaresi suggests that the key to ameliorating the secrecy dilemma lies in retrospective oversight. Several democracies have instituted rules and procedures, including legislative committees and freedom of information laws, that are useful for evaluating foreign policy performance after the fact. When such arrangements are in place, secrecy and consent can coexist. Executives are not expected to reveal their current thinking, decisions, or actions, so the secrecy crucial to effective foreign policy can be maintained. Meanwhile, publics are inclined to furnish their leaders with the material and political support they need, safe in the knowledge that they can punish them for unpopular or unsuccessful policies at a later date."
"3","Colaresi finds substantial support for this argument in the empirical record. Reinforced retrospective oversight in the United States and France has coincided with far greater public support for executives during international crises. Retrospective oversight also appears to have a significant effect on the price publics are prepared to pay for national security. From 1972 to 2006, democracies with middling oversight spent more on defense than those with low oversight. Finally, democracies that have national security oversight institutions are more successful in foreign policy than those that do not, winning more of their disputes and killing more enemy combatants during those disputes."
"4","Democracy Declassified is an important addition to the literature on democratic foreign policy. Theoretically, Colaresi goes further than other analysts of the subject in not only recognizing the secrecy dilemma but also developing the retrospective oversight concept to deal with it. This is also a real empirical contribution: anyone interested in secrecy and accountability in democracies should start their search for the relevant raw data here. As for the analysis, it leaves little doubt that retrospective oversight is associated with public support during crises, higher defense spending, and foreign policy success.         "
"5","The analysis is not entirely convincing, however. Domestic oversight and foreign policy outcomes are correlated, but there are reasons to believe that the relationship may not be causal. To take one example, there is scant evidence that the reason publics in high oversight countries support their executives during crises is a belief that they can mete out retrospective punishment. Indeed, Colaresi's own qualitative analysis does not back up his causal stories. In one case study, he suggests that poor oversight in France led to underinvestment in defense and defeat in World War II. In truth, however, French forces were equipped just as well as German forces in May 1940. Similarly, his argument that the United States was able to maintain high military spending during the 1980s because of reinforced oversight ignores the fact that spending as a proportion of gross domestic product was unprecedentedly low at the time.         "
"6","These causal issues notwithstanding, Democracy Declassified is a theoretical and empirical advance over existing liberal scholarship on democratic foreign policy.         "
