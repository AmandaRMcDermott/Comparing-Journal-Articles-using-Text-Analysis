"1","Why do laws and policies on the books not always translate as intended on the ground? Political scientists, sociologists, legal scholars, lawyers, and policymakers alike grapple with this line of inquiry. There is consensus around a short answer: laws and policies do not operate in a cultural void. Instead, they intersect with prevailing cultural norms in complex ways. Understanding this interplay more clearly is key to designing laws and policies whose outcomes align more squarely with their stated goals. In The Balance Gap: Working Mothers and the Limits of the Law, Sarah Cote Hampson investigates how employed women understand and invoke (or decline to invoke) work‐life balance laws and policies.         "
"2","Two in three mothers today work outside the home, and they still complete the majority of childrearing and housekeeping. So supportive policies are crucial to help women reconcile employment with motherhood. Drawing on 48 in‐depth interviews conducted in 2012–2013, Hampson compares the experiences of American mothers and mothers‐to‐be in two workplace settings—public universities and the military—to shed light on the gap between policy and the extent to which women feel the policies’ impacts in their daily lives."
"3","Hampson found that the degree to which women were knowledgeable about their rights at work, a state that scholars call “legal consciousness,” influenced whether they considered themselves rights holders able to mobilize and use work‐life policies. Women benefited from strong “institutional consciousness networks” (informal collections of men and women who understand themselves as rights‐holding members of a group, such as parents). These networks helped women better understand and navigate prevailing institutional cultures on college campuses and in the military that stigmatized mothers for caring for their families."
"4","Although work‐life policies are, in theory, instituted to allow women to provide familial care, Hampson shows how they in fact reinforced and perpetuated the stereotype that mothers are less capable in both workplace settings. This stereotype had disastrous consequences for her respondents. Policies such as maternity leave, flexible work accommodations, and time for lactation often proved problematic for women's career advancement, retention, and equality at work. This study confirms the work of other scholars who argue that work‐life laws and policies are not necessarily implemented to help women or bring about social change. The Balance Gap illuminates how the gendered assumptions underlying work‐life policies can sometimes hinder, rather than help, women on the job. Institutional consciousness networks, Hampson argues, are the “building blocks of collective resistance” (p. 139) to harmful workplace standards that penalize mothers.         "
"5","She rightly underscores the utility of a comparative analysis because it enables her to investigate whether and how women's experiences grappling with work‐life policies differ by race, education level, age, and social class. Readers would benefit from deeper analyses of these variations. For instance, 18 percent of active‐duty military personnel today have a bachelor's or advanced degree, while a PhD is virtually required for university faculty. How might these educational differences (and relatedly, women's trajectories into these careers) have shaped their perceptions of the available policies? The dearth of intersectional theorizing may be due in part to recruitment tactics and sample selection (for example, 45 of the 48 women Hampson interviewed identified as white, but white women make up only 53 percent of active‐duty women in the military in 2011). The experiences of nonwhite women are therefore largely absent in this analysis of legal consciousness formation, so the findings should be contextualized accordingly."
"6","The Balance Gap is an insightful read for those interested in gender, motherhood, work‐family law, and social change. Leveraging the concept of legal consciousness to understand the gap between work‐life policies and reduced work‐family conflict for women is an important contribution.         "
