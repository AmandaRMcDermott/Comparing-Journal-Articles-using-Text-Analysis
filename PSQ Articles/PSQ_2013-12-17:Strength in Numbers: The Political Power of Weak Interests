"1","Few books are entirely without merit, and Strength in Numbers has several merits. It is well‐written, the case studies are interesting and on‐point, and its core point—that diffuse interests “win” in politics more often than a naïve Chicago‐style model might predict—is clearly correct.         "
"2","Still, it is hard not to find the book frustrating. There are several confusions (or intentional muddling‐togethers‐for‐simplicity— I cannot tell) that limit the book's impact on anyone not already convinced of its message."
"3","First, there is the mischaracterization of Mancur Olson's core theory in The Logic of Collective Action. Parson Malthus is often mischaracterized in just this way. Malthus never said, in his “Essay on the Principle of Population,” that there would be famines. He said that famine would be the natural state of mankind unless social norms could be marshaled and society managed by rational principles.         "
"4","Olson makes an analogous point in Logic. He never claims that effective groups do not form. Rather, he says that successful groups either manage to put together selective incentives for participation, or else manage to use ideology and social connections to organize. The economic logic of group interest equaling private action fails; it takes something else. So the interesting question (and I heard this from Olson's own mouth, many times) is: Why so many large groups do in fact form, when pure economics predicts that they would fail?         "
"5","But Gunnar Trumbull can be forgiven this point. The caricature of Olson is common among those who disagree with him, and Trumbull's description is a central claim in the literature. The second and more‐damaging problem is the strange conflation of Olson with the Chicago model of regulatory capture, which is an entirely separate argument. Olson's work is best considered as an original text for the Indiana Institutional school, led by Vincent and Elinor Ostrom (the latter won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2009). In this view, transactions costs and diffuse interests are the problem, and institutions are the solution. The Ostroms showed a Darwin‐like delight in cataloging the diversity of institutional solutions to various collective‐action problems. This work is cited in Strength in Numbers (p. 5) as a counterargument to Olson, when, in fact it is the natural outgrowth of Olson's core question: since simple group action cannot solve problems of organization, what alternative forms of organization should we expect?         "
"6","The third difficulty with Strength in Numbers is its apparent goal of defeating the Chicago regulatory model. I have some sympathy with Trumbull's argument, since I published an article entitled “How Unorganized Interests Get Represented” in 1986 in the American Political Science Review. But the Chicago regulation view, based on incentives for regulatory capture and not Olson's collective action problem, alleges that the incentives faced by elected and appointed officials prevent them from acting as a pure public interest model would predict. Actual group action is nearly epiphenomenal in this view, and Trumbull's triumphant critique is beside the point.         "
"7","And that is why Trumbull never actually engages with the literature he believes he demolishes. The Chicago view is that self‐interest and transactions costs block the pure public interest agenda, so the glass is half‐empty. Trumbull gives examples and good arguments for why diffuse groups do actually win sometimes, so the glass is half‐full."
"8","Still, as I said above, the book has real strengths. The case studies are rich and interesting, in just the way that Ostrom's extensions of Olson are interesting. People are more clever than the naïve self‐interest model gives them credit for being. Trumbull is quite right about this, and the book is an important contribution to the debate over the nature of regulation and public policy."
