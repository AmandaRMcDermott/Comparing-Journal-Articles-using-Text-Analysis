"1","What does a good economy look like, and how do we get there? K. Sabeel Rahman asks these questions—one moral, the other pragmatic—and suggests that most contemporary political actors are looking in the wrong place for both answers. He characterizes the discourse as overly concerned with politically neutral metrics such as consumer welfare and growth, and he critiques policy debates as narrowly centered on the dosage of regulation: pitting more (and more sophisticated) technocratic management against a less regulated, freer market. Alternatively, Rahman reframes the problems with the modern American economy as problems of power relations, arguing that the good economy is one that prevents domination—the accumulation of arbitrary unchecked power over others—and that we can get there by making the regulatory state a site of robust democratic action.         "
"2","Rahman's normative arguments are well constructed and will certainly find a supportive readership among progressives inclined to welcome the book's democratic recommendations and wariness of large corporations and technocrats. But Democracy Against Domination is more than a sermon the choir will love; it is a provocative reframing of today's dilemmas of economic justice, built on a synthesis of more than a century of regulatory law and political thought. In particular, Rahman draws on John Dewey and Louis Brandeis, bringing insights from an earlier gilded age to our current political debates. Rahman does readers a true service by facilitating this century‐spanning dialogue.         "
"3","In the preface, Rahman sagely notes that books do not “‘end’; they merely stop” because the ideas need to be shared and critiqued to move forward (p. xii). In that spirit, I will offer a few areas in which the book's ideas could be refined. First, Rahman argues that our rhetoric of risk and growth leave financial regulation in the cold hands of technocrats, separated from the moral concerns of the public and divorced from questions about power. Is this portrayal accurate? Today's conversation about the political economy is morally charged on both sides, with regulations framed as job killers or corporate interests as greedy villains. Furthermore, economic growth and risk are deeply connected to political power. Both matter greatly for the levels of engaged participation that Rahman holds up as a primary solution to domination. Risk, growth, and inequality are not merely amoral metrics; they are foundational to democratic engagement.         "
"4","This brings me to a second concern. Rahman sets forth an agenda of institutional reforms to increase the power of the public in regulatory agencies (for example, enhanced roles for civic organizations, channels of direct democracy) and to limit the power of large corporations (for example, robust antitrust law, treating financial services as public utilities). But popular politics is not immune to the domination problem, and I was left wondering whether and how the recommend strategies would work. Would the patterns of engagement in these reformed institutions be all that different from the class bias we see in the electorate? How would the politics of these institutions be protected from the disproportionate influence of moneyed interests? Could legislators be incentivized to make regulatory changes that will engage citizens? Are ordinary people up to the challenge of monitoring financial regulation with institutional support, or is the global economic system too complex?"
"5","Several such empirical questions remain, but in a sense, they are an indication of one of this book's primary strengths. Like the best normative literature, Democracy Against Domination suggests an agenda that could be tested and tried by political actors and empirical researchers. This thoughtful book brings power directly into the conversation about financial regulation, revealing the deep roots of that connection in American intellectual history and offering readers new directions for institutional reform and scholarly inquiry.
