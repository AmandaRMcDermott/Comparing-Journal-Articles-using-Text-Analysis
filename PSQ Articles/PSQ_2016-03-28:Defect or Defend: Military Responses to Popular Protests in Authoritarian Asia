"1","When authoritarian regimes collapse, the protestors who take to the streets, risking the government's wrath, or liberalizing elites are generally lauded as the heroes of democratization. Yet militaries are often decisive actors in determining whether regimes endure or perish, choosing whether to protect the government, refuse repression, or even actively pursue the leader's ouster. In this book, Terence Lee seeks to explain why militaries choose to either “defect or defend” when authoritarian governments face virulent political protests. To do so, he examines two cases of military defection and regime collapse, the Philippines and Indonesia, and two cases in which militaries repressed popular protests and successfully defended the regime, China and Burma (Myanmar). Lee provides impressive detail about the relevant events and decision making in these cases, utilizing revealing interview material to substantiate his arguments. This rich case material suggests that some of the concepts and theories could be further refined, potentially helping explain the outliers that the author refers to in the conclusion."
"2","Lee's primary argument is that militaries are more inclined to divide and defect in instances with “personalistic” rule and much less likely to do so when authoritarian regimes develop “power‐sharing institutions” (p. 5). Lee defines personalism as the “degree to which decision‐making and coercive power is concentrated in the hands of one person” (p. 38)—in other words, an empowered dictator. Purges of distrusted officers, “divide and rule” strategies, and the creation of parallel forces indicate personalistic rule. This conceptualization of personalism resembles both Samuel P. Huntington's notion of subjective control in The Soldier and the State and Eric Nordlinger's concept of the “penetration” model of civilian control in Soldiers in Politics: Military Coups and Governments. However, Lee's model and case studies emphasize personal loyalties much more than political ideologies and tendencies. What stands out more than the solitary, long‐term dictators in the Philippines and Indonesia—Lee's cases of personalism—is the corruption that permeated these regimes. Both Ferdinand Marcos and Suharto used their positions to pursue financial gain for their families and friends and meddled in military personnel issues for apparently personal motives.         "
"3","This aspect of personalism creates incentives for defection, particularly for military leaders who have lost significant professional opportunities through favoritism, yet the argument provides less insight into why others join these movements. Lee suggests that military personnel choose sides largely to maximize career and financial opportunities. Examining similar crises in Latin America, however, David Pion‐Berlin, Diego Esparza, and Kevin Grisham in their 2014 article “Staying Quartered: Civilian Uprisings and Military Disobedience in the Twenty‐First Century” identify a broader range of factors affecting these decisions, including concerns about institutional integrity, legality, and long‐standing military role beliefs. In Lee's personalistic cases, the uncertainty inherent in personnel decisions that are seemingly based on the leader's whim and perceptions of loyalty rather than officers' professional merit or even ideological alignment would also seem likely to create discontent deep within the forces."
"4","However, if Lee's analysis of military motivations could be deepened, in other ways, the book goes beyond explaining military behavior in the face of protest, providing insight into the broader question of why authoritarian regimes collapse. Lee's discussion of personalism versus institutionalism helps explain not only military defection but also why other elites might join the opposition. In the Philippines, Lee demonstrates the central role of foreign actors in crisis moments, a factor that may also be relevant in other cases. In sum, Defect or Defend not only provides an interesting and provocative argument but also includes detailed empirical material that allows the reader to extend that analysis even further.         "
