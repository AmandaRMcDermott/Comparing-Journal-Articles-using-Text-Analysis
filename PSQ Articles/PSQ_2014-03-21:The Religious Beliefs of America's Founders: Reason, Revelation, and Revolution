"1","In his new book, Gregg Frazer presents an original and persuasive treatment of the religious beliefs of America's Founders. According to Frazer, the most influential American Founders were neither Christians nor deists but rather what he calls “theistic rationalists,” and the Founders sought to establish a republic that was neither secular nor Christian but rather one based upon theistic rationalism."
"2","Frazer defines “theistic rationalism” as “a hybrid belief system mixing elements of natural religion, Christianity, and rationalism, with rationalism as the predominant element” (p. 14). This “belief system” was not deistic, because in contrast to deism, it posited that God was providentially involved in the events of the world, that at least some of the Bible was inspired by God, and that Jesus Christ was a good moral figure. Neither was this belief system Christianity, however, because it rejected the divinity of Jesus, the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures, and other key Christian doctrines such as the Trinity, the necessity of belief in Jesus for salvation by grace alone, and substitutionary atonement—doctrines that theistic rationalists regard as being the result of a corruption of the teachings of Jesus by St. Paul and later leaders of the church."
"3","With persistent and skillful appeal to the public writings and private correspondence of the Founders, Frazer shows persuasively that some Founders often regarded by scholars as deists, such as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, were not deists. On the other hand, Frazier shows irrefutably that Founders sometimes thought by scholars to be Christians, such as George Washington, John Adams, and James Madison, were not Christians; the fairness of the author's treatment of these men is seen in Frazer's willingness to acknowledge Christian belief where it actually existed, as seen, for example, in Frazer's treatment of Hamilton's conversion to Christianity at the end of his life (pp. 193–196). In his treatment of the theistic rationalism of leading ministers of the period, Frazer argues persuasively that there exists an incompatibility between orthodox Christianity and Lockean ideas such as the right of resistance (pp. 102–105). This important theme of the incompatibility of Christianity and Enlightenment political ideas is one that appears throughout the book and leads Frazer to refer to theistic rationalism as the “contradictory nature of the hybrid religion of the period” (p. 87)."
"4","In spite of the strength of Frazer's arguments, some will criticize him for minor weaknesses. For example, Frazer omitted discussion of some Founders who were orthodox Christians. For example, Mark Hall's recent book, Roger Sherman and the Creation of the American Republic, shows Sherman's sincere Calvinist convictions that influenced his political thinking. Similarly, Frazer's treatment of influential ministers is persuasive in showing the incompatibility of Lockean and Christian political thinking and yet omits any significant treatment of those ministers of the period, such as Timothy Dwight or Jonathan Edwards, Jr., whose beliefs and political opinions were entirely within the orthodox Christian tradition. In addition, one wonders if “Unitarian” may have been a better way to describe the Founders than “theistic rationalist,” since they (pp. 121, 155, 185, 221), and those who influenced them (pp. 33–35, 38, 50, 62, 73), were often called Unitarians by Frazer.         "
"5","This book is a necessary read for any serious scholar who studies the place of religion at the American Founding, and it is a fascinating challenge to the general reader who is willing to see the Founders as establishing neither a Christian nor a secular republic."
