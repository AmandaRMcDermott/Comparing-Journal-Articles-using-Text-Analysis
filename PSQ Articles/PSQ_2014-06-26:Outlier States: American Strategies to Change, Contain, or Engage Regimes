"1","How should the United States deal with problematic countries, like Iran and North Korea, that support international terrorism and pursue weapons of mass destruction? In Outlier States: American Strategies to Change, Contain, or Engage Regimes, Robert S. Litwak of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars skillfully tackles this important question in his third of a trilogy of books on the subject.         "
"2","The work begins with an enlightening description of how views of, and strategies toward, “rogue” states have changed over time. Litwak argues that before the terror attacks of September 11, the United States generally sought to isolate and contain these countries, although there were some brief periods of engagement. After September 11, the U.S. approach shifted as the George W. Bush administration decided that the problem was the character of the regimes themselves and that, therefore, regime change was the only possible solution. The election of Barack Obama ushered in a new approach, offering these states a choice between punishment and isolation so long as they violate international norms, or the promise of benefits if they chose to rejoin the community of nations. Even the term used to describe these states has changed over time, from “outlaws” to “rogues” to, under the Obama administration, “outliers.”"
"3","The book is theoretically and methodologically informed, elaborating on how the Obama administration approach is consistent with Hedley Bull and the English School's conception of international society and basing the empirics on Alexander George's recommendations for qualitative research methods."
"4","The heart of the book, and perhaps its greatest contribution, is a series of in‐depth case studies of outlier states from World War II to the present. Indeed, the breadth of cases covered in the book is truly impressive. It examines the various pathways by which rogue states, including Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Mao's China, Pol Pot's Cambodia, Idi Amin's Uganda, Ceausescu's Romania, and Apartheid South Africa, have transitioned back into international society in the past. Next, it explores U.S. strategies toward outliers in the recent past in studies of Iraq and Libya. Finally, it delves into ongoing cases of contemporary concern—Iran and North Korea—and provides recommendations for policymakers."
"5","The studies are well done and bring forward original material, some from a new collection of documents compiled by Litwak's Wilson Center. To be sure, the book could have gone further in spelling out what lessons the reader should draw from these detailed case studies. Although it claims to identify “conditional generalizations about norm compliance gleaned from the comparative analysis” (p. 86), the “Assessment and Implications” section that concludes each chapter often provides a mere recapitulation of material that came earlier."
"6","In addition, since the book refrains from drawing firm conclusions, it is not clear that the policy recommendations flow directly from the historical analysis. Litwak recommends that the United States opt for the containment of both Iran and North Korea, yet this seems to be in tension with earlier claims that the United States must tailor its strategy to different circumstances in different countries. After all, containment is the only realistic option for North Korea, a country that is estimated to already possess nuclear material for over a dozen warheads. Iran, on the other hand, remains short of the nuclear threshold, and diplomatic and military options can still be pursued before we must settle for containment."
"7","Nevertheless, despite these limitations, Outlier States is a must‐read for scholars interested in understanding the states that have flouted international norms and then reintegrated into the community of nations in the past and the problem states that still bedevil us today.         "
