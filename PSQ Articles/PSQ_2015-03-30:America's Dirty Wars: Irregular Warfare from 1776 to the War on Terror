"1","The title of this book by Davidson College professor Russell Crandall is inaccurate; fortunately, the subtitle corrects the error. America's Dirty Wars describes both American and, more briefly, other countries' experiences in irregular warfare beginning with the American Revolution, when a band of insurgents defeated the world's dominant military power in a war that was not particularly dirty by the standards of the time. Crandall acknowledges as much, noting that “the United States, where it has involved itself in dirty wars, has in fact done so on widely varying levels of engagement, and with various levels of commitment and dirtiness” (p. 6). He himself has a varying level of commitment to the term “dirty war,” often preferring the more accurate “irregular war,” and one suspects that the racier word was chosen to drive sales.         "
"2","Despite the less than scholarly title, this is a serious survey of the most common form of warfare in the post‐Westphalian era. It notes the moral ambiguity that often flows from the choice of combatants to eschew uniforms and renounce the international norms and laws of warfare as well as the too often ignored fact that the United States wins more irregular wars than it loses. Most importantly, Crandall is determined to learn lessons from previous examples of irregular warfare in order to increase the chances that the United States will improve its position in the international system during the conduct of future wars. He is correctly convinced that those fights will more closely resemble Vietnam and Afghanistan than the historically unusual “regular” conflict between two uniformed armies of Operation Desert Storm."
"3","After a brief discussion of “Irregular Warfare 101,” Crandall begins his survey with a history of the American Revolution. He highlights George Washington's realization over time that his forces could not hope to stand against their opponents on an open battlefield, leading them to adopt a form of guerrilla warfare, although that term would not be invented for decades to come. He somewhat oddly treats the U.S. campaigns against the Confederacy and Native Americans together in one chapter before turning to the Philippine insurrection and the so‐called Banana Wars in the first third of the last century, but the vast majority of the book focuses on the Cold War and its aftermath."
"4","A Latin Americanist by training and inclination, Crandall's expertise and interest are evident; for example, he spends just 27 pages on both the French and American experiences in Vietnam while devoting 31 pages to the much less historically important U.S. campaign in El Salvador. The Iraq War receives 29 pages, as does the American campaign in Afghanistan. Crandall begins his conclusion by quoting a U.S. Special Forces general as saying, “Nowadays, everyone calls himself a counterinsurgency expert” (p. 467); an unkind reader might suggest that the quip could be turned against a scholar of Latin American politics looking for a broader readership."
"5","It is impossible not to compare this book with the work of Russell F. Weigley, whose 1960 work The American Way of War is the standard text on American inability to learn lessons from previous irregular warfare campaigns. Crandall admits his debt to the master before stating his own thesis that “even when it is possible to do so, the United States does not properly learn from its involvement in dirty wars” (p. 14). One wishes that he had spent more time examining what complexes and failings lead to this inability to learn, as current events indicate that irregular warfare—regardless of its dirtiness—is likely to challenge America for many generations to come.
