"1","In 1948, the Empire Windrush docked in London with over 500 West Indian passengers—the first postwar wave of Commonwealth migrants seeking better economic opportunities in the metropole. Their arrival sparked a fierce public debate about race, immigration, and citizenship that reached its crescendo in the 1960s. Kennetta Hammond Perry's excellent new study explores how these black Britons shaped the civil rights movement in Britain. Perry argues that black migrants made claims about citizenship and cultural inclusion that successfully challenged racial discrimination. “In doing so,” she contends, “they subsequently remapped the very boundaries of what it meant to be both Black and British in a critical juncture in the history of empire and transnational race politics in the twentieth century” (p. 6).         "
"2","Perry begins by addressing how West Indian migrants battled institutional and cultural racism with an appeal to a shared sense of Britishness. Under the provisions of the 1948 British Nationality Act, all Commonwealth subjects technically enjoyed the same legal status. In reality, nonwhites faced discriminatory practices in housing and employment, as well as relegation to the cultural margins of society. Black Britons fought back by embracing a malleable identity that was, at least in part, “British.” In one fascinating section, Perry analyzes how migrants commissioned family photographs that reflected images of consumerism and domesticity—quintessential “British” values. This theme of cultural inclusion is central to the book's thesis, and reflects a clear strategy in which migrants articulated an ideal of imperial citizenship “that did not distinguish between colonizers and colonized” (p. 58)."
"3","The second half of the book chronicles the rise of antiracist political activism in Britain and places it within the wider contours of decolonization, the Cold War, and the transnational black diaspora. Perry moves beyond the traditional study of policymakers and statesmen to address the pivotal role of this “Windrush Generation” in forcing a public conversation about racial discrimination. Her chapters focus on how key moments such as the 1958 “Race Riots,” the killing of migrant Kelso Cochrane, and the passage of the 1962 Commonwealth Immigration Act mobilized black opinion to challenge the color bar. For example, activists used the media to characterize the slain Cochrane as a hardworking family man denied the basic rights of security and justice and angrily questioned, “are we to be to be mauled down just because we are black?” (p. 128). This effective strategy challenged what Perry terms the “mystique of British anti‐racism”—the popular notion of Britain as a progressive society of inclusion and tolerance—and placed considerable pressure on a government which desperately wanted to avoid international comparisons to apartheid South Africa or Jim Crow America. Perry's last chapter addresses the success of grassroots movements in securing the passage of the 1965 Race Relations Act, a landmark piece of legislation outlawing forms of public discrimination. Though the act ultimately was rather limited in its scope, it nonetheless forced whites to acknowledge the prevalence of racism in British society."
"4","London Is the Place for Me is an important work that places black Britons at the heart of the political and cultural struggle against racial discrimination in postcolonial Britain, and it should be widely read by a multidisciplinary audience of historians, political scientists, and sociologists. Although Perry concludes her study with the late 1960s, her brief epilogue, revisiting the 2011 shooting death of Mark Duggan by the Metropolitan Police, serves as a pointed reminder of the enduring legacy of racial inequality in democratic societies on both sides of the Atlantic.
