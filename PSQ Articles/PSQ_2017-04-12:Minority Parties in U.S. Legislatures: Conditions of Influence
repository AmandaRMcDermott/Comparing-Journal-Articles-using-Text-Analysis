"1","Why and when are some (minority‐party) legislators more influential than others? In this impressive work, Jennifer Hayes Clark examines whether minority‐party members are able to play a role as active participants in the legislative processes of their states. Are they locked out at the committee assignment, cosponsorship, floor consideration, roll call voting, or final passage stage of the legislative process? Do they receive equal treatment compared with majority‐party members? What contextual factors condition these relationships?"
"2","The research design is ambitious and careful. Clark has mastered the art of crafting scripts to scrape from the multiple and various data formats maintained on state websites the information needed to tally the legislative history of all bills (and to categorize them), the roll call votes of legislators, their sponsorship activities, and much more, typically for 10 years or more per legislature. The design is also cognizant of potential data limitations. For instance, polarization is measured using elite surveys to preclude bias arising from the legislative process."
"3","Results are remarkably robust across stages of the legislative process. Consistent with institutional theories, minority members achieve more influence when their party has stronger institutional prerogatives (for example, the right to appoint committee members) and the majority has fewer institutional powers. Preference alignment also matters, with minority members included much more comprehensively when there is less party polarization. Finally, workload and informational context matter. Clark finds consistent evidence that the minority has a stronger hand in the legislative process in chambers with few staff and a high workload. Clark argues this is a context in which the legislative work of and information held by the minority has the highest value for the majority. This finding is somewhat surprising, as it contradicts expectations from some earlier literature that a high workload is associated with more majority leadership power. Further investigation to more fully tease out the causal mechanisms behind Clark's finding seems warranted."
"4","If there is a downside to this work, it is that the book could have gone further to test a broader range of theories. For instance, several recent works building on my article “The Logic of Legislative Leadership” (Legislative Studies Quarterly, May 2010) in the state legislative literature have found evidence that workload and the structure of preferences interact to shape party power. The idea is that polarization most powerfully motivates strengthening majority‐party power when the workload is high. Clark does not test this notion. More might also be done to explore how influence at one stage in the legislative process conditions success at later stages.         "
"5","There is also a risk that some readers will be confused by the omission of any effort to visualize the marginal effects of variables in the context of the interaction term. Because most of the variables Clark interacts with minority‐party membership to test her hypotheses are always positive and relatively large, the reality of minority disadvantage across the range of observed independent variable values may easily be missed."
"6","These minor issues aside, Clark has provided a solid and impressive contribution. It belongs on the shelves of all scholars of state legislatures, not to mention being worth a read for those interested in legislatures or state politics more generally. Clark's book deserves to be frequently cited as standing at the foundation of many strains of research in state legislative politics."
