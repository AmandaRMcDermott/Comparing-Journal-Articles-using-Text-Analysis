"1","Thomas Stewart and Patrick J. Wolf's new book provides an in‐depth look at the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), a federally funded voucher that provides low‐income students in Washington, DC, the opportunity to attend private school. In focusing on the qualitative experiences of parents, schools, and administrators, The School Choice Journey differentiates itself from other work on school choice, which is often more concerned with its politics or impact on student achievement. Other studies by Wolf (who is lead evaluator of the OSP) and his colleagues have found that the voucher had no effect on test scores but a large positive effect on high school graduation and parent satisfaction.         "
"2","The School Choice Journey uses five years of interviews, surveys, and focus groups to examine how parents and other stakeholders engaged with the OSP over time and to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Stewart and Wolf are particularly interested in the question of whether the “school choice journey” can transform parents “from passive clients of government services to informed consumers of educational options and … empowered citizens willing and able to shape public policy” (p. 6). They hypothesize that by engaging families traditionally left behind, school choice can have antipoverty effects beyond its impact on schooling outcomes. This is an intriguing proposition, and one I have not seen seriously explored. Unfortunately, while the book has much to offer, it does not fully deliver on this question.         "
"3","The OSP would seem to provide the ideal opportunity to study the impact of program participation on civic involvement. In 2009, the Barack Obama administration closed the OSP to new enrollees and rescinded the scholarships of 216 already admitted students. Uncertainty surrounding its future gave families the opportunity to engage their political muscle and fight for its continuation. OSP families took part in organized rallies, publicity campaigns, and congressional hearings, and the program was successfully reinstated in 2011. This dramatic episode—which opens and closes the book—is the authors' primary source of evidence that school choice programs empower their participants."
"4","Beyond a few anecdotes, however, there is little evidence provided that links school choice to civic engagement. The authors admit that “the OSP would not have been nearly as successful in moving participants from clients … to active citizens had policy makers … .not tried to take it away” (p. 143). One wonders whether program participants would have been similarly willing to protest the loss of any other large public subsidy. The book also ignores the outsize role national philanthropies played in facilitating the campaign to save the OSP, which—being in Washington, DC—played out on a national stage. Without diminishing the role families played in the effort, it is hard to know how generalizable their experience is beyond the Beltway."
"5","Where the book succeeds most is in its analysis of parent behavior and in offering concrete advice to policymakers. It usefully draws parallels between parents' criteria for choosing schools and Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where a safe environment is sought ahead of higher‐order concerns such as school quality. OSP parents were found to be frequently misinformed about basic services provided by their school and about their own expected level of involvement. The authors recommend that providers do more to assist parents in making school choices—beyond simply providing information—and target supports to students who are struggling to make the transition from public to private school. This is but one example of useful advice found in the book."
"6","On balance, the OSP has been a success, both for its families and for its political backers. Whether school choice builds consumer and civic skills that benefit families beyond the education sphere is a question that The School Choice Journey provocatively raises for future research.         "
