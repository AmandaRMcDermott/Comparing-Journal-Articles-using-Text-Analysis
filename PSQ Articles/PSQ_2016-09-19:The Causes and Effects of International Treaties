"1","THE UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION DOMINATED the negotiations leading to the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but many states had to consent to conclude the treaty.1 Their hegemonic influence was also insufficient to ensure the treaty's entry into force, and only slowly did states internalize verifiable nonproliferation as a norm.2 Is this experience representative of the larger pattern of the negotiation and entry into force of international treaties? Do states use international treaties when coerced to do so by a hegemon, to formalize agreement after they have converged on desirable outcomes, or to generate new standards of appropriate behavior to be internalized with time? In short, what is the relationship, if any, between the distribution of preferences and international cooperation?         "
"2","Political scientists have struggled to explain why states cooperate through multilateral treaties.3 Recent studies have found that treaty accession has potent screening effects, both upon states considering accession4 and upon members seeking to limit admission.5 Treaties also constrain states when treaty monitoring and enforcement are costly.6 However, these results assume treaty participation can be decomposed into a question of a single state facing costs ex ante to signal its type or ex post that constrain its behavior. This is useful if one state is choosing to join an existing institution or a group of states is choosing which states to admit.         "
"3","New collective action entails a series of events beginning with multilateral negotiations that only sometimes result in a text that state representatives can sign. Some or all of a population of states (usually specified in advance) must then ratify the agreement in order for it to enter into force, and then states are obligated to begin its implementation.7 When collectively considering new or expanded cooperation, rational states should consider the choices they expect others to make. As with the classic stag hunt game, states may be unwilling to risk accession or even signature unless reasonably assured that others will reciprocate.         "
"4","This process, however, poses a different dynamic and should not be treated as a bilateral agreement or decomposed into a series of dyadic relationships.8 If not coerced by a powerful state,9 commitments to cooperate are fundamentally a question of beliefs about the distribution of interests: are states in the system sufficiently similar that they believe they will not suffer the costs of asymmetric accession or defection by others? Treaties specify standards of behavior (and often their monitoring and enforcement) and contribute to an international socialization process,10 but I argue that the distribution of preferences both varies and affects the prior ability of states in the international system to formalize this cooperation. Specifically, I argue that political conflicts in the international system motivate treaty negotiations and converging interests allow them to enter into force.         "
"5","I create a new issue‐specific measure of preference similarity from United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) roll call voting records and use regression analysis to examine whether the systemic distribution of overall and issue‐specific preferences is a statistically significant cause of international treaty cooperation. The results partly confirm the socialization findings of Bearce and Bondanella but also add to our understanding of the causes and effects of formalized cooperation by showing a strong relationship between international interest similarity and the likelihood that states will be able to achieve international cooperation in the first place. I find that political conflict (divergent interests) motivates demand for cooperation, but its supply in treaty events requires signals that cooperation can succeed (converging interests) in order to move from treaty negotiation to entry into force."
"6","International relations scholars generally hold one of three divergent expectations about the effect of states’ preferences on their international treaty behavior. The first, held by most realists, assumes state preferences do not vary but are fixed, identically ordered, and inherently conflicted.11 The likelihood of any international outcome is determined primarily by the distribution of power: international treaties occur when dominant states use their power to facilitate “cooperative” outcomes that are in their interest, even when they are not direct participants in the resulting agreements.12 In short, the realist perspective argues that most states enter into international agreements because this is the order provided by the dominant state.         "
"7","Second, most rational institutionalists argue that international treaties occur because two or more states need formal cooperation to structure the adjustment of their behavior to produce mutually advantageous outcomes.13 Recent contributions have focused on the selection effects created when costs signal that an agreement is self‐enforcing, but implicit in the various results are the participating actors’ preferences: the distribution of state interests determines whether a policy outcome exists that the relevant actors will collectively find acceptable.14 Dyadic peace,15 trade,16 and other forms of cooperation are believed to be made more likely by greater bilateral interest similarity. As strategies used to satisfy a state's underlying interests, these behaviors are revealed preferences that reflect their expected value, and strategies may change over time as norms, identities, or information about the world change. Even the preference for national survival may not be fixed.17"
"8","While scholars have found some evidence of a positive and significant relationship between generally cooperative outcomes and the dyadic convergence of overall preferences,18 these findings are of less use for understanding the dynamic in place when states are confronting the uncertainties of multilateral negotiation and accession to new cooperation. When states are considering whether to sign and bring into force international treaties, it is the multilateral or systemic constellation of preferences that should determine whether a multilateral, self‐enforcing bargain exists.19 With less fear of the sucker's payoff from asymmetric accession or compliance, states should be more likely to commit as interests converge.         "
"9","However, antipathy so complete as to cause war is rare. Little cooperation is as open‐ended as the creation of the United Nations or as encompassing as the unification of Germany. Most multilateral cooperation is specific to an issue, such as a ban on nuclear weapons testing (the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) or a reduction in trade barriers (the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs or GATT). Narrowing the generalized rationalist conjecture, do new international agreements within an issue area become more likely as interests converge on that issue? Lyne, Nielson, and Tierney, for example, find a correlation between key states’ environmental interests and levels of environmentally friendly lending at the World Bank.20 Also, the GATT succeeded in advancing trade liberalization by extending its membership but also over several negotiating rounds extended the scope and breadth of the agreement. However, since the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), negotiations have foundered because states disagree about agricultural subsidies. A change in the distribution of international interests on an issue should affect the opportunity to coordinate among a group of states to produce joint gains within that policy area.         "
"10","Characterizing a third set of assumptions, constructivists argue that treaties play an important role in socializing actors as vehicles for actors to compete over and transmit norms, principles, and identities.21 Negotiators, constructivists argue, construct a common frame of reference about the nature of problems, and the appropriate strategies for resolution, and then communicate these new social constructions to domestic and international audiences.22 The willingness of a critical mass of the international community to embrace new standards of behavior is hypothesized to cause a norm cascade in which states experience increasing social pressure to enter into and comply with these treaties.23 Although most have not found empirical evidence of the socializing effect of international institutions, recent work shows that interest similarity overall increases among states sharing membership in international institutions.24"
"11","In short, most scholars agree that the international distribution of state preferences is important to the causal processes that determine state behavior but disagree about the direction of the effect. Rational institutionalists see a change in the distribution of interests as changing the opportunity structure confronting alternative strategies: more similar preferences over outcomes increases the likelihood of collective action on those outcomes. Constructivists argue that most change in state preferences over strategies occurs after processes of contestation and institutionalization lend legitimacy to new norms, principles, or identities. They also find only a weak effect, if any. This presents an empirical challenge if treaty events are not unrelated to the distribution of interests: do treaties enable cooperation when interests have converged on an acceptable outcome, or does the process of negotiation and institutionalization cause convergence?"
"12","While international institutions may cause the interests of the participating states to become more similar, I argue that the international treaties creating them are more likely to arise as the international distribution of interests becomes more similar. The core intuition is that states considering cooperation are estimating the likelihood of benefitting from cooperation using signals from the systemic distribution of preferences both overall and on the specific issue. States are acquiring information about these preferences from statements but also as state representatives interact in international forums, informally and formally negotiating policy. This suggests that taking seriously the role of preferences in formal cooperation requires attention to the systematic effects of three characteristics: the absolute level of similarity, the change in similarity over time, and the issue dimensions. In this section, I derive several observable implications about the conditions under which these characteristics affect the likelihood of observing formal cooperation. I focus on the opening for signature and entry into force of treaties as distinct but also observable cooperation events."
"13","First, the absolute level of similarity provides information about the demand for cooperation on an issue. Divergent interests point to disagreement over goals or strategies and therefore an inability to resolve the stag hunt problem: how to commit to cooperation when divergent interests can cause the defection of a portion of the community that, while small, can imperil the joint production of gains. Not all issue areas promise gains from the mutual adjustment of behavior, which may be less true for human rights than for trade or security issues. Therefore, the level of preference similarity should be inversely related to demand for cooperation:            "
"14","H1.International treaty events become more likely if international interests are divergent.               "
"15","Second, the direction and magnitude of change in the level of similarity provide information about the risk of cooperation failing. States have incomplete information about the capabilities and interests of others but are continuously updating their beliefs. Therefore, holding constant the absolute level of interest similarity among two states, when actions by the first state suggest that the trajectory of change in its interests is toward the second state, both are more likely to believe that attempts at cooperation will succeed than when their interactions are characterized by increasing conflict. Therefore, while divergent interests create the desire to structure an adjustment of their behavior, converging interests make credible commitments appear easier to achieve:            "
"16","H2.International treaty events become more likely if international interests become more similar.               "
"17","The dimensions in which interests vary are relevant whenever the distribution of overall interests in a population differs from the distribution on an issue under negotiation. When states are attempting to cooperate on a specific issue, it is the distribution of their interests on that issue that creates the need for international treaties. The collective realization that national economic conditions could be better advanced by cooperation on currency prices than by unilateral manipulation, for example, motivated the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).25 The overall distribution of preferences among states in the system provides information about the risk of cooperation failing because of divergent or diverging interests on other issue dimensions. Cooperation on an issue of apparent shared interest may be less likely when overall interests are more dissimilar. Negotiations with Russia over WTO accession, for example, concerned strictly economic conflicts but also issues explicitly excluded from the WTO's scope. States also appear hesitant to impose costs upon states they believe are overall politically similar when they are divergent on one issue, just as the United States ignored Israel's nuclear weapons program in the 1960s. Therefore, the distribution of overall and issue‐specific interests provides differentiable signals of the likelihood of achieving the benefits of cooperation, modifying the observable implications for the first two characteristics.

"23","The power of interest similarity to cause cooperation may be conditional upon other factors. First, it may depend on the cost to states of committing to cooperate. The level of commitment made by states appears to increase as states move from treaty negotiation to entry into force, a difference that is only partly legal.26 Opening a treaty for signature could reflect the point at which the parties reach agreement on a bargain that is likely to be self‐enforcing given the interests of the negotiating states. Accession procedures, though, offer a distinct opportunity for international audiences to observe from domestic‐level bargaining how likely it is that an agreement serves their national interests.27 Leaders should anticipate that treaties that enter into force create reputation costs for reneging, both internationally28 and at home.29 Although variations in national ratification procedures and timing introduce noise, entry into force provides a screening mechanism that is related to the risk of treaty commitment.30 In short, if the stages of cooperation vary in the relative costliness of the signal sent to external audiences about the interest in fulfilling the agreement, the need for similar interests should also vary:            "
"24","H3.International preference similarity is more important for the likelihood of treaties entering into force than opening for signature.               "
"25","The dependent variables are annual counts of opening for signature and entry into force of international treaties from 1945 to 2008, resulting in two discrete dependent variables. As the hypotheses describe issue‐specific observables, I focus on treaties covering nuclear issues because of the generally high risk of commitment and corollary gains from cooperation. A total of 35 treaties are identified by the International Atomic Energy Agency as covering nuclear arms control, nuclear safety, and nuclear security that appear open to all states in the system and therefore are “universal” in their appeal.31 There are 23 years in which at least one opened for signature, and 27 treaties entered into force in 21 years.32 Table 1 reports the key summary statistics for all variables, and Appendix A contains the full list of agreements and their years of opening and entry into force.         "
"26","Preferences should be important causal variables for explaining the strategies states choose when interacting with others, but empirically identifying preferences is problematic.33 Alliance data is the most popular source of international relations data on preferences because alliances are costly signals of state interests.34 However, alliance data do not distinguish states that lack formal alliances because they are hostile from those states that have implicit alignments or are simply strategically irrelevant.35 Others impute state preferences from their unit characteristics, such as predicting the dyadic risk of war from regime type, distance and contiguity, relative military capabilities, trade levels and interdependence, and past history of conflicts.36 Although there may be systematic relationships between some state characteristics and the propensity for certain behaviors, most of these variables are monadic characteristics rather than measures of strategic preferences. Further, indicators such as alliances, regime type, and wealth may capture too many dimensions of a state's interests and be too invariable to explain many outcomes of interest.         "
"27","UNGA roll call voting is used by Voeten to estimate the distance between states’ revealed preferences, and Gartzke uses UNGA voting to test hypotheses related to the democratic peace theorem.37 Both argue that UNGA voting is a useful source of revealed preferences because it is one of the only forums in which nearly all states regularly take formal positions on a wide range of international issues. States are often criticized when they dissent from the consensus expressed in the UNGA, such as the United States for its support of Israel, for its war‐fighting strategies in the Vietnam War, and for not voting to make nuclear weapons illegal. States targeted in specific resolutions—Israel for its treatment of the Palestinian people, South Africa for its apartheid policies, and Iraq for chemical weapons use during the Iran‐Iraq War, for example—perceive a quite significant reputational cost. States voting in the UNGA with the United States and other G7 states are more likely to enjoy World Bank loans and fewer conditions on IMF loans.38 While inference from individual resolutions could be biased because of strategic behavior by states seeking to maximize their returns in an individual interaction, the roll call data offer a large number of interactions in which most states have little incentive to be insincere, and therefore this provides a mechanism for inferring something about preferences.         "
"28","However, using all UNGA votes may also capture preferences that are too broad for any specific issue.39 I create new data sets of annual measures of preference similarity (S) using 4,943 UNGA roll call votes on resolutions from 1946 to 2008 as compiled by Gartzke and Jo for 1946 to 1996 and extended by Voeten.40 I first coded all resolutions by issue categories using the text descriptions of the resolutions provided by Voeten. For example, there were 1,957 resolutions related to sovereignty issues (including decolonization, independence, trusteeships, or other occupations), 1,174 resolutions pertaining to human rights, 729 to nuclear weapons or complete and general disarmament, 419 to economic or development issues, and 35 to the environment.41 (For a detailed description, see Appendix B.) Resolutions may refer to the goals of specific treaties but do so in the broadest terms and lack legal effect. Further, the persistence of particular issues over time, such as repeated resolutions from the late 1950s forward on the need for a comprehensive nuclear test ban, call attention to the distribution of interests by offering new opportunities for states to publicly stand firm or revise their position.         "
"29","New overall and issue‐specific S were then calculated.42 Generally, S uses any set of quantitative data on state foreign policy positions to mathematically calculate the differences between two states’ foreign policy behavior. Using UNGA votes as an example, S is a calculation of the similarity of two states’ voting behavior:            "
"30","In the foregoing formula, Pik is state i's vote on each UNGA resolution for year t from Pi1 up to PiN, and Pkmax is the maximum possible difference between states i and j given the number of resolutions for which they both have data during year t. If our data include two resolutions and both states vote the same on Resolution 1 (PiR1 –PjR1 = 0) and on Resolution 2 (PiR2 –PjR2 = 0), then for two possible data points (Pmax = 2), I calculate “perfect similarity” (mathematically, 1 –2[0/2] = 1 – 2[0] = 1). By adding more votes and analyzing the similarity of their portfolios over time, I can develop a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the distance between their preferences as revealed in their policy behaviors.         "
"31","Using this method, annual preference similarity scores were generated for all UN member state dyad‐years using all UNGA roll call votes except those on the issue being analyzed (referred to as Overall S) and using vote subsets specific to the issue analyzed, here nuclear issues (Nuclear S). S ranges from −1 to +1, and larger scores indicate greater observed similarity. Overall S is available for all years from 1947 to 2006. Some years are dropped because of insufficient roll call votes for issue‐specific S to be calculated. Nuclear S is available for 1947–1948 and 1957–2008 (except 1964). This aggregation of the data does not tell us what particular outcomes states prefer, but it provides information about the similarity of interests among the international community.         "
"32","I use the mean of annual S scores to proxy the system‐wide level of preference similarity. The mean is sensitive to outliers and other mechanisms that skew the data, but I am more concerned with broad tendencies in the population. Most treaty negotiations attempt to forge a consensus rather than decide by majority vote in order to avoid creating incentives for states to defect. Further, while international treaties are intended to have nearly universal application, negotiations accept that the appeal will fall short and instead target enough of the international population to be effective.43 As shown in Figure 1, which reports the high, mean, median, and low U.S. Nuclear S (1967–2005), the issue‐specific distribution of interests rarely reaches a high level of polarization. Voeten, for example, shows that Cold War divisions were both East/West and North/South, preventing bilateral polarization, and after the Cold War morphed into a single anti‐U.S. or counterhegemonic dimension that still resisted polarization.44 The face validity of these measures is further developed in a study of the negotiation and entry into force of the Nonproliferation Treaty in Appendix C.45 Some skewing is apparent toward similarity (1), and S has been criticized as suffering from this bias with greater numbers of actors in the event data,46 so I include the number of UN members to control for this effect.         "
"33","Rather than using a lagged variable, I explicitly model the change in the distribution in annual S scores by creating new variables from the difference over two years. The Overall S and Nuclear S—Lagged Difference report the change from Xt – 2 to Xt. A negative value indicates a decreasing distance over time, or interest convergence. I also proxy socialization by calculating annual Future Difference variables using the change to Xt + 3 in each S. Bearce and Bondanella prefer a five‐year lag, in part to differentiate the effects of what they believe is a change in information (years 1–3) from those of a change in identity (year 4 onward), although the reported difference in the coefficient is about 0.001 when moving from t0 to the largest value at t4.47 Again, a negative value indicates preference convergence.         "
"34","As the systemic level of democracy may have a structural effect similar to the distribution of interests from UNGA voting, I include the annual mean Revised Combined Polity Score (POLITY2) from the Polity IV data.48 However, there is little expectation from the literature that increasing the systemic level of democracy will affect nuclear arms control agreements.         "
"35","Lastly, if the distribution of preferences does not systematically affect the likelihood of international treaties, treaties may arise when imposed by more dominant states on weaker partners. If so, treaty events should become more likely when the systemic hegemon becomes more capable of imposing agreements on others, even if the hegemon is not a direct participant in the agreement.49 The United States has been the most powerful state since 1945 but has also shared this limited power to veto or supply public goods with the Soviet Union (and, more recently, Russia). To proxy the effect of U.S. power, I use the Correlates of War Project Composite Index of National Capabilities (CINC) score for the United States.50 I include the U.S.S.R./Russia CINC score as it was a peer competitor to the United States that could act as a veto player on some attempts at cooperation.         "
"36","The distribution of power may still interact with the distribution of state interests to cause the observed variation in outcomes.51 It should be easier for a dominant state to impose solutions to collective action problems, or its interest in underwriting and enforcing collective action should increase, when its preferences converge with those of the rest of the international community. Lake argues that dominant states negotiate hierarchic relationships with weaker states in which accommodating both sides’ interests decreases the need for the dominant state to use coercion.52 Therefore, the risk of asymmetric accession and compliance may be reduced if treaties are supported by powerful states.53 To proxy this factor, I include U.S. Nuclear S—Lagged Difference and Future Difference variables and interact both with U.S. CINC. I also include a transformed version Lake's dyadic level of U.S. economic and security hierarchy as an alternative measure of U.S. power, again generating an annual systemic‐level indicator using the annual mean of all dyadic observations of U.S. hierarchy.54"
"37","An important question, however, is whether issue‐specific variables discriminate well from each other or more general proxies. Table 2 reports the correlation coefficients (r) of the independent variables of interest.55 Overall S using all votes is convergent but not perfectly correlated with Overall S (used in this article) that excludes issue‐specific votes (r = 0.87 when excluding nuclear votes). Importantly, Overall S excluding nuclear votes is strongly divergent with Nuclear S (r = 0.37), reflecting strong discriminant validity. Nuclear S is weakly divergent with U.S. CINC and Security Hierarchy and strongly divergent with all other independent variables of interest (r < 0.39). In short, the issue‐specific measure of nuclear preference similarity has discriminant validity and is capturing variation in behavior missed by Overall S.         "
"38","The measures of U.S. power, U.S. CINC score and U.S. economic and security hierarchy, are strongly convergent with each other and negatively correlated with Overall S. The U.S. similarity on nuclear issues to all other states is weakly but negatively convergent with Overall S but strongly divergent with Nuclear S. U.S.S.R./Russian power and systemic level of democracy do not converge with other variables of interest. The number of UN member states does correlate with Overall S, and so its inclusion should control for the tendency of S toward 1 with higher numbers of actors, but it also negatively correlates with measures of U.S. power, and this collinearity will reduce their estimated effects. Not reported are the correlation coefficients of the independent variables with the treaty event counts. They reflect very weak correlations (r < 0.20) with the exceptions, although still strongly discriminant, of Nuclear S (r = 0.35 for agreement count) and U.S. Nuclear S (r = 0.27 for entry into force count).         "
"39","The relationships between interest similarity and international treaty events predicted in the hypotheses (summarized in Table 3) are analyzed using regression analysis. The dependent variables are event counts with no logical upper bound but zero inflated. Therefore, all effects were tested using negative binomial regression models with robust standard errors.56 Table 4 reports the regression coefficients, robust standard errors in parentheses, and, because coefficients are often difficult to substantively interpret, the predicted marginal effects in italics for the count of nuclear treaties opened for signature and entering into force.57 The scale of the dependent variables is similar, making it substantively meaningful to compare results across dependent variables. However, the direction and magnitude of the effects of the independent variables are not expected to be similar across outcomes as the hypotheses predict variation by the level of commitment.         "
"40","H1a predicts that international treaty events are more likely as overall conflicts are greater. The results in Table 4 show that the absolute level of systemic political dissimilarity is high, on average: Overall S is negative and significant at p <.01 or better. H2a predicts that international treaty events are more likely as overall interests are converging and is also supported: Overall S—Lagged Difference is negative and significant (p < .05 or better), which indicates convergence over time. This result holds when nuclear treaties both are concluded and enter into force, suggesting that states pursue agreements when overall political interests are dissimilar but converging.         "
"41","H1b predicts that international treaty events are more likely when issue‐specific conflicts are greater. The absolute distribution of issue‐specific interests is not a significant factor when treaties are opened (barely significant in Model 4.3 at p < .10), so I cannot infer that nuclear interests are either similar or dissimilar, on average, during treaty negotiations. However, the absolute level of nuclear interest similarity is high at entry into force (and significant at p < .01 or better in Models 4.7 and 4.8). H2b predicts the likelihood of treaty events is increased by issue‐specific interest convergence. Nuclear convergence occurs as treaties are opened (significant at p < .05 or better in Models 4.3 and 4.4) and the substantive effect is greater than the convergence of Overall S. Some nuclear divergence occurs as nuclear treaties enter into force (p < .05 in Model 4.7 but not significant in Model 4.8), but the effect is smaller than for convergence in Overall S. As nuclear interests converge to help nuclear treaties open and are very similar when they enter into force, I infer that greater issue‐specific similarity makes treaty events more likely.         "
"42","H3 predicts that states weigh the distribution of interests more heavily as the level of commitment increases. Comparing the preference variable coefficients and significance across the stage of cooperation, I find that overall conflicts are worse but also improving at entry into force, and, while nuclear interests are converging when nuclear treaties are concluded, they are strongly similar when nuclear treaties enter into force. This suggests that while nuclear treaties are negotiated to make broader political conflicts less dangerous, entry into force requires strong signals that states are unlikely to be interested in defecting from these nuclear agreements.         "
"43","Examining the other possible causes, I find the likelihood that nuclear treaties will open decreases with greater U.S. security hierarchy (p < .01 in Models 4.3 and 4.4), but this has no significant effect upon their entry into force. The U.S. share of power in the system is negatively correlated with the probability of treaties entering into force (significant at p < .01 or better in Models 4.7 and 4.8). Increasing U.S. economic hierarchy little or no effect. Therefore, I find that greater U.S. hegemony in the system reduces the likelihood of observing nuclear treaty events.         "
"44","The revealed interests of the United States, U.S. Nuclear S—Lagged Difference, also has no effect on the likelihood that nuclear treaties will be concluded and only a small negative effect (divergence) as nuclear treaties enter into force (p < .05 in Model 4.8). An interaction of U.S. Nuclear S—Lagged Difference and U.S. CINC, as reported in Models 4.4 and 4.8, also has no significant effect upon nuclear treaty events.58 In short, the U.S. distance from other states on nuclear issues has no effect upon the likelihood of concluding nuclear treaties, while entry into force becomes slightly more likely with some divergence from the United States.         "
"45","Finally, the systemic level of democracy was not expected to be associated with a greater likelihood of observing nuclear treaty events. While the global spread of democracy is not associated with the conclusion of nuclear treaties, it is associated (p < .05 or better) with their entry into force. The cause of this association is unclear, although the factors that may cause the democratic peace—institutional transparency, institutional constraints, and norms of liberal democracy59—may also reduce the risks of asymmetric accession and compliance.         "
"46","Socialization theory argues that the negotiation and entry into force of international treaties causes states to internalize the norms, principles, and identities they embody and legitimate. The coefficients on the Future Difference variables show that the conclusion of nuclear treaties is associated with overall interests subsequently diverging (significant at p < .05 in Model 4.3) but has little effect upon the distribution of nuclear interests (divergence is small and weakly significant at p < .10). Entry into force, meanwhile, is associated with continuing interest convergence overall (p < .01 or better in Models 4.7 and 4.8) and on nuclear issues (p < .01 in Model 4.8). Treaty events, therefore, have a significant effect upon the subsequent distribution of interests, but the direction of the effect is conditional upon the stage of cooperation: treaty negotiations tend to worsen international differences, while treaties entering into force on average reduces the overall differences.         "
"47","The results allow the following inferences regarding the likelihood of observing international treaty events. First, there is little systematic relationship between the distribution of power and the incidence of treaty events. One measure of U.S. power, U.S. security hierarchy, has a large and negative effect upon the likelihood of nuclear treaties being opened, while another, the U.S. CINC score, has a negative effect upon the likelihood of their entering into force. Otherwise, U.S. power plays no significant role. U.S. nuclear interests also have little or no significant effect. In short, despite its generally strong support for nuclear treaties, a greater U.S. share of power and hierarchy only reduces the likelihood of nuclear treaty events."
"48","Second, I find that preference similarity, on average, reduces the barriers to cooperation. When nuclear agreements are concluded, the international community is more often than not experiencing overall conflict: interests are dissimilar (Nuclear S and Overall S are negative) but become more similar (Nuclear S and Overall S—Lagged Difference show convergence). This suggests international treaties are not institutionalizing an established but informal pattern of behavior. Instead, and contrary to some expectations in the rational institutionalist literature, treaties are negotiated when divergent overall interests create incentives to avoid mutually disastrous outcomes. International institutions are strategies for overcoming the political conflicts that prevent states from improving national outcomes. When nuclear agreements enter into force, overall conflicts (divergence) in the international system persist, but overall interests become more similar and there is significant convergence on nuclear issues. This implies that nuclear treaties enter into force when states believe that the specific strategy is in the interest of the parties but also believe that interests more generally are converging in ways that reduce the risk of those other interests causing defection.         "
"49","Finally, my results allow inferences regarding the socialization hypothesis that treaty events change how states construct and perceive their interests. The observed divergence after treaties open implies there is domestic contestation over whether agreements as negotiated will advance national interests, although almost all the treaties in our data enter into force and nuclear interests, on average, converge by the time they do. The strongest socialization effects occur after entry into force, but this only partly supports socialization theory because overall interests converge (the effect is significant and substantively large) but nuclear interests do not. One explanation is that states learn new shared norms and identities from the successful entry into force but, having “solved” one point of conflict on nuclear issues, are diverging because they are turning to begin contestation over another perceived problem."
"50","This article began by posing an empirical puzzle about the systematic relationship, if any, between the distribution of international interests and the likelihood of cooperation: does a convergence of interests allow treaties to formalize cooperation or does negotiating and bringing into force treaties cause accession and compliance through a socialization process? To answer these questions, this article uses UNGA voting data to generate new issue‐specific proxies for the similarity of interests. This article then analyzes the relationship between preference similarity and treaty events using data on the timing of international nuclear treaty events from 1945 to 2008. Additional evidence is provided by a study of the negotiation and entry into force of the Nonproliferation Treaty in Appendix C.60"
"51","This article has four findings significant in explaining international cooperation. First, the likelihood of observing international treaties being opened for signature or entering into force is not systematically related to the distribution of power. In fact, the likelihood of nuclear treaty events is higher when the United States is less able to impose solutions. The similarity of U.S. nuclear interests to other states also appears to have no effect. Second, treaties are more likely to be negotiated when conflicts of interest are more intense but also improving. While interests on the issue have converged by the time treaties enter into force, this shows that states are not merely formalizing existing patterns of behavior. Third, the need for converging interests increases with the risk of exposure to the costs of asymmetric accession or compliance. Therefore, while conflicts motivate negotiations, successfully formalizing an agreement to cooperate requires convergence as a signal that reciprocity is likely. Fourth, treaty events do affect how states construct and perceive their interests. While the negotiation of treaties results in increasing dissimilarity and worsening conflicts of interest, socialization occurs after treaties enter into force."
"52","These findings suggest two broader points about the study of cooperation and conflict in international politics. First, scholars should pay serious attention not only to the distribution of interests but also to the direction and magnitude of their change. Second, while a number of scholars have taken preferences seriously, using overly general measures of interests has obscured their systematic effects upon behavior. My findings do not resolve whether states update their preferred strategies in an issue area because of new information or internalize new issue‐specific norms or identities. My findings may also be specific to nuclear cooperation, and future analysis should examine whether other issue areas have different relationships. However, being more attentive to issue‐specific revealed preferences will benefit theory development in the future."
