"1","FOR MORE THAN 60 YEARS, the United States has maintained an extended deterrence commitment to protect South Korea as part of a system of alliances in East Asia. The guarantee included a mutual security treaty that formalized the U.S. pledge to defend its ally and placed troops along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) as a sign of the U.S. determination to defend South Korea. The U.S. commitment also entailed South Korea's inclusion under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, whereby Washington vowed to use nuclear weapons to deter and, if need be, defeat an attack on the South. The nuclear umbrella included the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons on the peninsula; however, these were removed in 1991."
"2","Despite the longevity of U.S. extended deterrence and the nuclear umbrella in East Asia, there have always been some difficult and troubling aspects of this strategy. An important requirement for successful deterrence is credibility. Would the United States truly be willing to use nuclear weapons in the defense of an ally given the tremendous devastation of those weapons? What if the adversary possessed nuclear weapons that could strike the U.S. homeland or U.S. facilities in the region? Would the United States use nuclear weapons in response to a non‐nuclear attack, whether conventional, biological, or chemical? Indeed, some even question whether there is a nuclear umbrella.1"
"3","These issues raised serious questions about the credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella during the Cold War and continue to be concerns today. Despite these credibility questions, South Korean leaders place high value on remaining under the U.S. nuclear umbrella and have exerted great effort to have Washington provide explicit reassurances that the nuclear umbrella remains in place. These issues raise two key questions that are the focus here. What role does the U.S. nuclear umbrella play in South Korean and U.S. security calculations? Why would South Korea and other U.S. allies continue to value and rely on the nuclear umbrella when its credibility is so shaky?"
"4","The U.S.‐Republic of Korea (ROK) alliance is solid, and there is little doubt the United States would come to South Korea's defense if it were attacked. Washington will continue issuing statements affirming the commitment to use nuclear weapons if necessary to defend South Korea, and the U.S. military will plan and train for the possible use of nuclear weapons. However, in the end, it is highly unlikely that a U.S. president will ever give the directive to use nuclear weapons to defend South Korea because of a number of strategic, operational/military, and moral considerations. Though the Donald J. Trump administration has declared that “all options are on the table” and the President has made several statements and tweeted the possibility of using military force, the likelihood of the United States using nuclear weapons is very low. U.S. nuclear use in Korea would have devastating consequences, and doing so, even in retaliation, would weaken the norms of nuclear use in future conflicts for other states, which is not in anyone's interest. Instead, the United States would rely on conventional options that are far more credible and have similar strategic effects."
"5","The U.S. nuclear umbrella for South Korea will remain in place, as it has become an important part of the regional security architecture that ROK leaders value despite the lingering credibility issues. More importantly, the nuclear umbrella is a political signal for the defense commitment and overall health of the alliance. These elements are not included in standard applications of deterrence theory, yet they are crucial for the security guarantee to South Korea and other U.S. allies. To remove the umbrella would be a critical change to the status quo that could disrupt regional security. Moreover, for the United States, the nuclear umbrella is also an important nonproliferation tool to persuade more states from acquiring nuclear weapons. The U.S. alliance is strong, and Washington will fulfill its commitment to defend South Korea, but it will not use nuclear weapons to do so."
"6","The remainder of this article will first review the theoretical foundation of extended deterrence, followed by a history of the nuclear umbrella in Korea and an examination of the North Korean threat the umbrella is designed to address. Next, I examine the role of the nuclear umbrella in South Korean security calculations and provide an assessment of the capability, motivations, and credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications this case study has for nuclear weapons and extended deterrence."
"7","Deterrence is the use of threats to convince an adversary to refrain from taking an action the defender does not wish it to take. The central tenet of deterrence is a threat issued by the defender to raise the costs of a challenger's actions to the point that the challenger will refrain from taking the unwanted action. The defender must demonstrate that regardless of what the challenger seeks to obtain, the costs of achieving the objective will outweigh the gains. Defenders can seek to deter in two ways: first, by possessing sufficient military capability to deny a victory or pose a long war of attrition,2 and second, with threats of punishment should the challenger take the unwanted action.3 Deterrence by punishment forms the core of nuclear deterrence.         "
"8","Distinctions exist in certain types of deterrence situations that are important for understanding Korea and the U.S. nuclear umbrella because states will act differently depending on the situation. Two sets of deterrence situations are relevant here: primary versus extended deterrence and immediate versus general deterrence."
"9","In primary deterrence, states seek to protect their homeland, while in extended deterrence, a defender is deterring an attack on an ally. For primary deterrence, there is little doubt that a state will defend itself if attacked, but many doubts arise in a situation of extended deterrence. A defender might balk at protecting an ally in a crisis, particularly if the potential costs of doing so are high. Defenders exert great effort to demonstrate their commitment through treaties and alliances, but there is always a possibility that the defender will not follow through in a crisis."
"10","Patrick Morgan identifies important differences in deterrence situations that he labels immediate and general deterrence.4 Immediate deterrence situations are crises in which the challenger has provided notice either in word or deed that an attack may be forthcoming, prompting the defender to issue specific counterthreats of retaliation to deter the looming assault. In contrast, general deterrence pits two adversaries in a hostile relationship in which either might consider using force against the other if the proper circumstances arose, but there is no immediate danger of an attack. The adversaries build their military capabilities and undertake preparations to defend themselves, but they do not feel the need to issue specific counterthreats. The relationship is relatively stable but with significant enmity and mistrust. Immediate and general deterrence situations are best viewed on a continuum along which a relationship can possess qualities of both immediate and general deterrence. Situations can shift along the continuum, for example, progressing to a crisis that might require counterthreats to deter specific actions before returning to a more stable equilibrium of general deterrence.               "
"11","The U.S. nuclear umbrella for South Korea has been part of U.S. military preparations that, at most times, resembled a situation of general deterrence. War has not been imminent, and U.S. leaders have not issued specific counterthreats of nuclear retaliation. Instead, Washington has typically issued general statements about South Korea being under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. However, there have been some occasions on which Washington has utilized specific nuclear threats. Although an attack was not imminent, North Korea's six nuclear tests were sufficiently disconcerting to prompt Washington to issue pointed assurances that South Korea remained under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The spring of 2013 was a particularly tense time on the peninsula following North Korea's December 2012 missile launch, the February 2013 nuclear weapon test, the subsequent United Nations Security Council resolutions, and the worse than normal vitriolic North Korean response. During the annual Key Resolve/Foal Eagle spring exercises that year, the United States made a high‐profile demonstration of B‐2 and B‐52 bombers, which can be used for conventional or nuclear missions, to make a deterrence statement indicating an incremental shift from general toward immediate deterrence. The United States undertook similar actions in the spring of 2016 after the January 2016 nuclear test and again on several occasions throughout 2017 after the plethora of ballistic missile tests and sixth nuclear weapons detonation. Deterrence also works in the other direction, as North Korea seeks to deter the United States and South Korea through its actions and language."
"12","Over the years, deterrence has slid back and forth from general to immediate, but for the most part, strategic deterrence has been stable, with little danger of war breaking out. For example, a 1999 U.S. State Department report by William Perry that reviewed U.S.‐North Korea policy noted the tremendous loss of life that would result in another war but that “[u]nder present circumstances . . . deterrence of war on the Korean Peninsula is stable on both sides, in military terms.”5 Although miscalculation is always a possibility, Perry maintained, there is nothing that would suggest to North Korea that a war would not be a disaster for it and that stability will endure. Though the events of 2017 shifted towards immediate deterrence, perhaps farther than had been the case for some time, Perry's assessment is likely to continue in the years ahead.               "
"13","The most challenging problem for deterrence, especially extended deterrence, is credibility. Credibility requires that the defender possess the capability to carry out the threatened retaliation and that it impose sufficient cost to make the challenger refrain from the unwanted action. Finally, the defender must convince the challenger of its resolve to carry out the threat should deterrence fail.6 These three dimensions of credibility are linked but possess different dynamics. Having the capability to inflict unacceptable harm is the starting point. Without this capability, which is made easier with nuclear weapons, state threats to punish are essentially bluffs. Yet given the precision of today's conventional munitions, even those weapons can have the strategic effects of nuclear weapons. However, the crucial element here is that the challenger must be convinced that the defender possesses the necessary capability. Thus, a defender may still be able to deter with reduced capability so long as the adversary perceives it to be sufficient. Conversely, the challenger may not be convinced even if the defender in fact has the prescribed military capability.            "
"14","To ameliorate the credibility concerns, defenders have often gone to great lengths to demonstrate that they would indeed come to an ally's defense if attacked. Treaties, alliances, and trade ties along with economic and military aid help demonstrate a defender's commitment to an ally.7 Yet these assurances can be ignored in a crisis, and there is always a chance that the defender will not follow through on its promise, particularly if a response carries great cost and risk. Thomas Schelling notes that “saying so, unfortunately, does not make it true; and if it is true, saying so does not always make it believed. We evidently do not want war and would only fight if we had to. The problem is to demonstrate that we would have to.”8"
"15","To show its resolve, the United States deployed combat troops to South Korea to help defend the country and act as a trip wire to ensure a U.S. response should deterrence fail. In the first few decades, the United States based two combat divisions close to the DMZ and along the expected invasion routes to the South. Ground troops on the front lines are difficult to remove in a crisis, providing a direct link to the defender's military forces and a signal that the commitment is firm.9"
"16","Finally, defenders that possess nuclear weapons can reinforce resolve by deploying them to the ally's territory to act as a deterrent or for warfighting if deterrence should fail. In addition or as a discrete measure, the defender can issue statements that the ally is under its nuclear umbrella, indicating that it reserves the right to use nuclear weapons to protect its ally. The presence of nuclear weapons always makes escalation to a nuclear conflict a possibility, particularly if the defender has not provided a “no‐first‐use” declaration. Thus, even a limited conventional conflict has the potential to escalate to nuclear war."
"17","How certain must the threat of retaliation be for deterrence to succeed? Despite a belief by the defender and ally of the absolute certainty of retaliation, the challenger may not be convinced. Moreover, the challenger may conclude that the benefits of an assault are sufficiently high to proceed despite the costs and certainty of retaliation."
"18","Conversely, even in the face of an uncertain or unlikely possibility of retaliation, an adversary may yet be deterred, especially if the costs of retaliation are high and the challenger is unsure that it can control escalation once hostilities commence. Schelling maintains that “it is the essence of a crisis that the participants are not fully in control of events; they take steps and make decisions that raise or lower the danger, but in a realm of risk and uncertainty.” Consequently, Schelling argues, uncertain threats may be credible because “[a] response that carries some risk of war can be plausible, even reasonable, at a time when a final, ultimate decision to have a general war would be implausible or unreasonable. A country can threaten to stumble into a war even if it cannot credibly threaten to invite one.”10 Powell points out that there is an important trade‐off between wielding power to obtain demands and increasing the risk of escalation. For the challenger, while bringing more power to bear may increase the chances that the defender will back down, it also increases the possible risk that the defender may escalate and events may get out of control, including the use of nuclear weapons.11 Thus, assessing resolve is a difficult and imprecise process of shifting assessments of costs, benefits, risks, and the defender's resolve.            "
"19","Depending on the deterrence situation, resolve will have different requirements. During peacetime, it is relatively easy to provide commitments that appear credible. Few costs are apparent when providing security guarantees to any number of allies. However, it is when the situation shifts from general deterrence to a crisis of immediate deterrence that the commitment is tested. The defender now faces a host of serious potential costs that change its earlier cost‐benefit calculus. Regarding the nuclear umbrella, it is easy to provide these guarantees to allies in peacetime but far more difficult in a conflict, especially when the threat may be issued to another nuclear‐armed state. Moreover, how does a state demonstrate its resolve to use nuclear weapons when none has been in over 70 years.12"
"20","Other factors also impact the defender's assessment of the costs of upholding its deterrence commitment. First, the capabilities of the adversary are an important element. In a symmetric conflict of relatively equal military power on both sides, particularly if nuclear weapons are involved, coming to an ally's defense could be very costly. Consequently, during the Cold War and U.S. efforts to deter the Soviet Union, the question was asked regularly: would the United States really trade Washington or New York for London or Paris? Washington sought to bridge this credibility gap by deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Europe, but doubts remained. Although debate continues over whether North Korea has the ability to reach the U.S. homeland with nuclear weapons, it is likely to obtain this capability sometime in the future. DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) nuclear weapons significantly increase the potential costs of any U.S. response to North Korean actions, whether conventional or nuclear, and raise the specter of “decoupling,” whereby Washington might hesitate to respond given the costs.13"
"21","Finally, credibility can also be affected by the defender's reputation and past behavior.14 Logic would dictate that if the defender has a reputation of not maintaining commitments and backing down in a crisis, enemies and allies will be less inclined to believe in the credibility of future commitments. When studying immediate deterrence cases, Paul Huth found that the “past behavior of the defender in the most recent confrontation with the potential attacker had a significant effect on deterrence outcomes” that “reflects the importance of the interests at stake for the defender.”15 Others have argued it is not reputation or interconnectedness of commitments that determines a state's credibility.16 Daryl Press contends that “[a]country's credibility, at least during crises, is driven not by its past behavior but rather by power and interests. If a country makes threats that it has the power to carry out—and an interest in doing so—those threats will be believed even if the country has bluffed in the past.”17 In addition, James Fearon argues that “[e]x ante measures of the balance of interests such as alliance ties or geographical contiguity between defender and protégé appear to be related to the failure of immediate deterrent threats.”18 Although scholars disagree, state leaders are often very concerned about reputation and its connection to interests and credibility. The difficulty comes when reputation becomes a goal unto itself and skews larger assessments of the interests at stake.            "
"22","How credible are threats to use nuclear weapons? Nuclear weapons have been a central element of deterrence for decades, yet they have not been used in a conflict since 1945. States have been reluctant to use nuclear weapons, even when they are facing relatively weak states and have no fear of nuclear retaliation. Despite the hesitance to use nuclear weapons, several states have maintained large nuclear arsenals with detailed war plans and sets of targeting options should they be needed. Throughout the Cold War, and for years after, the United States maintained a first‐use posture indicating its willingness to use nuclear weapons first in a conflict rather than wait to retaliate with nuclear weapons. U.S. leaders argued that first use was necessary to offset Soviet conventional strength and obviate the expense of matching the Red Army. In 1972, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird stated, “Our theater nuclear forces add to the deterrence of theater conventional wars in Europe and Asia; potential opponents cannot be sure that major conventional aggression would not be met with the use of nuclear weapons. The threat of escalation to strategic nuclear war remains a part of successful deterrence at this level.”19"
"23","In the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), the Barack Obama administration modified U.S. strategy but stopped short of a no‐first‐use declaration with the “negative security assurance.” Accordingly, the United States would not threaten or use nuclear weapons against non‐nuclear states in good standing with their obligations under the Nuclear Non‐Proliferation Treaty (NPT). For nuclear weapon states and those not in compliance with the NPT, Washington reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in a narrow range of contingencies, including the use of conventional, chemical, or biological weapons. However, the document noted that while nuclear weapons play a critical role in extended deterrence, “the United States wishes to stress that it would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.”20 U.S. allies in Asia were delighted to not see a no‐first‐use declaration or that the sole purpose of nuclear weapons was to deter a nuclear attack, but many wondered what was included under “extreme circumstances.”         "
"24","In August 2016, in the closing months of the Obama administration, reports appeared that the president was considering the adoption of a no‐first‐use policy. The reports sparked considerable debate, and Obama faced stiff opposition within his cabinet.21 Lewis and Sagan argue that while a no‐first‐use pledge is useful, it should only be done after careful planning and in consultation with allies. As an interim step, they argue, Obama should have declared that “the United States will not use nuclear weapons against any target that could be reliably destroyed by conventional means.”22 The Trump administration has begun work on its own NPR and early reports indicate it may recommend development of smaller nuclear weapons to provide the president with a larger set of options. However, for the remainder of the report, it is unclear what will change in this new version.23"
"25","Despite statements of determination to use nuclear weapons, even if only in extreme circumstances, there are several arguments that raise serious doubts about the credibility of nuclear threats. Traditional realism argued that the hesitation to use nuclear weapons is due to successful deterrence; the possibility of nuclear annihilation made it far too dangerous to risk a nuclear exchange. Yet why have states also been reluctant to use nuclear weapons against adversaries that did not possess nuclear weapons and where nuclear retaliation was not an issue?"
"26","One of the answers is the growing norm of the non‐use of nuclear weapons.24 Whether one labels it a taboo or a tradition of non‐use, states have been reluctant to use nuclear weapons even against non‐nuclear enemies. Nina Tannenwald argues that “a powerful taboo against the use of nuclear weapons has developed in the global system, which, although not (yet) a fully robust prohibition, has stigmatized nuclear weapons as unacceptable weapons—‘weapons of mass destruction.’” Consequently, “the effect of this taboo has been to delegitimize nuclear weapons as weapons of war, and to embed deterrence practices in a set of norms . . . that stabilize and restrain the self‐help behavior of states.”25 T.V. Paul disputes the label of a taboo but agrees that “the unwillingness to use nuclear weapons can be partially attributed to an informal norm inherent in the tradition of non‐use” but must encompass both rational/materialistic and normative/ideational considerations.26"
"27","There are several factors that explain this restraint. First, leaders have a clear understanding of the destructive power of nuclear weapons.27 As a result, Stephen Cimbala maintains, leaders become more cautious and seek to avoid these confrontations because “leaders will be staring into Nietzsche's abyss, and the abyss will be staring back.”28"
"28","Second, states would incur what Paul calls the “reputational costs of nuclear use.” Leaders that cross the nuclear threshold for the first time in decades, especially if doing so first in a conflict, would receive a deluge of international condemnation. Leaders, government institutions, and military capabilities are the likely targets of nuclear weapons, yet the indiscriminate nature of nuclear use would cause large‐scale casualties among civilian populations who are deemed undeserving of a nuclear holocaust. Thus, Lewis and Sagan argue that “it is hard to imagine a circumstance in which it would be either ethically responsible or strategically wise to use a nuclear weapon when a conventional one would suffice.”29 Consequently, states are self‐deterred from using nuclear weapons, particularly against non‐nuclear states.30"
"29","In a study that included public opinion attitudes, Press, Sagan, and Valentino argue that the U.S. public does not possess a “nuclear aversion” and would support nuclear use if it provided a military benefit over conventional weapons. However, the situations in which this would be the case in Korea are few. Moreover, some respondents were concerned about setting a precedent that would make it easier to use nuclear weapons against the United States in the future.31 While this may lessen some of the domestic political pressure to refrain from using nuclear weapons, it is not clear how much impact it would have on a president's decision to go nuclear.         "
"30","In addition to these concerns, there are also tactical/military reasons to avoid the use of nuclear weapons. The use of strategic or lower‐yield tactical nuclear weapons would contaminate the battle space and make future operations far more difficult. Follow‐on ground operations would require that units wear special gear and take numerous other precautions that would cause a very slow advance. The long‐term effects on civilian and military personnel of nuclear detonation and the potential impact on neighboring states make even the use of small‐yield tactical nuclear weapons problematic. Moreover, states would be very hesitant to escalate because, as Schelling notes, “senior officials, civilian and military, acknowledged and expected that if the nuclear ‘threshold’ were ever crossed by either side in a war, the other might feel instantly released from inhibitions, and there might be no telling how far escalation would go.”32 The ability to control the escalation ladder once first use occurs is uncertain, and U.S. leaders should not want to set a precedent for others to escalate in a crisis by doing so itself in anything but the most dire of circumstances. As Scott Sagan notes, U.S. use of nuclear weapons would have a serious impact on nonproliferation because it “would encourage many other states to abandon their ethical inhibitions against developing nuclear weapons and thus would increase the likelihood of future nuclear wars.”33 Paul cautions that “the tradition of non‐use is one norm that Washington would be well advised to preserve, for once it is broken, it may not be easy to resurrect it even if future leaders wished to do so.”34 Finally, even if the United States were responding to nuclear first use, Thomas Nichols writes that “it makes no sense to try to reestablish it [nuclear taboo] by violating it again.”35"
"31","Although states have refrained from using nuclear weapons in war for years, and pressure to continue this tradition remains, a state may yet use a nuclear weapon, particularly if it believes its existence is threatened. This returns to the core difference between primary and extended deterrence: nuclear threats are more credible in primary than extended deterrence. Thus, Paul argues, “a nuclear state may not use its ultimate capability unless a threshold is crossed, for example, when a vital issue, such as the survival of the state itself, is threatened. . . . Breaking the tradition would elicit the revulsion of generations to come, unless it was for a question of extremely vital importance, such as the physical existence of the nuclear state or its key allies.”36"
"32","The nuclear umbrella began as one part of the extended deterrence commitment for South Korea that included the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons with its forces in South Korea.37 The first U.S. nuclear weapons arrived in South Korea in January 1958 as part of an effort to modernize U.S. forces. Discussions to deploy these weapons began sometime in 1955 and arose in the context of concern for Soviet and Chinese efforts to rearm North Korea after the Korean War, which was a violation of the armistice. U.S. defense officials argued that these arms shipments were altering the military balance and needed to be addressed.38 Secretary of State John Foster Dulles challenged this assessment and asked for “publishable evidence” that the violations were occurring before taking action. The Pentagon resisted this request, and according to Donald Stone Macdonald's assessment of State Department archives, “the ‘published evidence’ was never satisfying”39 and “the Defense Department was unable to develop a completely convincing brief showing such violations.”40 The determination of communist violations was essential because without it, the United States would have been the one violating the armistice.41"
"33","U.S. officials also hoped that modernization, including the possibility of nuclear weapons, would provide justification for reducing the size of the ROK military, a force that required heavy U.S. funding given South Korea's struggling economy. During a National Security Council meeting in September 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower lamented that “we were surely spending an awful lot of money in Korea” and that “[ROK president Syngman] Rhee was insisting on too large forces.”42 Dulles argued that nuclear weapons should not be included until Rhee actually reduced his military.43 Ultimately, Rhee refused to implement any reductions, regardless of the decision on nuclear deployments.         "
"34","For several months preceding the decision, debate raged in Washington over whether U.S. force modernization in Korea should include nuclear weapons. The State Department was reluctant to include nuclear weapons, believing they were “very conspicuous weapons,” would create a propaganda opportunity for North Korea, would generate resentment in the region, and were not worth the political price that would be paid.44 While Dulles agreed that modernization needed to be a priority, he did not believe it should include nuclear weapons.45 However, Dulles did recognize that the deployment of nuclear weapons might have a restraining influence on President Rhee. During armistice talks, Rhee expressed his opposition to the agreement, believing that hostilities should not end until the peninsula was reunited under his control. Ultimately, Rhee refused to sign the armistice, and U.S. officials feared that he might restart hostilities. Rhee's actions and rhetoric were so disturbing that Washington had a contingency plan in place named Operation Everready to oust him should that become necessary.46 Nuclear weapons on the peninsula might assist in helping to restrain Rhee's ambitions.         "
"35","The Pentagon countered that these weapons were absolutely essential to prevent U.S.‐ROK forces from being overrun in the early stages of an invasion. With Seoul's proximity to the DMZ, nuclear artillery was necessary to cover the approaches to the capital and prevent this crucial objective from falling early in a conflict. Nuclear weapons would also be an important signal of the U.S. defense commitment to South Korea, allowing Rhee to reduce his troop levels and save the United States money.47 Peter Hayes also maintains that the U.S. Army was intent on deploying nuclear weapons to South Korea because of budget implications that allowed the army to better compete with the navy and air force for nuclear missions and congressional funding.48 In the end, Eisenhower approved the deployment of nuclear weapons along with Honest John missiles and 280‐millimeter cannons, both dual capable, in NSC 5702/2 in August 1957, the first U.S. nuclear weapons in Korea.         "
"36","For the U.S. military, the presence of tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea achieved several goals. A 1979 U.S. Defense Department report noted,            "
"37","U.S. theater nuclear forces have a symbolic importance that transcends their direct military value. They are the visible evidence of the broader U.S. commitment and of the linkage between our deployed posture and the strategic nuclear forces. . . . [Nuclear weapons] also dramatize to a potential attacker that any conventional attack could set off a chain of nuclear escalation, the consequences of which would be incalculable.49"
"38","Should deterrence fail, the U.S. Army intended to use nuclear weapons as part of a war‐fighting strategy early in a conflict to stop a North Korean assault. Periodically and sometimes in response to specific North Korean actions, the United States sought to enhance deterrence by demonstrating its willingness to use nuclear weapons. For example, in 1976, two U.S. Army officers were attacked and killed in the Joint Security Area of Panmunjom by a group of North Korean soldiers. In response, the United States brought B‐52 bombers from Guam that flew up the peninsula, veering off from North Korea at the last instant. DPRK leaders knew these planes were capable of carrying nuclear weapons, and when the crisis ended, the Defense Department stated the flights would continue, with one to two per month.50 During the annual spring exercise in 1982, the United States utilized for the first time the Airland Battle doctrine, which simulated the use of nuclear weapons to defend the South during a North Korean invasion.         "
"39","North Korean leaders were well aware of the U.S. nuclear umbrella and the possibility of U.S. use of nuclear weapons. In addition, North Koreans had clear memories of the pounding they took from conventional bombing during the Korean War. Referring to the 1982 exercises, North Korea declared that “[n]obody can guarantee that this unprecedentedly large‐scale war exercise staged with many nuclear weapons will not escalate into a full‐scale nuclear war against our republic.”51 Over the years, North Korean statements have made many similar references. No doubt, the U.S. nuclear umbrella has been a serious concern for North Korea and an important motive for its nuclear ambitions.         "
"40","For several years, U.S. officials took a “neither confirm nor deny” position on nuclear weapons in South Korea, although most assumed these weapons were present. However, in 1976, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger acknowledged their presence publicly, in part to reassure ROK leaders in the wake of Richard Nixon's withdrawal of a combat division and rapprochement with China, neither of which was done in consultation with Seoul. In addition, it also accompanied efforts to dissuade South Korea from acquiring its own nuclear weapons. Later, Washington added other nuclear‐tipped missiles, including the Sergeant and the Nike‐Hercules along with atomic demolition mines and gravity bombs.52 Estimates of the number of nuclear weapons deployed to South Korea at any given time ranged from 250 to more than 600 depending on the year.53"
"41","As time passed, many, including top U.S. military officials began to question the wisdom and utility of basing tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea. The goal of U.S. nuclear weapons was to blunt a North Korean assault, so nuclear forces needed to be forward‐deployed close to the DMZ. Yet doing so made these weapons vulnerable to a preemptive strike or being overrun by North Korean forces during the initial stages of an invasion. If these weapons could not be withdrawn in time, this situation would create a dangerous “use‐or‐lose” scenario that could cause unintended escalation to nuclear war. Using tactical nuclear weapons had other serious consequences. Detonation on the peninsula would cause severe damage and spew radioactive fallout, endangering South Korean and U.S. military personnel along with South and North Korean civilians. Fallout would also likely drift into China, the Soviet Union, and Japan, causing further nuclear contamination and raising regional tensions. Thus, the use of tactical nuclear weapons was always a dangerous proposition with many serious consequences. By the 1970s, U.S. nuclear weapons had been removed from their forward positions to ones farther south."
"42","By the late 1980s, as the end of the Cold War approached, support for maintaining nuclear weapons at all in South Korea had begun to fade. In 1987, U.S. Forces Korea Commander General Louis Menetrey remarked, “I do not envision any circumstance which . . . would require the use of nuclear weapons.”54 The following year, Lieutenant General John Cushman, the former commander of I Corps that protected the approaches to Seoul, maintained that “nuclear weapons are no longer necessary for the defense of Korea” and that “actual use would be an appalling catastrophe even to the victor.”55 In October 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced that the United States would begin a process to remove all U.S. nuclear weapons from the peninsula. The move was intended in part to coax North Korea into relinquishing its nuclear ambitions and comply with International Atomic Energy Agency inspection requirements. President Bush also hoped that removing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons would nudge President Mikhail Gorbachev to do the same, ensuring that the Soviet arsenal remained safe and secure as the Cold War ended.56 By December 1991, the removal process was complete, and South Korean president Roh Tae‐woo announced, “as I speak, there do not exist any nuclear weapons whatsoever, anywhere in the Republic of Korea.”57"
"43","For years, North Korea's conventional capabilities were the primary concern for U.S. and ROK defense planners. After the disaster of the Korean War, Washington and Seoul were determined to deter another conventional assault across the DMZ. As Pyongyang's conventional capabilities grew, extended deterrence and the nuclear umbrella were directed largely toward a North Korean conventional attack. By the 1990s, the DPRK's military capabilities had become more complicated and asymmetric with its growing ballistic missile force, special operations units and, chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons supplementing its significant conventional strength. We now turn to a brief assessment of North Korea's ballistic missile, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapon programs."
"44","North Korea's ballistic missile force is one of its chief military assets. For several decades, the DPRK has been working on its ballistic missile program, in part through acquisitions from the Soviet Union and work on its own indigenous capability.58 The North Korean missile force contains approximately 500 short‐range Scud missiles that can target the peninsula and 150 to 200 medium‐range Nodong missiles that can reach most of Japan and U.S. bases there.59 North Korea has also developed another short‐range missile, the KN‐02 or Toksa. The missile is an upgraded Soviet SS‐21 that uses solid fuel, an important improvement over the bulk of its liquid‐fuel missiles.            "
"45","North Korea continues work on longer‐range systems.60 The Musudan or Hwasong‐10 is an intermediate‐range ballistic missile that can reach Guam. The missile has been flight‐tested on several occasions, but only one of the tests was considered a possible success.61 A New York Times report speculated that the failures may have been due to U.S. cyberattacks in what have been dubbed “left‐of‐launch” operations.62 However, other analysts have raised doubts about the ability to hack into North Korea's missile program.63"
"46","Flight tests have also occurred for the KN‐11/Pukguksong‐1, a missile being developed as a submarine‐launched ballistic missile. Since 2014, North Korea has conducted several tests of the missile from a ground‐based platform, a submerged platform, and a Sinpo‐class submarine named for the Sinpo South Shipyard, but with mixed results.64 Tests have also been conducted for the KN‐15 or Pukguksong‐2, the land‐based, medium‐range variant of the KN‐11. Another missile that was first revealed during the 15 April 2017, parade to commemorate Kim Il‐sung's birthday and flight‐tested is the KN‐17 or Hwasong‐12, a short‐ to medium‐range Scud variant that has fins on the warhead to allow for maneuverability in flight. The KN‐17 was initially believed to be an anti‐ship missile, but since North Korea does not have the necessary sensors and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) for these types of operations, analysts believe this will be more important for improved accuracy in hitting ground targets.65"
"47","Finally, work also continues on building an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the United States. In his 2017 New Year's Day speech, Kim Jong‐un declared that North Korea was in the “final stage of preparation for the test launch of [an] intercontinental ballistic missile.”66 In July, North Korea conducted two tests of the KN‐20 or Hwasong 14, a mobile ICBM, demonstrating further progress in extending the range of its missiles. Though analysts disagree over whether DPRK missiles can reach the continental United States, North Korea continues to advance the capabilities of these systems.            "
"48","North Korea's nuclear weapons program remains the most serious concern for regional stability. Pyongyang has tested on six occasions: October 2006, May 2009, February 2013, twice in 2016, and in September 2017. A 2015 estimate placed North Korea's nuclear arsenal at 10 to 16 weapons from spent fuel produced at the Yongbyon reactor and highly enriched uranium produced at one or possibly two enrichment facilities.67 A study by David Albright and Serena Kelleher‐Vergantini in June 2016 increased these estimates to 13 to 21 warheads.68 Even more troublesome, Albright extrapolated data for North Korea's future arsenal and projected three possible scenarios for a stockpile of 20, 50, or 100 nuclear weapons by 2020.69"
"49","Although North Korea continues working on the various components, it is unclear exactly how far it has progressed toward its goal of developing an effective and reliable nuclear deterrent. In addition, debate continues over whether North Korea has succeeded in miniaturizing a nuclear weapon so that it is sufficiently small to fit on a ballistic missile. In March 2016, Admiral William Gortney, head of NORAD and commander of NORTHCOM, testified before Congress that “while the KN‐08 remains untested, modeling suggests it could deliver a nuclear payload to much of the Continental United States.”70 The day before Gortney provided his assessment, Kim Jong‐un was pictured next to North Korean scientists and a silver globe that was presumed to be a model of a nuclear warhead.71 After the September 2017 test, North Korea released another photograph showing Kim Jong‐un with what it maintained was a hydrogen warhead that had been weaponized. North Korea has yet to provide definitive evidence of this capability, but assessments have moved toward the conclusion that North Korea has achieved this objective. In any case, it is certain that Pyongyang will strive to reach this goal sometime in the future. Moreover, even if systems are not fully capable, they may be sufficiently close to what Wit and Ahn call “emergency operational capability,” which generates some deterrence benefit even if the systems are not fully reliable.72"
"50","North Korean technicians and scientists face some difficult challenges to ensure that any nuclear weapons system functions as hoped, including modernizing its missile force from liquid to solid fuel, improving the range and accuracy of its ballistic missiles, and developing a survivable, long‐range reentry vehicle. North Korea has shown significant progress, but the obstacles are numerous; as Dana Struckman, retired U.S. Air Force colonel and missileer has noted, “building a nuclear weapon and its delivery system, and then keeping them operational for the long term is hard—even harder for those states attempting to do it under the umbrella of international sanctions and monitoring”—“it won't be easy . . . or cheap.”73 The United States, South Korea, and others will never accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, and the use of force to eliminate the program is unlikely.74 The Trump administration has announced on numerous occasions that “all options are on the table” and President Trump has sent several provocative tweets that indicated military options were under serious consideration. Despite the rhetorical battle between Kim Jong‐un and Trump, neither side has utilized a military option and the use of military force is dangerous and risky. Thus, for the United States there may be few actions to take short of reinforcing deterrence, increasing sanctions, improving missile defense, maintaining a watchful eye on North Korea's proliferation activities, and making certain that further growth of the DPRK's program is as difficult and expensive as possible.            "
"51","Finally, North Korea also has a significant chemical and biological weapons program. The DPRK is believed to have 2,500 to 5,000 tons of several chemical agents, including mustard gas, VX, and sarin.75 These chemical agents are produced indigenously and could be delivered with ballistic missiles, rockets, and artillery.76 North Korea also possesses a biological weapons program, but less is known about these weapons.            "
"52","Over the years, South Korea has relied on U.S. nuclear weapons and the nuclear umbrella in its security planning as a deterrent to prevent a repeat of the Korean War. One of the venues for the United States to provide affirmation of the nuclear umbrella is the annual Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) that includes the ROK minister of defense and the U.S. secretary of defense. At the conclusion of this meeting, both parties issue a joint communiqué that reaffirms the principles of the alliance and outlines mutual agreement on a variety of issues. Since 1978, the communiqué has included a specific reference that “Korea is and will continue to be under the U.S. nuclear umbrella.”77 The wording changed little over the next 30 years, although its position within the communiqué shifted based on events.         "
"53","The October 2009 SCM Joint Communiqué between Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Minster of Defense Kim Tae‐young contained an important change in the nuclear umbrella clause. Following North Korea's second test in May 2009, the communiqué “reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to provide extended deterrence for the ROK, using the full range of military capabilities, to include the U.S. nuclear umbrella, conventional strike, and missile defense capabilities.”78 The statement repeated the U.S. commitment but reminded that extended deterrence, while including the nuclear umbrella, need not rely solely on it; missile defense and conventional military strikes are also part of deterring North Korea.         "
"54","Guarantees of the nuclear umbrella also came occasionally from higher levels. In June 2009, Presidents Barack Obama and Lee Myung‐bak held a summit meeting in Washington, DC. As a result of North Korea's May 2009 test, South Korean officials lobbied hard for the summit to include a statement of the U.S. defense commitment, including an explicit reference to the nuclear umbrella. The White House was hesitant to do so given that it ran counter to Obama's speech in Prague that called for a decreased role of nuclear weapons in international security along with their eventual elimination.79 The administration complied, despite its misgivings, elevating the commitment from a statement between ministers to one between heads of state. Consequently, the Joint Vision of the Alliance issued during the summit reiterated “the continuing commitment of extended deterrence, including the U.S. nuclear umbrella,” providing the high level guarantee Seoul desired.80"
"55","Since North Korea conducted its first nuclear test, ROK analysts and leaders have devoted considerable attention to extended deterrence and the role the U.S. nuclear umbrella plays in South Korean security calculations. The security environment has changed dramatically since the end of the Cold War, requiring increased analysis regarding deterrence, nuclear weapons, and the nuclear umbrella. From these efforts, ROK planners and analysts have articulated several reasons for their belief in the importance of the nuclear umbrella in South Korea's security planning."
"56","First, many analysts believe that the power of nuclear weapons is critical to deterring a nuclear‐armed North Korea. During the Cold War, Moscow and Washington were rational actors that were well aware of what was at stake and understood the logic of deterrence. Today, many in South Korea have little confidence in the rationality of the Kim Jong‐un regime and believe he is willing to tolerate a great deal of risk.81 To confront these dangers, the power of the U.S. nuclear umbrella provides the needed certainty that aggression would entail serious costs for Pyongyang. As Chang Kwoun Park notes, “In order to deter North Korea's nuclear threat, North Korea must be made to accurately understand that any North Korean provocation will be promptly followed by punishment that will overwhelm them.”82 South Korea lacks the necessary conventional strength to impose such costs, making nuclear weapons and the U.S. nuclear umbrella a necessity for this task.83"
"57","Second, it must be made clear to North Korea that it has no chance of escalating a conflict to nuclear weapons without paying a severe price from nuclear retaliation. In other words, Pyongyang cannot be allowed to control the escalation ladder in a clash with the South, and the nuclear umbrella adds significant uncertainty to North Korea's calculations that it could do so in a crisis. Moreover, the U.S. nuclear umbrella lets South Korea respond and even escalate with conventional weapons in response to aggression with less fear that North Korea will go nuclear, as doing so would bring nuclear retaliation under the umbrella.84 Thus, if North Korea were to act as it did in 2010 by sinking a ROK ship or shelling an island, South Korea could retaliate since the nuclear umbrella would counter any North Korean threats to escalate.         "
"58","Third, some ROK analysts maintain that the nuclear umbrella is less about actual war fighting and more about offsetting the political leverage North Korea might believe it gains from having nuclear weapons. Pyongyang might use its nuclear weapons to intimidate the South for political or economic concessions or possibly to achieve domestic political goals.85 The nuclear umbrella is necessary to neutralize any perceived political power that North Korea thinks it gains from its nuclear weapons. Signaling the strength of the U.S. commitment to the alliance without the nuclear umbrella would be insufficient to achieve this goal in the minds of many ROK analysts.86"
"59","Fourth, the U.S. nuclear umbrella also has an important impact on South Korean domestic politics. When the DPRK tests its ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, ROK leaders feel serious pressure from their citizens to “do something” in response. The U.S. nuclear umbrella furnishes reassurance for the ROK public and gives their leaders political cover that they are in fact responding to the North Korean threat. In addition, the nuclear umbrella spares the country from conducting a formal, contentious debate about acquiring its own nuclear weapons.87 There are increasing calls, particularly among conservatives, for South Korea to have its own nuclear weapons. Indeed, South Korea sought to build nuclear weapons in the 1970s under Park Chung‐hee, fearing a declining U.S. defense commitment, but abandoned the effort after heavy U.S. pressure. More recently, conservative ROK politicians have called for an indigenous nuclear capability, and public opinion surveys have expressed strong support for this option.88 However, President Moon Jae‐in has declared in no uncertain terms that South Korea will not request the return of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons or develop its own.89 The U.S. nuclear umbrella helps the government resist these demands.         "
"60","Finally, although ROK analysts acknowledge that nuclear weapons may have limited military utility in dealing with North Korea, the political significance of the nuclear umbrella is crucial. One group of ROK scholars have argued that the nuclear umbrella provides an important sign of the strength of the U.S.‐ROK alliance and a critical signal of assurance.90 Another group of ROK analysts maintains that the nuclear umbrella generates confidence for South Korea, showing a level of commitment to ROK security that goes beyond any provided by conventional forces. The U.S. nuclear umbrella is an important component of the security architecture, and although the United States is unlikely to launch a nuclear strike, the umbrella is more important as a political signal to provide assurance to South Korea of the overall defense commitment.91 As one defense analyst has noted, the U.S. extended deterrence commitment is a series of connected segments that include political, economic, and military elements. The nuclear umbrella is an essential aspect of the overall extended deterrence commitment, and there would be a gap without it.92 As a result, the nuclear umbrella is a significant part of the alliance that sends a strong indication of U.S. support to ROK leaders and the public, even if the likelihood of using nuclear weapons is low. The nuclear umbrella aids in strengthening the alliance demonstrating the lengths to which the United States will go to defend the South, and, in turn, a robust alliance helps make the nuclear umbrella appear more credible to South Koreans.         "
"61","The United States has a large nuclear arsenal should it ever decide to exert the nuclear umbrella. Often described as the “triad,” one leg consists of Minuteman III ICBMs divided between three air force bases. Each missile carries one warhead with an explosive yield of 300 to 500 kilotons (KT). The second leg is the 14 Ohio‐class submarines, the “boomers” that carry 24 Trident II D‐5 missiles each, with a yield of 300 to 475 KT per warhead. To comply with the New START Treaty, the ICBM force will be reduced to 400 deployed launchers, and the number of launch tubes on the “boomers” will be decreased to 20 to reach the overall treaty limits of 700 deployed launch vehicles and 1,550 total deployed warheads.93 Although using one of these two legs is an option for the nuclear umbrella, their destructive power makes it likely that U.S. leaders will refrain from doing so. Delivering a strategic warhead against North Korea would be viewed as disproportionate, and although regional players could be warned prior to launch, sending a ballistic missile into the region is likely to upset Beijing and Moscow and further disrupt regional stability.         "
"62","Instead, the United States would be far more likely to use the third leg of the triad consisting of B‐2 and B‐52 bombers. These planes are capable of carrying B‐61 gravity bombs or nuclear‐tipped AGM‐86B air‐launched cruise missiles. The B‐61 is an adjustable yield bomb and depending on the model can be set to produce a yield ranging from 0.3 to 170 KT. Cruise missiles are armed with W80‐1 warheads that also have adjustable yields ranging from 5 to 150 KT.94 The yields of these weapons, even at their lowest level, remain substantial, and their use would nonetheless constitute nuclear use. The devastation wrought by even a small nuclear weapon would be catastrophic, yet when compared with the use of strategic nuclear weapons, there is a greater likelihood that U.S. leaders would order the use of these smaller‐yield weapons. Finally, bombers have the benefit of being able to be recalled once launched and have a “demonstration” capability that ICBMs do not and is more problematic for submarines. Particularly for extended deterrence, bombers can be flown in ways that reassure an ally and its public while making a statement to an adversary.         "
"63","Some in South Korea have called for a return of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the peninsula. Cheon Seong‐whun has argued that the nuclear umbrella is “fragile,” and if North Korea develops long‐range missiles with nuclear warheads, “there is doubt that the United States could protect Seoul at the risk of nuclear attacks on New York or Los Angeles. The United States should consider redeploying tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea to effectively deter North Korea's nuclear threats.”95 Chong Mong‐joon, a member of the ROK National Assembly and primary shareholder of Hyundai Heavy Industries, has also been a strong advocate for returning U.S. nuclear weapons and for South Korea to build its own. Although the return of tactical nuclear weapons was an option under consideration by the Donald Trump administration,96 it is very unlikely the United States would ever return tactical nuclear weapons to Korea and the Moon administration will not make a request to do so.         "
"64","The U.S. nuclear umbrella does exist; should the president of the United States choose to do so, the nuclear forces to defend or retaliate for an ally are available. The U.S. military goes to great lengths to train for implementing the nuclear mission should the order come. Thus, when viewing the capability side of the equation, the United States has a credible nuclear option. The difficulty comes with resolve, the other component of credibility, and it is here that there are many reasons why the order to use nuclear weapons to defend South Korea will not and should not come."
"65","Successful deterrence is premised on the defender's determination to respond; the defender must demonstrate that it is willing to carry out the threat should deterrence fail. Yet what scenario would prod a U.S. president to use nuclear weapons for the first time since 1945? Short of a direct attack on the United States, there would be enormous pressure on the president to refrain from escalating a conflict to nuclear weapons. There are several reasons why a U.S. president would think long and hard about using nuclear weapons in Korea and ultimately refrain from doing so."
"66","First, if a crisis came to the point that Washington was considering the use of nuclear weapons, North Korea would have crossed a very serious line, such as a major conventional attack, invasion, or a nuclear first strike. If such an event occurred, it is likely that Washington and Seoul, accompanied by broad international support, would move to end this security problem in a regime change operation. Consequently, ROK and U.S. troops would be deeply engaged and moving into North Korea. The use of nuclear weapons would contaminate the battle space and make follow‐up operations exceedingly more difficult. In addition, South Korea would have to deal with the task of cleaning up an irradiated North in the unified Korea that would follow."
"67","Second, the nuclear blast and accompanying short‐ and long‐term effects could have devastating consequences throughout the region. Although the DPRK regime and its military forces would be the target, the indiscriminate nature of nuclear weapons would result in thousands of DPRK civilians being killed in a nuclear strike. To use nuclear weapons simply because Washington said it would or as an act of retaliation has little operational value while carrying huge human, political, and economic costs. Moreover, the fallout and other effects could drift south over Seoul or toward China, Japan, Russia, and others in the region. Referring to a study of nuclear options during the First Gulf War, Colin Powell notes, “The results unnerved me. To do serious damage to just one armored division dispersed in the desert would require a considerable number of small tactical nuclear weapons. . . . If I had had any doubts before about the practicality of nukes on the field of battle, this report clinched them.”97 The geography of Iraq is very different from that of Korea, but the problems Powell raises for nuclear use would also apply.         "
"68","Third, as scholars have argued concerning the nuclear taboo or tradition of non‐use, a U.S. president would be under extreme pressure to avoid escalation and not cross a nuclear firewall that has been in place since the end of World War II. The president would be very reluctant to resort to this option and cross over this long‐standing norm. Moreover, using nuclear weapons sets a dangerous precedent that makes it easier for other states to use nuclear weapons in a future conflict. Even if North Korea used nuclear weapons first, using them in retaliation only makes it more difficult to reestablish a firewall that is in the U.S. strategic interest."
"69","Finally, while a nuclear response is highly unlikely, the United States has a multitude of lethal and precise conventional weapons that it would not hesitate to use to defend South Korea. Consequently, a U.S. conventional response is far more credible and would have the same devastating strategic effect on North Korea and its leaders as nuclear weapons. Thus, the U.S.‐ROK alliance is highly credible, and there is no doubt Washington would come to Seoul's assistance if attacked, but the use of nuclear weapons would almost certainly not be part of the response."
"70","Critics of this argument will maintain that the United States must respond to Pyongyang's use of nuclear weapons in kind because doing otherwise would send a message to other allies that U.S. security guarantees are meaningless, and Washington would never be able to resurrect the nuclear umbrella again. However, the United States has always stated that it has a range of options for responding to any type of conflict in Korea. A forceful U.S. conventional response that leads to regime change in North Korea would not damage U.S. credibility. There is no absolute obligation that the United States must respond with nuclear weapons, only that aggression be met with a robust, appropriate U.S. reply. A powerful U.S. conventional response that has the same strategic effect as nuclear weapons would mitigate any perception in the United States and among its allies or adversaries that U.S. security commitments lack credibility."
"71","An important dimension of the U.S. nuclear umbrella is that Washington has not given a no‐first‐use guarantee, going only so far as a negative security assurance. While there is merit in the United States providing a no‐first‐use guarantee, it is likely North Korean leaders would not believe it. Moreover, even if the United States withdrew its nuclear umbrella in a formal declaration, North Korea would never be certain that U.S. leaders would not use nuclear weapons to defend South Korea. So long as the United States retains a nuclear weapons arsenal, a certain degree of ambiguity will remain; North Korea will have little confidence in a U.S. statement not to use nuclear weapons first or a pronouncement that removes South Korea from the nuclear umbrella.98"
"72","For South Korea and other U.S. allies, the goal of the nuclear umbrella is security and deterrence. The nuclear umbrella demonstrates a commitment to provide the ultimate capability to deter aggression and reassure the ally of its importance to Washington. Yet for the United States, the nuclear umbrella has another important goal: nonproliferation. After every North Korean nuclear weapon test, the United States reassured South Korea of its inclusion under the nuclear umbrella for fear Seoul might consider developing its own nuclear weapons. The 2010 NPR maintains that security relations with allies “can also serve our non‐proliferation goals . . . by reassuring non‐nuclear allies and partners that their security interests can be protected without their own nuclear capabilities.”99 Once North Korea developed the ability to strike the U.S. homeland with nuclear weapons, ROK leaders feared decoupling because it was now vulnerable to a nuclear attack. One ROK politician remarked after North Korea's fourth nuclear test, “It's time for us to peacefully arm ourselves with nuclear weapons from the perspective of self‐defense to fight against North Korea's terror and destruction.”100 As a result, U.S. leaders have worked hard to reassure South Korea to dissuade it from moving in that direction. Thus, Choi and Park argue, “A strong U.S. security commitment and the provision of its nuclear umbrella play the role of a ‘bottle cap’ that keeps South Korea from thinking it needs to develop nuclear weapons.”101"
"73","South Korea's acquisition of nuclear weapons surprisingly became part of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During the campaign, Donald Trump indicated that he believed nuclear proliferation was likely and that the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea and Japan would not be such a bad idea.102 Trump asserted that Seoul and Tokyo were not paying their fair share to support the presence of U.S. forces. If they were unwilling to increase their contributions, the United States would consider withdrawing its forces, and nuclear weapons could compensate for the U.S. departure. The Obama administration spoke out strongly against this course of action, and Trump has since backed away from this suggestion. Despite the stir that Trump caused with his campaign remarks, the U.S. commitment to nonproliferation and the role of the nuclear umbrella in achieving that goal are likely to remain.         "
"74","Three important implications emerge from this study. First, despite the regular reassurances that South Korea remains under the U.S. nuclear umbrella and the unambiguous capability present for using nuclear weapons, significant credibility problems remain regarding resolve. Under what circumstances would the United States be willing to use nuclear weapons to defend South Korea? Even in a crisis and without a no‐first‐use policy in place, a U.S. president would be under tremendous stress for political, moral, and military reasons to refrain from using nuclear weapons and crossing a long‐standing fire break. Washington would likely go to great lengths to respond only with conventional weapons, even in the face of North Korean use of chemical or biological weapons, and possibly even nuclear weapons. Using nuclear weapons in a conflict sets a disastrous precedent that is not in the U.S. or anyone else's interest."
"75","Here is the paradox this study has addressed—with these uncertainties, the credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella is in great doubt, but allies continue to ask for and rely on the nuclear umbrella. Yet even a guarantee that is largely incredible still has deterrence value, particularly given the overwhelming destructive power of nuclear weapons. As Schelling argues, even uncertain threats can contribute to deterrence. Regarding extended deterrence in Europe, former British secretary of state for defense Denis Healey remarked that “it takes only five per cent credibility of American retaliation to deter the Russians, but ninety‐five per cent credibility to reassure the Europeans.”103 Thus, with the high levels of mistrust between Washington and Pyongyang, the nuclear umbrella has an impact on North Korean leaders because they may not be convinced that the United States might not use nuclear weapons. While the credibility of the nuclear umbrella may be questionable from some vantage points, it may not be so from that of the adversary. Enemies and their militaries tend to view these circumstances from a worst‐case assessment that the defender may indeed respond so that credibility may be stronger in their eyes than what others might believe. Despite all of the uncertainties, South Korean leaders continue to place a high value on the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Thus, the political and symbolic value of the nuclear umbrella, along with a belief that the credibility of the U.S. guarantee is “good enough,” motivates ROK leaders to continue vigorous calls for the nuclear commitment.         "
"76","Second, despite the credibility questions, the nuclear umbrella continues to have important symbolic effects for South Korea as a sign of the U.S. commitment to defend the country. Again, Healey maintains that “Europe's concern with the credibility of American deterrence is a function of its general confidence in the wisdom and consistency of American leadership rather than changes in the relative military power of the United States and the Soviet Union.”104 To not reaffirm the nuclear umbrella following North Korea's nuclear tests would have been an alteration of the security architecture that would have been difficult for Seoul to accept. Despite the credibility problems, why is the U.S. nuclear umbrella so highly valued by South Korea? Patrick Morgan maintains that “American extended nuclear deterrence is woven into East Asian international politics and US relations with East Asia. In the eyes of various governments, it is one of the salient characteristics of a satisfactory status quo.”105 As noted earlier, the nuclear umbrella is viewed by South Korea as a demonstration of the U.S. commitment that bolsters ROK confidence in ways that cannot be achieved with allies and conventional weapons, even though there are significant credibility issues. Although the early statements of the Trump administration have raised some serious questions in the minds of South Koreans concerning the U.S.‐ROK alliance, overall, there is confidence in the long‐term outlook of the U.S. defense commitment.         "
"77","While the importance of the nuclear umbrella to ROK security remains, it is only one part of a broader security structure. The 2010 NPR states that “enhancing regional security architectures is a key part of U.S. strategy for strengthening regional deterrence.” In addition, “these regional security architectures include effective missile defense, counter‐WMD capabilities, conventional power‐projection, and integrated command and control − all underwritten by strong political commitments.”106 In 2014, Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Rose Gottemoeller maintained,            "
"78","[E]xtended deterrence is not only about nuclear weapons. Extended deterrence has to do with our complete alliance relationship and that, of course, contains within it a full panoply of weapons systems and everything that goes with weapons systems to make them effective—such as effective command, control, communications, and reconnaissance capabilities. Conventional weapons—and very effective conventional weapons at that—are a core, inherent part of extended deterrence.107"
"79","A forthcoming Trump NPR is unlikely to change these fundamentals of U.S. extended deterrence. Thus, the nuclear umbrella remains an important component of the regional security architecture but is only one piece of that structure, and an important political statement of reassurance for South Korea, even though the United States is unlikely to ever use these weapons."
"80","Third, for the United States, the nuclear umbrella is in part a guarantee for the security of South Korea, but it is also an important tool for U.S. nonproliferation goals. After the first North Korean nuclear test, U.S. leaders feared that Seoul might be tempted to pursue a nuclear capability, and calls by conservative elites in South Korea for its own nuclear weapons have grown. Van Jackson, the former Korea lead at the Pentagon, maintains that “in my conversations with experts from Australia, Japan and South Korea over the years, . . . I've concluded that these states are signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and have not gone nuclear mostly because of the U.S. nuclear umbrella extended to them.”108 U.S. assurances of the nuclear umbrella are important efforts to convince South Korea to continue forgoing nuclear weapons and keeping the NPT regime from deteriorating further. As noted earlier, though the credibility of the nuclear umbrella is low, it has been sufficient to persuade South Korea and other U.S. allies not to go nuclear.         "
"81","The U.S. nuclear umbrella has been a part of the security architecture in Korea and East Asia more broadly for many years, and it is likely to remain. The nuclear umbrella is real; the United States maintains a large nuclear arsenal that is more than capable of defending South Korea and other allies with nuclear weapons that could inflict terrible damage on any adversary. This part of extended nuclear deterrence is highly credible. It is resolve that remains the problematic element, as it was during the Cold War in Europe and Asia, and it will remain so in the future. It is essential that the reluctance to use nuclear weapons remains. The U.S. defense commitment to South Korea is credible despite some of the early difficulties in relations under the Trump administration. If South Korea were attacked, there is little doubt the United States would be there to protect its ally. However, that response will be with conventional assets, not nuclear weapons. The use of conventional weapons is credible with similar strategic effects on North Korea so that deterrence remains robust. Moreover, even a small chance of nuclear use, given the costs, will have a deterrent effect on North Korea. Washington will continue to provide its nuclear umbrella as an important political signal for the alliance and as part of its nonproliferation policy while also gaining some benefit for its deterrence posture. The credibility problems of the nuclear umbrella will remain, but the U.S. nuclear umbrella will be “good enough” for successful strategic deterrence of North Korea."
"82","Some would maintain this is an argument for smaller, more useable nuclear weapons to make U.S. nuclear use more palatable.109 However, even smaller nuclear weapons will encounter the same obstacles and problems noted here and are not the answer. Others would argue that this makes a case for South Korea to acquire its own nuclear capability.110 Again, there are a host of reasons why this is a bad idea for South Korea and would do little to improve its security.111 Strategic deterrence is solid in Korea, and Pyongyang knows that any major military operation against the South, to include the use of nuclear weapons, would be tantamount to regime suicide. The more difficult problem in Korea is deterring lower‐level DPRK provocations, and ROK nuclear weapons along with U.S. tactical nuclear weapons would do little to address this challenge. In the end, the combined conventional military strength of the U.S.‐ROK alliance along with an uncertain nuclear umbrella is more than sufficient to deter a nuclear North Korea.*"
