"1","The vibrant history of U.S. women's right‐to‐jury movements, while prominent in the news at the time, became invisible. The history is checkered, with fits and starts, with a few states allowing women the right to serve on juries when they were granted suffrage. In 1870, Territorial Wyoming was the first to allow women on juries (but this right was withdrawn the following year), and in 1968, Mississippi was the last state to grant women this right. Fortunately, Holly McCammon has made this history visible, providing an incredibly well‐documented and fascinating account of these movements, focusing on 15 states, based on whether they acquired women's right to juries in less than or more than 20 years of activism. The former she labels the “swift” states (California, Illinois, New York, Tennessee, Vermont, and Wisconsin) and the latter the “slow” states (Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Texas)."
"2","The book is guided by strategic adaptation, to assess and compare how fluidly and effectively activists in numerous states modified their tactics to the broader social contexts and recognized and responded to critical political signs. Although the state movements did not face identical resistance, the strategic adaptation focus is highly persuasive in documenting how activists in the “swift” states were successful far more quickly than those in the “slow” states in acquiring the right of women to serve on juries."
"3","Two of the most‐intriguing findings were the potentially positive outcomes of political defeats from both outside and tensions within a movement. Swift states used political defeats to fight back, reframe their arguments, coalition build (for example, with other organizations, judges, and politicians), and so on. Using grassroots mobilizing, they responded to the rationales that had been used against them, designing effective radio and newspaper advertisements, pamphlets, and speeches. A significant amount of this framing, reframing, and outreach was not only to counter staunch detractors, but also to engage those who felt apathetic about women on juries, “harnessing resonant frames” to counter their opponents' claims (p. 121). Conversely, slow states seemed immobilized by their defeats, with less continuity in their activism, and relying on the same tactics that had not worked in the past and would not work in the future. McCammon also describes how within‐movement tensions served as consensus building and stronger organizational ties in the swift than in the slow states."
"4","Yet, clearly even the slow states were ultimately successful, and McCammon identifies the turning points when four slow states' movements shifted from being less to more strategic in seizing political opportunities and making organizational shifts. McCammon's use of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) buttresses the narrative findings reported in the bulk of this book, including the slow states' turning points. QCA allows more‐methodological identification of causal patterns, and with this approach, McCammon shows both the “steadily honed” strategic adaptation in swift states and the distinct turning points where the slow states changed tactics and were successful (p. 192)."
"5","My only disappointment in this book was in finding less than I wanted to know about race (although there was some information), in what appeared to be a white women's movement. However, The U.S. Women's Jury Movements and Strategic Adaptation is a valuable contribution, documenting this forgotten part of feminist activism in women's right to the jury box. Moreover, this book is equally essential in identifying what facilitated and what stymied these organizers' attempts to allow women the right to serve on juries. As McCammon states, “Understanding these jury movements reveals significant guidance for “modern‐day activists” in terms of “whether and how quickly they achieve their aims” (p. 6). This book is hugely instrumental for effective guidance of current social movements.         "
