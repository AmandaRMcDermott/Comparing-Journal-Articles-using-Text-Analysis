"1","In 2015, media headlines on migration were as ubiquitous as they were troubling. An estimated 6,000 Rohingya Muslims and Bangladeshis stranded at sea were repeatedly denied refuge by multiple Southeast Asian nations. More than a million Syrians, Afghans, and Eritreans fled their war‐torn countries, only to be met with interdiction, riot police, barbed wire, suspended rail lines, exceptional passport checks, holding facilities, and, eventually, closed borders. Across the Atlantic, tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and young families fled and continue to flee the violence and poverty of Central America to Mexico and the United States, only to be detained and expeditiously deported with equal disregard for international legal protections as for the fates awaiting them upon their return. Rather than recognize human rights and honor international refugee law, both the European Union and the United States have fallen into long‐entrenched acrimonious debates, ultimately offering little relief to migrants and refugees on the move."
"2","Rightlessness in an Age of Rights: Hannah Arendt and the Contemporary Struggles of Migrants by Ayten Gündoğdu serves as an intervention into these contemporary, intractable crises through a careful examination of the debates and critiques surrounding political theorist Hannah Arendt's call to rethink human rights. Accessible even to those new to Arendt's complex corpus, Gündoğdu's book offers meticulous and novel interpretations of Arendt's key concepts and arguments, including her phenomenological account of the human condition and her critical analysis of “the social question.” In particular, Gündoğdu ruminates on Arendt's proposal of “a right to have rights,” shifting our attention from seeking a normative foundation of human rights to an examination of what generates, guarantees, and reinvents rights.         "
"3","Arendt recognizes personhood as a legal artifact, and thus, she argues, to claim rights requires a reconfiguration of citizenship beyond the nation‐state. In Gündoğdu's analysis, the right to have rights exemplifies Arendt's conceptualization of human rights as the right to belong to a political community in which one's actions, speech, and opinions count. This leads Arendt, and Gündoğdu by extension, to question, what are the limitations to formal guarantees of human rights when states fail to recognize and, at times, actively negate the existence of rights?"
"4","Drawing on cross‐disciplinary scholarship, Gündoğdu shifts Arendt's notion of the right to have rights in new directions by sketching several contemporary examples that push readers to explore how changes in the institutionalization of human rights since Arendt's time have reinforced old and created new limits to human rights. Gündoğdu details a troubling trend in which human rights questions are met with the victimization of migrants and refugees, which reduces human rights to the rights of victims. Dependent on compassionate humanitarianism and its corresponding menagerie of professionals, refugees’ rights are to be protected rather than to be claimed. The failure of states to recognize the rights of the stateless subjects them to arbitrary violence inflicted through refugee encampment, immigration detention, and deportation. Thus, the stateless are not only excluded from a political community in which they are recognized as active and meaningful participants but also expelled from humanity."
"5","While highlighting the persistence of rightlessness in an age of rights, Gündoğdu reminds us that migrants are not passive recipients of state recognition and protection but actively seek to (re)claim rights. Detained asylum seekers violently and symbolically illustrate their speechlessness through lip sewing. In response to a failure of states to grant rights and protections, those known as sans‐papiers demand regularization through public protest and civil disobedience, illustrating the fragility of guarantees under human rights law. Gündoğdu's Arendtian critical inquiry argues convincingly for an imperative to radically rethink the conditions under which people may claim rights to political identity and belonging and by extension, to understand citizenship, rights, and humanity in new ways.
