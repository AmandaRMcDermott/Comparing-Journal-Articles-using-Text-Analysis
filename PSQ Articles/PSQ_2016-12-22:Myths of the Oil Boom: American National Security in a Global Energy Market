"1","From 2008 to 2015, the shale oil revolution nearly doubled U.S. oil production and generated triumphal claims that America's energy problems were finally solved. Alas, Steve A. Yetiv soberly pierces the hype. This timely book confronts a flurry of misconceptions about how the oil boom affects U.S. security and argues that, in fact, the impact is small. According to Yetiv, new production, while remarkable, does not alter oil market fundamentals, nor does it lessen the need for U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf to protect the free flow of oil. Nevertheless, as long as these pesky myths circulate, the United Sates will be unable to formulate the comprehensive energy policy that it needs—one that focuses foremost on decreasing oil consumption."
"2","In Yetiv's view, oil security means achieving three things: maintaining reasonable long‐term oil prices, preventing major supply disruptions, and minimizing the negative by‐products of oil consumption (pollution, for example). On the first two factors, the American oil boom offers limited benefits; on the third factor, it actually detracts from oil security. Although U.S. output probably helped to push global prices down in 2014–2015, Yetiv suggests that the long‐run effect is likely to be small because, among other reasons, shale oil is expensive to produce and requires moderately high prices to be economically viable. The boom's effect on managing supply disruptions—the second aspect of oil security—is dubious. Because there is one global market price for oil, significant disruptions anywhere in the world will raise prices for the United States just as much as they would for any other country. Increased U.S. production does not change this fundamental fact. Finally, by encouraging oil consumption, the oil boom magnifies its ills—for instance, by increasing the carbon emissions linked to climate change."
"3","Yetiv spends most of the book correcting numerous erroneous beliefs that act as obstacles to effective policy—a worthy goal, to be sure. He has mixed success. Part of the challenge of his project is that it aims to speak to broad audience: scholars, students, and the American public at large. Members of this audience, however, operate at different levels of understanding when it comes to oil, so a claim pitched at novices will seem obvious to experts, while a claim pitched at experts will befuddle the uninitiated. The problem is genuinely tough to reconcile. For example, experts surely understand that the president cannot control oil prices—the myth animating Chapter 4—but many Americans do not, and this latter group would learn from the chapter. Other chapters speak more clearly to insiders, such as Chapter 3, which asks whether Saudi Arabia is still willing and able to moderate oil prices. Experts might find the question intriguing, but to many Americans, the notion that Saudi Arabia has ever acted as a “price dove” might seem nonsensical.         "
"4","Finally, for a book focused on myths, strikingly little attention is paid to the origins of popular misconceptions about the oil boom and its impact on American security. Yetiv claims that the myths themselves play a role in blocking energy policy reform, but where do they come from, and why are they so prevalent? Do interested actors spin these yarns to tilt opinion toward their preferred policies? If so, it might take more than myth busting to set American energy policy on the right track."
