"1","“Ideology” and “party” are two of the most frequently used terms in discussions of American politics. However, the current political environment, in which liberals are Democrats and conservatives are Republicans, has made it easy to conflate these two terms. The measurement of ideology adds to the confusion, as standard measures such as NOMINATE capture ideology, party, constituency interests, and any other factors that result in members voting with other groups of members. Hans Noel seeks to understand how ideological and partisan coalitions are distinct and how the liberal‐conservative ideologies we recognize today came to align with the party coalitions. He emphasizes that parties need not be organized around ideologies, much less around the liberal‐conservative dimension. Parties care about winning office and can join together issues to create a winning coalition regardless of whether that coalition contains strange bedfellows. Ideologies, by contrast, are focused on principles and may reject possible allies who do not share key principles. Over the course of American history, political thinkers constructed the liberal‐conservative ideological dimension, and parties collapsed around that ideological dimension."
"2","This book builds on Frances E. Lee's argument in Beyond Ideology: Politics, Principles, and Partisanship in the U.S. Senate that ideology is but one component of what separates members of partisan coalitions. However, Noel's work is unique in many ways. In particular, Noel focuses on the larger political system, examining how political thinkers (termed “coalition merchants,” p. 7) develop ideologies and how those ideologies influence political parties. This approach brings in new data—the views of opinion writers throughout U.S. history—and uses these data to show that an ideological left‐right dimension had emerged among opinion writers by the 1950s but was not adopted by congressional parties until later decades. Noel also offers a theoretic perspective about how ideology and party influence the construction of coalitions. The perspective he advances is an elite‐driven story in which parties respond to policy demanders and ideological leaders, not to voters. In short, this explanation ties together questions about the role and design of political parties, issue politics, and congressional polarization.         "
"3","His findings have important consequences for a range of research programs. First, what does the interaction between coalitions of ideology and party mean for the structure of issues on the congressional agenda? Do party leaders focus on particular issues (and ignore others) as the party coalition condenses around an ideological dimension? Second, Noel's findings speak to research on the influence of ideology versus party on members of Congress. Noel alludes to this briefly (p. 131), showing that the patterns of votes provide information about when behavior is organized by party and when it is organized by ideology. More broadly, Noel's argument emphasizes the need to think carefully about what ideology is (and is not) and what evidence differentiates ideology and party influence when ideology offers a competing framework to party versus when it has been adopted by the party? Third, Noel's focus on an elite‐driven story of ideology and political polarization can inform studies of elite polarization that posit that elected officials are more polarized than the general public."
"4","While the elite‐focused argument of the book offers a compelling account of how ideology and party aligned, the elite focus comes at the expense of ordinary voters, individual members, and the electoral connection between elected officials and their constituents. Do voters play any role, even in limiting which ideologies the parties might align with? How did members, particularly those in the 1960s and 1970s whose constituent interests put them at odds with a liberal Democratic ideology, balance constituent interests? There are a few instances when Noel points to the possibility that an ideology might not be a winner, but in general, voters are sidestepped, and the resulting implications for democracy are addressed only briefly."
