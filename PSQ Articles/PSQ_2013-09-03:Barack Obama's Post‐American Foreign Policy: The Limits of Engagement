"1","Robert Singh's book offers a trenchant critique of Barack Obama's foreign policy, more out of sadness than opposition. Like most Europeans, Singh applauds the stylistic changes Obama has made in U.S. policy. But, unlike many Europeans and others who strain to magnify Obama's accomplishments, Singh concludes that “the substantive results of Obama's approach have been relatively modest” (p. 194)."
"2","Neither transformative nor realist, Obama's approach, according to Singh, is “unrelentingly pragmatic, prudent and at times accommodationist” (p. 6). The goal appears to be “calibrated strategic retrenchment; scaling back commitments, reducing costs, minimizing unilateralism, encouraging multilateralism, and espousing less rather than more US assertiveness abroad” (p. 59). According to Singh, the policy fails on four counts."
"3","First, it suffers from strategic naïveté. It assumes that countries share interests and mutual gains when, for most states, interests remain sovereign and relative sum. Obama pursues his goals without identifying or building specific coalitions, yet expects other states to step up and support the same goals as America."
"4","Second, Obama applies little leverage to his policies, either positive or negative. Friends such as Israel, Iraq, and Turkey do not trust him, while foes such as Iran and North Korea do not fear him. Russia pockets U.S. concessions on missile defense but does not reciprocate by supporting U.S. objectives in Iran and Syria; and Obama's engagement policy with China morphs into a hedging strategy, which, shortly after this book was finished, produced Obama's “pivot” to Asia, a transfer of U.S. military resources from the Middle East and South Asia to the Far East just as threat—Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea—heats up in all three regions."
"5","Third, despite his rhetorical gifts, Obama fails to give the American people a sense that their leadership in the world is still necessary. In fact, by betraying a certain discomfort with American power and leadership, he cultivates a risky mood of neo‐isolationism in America (p. 195). He raises expectations with one initiative after the other; and, when he does not follow through, the public concludes that it is either so easy or so impossible that America does not need to be involved."
"6","Finally, Obama sets few if any priorities. Another Englishman, Niall Ferguson, now at Harvard University, draws the same conclusion: “The defining characteristic of Obama's foreign policy has been not just a failure to prioritize, but also a failure to recognize the need to do so” (Newsweek, 21 February 2011) The pragmatist simply reacts; he does not shape. He has no agenda, and assumes that other countries do not either.         "
"7","In detailed chapters on Afghanistan/Pakistan, Iran, Israel/Palestine/Arab Spring, China, and Russia, Singh supports the indictment of Obama's foreign policy. The United States is leaving Afghanistan, as it did Iraq, with instability increasing, not decreasing, in the region. Historically an ally, Pakistan now invites China to establish a naval base at Gwadar on the Indian Ocean. In Iran, sovereign interests push toward conflict. As a former Iranian president says, “We need enmity with the United States” (p. 109).         "
"8","In the Middle East and Arab Spring, Obama's approach of unprioritized and unleveraged engagement has resulted in a “quixotically disengaged” policy. America hangs back as Muslim‐inspired factions and martyr‐seeking jihadists rend the curtain of stability in Egypt, Syria, and elsewhere. Russia tolerates Iranian nuclear ambitions, and China pursues nothing less “than the creeping end of 500 years of western global predominance” (p. 159)."
"9","Singh's book exposes the dazzling disarray in Obama's foreign policy—dazzling because many commentators, especially in Europe, continue to hold Obama in awe and hope that he will succeed; and disarray because the world is becoming more chaotic and Obama's foreign policy seems to be chasing rather than shaping it."
