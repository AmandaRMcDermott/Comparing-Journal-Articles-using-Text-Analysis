"1","In a well‐executed new book, Todd S. Sechser and Matthew Fuhrmann examine the benefits that nuclear weapons confer on the states that possess them. Specifically, they tackle the question of whether nuclear weapons allow states to coerce others. Their answer is clear: “nuclear weapons are useful in world politics for deterrence, but not coercion” (p. 59). Nuclear‐armed states do not succeed in their coercive threats more often than non‐nuclear states, and they do not generally do better in territorial disputes. And states that do seek to signal their coercive resolve with nuclear weapons often have their signals ignored or misunderstood."
"2","Sechser and Fuhrmann's book is the most important work on nuclear coercion since Richard Betts's classic Nuclear Blackmail and Nuclear Balance, and it deserves a wide readership. Their book not only makes a theoretical contribution in laying out exactly why the nuclear holdup is rarely credible but also marshals an array of evidence in support of their argument that combines statistical analysis of compellent threats with historical evidence from cases of attempted nuclear coercion. For those in the academy and Washington, DC, who believe nuclear weapons grant states free rein in international politics, Sechser and Fuhrmann's book provides a valuable corrective.         "
"3","Like any good work, Sechser and Fuhrmann's book raises questions that future research could address. First, the distinction between compellence and deterrence is crucial to their argument: threatening nuclear use is more credible in seeking to deter states from attacking than it is in trying to force states to give something up or change their behavior. But many crises do not fit neatly into these two categories, and many state behaviors contain elements of both compellence and deterrence that may be aimed at multiple targets. In the years after World War II, for example, the United States extended nuclear protection to a range of states in Europe, Asia, and Australasia. Was this an effort to deter attacks against these allies? An effort to compel adversaries of those states to back down in territorial disputes? An effort to deter allies from acquiring their own nuclear weapons? An effort to compel others to accept U.S. dominance of the postwar world order? It would be interesting for future work to build on Sechser and Fuhrmann's argument by relaxing the assumption of a clean distinction between deterrence and compellence or by exploring the impact of nuclear weapons on crises that contain significant elements of both deterrence and compellence."
"4","Second, the apparent disconnect between policymaker perceptions and reality merits future study. While Sechser and Fuhrmann argue that nuclear weapons are poor tools of coercion, their cases show that statesmen have often thought they would be useful for that purpose. As they write, “many world leaders . . . have suggested that nuclear arsenals provide coercive benefits, either for themselves or for their nuclear‐armed enemies” (p. 238). Exploring why this disconnect might exist and persist would also be a productive avenue for scholars to explore. For example, it might be that Sechser and Fuhrmann correctly identify the limited utility of demanding concessions from a state while threatening to use nuclear weapons if it does not comply, but this does not rule out the possibility that nuclear weapons offer benefits to the states that acquire them beyond simply the ability to deter attacks."
"5","These questions and others merit additional research but do not diminish the importance and quality of Sechser and Fuhrmann's work. Their book provides a solid foundation for others to build on as they pursue these questions."
