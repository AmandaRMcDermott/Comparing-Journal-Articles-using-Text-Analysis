"1","For well over two decades, a cross‐disciplinary debate over the proper way of conceptualizing presidential rhetoric and its effects (or lack thereof) has raged sporadically, pitting humanists in communication and English departments against increasingly positivist political scientists. Rather than lurch toward resolution, however, the debate seems increasingly to be conducted across two ever‐more distant tracks, as scholars in one camp misunderstand and misconstrue seminal work in the other and remain largely unaware of new developments outside their own fields. Scholars outside political science touch the bases as they reference work by Jeffrey Tulis, Samuel Kernell, and George Edwards in an often overreliant and myopic manner; political scientists often do the same with hurried references to now‐classic works by David Zarefsky and Martin Medhurst but few others."
"2","Jeffrey P. Mehltretter Drury's Speaking with the People's Voice: How Presidents Invoke Public Opinion is at once an example of a continuation of this trend and a work those who seek to transcend it should read and consider seriously. Drury, a communication scholar and rhetorician, is particularly concerned with how modern American presidents have made reference to the preferences and values of the American people—what he calls “invoked public opinion”—as they have rhetorically communed with the nation.         "
"3","To answer this question, he develops a three‐part typology identifying ways presidents that invoke public opinion. The components of this typology include bandwagon appeals (where public opinion is invoked to convince the audience they should also believe something), identity appeals (where opinion shared between the audience and speaker are invoked to encourage agreement on another topic), and contra populum appeals (where flawed public opinion is invoked so that the speaker can correct it). He then devotes a series of chapter‐length case studies to each component, teasing out the essential functions of each type of appeal (for example, for bandwagon, there is aggregation and recognition; for identity, there is constitution, association, and amplification; and for contra populum, there is correction) in the abstract before applying them to a deconstruction of a single seminal speech.         "
"4","The case study analyses are deftly executed, and his fellow rhetoricians will be comfortable in the author's fluid treatment of his central concepts. However, this volume indicates interdisciplinary aspirations, and it is the readership outside of his field—and especially those in political science—that will struggle with the volume's theoretical, conceptual, and operational approaches. Several key concepts—perhaps most notably, the distinction between presidents leading by public opinion rather than presidential leadership of public opinion, but also a somewhat muddled critique of social scientific approaches to empirical research—are insufficiently precise, with some classifications seeming as if they could just as easily be found under a different conceptual heading or in a different analysis chapter. Political scientists will also likely want far more discussion of causes and consequences, for although the analyses in Speaking with the People's Voice are thorough and rich, they are essentially descriptive.         "
"5","The most interesting aspect of this book is the selection of the case study speeches: Richard Nixon's 1969 Vietnamization/silent majority speech, Jimmy Carter's 1979 crisis of confidence speech, and George W. Bush's 2005 speech in defense of the war in Iraq. Taken together, these speeches are a rather ignominious bunch, strategic rhetorical acts characterized by political weakness and, at least for the first two, remembered historically as controversial, failed, or both. This observation would at least casually suggest a linkage between political context and invocation, one that this book does not address but that future scholars should."
"6","In sum, Speaking with the People's Voice is a useful addition to the ongoing conversation about how, why, and to what effect presidents speak as they do. Scholars interested in this debate, and particularly in learning more about the arguments made by the humanists involved in it, would do well to study it carefully.         "
