"1","Adam L. Fuller's book on neoconservatism joins a long list of articles and monographs published in the last decade on this important, ever‐fascinating, and controversial subject. Rather than focusing on the neoconservatives' foreign policy, as do so many of the recent books on neoconservatism, Fuller focuses primarily on their domestic policy and underlying political philosophy. Fortunately, just one chapter out of eight is devoted to neoconservative foreign policy."
"2","Taking the Fight to the Enemy takes the neocons seriously and transcribes accurately what they have been saying about themselves for a very long time. In this way, Fuller's book reminds one of Mark Gerson's 1997 The Neoconservative Vision: From the Cold War to the Culture Wars. What is most original in this book comes out of the personal interviews that Fuller conducted with several leading neoconservatives.         "
"3","The theme and scope of Fuller's book are as ambitious as they are comprehensive. The book seeks to answer one basic question: What is neoconservatism? Fuller attempts to answer this question by examining the historical development of the neoconservative movement from the 1930s to the present. His method consists largely of a series of Wikipedia‐like intellectual biographies of the principal neoconservative thinkers, for example, Irving Kristol, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer, Norman Podhoretz, and Midge Decter. The virtue of this book is that it is full of interesting anecdotes about the principal neocons that are not available in those books that more fully explore the depths of neoconservative thought."
"4","The book also provides a series of mini‐biographies of a whole range of so‐called “public” intellectuals who influenced and were sometimes associated with the principal neocons, such as Max Schactman, Eliot Cohen, Sidney Hook, Lionel Trilling, and Robert Nisbet. Ironically, Fuller devotes an entire chapter to the thought of the political philosopher Leo Strauss, a man whose influence on the neocons is described by our author as “exaggerated and overstated.” Our author also claims that Sidney Hook and Lionel Trilling were much more influential on neoconservative thinking than Strauss, and yet they each receive only half the number of pages given to examining Strauss's thought. More importantly, Fuller's analysis of Hook and Trilling, while somewhat interesting, fails to demonstrate how these writers' ideas influenced the neocons in any meaningful way. For instance, Fuller's examination of the depths and intricacies of Hook's theoretical Marxism is largely irrelevant to the task of explaining the meaning of neoconservatism. Fuller also examines Trilling's long‐forgotten novel, The Middle of the Journey, and, more particularly, he focuses on a book review written by one of the novel's characters of Melville's Billy Budd. It is all rather self‐indulgent and the meaning and relevance of this detour is never made clear.         "
"5","The strongest and best part of Taking the Fight to the Enemy is chapter 7, “One Nation, Two Cultures,” where Fuller examines the neoconservatives' critique of the Beat Generation of the 1950s and New Left of the 1960s and the moral and social upheaval that followed in their wake. Fuller is to be credited with highlighting the important, but all‐too‐neglected role, played by Midge Decter in analyzing the meaning and consequences of the feminist revolution.         "
"6","Taking the Fight to the Enemy might have been a good book. Unfortunately, it reads as though it were the penultimate draft of a doctoral dissertation in need of one more substantive and stylistic revision. (This reviewer has never read a book so full of typographical and grammatical errors.) We live today in an academic world where dissertations are all too often approved prematurely and where publishers have cut back on copy editors. Sadly, the author of this book has been done an injustice by those responsible for judging its merits.         "
