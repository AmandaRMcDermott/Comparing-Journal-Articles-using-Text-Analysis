"1","The U.S. Senate's status as a gentlemen's club that kept women out of its membership ranks was laid bare in 1992 when then‐candidate Democrat Dianne Feinstein remarked that “two percent may be good enough for milk but it's not good enough for the Senate.” Since that time, women have steadily increased their numbers therein, making it possible to consider the nature, scope, and significance of their activity as senators. Given its membership size and institutional rules and norms of operation, the Senate serves as an ideal institution for monitoring women's activity. In keeping with her previous work on gender and legislative activity in the House, Michele Swers concludes that gender serves as a defining characteristic ordering women senators' policy priorities. Voters see women as experts on women's and social welfare issues, and women senators are employed by both parties to burnish those credentials as it suits their respective party's needs. The challenge, however, is that the incentives to act on those priorities are not equally enjoyed by Democratic and Republican women. Democratic women senators are often called on to play the role of offense in advancing the Democratic Party's status as “fighters” for women and families, as highlighted by Swers's comprehensive case studies of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, abortion legislation, and Supreme Court nominations. And, acknowledging the party gap in women's Senate membership, with women Democrats outnumbering women Republicans by more than two to one, Swers demonstrates how Democratic women senators continually seek to expand their collective presence within the caucus (if not the Senate itself) in ways that Republican women simply cannot."
"2","In contrast, the experience of Republican women senators is much different. Only a few Republican women senators have served at the same time in any given Congress (a maximum of five Republican women senators served together in the 112th Congress), which means that these same few women are often deployed by their own party leadership time and again as defense to counteract the image that the Republican Party is hostile to women. Republican women receive no electoral benefit from voters by focusing on women's issues. The primacy of core Republican Party tenets of fiscal conservatism and limited government effectively discourages Republican women senators from spending time or developing expertise on women's issues. One question that is only briefly considered by Swers is how the retirement of moderates like Senator Olympia Snowe and the election of social conservatives like Senators Deb Fischer and Kelly Ayotte will affect the issues on which Republican women focus their attention.         "
"3","Swers broadens her focus on the legislative activity of women members to include defense and national security policy in a post September 11 context. Here, she notes that security policy may be an area in which Republican women senators may claim an advantage over their Democratic counterparts. Double stereotypes of gender and party ownership of issues conspire to force Democratic, but not necessarily Republican, women senators to work harder to establish credentials with voters and their male colleagues. And even when Democratic women senators do turn their attention to security issues, their focus is often on women, as evidenced by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's ongoing work on mitigating sexual assault in the military."
"4","Over the last 20 years, women's membership in the U.S. Senate has increased from 2 to 20 percent. Swers's research affirms that women senators will play an increasingly important role within their respective parties in voter outreach and party messaging."
