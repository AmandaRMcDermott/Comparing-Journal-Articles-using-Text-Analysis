"1","African Americans’ efforts to secure political equality were impacted by necessary coalitions with whites. Because of the tenuous nature of these relationships, political scientists have explored what seems a natural development: coalitions among blacks and Latinos. Much of the research on the potential for this coalition development has reported prevalent feelings of distrust and hostility. Andrea Benjamin's Racial Coalition Building in Local Elections: Elite Cues and Cross‐Ethnic Voting expands this discussion by focusing on black and Latino vote choices in mayoral elections.         "
"2","Benjamin proposes the “co‐ethnic elite cues theory,” which argues that when partisan cues are absent and race/ethnicity is salient in an election, co‐ethnic endorsements should prompt minority groups members to vote for a particular candidate, even if that candidate is from another ethnic group (p. 8). According to this theory, there are “three factors that explain possible variations in Black and Latino voting patterns in local elections: elites and their endorsements; the quality and demographic characteristics of the candidates; and the political context (racial/ethnic salience)” (p. 37)."
"3","In order to test her theory, Benjamin uses content analysis of newspaper endorsements, experimental designs, and exit polls from cities including New York and Chicago to examine the relationship between co‐ethnic leader endorsements and voters’ choices. These methods reveal that when race/ethnicity is made salient in a campaign, there is a relationship between the number and direction of co‐ethnic endorsements and candidate preference among black and Latino voters. The political candidate with the most endorsements from black and Latino leaders and organizations often receives a majority from both voting blocs."
"4","Much of Benjamin's findings confirm what we know about vote choices for blacks and Latinos, but by focusing on local elections, she forces us to think more broadly about elite cues, racial and ethnic politics, and representation. Benjamin observes that endorsements from local ethnic leadership and organizations do influence black and Latino voters, but these elite cues alone are not enough to change vote choice. When there is a white candidate who has received an endorsement from black and Latino elites, it is not enough to make him or her the candidate of choice for either black or Latino voters. In addition to endorsements, the racialized context of the campaign and the candidate's race/ethnicity are also important. For blacks, co‐ethnic cues can explain vote choice if the candidate is Latino. If the candidate is black, regardless of salience, Latinos rely on co‐ethnic cues and perceive some candidates as sympathetic to Latino issues. Benjamin illustrates how co‐ethnic endorsements do not help Latinos express more positive feelings toward blacks. Furthermore, she explicitly discusses how racial attitudes are fairly stable, even when co‐ethnics endorse a member of the group in the local election."
"5","Benjamin's work is critical to understanding the nuanced ways in which black and Latino voters decide whom to support in local elections. Benjamin successfully revitalizes the literature on incorporation and racial attitudes by clarifying the conditions in which black and Latino voters are responsive to black‐Latino political coalitions. Bringing to the forefront local elections is immeasurable since cities have been central to the advancement of civil rights and equality for people of color (for example, Ferguson or Baltimore in recent years). Showing that blacks and Latinos are willing to support out‐group minority candidates provides evidence that these groups are willing to work together to win local elections for the benefit of their communities."
