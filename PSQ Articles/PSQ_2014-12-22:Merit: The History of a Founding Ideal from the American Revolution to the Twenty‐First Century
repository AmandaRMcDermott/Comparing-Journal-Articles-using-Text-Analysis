"1","This book engages in an admirable attempt to understand an impressive range of important American historical trends and events through the lens of an idea. Joseph F, Kett begins by describing the uneasy existence of widely acknowledged “Men of Merit” within a revolutionary era inspired by ideas of equal rights and popular sovereignty/consent. These revolutionary leaders and American Founders understood merit as an inherent personal quality evidenced externally by public achievements and recognition, which Kett terms “essential merit.” The nineteenth century witnessed the gradual transformation of prevailing understandings of merit from the “essential” to the “institutional”; from merit as an inherent personal quality evidenced by public recognition to merit as a “presumption” certified by testing or institutional affiliation (p. 13). This transition leads Kett into an extensive treatment of educational history and the history of standardized testing, a treatment which ends up occupying the majority of his book. The book concludes with a provocative and thoughtful assessment of the status of the idea of merit—specifically, its “crisis”—since the 1960s."
"2","This book provides a veritable treasure trove of historical anecdotes, facts, statistics. and studies relating to American educational history and its intersections with American political history. The book is impressively researched throughout and provides a number of insightful suggestions at the intersections of American political history/theory and educational history/theory. For these reasons, Kett's book should prove valuable to a wide range of scholars of American political thought, including both historians and political scientists."
"3","These undeniable “merits” of Merit are, however, accompanied by a few significant shortcomings. First and most importantly, it is far from clear to this reviewer that “merit” provides the best conceptual lens for uniting and understanding the historical phenomena that Kett traces throughout much of the book. While the range and rigor of Kett's historical research are undeniable, the unity and coherence of the whole remain tenuous throughout. The narrative thread of the book is frequently lost, and when it is picked up at intervals—particularly in the introduction and epilogue—it is handled in overly vague and even occasionally clumsy ways. When discussing the “mental testers” at the opening of chapter 6, for example, Kett states that “the kind of merit they had in mind had nothing in common with the overall superiority of the Founding Generation's Men of Merit.” “Nor,” moreover, “did they have much in common with those who had devised merit systems in the nineteenth century to settle disputes over rank orders in competitions” (p. 159). If these various instances of “merit” have so little in common, the reader may ask, why view them together in terms of “merit” at all?         "
"4","Kett's historical materials might have been more compellingly united and lent significance by the Jeffersonian concept of “natural aristocracy,” a concept that plays an integral but subordinate role in the book. This concept more accurately captures the interplay between basic equality (Kett's “equal rights” + “popular consent”) and the differential results of the exercise of liberty or the “pursuit of happiness,” an interplay that animates the historical narrative of the book, than the rather amorphous and vague one of “merit.” While the choice of “merit” as the guiding theme of the book may thus constitute a missed opportunity, this book should nevertheless prove a valuable resource for students of American political thought."
