"1","For students of American foreign policy, the Cold War provides a pretty big conundrum. For one thing, it was the first time the United States committed to playing a “permanent” global leadership role. For another, America's Cold War strategy was grounded in a conceptually sound doctrine: containment. And even though containment was never as accepted (by the public or policymakers) or unified (as a coherent strategy) as it appears in retrospect, at least it was something. Indeed, for 45 years, containment offered an intellectual blueprint though which the broad strokes of America's military, economic, and cultural (soft power) strategies could be developed—through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Bretton Woods, and the spread of liberal‐democratic ideas.         "
"2","Then the Cold War ended. And ever since—brief euphoria over Francis Fukuyama's “End of History” notwithstanding—the United States has been left wandering in search of a grand (or, really, any) strategy."
"3","In US Foreign Policy in the Post‐Cold War Era: Restraint versus Assertiveness from George H.W. Bush to Barack Obama, Tudor Onea does not seek to explain America's lack of a post‐Cold War grand strategy. Nor, thankfully, does he endeavor to create one. Instead, the “puzzle” Onea sets up is far more limited: why America has been so “assertive” in the post‐Cold War world, rather than just kicking back and enjoying the fruits of its dominant, unipolar global position. Onea's cases of “assertiveness” are the familiar ones from the late 1990s and 2000s—Kosovo, Iraq (under both Bill Clinton and George Bush, Jr.), and general unilateralism—which, he says, followed America's brief (and unsuccessful) fling with “restraint” in the early to mid 1990s.         "
"4","Onea posits that America's apparently unusual behavior (I will get back to that) can be explained by looking at Washington's reaction to real and symbolic threats to its global “prestige,” with prestige defined as “deference” that the United States demands from other states because of its systemic dominance (p. 3). This, he argues, supplies a stronger explanation for America's “assertiveness” than alternatives like structural realism, domestic ideology (American “exceptionalism”), and “open door” economic revisionism."
"5","Setting the book up this way is interesting, and effective. And I particularly liked Onea's discussion of the continuum of America's strategic options from isolation (pure restraint) to hegemony (pure assertiveness) (pp. 7–8). His cases, and his analysis of the Barack Obama administration, are well informed."
"6","The problem, though, is that the concept of “prestige” does not do well as an all‐encompassing explanation for America's behavior in the 1990s (or elsewhere). One does not need to be a hard‐core structural realist to recognize that the United States had the greatest stake in the post‐Cold War unipolar system; and that the United States would probably respond to challenges (big and small, real and symbolic) to the post‐Cold War status quo. As Onea himself asserts, the restraint of the early to mid 1990s was met with increasing challenges to American power and authority. While concern over “prestige” may have played a role in its responses, it remains unclear how this would not be mostly epiphenomenal to America's general sense of need to get its bearings back as the sole superpower in the global system. And whether the narrow concept “prestige” accounts for the precise nature of U.S. responses is simply too thin a slice to confidently test."
"7","I should also note that Onea's policy prescription—a “smarter” policy of prestige, to avoid counterproductive overreactions—would probably sell well to the Obama administration (they like putting the word “smart” in front of their initiatives), but does little to practically solve the challenge of knowing the precise metric of response (as if there is one) in uncertain moments of challenge, large and small."
"8","Onea's book is in keeping with a growing trend of explanations for America's cycles of global engagement and retrenchment, including Stephen Sestanovich's Maximalist: America in the World from Truman to Obama. Though “prestige” is not the most‐convincing explanation for these cycles, or even for the more‐focused question of why America developed an assertive foreign policy in the post‐Cold War era, it is no doubt part of the mix.
