"1","This highly accessible book examines the shifting dimensions of the “culture war” during the Barack Obama presidency, a volatile season in American political history by any measure, the meanings of which our profession will debate for years to come. Those who attempt first to make meaning of recent events do us all a great service. To be sure, their proximity is at once an important strength and malefic flaw, their views necessarily incomplete, if not sometimes myopic. And yet the brave souls among our ranks proceed anyhow, advancing theses that are sure to be nuanced or amended as our field of vision grows and their ideas are tested. John Dombrink's The Twilight of Social Conservatism: American Culture Wars in the Obama Era is an important and valiant attempt to understand the latest round of a political culture war that has been with us now for nearly four decades.         "
"2","Dombrink's most notable contribution is to advance a counterintuitive thesis. We can all agree that the Obama years have been divisive, sometimes downright nasty, and so our impulse, in light of the volume and rancor of the conservative backlash, is to perceive social conservatives as once again on the ascent. Dombrink concludes just the opposite. Drawing on polls, demographic research, and commentary, he argues that the culture war is in fact waning. Dombrink's examination is impressive in its range, chronicling the paradox of simultaneous “growth” (p. 5) on either end of our political spectrum—liberalization on the one end (as evidenced by rapid policy changes such as legalization of same‐sex marriage) and growing conservatism on the other (e.g., the rapid, unexpected rise and force of the Tea Party). The crux of Dombrink's argument is this: the so‐called wedge issues (abortion, gay rights, etc.) that have been successful in American politics are losing their power, and this “unwedging,” in his view, “is what characterizes America in 2015” (p. 7)."
"3","Dombrink might be right. But were I a conservative culture warrior, I might caution him, channeling Mark Twain, of the exaggerated reports of my demise. The reality is simply that it is too soon to know for sure the fate of social conservatives and, by extension, the culture war they fight. In this respect, Dombrink's thesis might be a bit too ambitious. The book would be much more effective if The Twilight of Social Conservatism were stated as a question rather than an answer.         "
"4","Dombrink's other blind spot involves his serial references to Sin No More, a 2007 book that he coauthored with Daniel Hillyard on crime, law, and morality in America. Certainly, the arguments he makes there are germane to his discussion of social conservatism in the Obama years, but too often, Dombrink references his own work to the exclusion of a vast literature on culture war politics that would certainly prove at least equally useful.         "
"5","The Twilight of Social Conservatism is, in the final analysis, an important book, and we would do well to consider it a worthy starting point in what is sure to be a line of work attempting to understand the fate of the culture war in American politics. For that, we owe John Dombrink our gratitude and thanks.         "
