"1","Who should be held responsible for the financial crisis? That question, which is at the heart of Mary Kreiner Ramirez and Steven A. Ramirez's clearly written and well‐sourced book, The Case for the Corporate Death Penalty: Restoring Law and Order on Wall Street, has held a large share of the public and academic discourse over the past decade. The authors’ answer, as the title suggests, is corporations—specifically, Wall Street banks and the senior managers within them. But the blame is also laid at the feet of the Department of Justice, which, given to political and economic pressure, made “zero prosecutions of any megabank,” thus constituting a “historic breakdown in the rule of law” (p. xiv).         "
"2","There is much to like about this book and its analysis of the central question, which is particularly timely as we approach the 10‐year anniversary of the start of the financial crisis. Despite there being hundreds of books and articles written on the subject, only a few have directly tackled the issue of why the prosecutorial response was so anemic, and even fewer still with as much vigor or scope. Over six chapters, Ramirez and Ramirez marshal the facts against the leaders of Countrywide, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Goldman Sachs, Ernst & Young, and other companies for criminal wrongdoing, a veritable rogues’ gallery when it comes to originating, trading, and advising on subprime mortgages and derivatives. Drawn largely from news reports and court documents from civil litigation, the book tells a compelling story of greed, recklessness, and fraud by some of our most respected financial institutions. For anyone trying to understand how the crisis originated and then filtered throughout the financial system, the book is an invaluable resource. It likely will also make you mad, as it suggests an era of financial impunity aided by government inaction."
"3","My biggest critique of the book has less to do with its content than its moment: I wonder whether it has passed. While it may be an appropriate time to review the causes of the financial crisis and consider what conclusions may be drawn, one has to consider whether the central question—who is to blame and how can they be held responsible—has largely been answered. We do not seem to care. If the lawlessness that the book speaks of truly leads to long‐term devastation, then why are we seeing a stock market at record highs, unemployment at record lows, and a newly elected president transparent in his aims to strengthen, not weaken, corporations? Deregulation, lower corporate taxes, less government spending, and a “softer approach” to corporate crime are the articulated positions of the current administration and the majority party controlling the legislature. Our collective response to the financial crisis seems to be that we want more big business, not less."
"4","While this could be a product of “economic and political power [that] is dangerously concentrated” (p. 228), it could also be that the public does not view corporate fraud as the authors do. Although we say we want corporate heads to roll, maybe we just want a cheap mortgage and we are willing to take the risk. If that is true, not only will individual corporate prosecutions be extremely difficult from a legal standpoint, so, too, will effectuating systemic reform. That is not to say the book's thesis is incorrect, but it does cast doubt on the plausibility of its particular strain of recommendations aimed at “reimposing law on financial elites” (p. 220). Unfortunately, the case for the corporate death penalty may already be closed."
