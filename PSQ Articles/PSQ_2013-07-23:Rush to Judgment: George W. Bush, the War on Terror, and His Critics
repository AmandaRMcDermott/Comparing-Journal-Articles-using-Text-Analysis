"1","Stephen Knott has written a book that attempts to reverse the negative reputation of President George W. Bush. The author uses his Introduction to survey all the historians who wrote toxic statements about the 43rd president, along with various polls, such as a Siena College Research Institute survey of 238 presidential scholars who ranked Bush thirty‐ninth, “cementing for the moment his reputation as one of the nation's five worst chief executives” (p. 10). If the reader ever needs a chapter quoting all Bush's enemies, including conservative critics, novelists, and Hollywood, this is it."
"2","Knott is taking them all on. “The visceral animus some American historians felt [toward the Bush administration],” he declares, “bordered on the unprofessional and made a mockery of the principle of academic objectivity” (p. 11). Hence, the author looks to the behavior of previous presidents and asks a number of questions. Was power “seized” during the Bush presidency? Was the nation in a constitutional crisis? Were the President's actions unconstitutional, a threat to civil liberties, and contrary to the intentions of the founding fathers? Finally, was Bush, as journalist Helen Thomas claimed, “the worst president in all of American history”? (pp. 20, 21)."
"3","Knott then examines previous examples of presidential power grabs, and asks who Bush's role models were. They include “The Clandestine Lincoln,” (p. 28) and Woodrow Wilson and his “Firm Hand of Stern Repression” (p. 34). According to the author, during Wilson's presidency, he “followed through on his expansive view of presidential power, suppressing domestic dissent and subversion in a manner that exceeded Dick Cheney's wildest dreams,” (p. 35) which might be true, but there was a constitutional difference. World War I was declared; Iraq was not. The same could be said of the author's coverage of Franklin Roosevelt's behavior during World War II. Again, that conflict was declared and was a war for national survival; Iraq was not."
"4","Of course, the author has a point—that previous presidents have stretched the law and the Constitution by their actions. In this regard, Knott does a good job of reminding readers of Andrew Jackson's forced removal of Native Americans, of Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War, of Wilson's enforcement of the sedition and espionage acts, or Franklin Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans. FDR's “broad conception of presidential power went far beyond that of George W. Bush” (p. 43). Eventually, in Chapters 2 and 3, the author gets his whacks in at Congress, and then hammers the Supreme Court for ruling against the Bush administration's detention policies at Guantanamo. “The notion of sharing executive national security power with the judiciary, or allowing the judiciary to check this power, is as contrary to the intentions of the Founding Fathers as you can get” (p. 90). No checks and balances for Knott."
"5","The author's last four chapters are his re‐invention of Bush. The interpretation could have come from that administration: Bill Clinton should have done more to prevent September 11; as a war president, Bush acted like previous commanders‐in‐chief; everyone thought Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; Bush was a “strong president who protected the prerogatives of the executive office”; (p. 148), and his critics have given him an unfair indictment."
"6","This is a pro‐Bush polemic about anti‐Bush polemics. The idea that historians and political scientists were “unprofessional” during a time when the unnecessary Iraq war was tearing that and this nation apart is absurd. We are human, and thus biased, and we are citizens with the right and even obligation to speak out."
"7","In the long run, this book is important because it is the first attempt to revise the traditional interpretation that the presidency of George W. Bush was a failure. Each reader can decide whether the author succeeds."
