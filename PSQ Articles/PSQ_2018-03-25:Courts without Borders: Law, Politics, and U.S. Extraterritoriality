"1","When will U.S. courts bring U.S. law to bear on the activities of foreign actors outside the United States? Over the past few decades, the number of domestic court cases that have projected U.S. law beyond U.S. borders has grown dramatically. On a smaller scale, other nations have begun to follow the U.S. extraterritorial lead. No longer solely the realm of international law and international institutions, domestic law increasingly plays a prominent role in global governance. As a result, the once neglected area of extraterritorial jurisdiction has taken on increased importance to political scientists, international relations scholars, legal academics, and international lawyers."
"2","Into this mix comes Tonya L. Putnam's terrific and very readable book, Courts without Borders: Law, Politics, and U.S. Extraterritoriality. It is a valuable addition to a growing body of interdisciplinary literature that explores different ways transnational law is made. Putnam examines the politics behind judicial extraterritoriality. Why, she queries, have U.S. courts generally declined to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over product liability claims and alleged patent violations, but they are willing to enforce domestic statutes extraterritorially to disrupt international trading cartels, counter transnational securities fraud, or protect U.S. trademarks?         "
"3","Putnam proposes a novel theory to explain the variation—why U.S. courts have become frequent but selective extraterritorial regulators. She argues that the answer does not lie in examining legal doctrine or statutory text; rather, court behavior can be explained when the decision to apply a law extraterritorially supports (or at least does not undermine) the integrity or operation of U.S. law. She then teases out this theory in contexts in which extraterritorial conduct threatens the public policy purposes behind U.S. law and in rights‐based disputes, involving rights “at the core of the American political identity.” She examines a number of case studies, from international antitrust (p. 101) to intellectual property protection (p. 152), to human rights enforcement (p. 202). Responding to recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, she concludes the book by pondering whether judicial extraterritoriality is in decline and whether the end of an era is upon us."
"4","Her explanatory theory is intriguing, but her more important contribution may be how domestic decisions have influenced broader processes of transnational rulemaking and the international political consequences of U.S. judicial extraterritoriality. It is on these fronts that her book shines the most. A number of scholars have suggested that unilaterally applying domestic laws extraterritorially can spur harmonization—serving as a stopgap measure before meaningful international agreement can occur. Putnam shows why this assumption is likely unwarranted. When advocates have failed to convince courts that domestic rights should be extended extraterritorially, that failure has, at times, helped fuel bilateral or multilateral engagement. Conversely, when U.S. extraterritoriality has proven effective little urgency exists for the United States to negotiate coordinated rules. In this way, judicial extraterritoriality is a result of domestic political struggles and a form of unilateral international engagement. The story of U.S. extraterritoriality then, as Putnam shows, is a story of a peculiarly American strategy for diffusing legal norms and ideas internationally and a way to press U.S. regulatory preferences abroad."
"5","Much of the book soars, while some parts (as is the case with all books) tread more familiar ground. One may not be convinced that the novel theory advanced fully explains all the variation, but it is a compelling account. For my own taste, the risks and benefits of judicial extraterritoriality could have been explored more. But these are quibbles, and minor ones at that. As a whole, the book is a thoughtful, insightful, and welcome entry in a growing and important area."
