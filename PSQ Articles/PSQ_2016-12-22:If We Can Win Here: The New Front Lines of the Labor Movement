"1","For many, it is a paradox of our times that while economic inequality and insecurity worsen, collective action by workers seems almost nonexistent. This contrast provides the background for Fran Quigley's study of recent efforts to organize low‐wage service sector workers in Indianapolis, Indiana. A law professor at Indiana University and an occasional participant in these struggles, Quigley provides detailed accounts of unionization campaigns among food service workers, hotel housekeepers, janitors, security guards, and home care employees. While his main focus is on attempts to secure union recognition and collective bargaining contracts, he also describes political mobilizations by workers to press for mandated wage increases and benefits and efforts by the city's growing Latino population to push for immigration reform and economic equity."
"2","Quigley is fascinated by the possibility that service workers can be mobilized into unions in much the same fashion that industrial workers were during the 1930s. The unions of that period, he argues, took manufacturing jobs that were “low‐paying, dangerous, and provided little security or long‐term benefits” (p. 17) and transformed them into the backbone of the middle class. Current service sector workers are likewise underpaid and ill treated but frequently employed by corporations generating massive profits. In contrast to manufacturing, service jobs that involve cleaning hotel rooms, preparing food, and providing security and maintenance cannot be effectively outsourced to foreign countries. Quigley views the place‐bounded nature of service work as a key vulnerability for employers that unions ought to able to effectively exploit."
"3","To address this possibility, Quigley recounts efforts by the UNITE HERE union to organize hospitality workers at the city's Hyatt Regency Hotel and food service workers at four locations: the local airport, two private colleges, and one public university. The latter institutions all hired outside contracting firms to provide food service staff, a scheme that often hinders successful organizing. Nonetheless, the union was successful at all four locations in ultimately securing recognition and a first contract. Quigley notes, however, that wages and benefits remained unimpressive for these workers even after unionization. The UNITE HERE campaign to organize hotel workers was less successful (albeit spirited) and did not result in even a union certification vote. The drive by the Service Employees International Union to organize home care workers was also fruitless, and most of the security guards and janitors in the city remained unorganized."
"4","Overall, the outcomes of the unionizing drives were not reassuring for those who believe that service workers are likely to organize on a major scale in the near future. Much effort was made by talented organizers and courageous employees, but with marginal results. Quigley does see promise in the creation of a “worker center” in the city that would provide legal advice for nonunion employees and organize protests in favor of higher wages and just treatment. But such a center, he acknowledges, would provide neither union dues nor a stable platform for future collective action."
"5","If We Can Win Here is a valuable book in that it provides great detail on the frequently despicable working conditions endured by low‐wage employees and the aspirations of individual workers and organizers who choose to take action to improve those conditions. The thick descriptions provided by the author do indeed give readers a palpable grasp of what life is like on “the front lines of the labor movement.” The downside to this approach, however, is that Quigley does not provide any systematic analysis explaining why some drives succeed and others fail or whether his story is ultimately cause for optimism or despair. Heroes are aplenty in this text, but their capacity to overcome the forces arrayed against them remains uncertain.         "
