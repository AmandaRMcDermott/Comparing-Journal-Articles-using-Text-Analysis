"1","Eighty years have passed since the end of Herbert Hoover's presidency, but the debate about his place in U.S. history continues. Scholars are still puzzled by why posterity ranked him as a mediocre president and whether such a rating is accurate. Glen Jeansonne, in The Life of Herbert Hoover: Fighting Quaker, 1928–1933, joins this debate by providing an account of Hoover's presidency through the prism of his personality. Hoover was a man whose heart never aged, who was never too busy to help friends and people in need, and who was too humble to brag about his deeds. As a result, two distinct images of the President have emerged. The one, “Bert,” was respected and deeply admired by those who interacted with him on a daily basis, and the other was portrayed by journalists who had only sporadic access to the White House. It was the media account that subsequently contributed to the negative image of Hoover as President. Jeansonne's understanding of Hoover's personality is so profound that a reader begins to think that the author belonged to the circle of Hoover's close friends. Jeansonne also skillfully shows how traits that made Hoover successful as a businessman and as a humanitarian later became a liability when dealing with Congress, party leaders, and the media.

"2","Twenty chronologically organized chapters provide a comprehensive account of how Hoover's polices originated, what he intended to accomplish, and how political context limited his options. Two chapters on macroeconomic stabilization generate new insights into how the economic crisis changed the strategic environment in which economic actors operated and made cooperation among them unfeasible. Neither the National Credit Corporation, established to provide loans to banks, nor the Farm Board, authorized to purchase grain from farmers, produced the desired results, because farmers and bankers pursued their self‐interests and this, consequently, led to socially suboptimum outcomes. These chapters also suggest that Hoover's stabilization measures constituted a major departure from both the laissez faire advocated by the old guard Republicans as well as the associationalism that Hoover had promoted as Secretary of Commerce. The chapters on Hoover's social policy supply plenty of new facts about Hoover's relations with organized labor, farmers, veterans, African Americans, and women. This information is especially relevant for understanding the demise of the Republican Party regime and the sources of the electoral realignment of 1932. The extensive discussion of domestic polices is juxtaposed with that of Hoover's foreign policy."
"3","The book raises an important question about the benchmark against which any president should be evaluated. Jeansonne extols Hoover for an unprecedented expansion of the government's role during economic downturns, for implementing a long list of social policies and reducing the inefficiency of the federal bureaucracy, and most importantly, for conceiving policies that became key pillars of the New Deal. Jeansonne is most convincing in showing that Hoover outperformed his predecessors, especially Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. He is less systematic, however, in evaluating Hoover's policies in other areas. Hoover's success in pushing through Congress bills related to conservation, government reorganization, prisons, radio, and other social issues obscures his failure to shape the debate on such important measures as prohibition, the tariff, and Muscle Shoals."
"4","The Life of Herbert Hoover is an eloquently written narrative substantiated by thorough historical research and constitutes a welcome addition to the existing literature on Hoover's presidency and the Great Depression. It is by far the most comprehensive account of how Hoover's multifaceted personality shaped his relationship with the Party, Congress, and the media, and influenced his policy choices. The book will be of great value to any scholar working on that period.         "
