"1","At the center of almost every scandal that befalls a U.S. agency is its inspector general (IG), who is often the reason the problems are revealed in the first place. And yet, given their importance in uncovering bureaucratic failures and diagnosing why they occurred, it is remarkable how little scholarly attention IGs have received in the public administration and bureaucratic politics literatures. Nadia Hilliard's book, The Accountability State: U.S. Federal Inspectors General and the Pursuit of Democratic Integrity, helps fill this void by presenting a sophisticated and textured account of the IG office as a key mechanism to promote bureaucratic accountability.         "
"2","Implementing a research design that combines interviews with key members of the IG community with an examination of an extensive set of primary documents, Hilliard begins by documenting the history of the IG position as it has evolved from the Inspector General Act of 1978, a valuable endeavor in itself. Still, the book's key findings emerge from detailed inquiries into the experiences of the IG offices in the Departments of State, Justice, and Homeland Security. Not only do these rich narratives illustrate how IGs strive to balance the often conflicting desires of two principals, Congress and their departmental leadership, but also they importantly show how IGs have followed divergent paths to forge distinctive visions of what democratic accountability means for their departments."
"3","Hilliard explains that by moving beyond their original charge to ferret out departmental fraud and waste, many IGs have built practices that foster a better functioning democracy in one of three ways. While some produce investigations with the goal of promoting bureaucratic political neutrality, others have channeled the efforts of their offices to uphold constitutional rights. A third group specializes in promoting administrative efficiency and performance improvement, especially in responding to national emergencies."
"4","In some ways, IG offices are not unlike the agencies they monitor. They face similar challenges in coping with competing missions (here balancing auditing and investigating), fostering productive cultures, and managing the realities of resource constraints. Still, as Hilliard notes, these offices “are not equivalent to bureaucracies; they do not provide services that gather coalitional support, and they are the agent of two opposing principals” (p. 18). Further, they are in the unusual position of partially deriving their legitimacy from the reactions of the very agencies they criticize. Thus, as the book aptly demonstrates, IGs are worthy of study as an entity separate from the broader departments in which they reside."
"5","As trade‐offs exist with almost any research approach, the historical cased‐based strategy adopted by Hilliard—although appropriate in light of one interviewee's observation that “once you've met one IG, you've met one IG” (p. 40)—does have a few drawbacks. The book nicely identifies possible explanations for how some IGs construct their particular paths toward effectively promoting democratic functioning by focusing on two IG offices perceived to be successful and one that has been less so, as measured largely by reactions to their reports. The levers include the IG's functional background and longevity in the position, office resources and independence, and the substantive focus of the associated department. Still, determining the relative importance of these features is somewhat beyond the scope, a point that Hilliard acknowledges."
"6","Altogether, The Accountability State represents a refined and informative look into the world of government IGs. Although Hilliard appropriately refrains from sweeping conclusions, this noteworthy book offers ample evidence that, at least sometimes, IGs are not just another layer of the “bureaucracy that they were designed to shrink” (p. 16) but rather have grown into figures that help impose democratic accountability on a potentially unchecked administrative apparatus.
