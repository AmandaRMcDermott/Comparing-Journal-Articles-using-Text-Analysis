"1","Utilizing nationally representative survey data from the 2010 and 2012 administrations of the Cooperative Congressional Election Studies, Damon M. Cann and Jeff Yates cover a good deal of ground that law and courts scholars and students of state politics will find interesting. The authors outline in a competent and comprehensive manner the factors that go into assessments of state court legitimacy, how citizens perceive judicial decision making, and what sort of selection method people prefer for state judges."
"2","Cann and Yates offer a relative ranking of high court legitimacy for each of the 50 states that they extrapolate by looking at the responses to legitimacy questions from respondents in their nationally representative sample. Specifically, they weigh survey responses for several “respondent types” in the national sample (for example, white, female, college educated; p. 28) by their relative proportions in each state population to come up with the legitimacy ranking. One might question whether it would be more accurate and straightforward to derive such rankings from survey questions that are representative of the population in each state, but that is not the data they are working with. To the extent that the reader is willing to go along with their methodology, the authors’ findings are intriguing: citizens of Washington State are deemed to have the most positive view of their state high court and those in Mississippi the least positive."
"3","For each of the empirical analyses that follow, Cann and Yates start with bivariate relationships between hypothesized influences and the dependent variable of interest before laying out a structural equation model of the relationship between variables and multivariate results. The presentation of results in this manner becomes a bit routine by Chapter 7, and readers may find themselves skipping ahead to the end of each chapter to see which influences “hold up” in the multivariate model. As for legitimacy, in Chapter 3, the authors find that knowledge of state legal factors (reflected by the respondents knowing the number of judges on the state supreme court, that the court employs judicial review, and that the state has its own constitution) enhances views of state high court legitimacy, as do college education and subjective policy agreement with the court's outputs. State courts that were rated as “high‐quality” institutions by academic scholars also receive higher legitimacy ratings, although the precise mechanism of such influence in citizen assessments is not entirely clear. Citizens who perceive judges as activists, acknowledge ideological factors in decision making, and live in states with judicial elections are less likely to assess state courts in a positive light."
"4","In subsequent chapters, the authors find that citizens have a pretty realistic view of how judges make decisions. Knowledge of state legal structures and college education tend to enhance the view that judges are influenced by factors other than law. Actual experience in courts through jury participation tends to enhance legal conceptions of decision making; borrowing from James L. Gibson and Gregory A. Caldeira's “positivity theory,” which some of their findings challenge, Cann and Yates posit this may be because of increased exposure to legal symbols during time on juries. Those who agree with court outputs tend to see them as more legalistic—perhaps because it makes people feel better to think that decisions they agree with are the result of appropriate legal criteria."
"5","Cann and Yates also find that respondents prefer electing judges to other methods of state judicial selection. This is ironic in light of the dampening effect of judicial elections on perceptions of state court legitimacy. They also find that people tend to prefer selection methods that are currently employed in the states in which they reside, suggesting either that they have learned to love the benefits of their state system or that they have a substantial regard for the status quo. Other chapters in the book explore citizen views of “judicial impact” and how views of state judicial institutions are related to citizens’ respect for and compliance with the rule of law. In sum, These Estimable Courts is a worthwhile book that adds to our knowledge of how people think about state judicial institutions.         "
