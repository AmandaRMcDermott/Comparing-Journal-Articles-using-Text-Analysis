"1","Is just war thinking flexible enough to address the unique ethical problems of contemporary warfare? In this book, Amy E. Eckert takes up the problem of military privatization, asking whether the just war tradition can adequately address the ethical problems posed by states’ increasing reliance on private military companies (PMCs). Such corporations—including the now defunct Blackwater—provide a variety of services to the states that hire them, from logistics to combat."
"2","A skeptic might ask why PMCs should prompt revisions of the tradition, since canonical just war thinking (whose authorities include Thomas Aquinas and Francisco de Vitoria) developed in an era when mercenaries were frequently employed. Eckert's cogent response is that two very modern assumptions motivate contemporary just war thinking. First, Eckert argues that contemporary just war thinking is heavily indebted to the international law of war, which is itself a product of the post‐Westphalian state system. Contemporary just war thinking's statist orientation is challenged by PMCs’ disruption of the state's monopoly over the legitimate use of force. Similarly, the in bello criteria, in Eckert's view, developed in their present form only after the rise of the sovereign state and presume a clear distinction between state actors (national militaries) and civilians.         "
"3","Second, Eckert asserts that contemporary just war thinking reflects a modern understanding of the public/private divide. While the historical just war tradition privileged the public sphere, today the reverse is largely true, reflecting liberal political values. Individuals, rather than states, have become the focus of just war reasoning, and states themselves increasingly seek to outsource their functions to the market. Ultimately, states turn to PMCs because they operate in the private sphere, offering highly discrete services (relatively) inexpensively. But this lack of transparency makes just war scrutiny difficult.         "
"4","Responding to these twin challenges posed by PMCs, Eckert argues for a moderate reinterpretation of the tradition. Regarding jus ad bellum principles (addressing the ethics of war initiation), Eckert argues that the emergence of PMCs makes authority more diffuse, blurring the line between public violence (war) and private violence (including terrorism). She concludes provocatively that this blurring suggests that other communities may also permissibly engage in public violence, so long as they satisfy the other just war criteria. Additionally, Eckert cautions that states must not allow the availability of PMCs to sway their judgments regarding last resort and just cause, however tempting PMCs may seem as a way to do more with less.         "
"5","In regards to the jus in bello aspects of just war thinking (addressing the ethics of war conduct), one of Eckert's most insightful discussions explores how PMC use complicates the principle of discrimination. Contemporary just war thinking relies on what Eckert terms the “national military model” (p. 107), which distinguishes between legitimate and illegitimate targets of direct force on the basis of membership in a hierarchical military force. By bringing individuals who are technically civilians into the military sphere, PMCs complicate the idea of noncombatant immunity.         "
"6","Eckert's work is particularly noteworthy for her incorporation of a broad range of perspectives. Historical just war thinkers are invoked alongside contemporaries (including both Walzerians and revisionists); the fields of international law, political theory, and international relations are also represented. This strength is also the book's weakness: more careful attention to the differences between the various kinds of just war thinking—and international law—would have made Eckert's argument even richer. Nonetheless, the book makes a significant contribution to the ongoing debate over the applicability of traditional just war concepts to contemporary problems."
