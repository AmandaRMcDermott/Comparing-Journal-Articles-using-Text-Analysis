"1","When the United States perceives a threat to international security and calls on its allies for military assistance, how do they respond to such requests? A conventional view of alliances as instruments of control wielded by powerful states would suggest that secondary partners are likely to fall in step with U.S. plans or suffer the consequences of disappointing their patron superpower. Yet, since World War II, U.S. allies have pursued varying levels of military commitment in U.S.‐led wars—ranging from nonparticipation to full‐scale cooperation—without causing any apparent long‐term damage to their alliance relationships. To crack this puzzle, Stéfanie von Hlatky develops a neoclassical realist theory that elucidates how U.S. allies navigate between the Scylla of American expectations and the Charybdis of domestic constraints. She then evaluates this theory empirically through qualitative analyses of the United Kingdom's, Canada's, and Australia's initial responses to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq."
"2","Von Hlatky's theory rests on three claims. First, power asymmetries between the United States and its democratic allies can generate divergent assessments of international threats, where the former gauges developments in terms of its global ambitions while the latter prioritize more circumscribed sets of concerns. Second, when such disagreements arise, U.S. allies face strong reputational incentives to respond favorably to requests for military support, given the value of American protection. Third, their ability to respond favorably is significantly mitigated by two domestic‐level factors: the autonomy/cohesion of foreign policy decision makers and the availability/suitability of military capabilities. This argument generates three predictions: first, full‐scale participation in U.S.‐led wars is likely when allied states have both a highly autonomous/cohesive leadership and available military capabilities that satisfy U.S. operational needs; second, limited participation is likely when allied states have either a weak leadership with strong military capabilities or a strong leadership with weak military capabilities; and third, nonparticipation in likely when allied states have both a weak leadership and limited military capabilities."
"3","Von Hlatky's case analyses are well written and researched and offer general support for her theoretical predictions. In October 2001, at the outset of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, the United Kingdom had a strong leadership and available/suitable military capabilities, which translated into full participation. Alternatively, both Canada and Australia had similarly strong leadership but weak capabilities, which caused both allies to pursue only limited participation. In March 2003, at the outset of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the United Kingdom retained its strong military capabilities but now had a weak leadership. Contrary to Von Hlatky's expectations, though, the United Kingdom nevertheless pursued full participation. Canada also had a significantly weakened leadership by this point. In light of its still weak military capabilities, Canada opted for nonparticipation in Iraq. Australia, on the other hand, again pursued limited participation, given its strong leadership but weak capabilities. Thus, only the United Kingdom's response to the war in Iraq is inconsistent with Von Hlatky's expectations. She accounts for this anomaly by suggesting that Prime Minister Tony Blair was able to artificially boost his decision‐making autonomy by circumventing the normal policymaking process."
"4","On the whole, American Allies in Times of War makes a useful contribution to scholarship on military cooperation among democracies by examining how the lesser members of asymmetric alliances try to reconcile a dominant partner's expectations with their own domestic constraints. It also has the benefit of being timely. Now that the last British troops have been withdrawn from Afghanistan, readers looking to reflect on why and how they were first deployed there 13 years ago have a solid place to start.         "
