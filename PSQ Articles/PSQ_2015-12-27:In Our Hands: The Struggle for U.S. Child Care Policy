"1","Consistent access to high‐quality and affordable child care is an ongoing concern for many parents in the United States. Even those with sufficient economic resources still can be quite focused on finding and maintaining the best care for their child that is compatible with their family circumstances. Parents at the lower end of the economic scale frequently are faced with substantial challenges. When balancing quality and affordable child care with low‐wage work, these challenges can be overwhelming. Parents are not the only ones affected, of course. The quality of child care has a direct impact on the well‐being and development of the child."
"2","Despite this widespread need by numerous parents and their young children, there is currently little momentum in building robust systems of child care. Given the resonance of the issue to such a widespread constituency, it is quizzical that inertia continues. Why? What would it take to instigate an effort to address the limitations of child care? These are the questions Elizabeth Palley and Corey S. Shdaimah address by aiming to untangle the many reasons a cohesive national policy regarding child care has been elusive."
"3","The authors utilize evidence from several sources. They report data collected from qualitative interviews with policy stakeholders, examine legislative testimony, and provide substantial detail about the history of child care policies (for example, tax credits and deductions, the Child Care Development Block Grant, Head Start, the Family and Medical Leave Act). In one section, a contrast is made with other countries' national approaches to child care. While it is well known that many other Western industrialized nations have more extensive systems of child care, the specific examples provide a critical reminder and offer a sharp contrast to U.S. policies."
"4","Several relevant theoretical frameworks are offered to explain the lack of cohesive child care policy. Palley and Shdaimah briefly describe policy theories related to framing, interest groups, and social movements and adeptly apply them to the child care problem. Different advocacy groups frame the problem of child care in compelling but often competing ways (for example, child development versus women's rights versus support for welfare‐to‐work). Interests groups have their own agendas to address a narrow piece of the child care challenge. They do work in coalitions, but efforts are fragmented. Moreover, the lack of political standing of children and continuing social trends that question the role of government in addressing social need are key contextual barriers."
"5","The final chapter is titled “If We Have a Major Social Problem, Why Is There No Movement for Change?” Throughout the book, the authors amply document a major social problem and in several sections also address the “why.” This final chapter moves toward identifying strategies for change; these include using facts to create public awareness, offering comparisons across jurisdictions, creating a sense of outrage regarding the lack of attention to the needs of children, and creating a vision of child care solutions. The strategies are not unique to the problem of adequate child care, and clearly a combination of strategies is warranted. In the end, the authors are clear that incremental change in policy is not sufficient. The argument of the book culminates in its concluding sentence: “We need a revolution” (p. 220)."
"6","Overall, the book makes a scholarly contribution with its comprehensive approach and rich detail regarding the history and current status of child care policy. Use of policy theories, furthermore, contributes to our understanding of policymaking more broadly."
