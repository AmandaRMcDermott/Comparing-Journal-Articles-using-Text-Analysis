"1","This book lacks subtlety and nuance. But, to a large degree, that is its author's ultimate point. For Glenn Feldman, the origins of modern American conservatism cannot be found in the complicated and ever‐changing landscape of suburbanization and morphing Sunbelt identities. It did not come about as the result of Texans’ or midwesterners’ migration to California and the West (or the religious sensibilities that came with them), and it was not the consequence of a fusion among various regional cultures and priorities. No, for Feldman, understanding the origins of Republican power—both nationally and in the South—comes down to one central motive: an unmitigated dedication to preserving white supremacy."
"2","Boiling all other factors down to what he calls “Sophistic Pruning” (p. 5), Feldman presents an aggressive, confrontational, and unequivocating history of the politics of white supremacy in the Deep South from Reconstruction through the early 1950s. He is particularly interested in connecting dots between southern hostility to the “New Deal's racial liberalism” and the Dixiecrat revolt of 1948, which Feldman argues was the moment—if such a moment can be identified—when southern conservatives ceased to identify themselves with the national Democratic Party and began to embrace the idea of partisan realignment. In Feldman's view, once white southerners began to embrace the idea of Republican rule at this moment, they never stopped. Pushing that argument even further, Feldman sees southern white supremacy as the core principle behind national conservative Republican growth, interpreting this facet of modern American politics as one of linear continuity stretching from Strom Thurmond to Ronald Reagan and beyond.         "
"3","More than 20 years since the brilliant, pathbreaking work of Alan Brinkley and Dan T. Carter, Feldman's book is part of a tidal wave of scholarship on the origins and nature of modern American conservatism that keeps flowing, seemingly without end. Within that wave, historians continue to explore new (and re‐explore old) inroads, hoping to say something fresh about the evolution of modern American politics, the transformations of the Right, and what almost everyone seems to recognize as the modern Republican Party's greatest moment of triumph, the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in 1980. Feldman's book is an effort to engage that conversation by repositioning modern American conservatism as centrally southern and racial in origin. Although he usually confines specific names to his endnotes, Feldman is taking on scholars such as Donald Critchlow, Lisa McGirr, and others who have argued for a nonlinear conservative ascendancy with multifaceted and multiregional roots. Critiquing what he calls the “almost‐occult worship of nuance” (p. 302), Feldman sees a history that is primarily black and white. White southerners, somewhat monolithically, he argues, despised FDR and the New Deal because they saw it as an attack against white supremacy. By 1944, white supremacists came close to a full revolt, and in 1948, these conservatives were no longer willing to support national Democrats."
"4","His argument is forceful, and his writing is nothing if not energetic. But for someone like myself, who prefers to see the complications of history as evidence of complication, Feldman's arguments are not so much unconvincing as they are overextended. Despite the fact that many, like myself, will disagree with the way Feldman dismisses scholarship that understands postwar political changes within a context of complexity and nuance, there can be no question that a book like this is good for the historiography. Historians should always be wary of consensus, and Feldman has, with this book, made an important contribution that will support ongoing momentum for the study of the geographic and ideological origins of modern American conservatism during the second half of the twentieth century."
