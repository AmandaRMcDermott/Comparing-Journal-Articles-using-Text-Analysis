"1","The underrepresentation of women in American politics at both the state and national levels has been addressed by many scholars. Through this research, we know that women govern differently and tend to have different policy priorities than their male counterparts. In this extraordinarily researched work, Women in Politics in the American City, Mirya R. Holman extends this line of inquiry to American city politics.         "
"2","Holman employs rich survey, interview, and textual data to help us understand the ways in which female leaders at the local level make a difference in urban politics. She sets the stage for her analysis by describing the claims that are commonly made related to the limits of mayoral power. For example, local leaders must always keep in mind that citizens have the power to exit, taking their tax dollars with them. In addition, because urban governments lack money, they must often partner with the private sector to advance common goals. These partnerships, however, restrict the ability of local officials to pursue many other priorities of interest. Indeed, if an elected official tries to pursue policies that do not have broad and deep levels of support, he or she will likely fail, which will inhibit the mayor's capacity to obtain other agenda items needed by the city. Finally, Holman notes that women, because they are residentially dispersed without monolithic interests, are difficult to represent as a unified group. Overall, then, all of these factors work against elected officials' ability to pursue issues that are critical to women's well‐being at the city level."
"3","To understand whether these claims operate at all times, Holman first defines policies that address children, education, affordable housing, social welfare, and domestic violence as a particularly important set of women's urban issues. These issues often stand in contrast to economic development issues that also attract local attention. Interestingly, she notes that male and female leaders both prioritize economic development issues over women's issues. However, female leaders feel a responsibility to represent a broader segment of the community, including establishing linkages between their offices and those groups that serve the interests of women."
"4","Holman also notes that the process of governance is distinct for female leaders versus male leaders. At city council meetings, issues of importance to women are discussed more frequently in localities with female mayors. Female‐headed cities also pass more domestic and sexual violence legislation than cities led by men. In addition, public participation is much more expansive in cities led by women. This participation extends not only to activities around women's issues but also to more general issues. Perhaps most importantly, community members feel as if they are much more involved in the governance process—that they are being heard by their elected leaders—when women rather than men are mayors. In other words, groups with very diverse interests sense that they are represented more adequately by female leaders than by male leaders."
"5","This book impressively speaks to an important issue in political science with both methodological rigor and a clear‐cut analytical framework. At the city level, many scholars would argue that anyone representing women's issues or any other type of issue besides economic development would be hard‐pressed to make an impact on policy. Holman demonstrates that this is not the case and that women's issues can and should receive a local government's attention. In other words, Holman shows us directly that women can make a positive difference in local politics."
