"1","This is the most‐comprehensive biography to date of a woman who is widely known yet remains, according to the author, insufficiently understood: “Held up as a national heroine but stripped of her lifelong history of activism and anger at American injustice” (p. ix). By refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger, Rosa Parks sparked an historic 381‐day bus boycott by black residents of Montgomery, Alabama. There had been many previous black protests against the Southern system of white supremacy, and even similar acts of defiance against bus segregation in Montgomery and elsewhere, but Parks's refusal inspired a decade of escalating mass protests culminating in the passage of landmark civil rights legislation. Although somewhat less famous than Martin Luther King, Jr., Parks made possible King's rapid rise to international prominence. Upon her death in 2005, Parks received bipartisan accolades at a seven‐hour televised funeral, where the eulogists included former President Bill Clinton and future presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and President George W. Bush later signed legislation honoring Parks with a permanent statue in the U. S. Capitol."
"2","Although Parks's considerable historical significance is hardly in doubt, Jeanne Theoharis laments that the only serious book‐length accounts of Parks's life are “Douglas Brinkley's pocket‐sized, unfootnoted biography” and the “young‐adult‐focused autobiography” Parks wrote with Jim Haskins (p. xi). The Rebellious Life seeks to replace “a gendered caricature of a quiet NAACP secretary who kept her seat on the bus” with a detailed portrait of Parks's “lifetime of progressive politics and the resolute political sensibility that identified Malcolm X as her personal hero” (p. xiii). Theoharis recognizes the difficulty of writing a “new history of Rosa Parks” (p. 247) without access to Parks or most of her papers, which are tied up in a legal dispute, and she admits that “Parks often covered up the radicalism of her beliefs and her actions” (p. 11). The Rebellious Life therefore relies mainly on the multitude of interviews that Parks granted during her lifetime.         "
"3","Although this will probably be the definitive biography of Parks for some years to come, Theoharis may have overstated the newness of her findings regarding her subject's early activism. She largely reflects the portraits of Brinkley and Haskins (she cites the former more than two dozen times and the latter more than sixty times in her ample notes for the pre‐1957 period). Theoharis's account of Parks's involvement, through her husband Raymond, in the controversial Scottsboro rape case of the 1930s, her subsequent long association with the Montgomery NAACP branch, and her visit to the controversial Highlander Folk School mainly confirm Brinkley's work and the autobiography. Although the tired seamstress myth certainly persists, it is thankfully not evident in historical scholarship or most textbooks published during the past two decades."
"4","Theoharis has made a more‐original contribution to our understanding of Parks's life after the successful conclusion of the bus boycott. Rather than being acknowledged as a skilled and experienced activist, Parks found it difficult to find a paid position in the movement after being fired from her job. After moving to Detroit, she and her husband struggled economically until 1965, when newly elected Congressman John Conyers hired her to work in his Detroit office. Theoharis relates that this position enabled Parks to blossom as a political activist, painting her as militant and even radical—eager to identify with progressive causes, attend Black Power gatherings, and participate in the campaign against South African apartheid. Parks clearly warrants greater attention to her life of activism rather than to a single heroic act, but The Rebellious Life also suggests that she was indeed a reserved activist reluctant to reveal the political ideas that motivated her.
