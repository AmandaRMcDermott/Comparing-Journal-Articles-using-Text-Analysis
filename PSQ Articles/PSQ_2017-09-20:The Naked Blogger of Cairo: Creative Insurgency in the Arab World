"1","As heroic as the Arab Spring protestors were, their hopes for liberation gave way to intensified state repression, repackaged authoritarianism, and horrific wars. Marwan Kraidy, the Anthony Shadid Chair of Global Media, Politics, and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania, invites us to revisit those heady days, not for nostalgic purposes but to recognize the raw, sometimes self‐sacrificial inventiveness that Arabs marshal to challenge entrenched rulers. The Naked Blogger of Cairo draws attention to the “creative insurgency” that animated and still defines dissent in Arab political life.         "
"2","Kraidy enlivens this much‐narrated story of desperate, bottom‐up resistance by locating rebellious creativity in humanity's most basic instrument of communication. The body is more than the biological complex of organic matter that composes our anatomical casing. Critical social theorists have examined the many ways power actualizes and is visible on our physical selves. It is not all domination. Bodies are vital instruments of expression when other avenues of voice are foreclosed. Kraidy writes, “freedom is enfleshed in humans” and “concretized through practice” (p. 131)."
"3","Arab rebels practice a type of corporeal disobedience by lighting themselves aflame, hunger striking, standing in the way of state officers, and occupying public spaces such as Tahrir Square. In doing so, they assert a self‐freedom that delegitimizes bankrupt authorities that overregulate and trespass upon citizens’ personhood."
"4","How defiance through the body undermines Arab political formations gestures to Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes imagined commonwealths as masses of individuals associating to escape the brutal state of nature. Their formal incorporation into a state was a virtual, giant, mechanistic being: the Leviathan. The national sovereign protects this body politic in exchange for absolute loyalty—the same trade‐off of Arab autocrats. When Arab publics reclaim ownership of their bodies to protest, they, as Kraidy writes, “relocate sovereignty from the despot's person to the people” (p. 92). They withdraw from the Leviathan."
"5","Direct action is not the only means of bodily dissent. People diminish the revered “classical body” of a tyrant through humorous insults. These are amusing: the popular circulation of imagery depicting Mubarak as the Laughing Cow, a cheese spread logo. A Syrian finger puppet show caricaturizing president Bashar al‐Assad. A digital video series that “infantilized” Tunisian dictator Zinelabidine Ben Ali (p. 215). Lampooning erodes the grandiosity of national father figures, encouraging later protest."
"6","In three contrasting cases, Kraidy examines how female bodies bear symbolic potency in Egypt's “revolutionary struggle” (p. 158). The book's eponymous blogger posted nude photos online to protest restrictive norms and double standards with sexuality. Photographs of the “Blue Bra Girl” having her shirt ripped off by officers during a protest provoked backlash. The government subjected the “Dutiful Daughter” to a humiliating virginity test; she launched a campaign against the practice. They all elicited national debate."
"7","In this book, Kraidy furthers his interest in identifying expressive political activity in underappreciated forms. His Reality Television and Arab Politics: Contention in Public Life presented the disputatious public debates around entertainment programs.         "
"8","The Naked Blogger of Cairo is an engaging, accessible read driven by richly described characters and cases. Still, it is theoretically grounded. The focus on bodily communication in Arab protest gets readers to appreciate the variegated layers of Arab politics. It is a welcome supplement to the many writings on the Middle East's religionist militancy, conflict, and geopolitical intrigue that take no interest in the vibrant currents of popular political life.
