"1","THE WAR OVER WAR POWERS began soon after the ratification of the Constitution and shows little sign of resolution. Legislative and executive supremacists argue about who can initiate hostilities and what should happen after the initiation of hostilities. Legislative supremacists claim that presidents have usurped congressional power, while executive supremacists claim that presidents merely assert their formal powers when they initiate operations unilaterally. Each side marshals an impressive array of historical facts, eighteenth‐century definitions, choice quotes from the Framers, judicial decisions, and selected constitutional clauses to argue its case. Each school claims to have the definitive reading of the distribution of powers.         "
"2","The president and Congress have battled over these questions alongside scholars. Since World War II, presidents have regularly asserted their ability to initiate hostilities unilaterally, often citing international agreements or United Nations (UN) Security Council resolutions to support their actions. When called upon, the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) provides a more thorough constitutional justification. Meanwhile, legislative supremacists and members of Congress claim the legislature must initiate the use of force without producing arguments or asserting powers that restrain presidents."
"3","By the time the Ronald Reagan administration started developing the theory of the “unitary executive,” Congress had already ceded a great deal of its war powers.1 The events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent fear of another attack provided the opportunity to develop the most thorough justification for unilateral executive action, as articulated by John Yoo.2 Yoo served as the deputy assistant U.S. attorney general in the OLC under President George W. Bush, making it no surprise that during Bush's presidency, the unilateral exercise of power arguably reached a peak. While there are few politicians and scholars who present similar views,3 it is surprising to find that during the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations, the OLC produced arguments echoing Yoo's to justify circumventing congressional control over military actions. What explains the consistently expansive definition of executive power in these administrations?         "
"4","In contrast to the contemporary gulf between the two sides of the argument, the early debates over war powers demonstrate a healthy struggle facilitated by the ambiguity of the constitutional text. The current debate denies the concept articulated most effectively by Edward S. Corwin: the Constitution is “an invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign policy.”4 Currently, the system lacks serious disagreements that allow the political branches to exercise their powers without encroaching on the other. This article will use the examples of the OLC's justifications for operations in Bosnia and Libya to demonstrate the problem.         "
"5","Divisions over the nature of constitutional war powers emerged soon after ratification. Previously allies, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison present fundamentally different interpretations. While Hamilton views war powers as executive by nature, split between the legislature and the president, Madison claims that the initiation of hostilities is a deliberative power, making it legislative by nature. This dialogue demonstrates the lack of definitive answers about constitutional questions even among those who participated in the creation of the document. This provides a third “Corwinian” dialogue among the political branches that is often ignored by current legal scholarship."
"6","Hamilton, who favors the most expansive executive‐centered definition of powers, presents the ability to respond to emergencies as inherent in the Constitution.5 He cites the vesting clause, claiming that the “EXECUTIVE POWER of the Nation is vested in the President; subject only to the exceptions and qu[a]lifications which are expressed in the instrument.” Based on Hamilton's reading, there is a “more comprehensive grant contained in the general clause.” Presidents have all of this power save a few pieces given to Congress. Hamilton argues that presidents must possess a “right of Judgment” when deciding “whether the Nation be under obligations to make War or not.”6 Presidents therefore can have a seat at the table when determining whether to initiate hostilities, as long as they do not encroach on Congress's power to declare war. In Hamilton's lengthy speech during the Constitutional Convention, he strikes a balanced view of executive power, saying that the president should have “power and independence” but must be “sufficiently controuled, to answer the purpose of the institution at home.”7"
"7","While the president has a duty to “preserve Peace until war is declared,” he also has some discretion about threats to national security. The powers of the government have to be equal to the ends of government, and self‐preservation is an end of government; therefore, the federal government must have the constitutional power to do what is necessary to preserve the state. The executive is the natural home for responding to threats because, unlike the legislative branch, which is slow and deliberative by nature, presidents have the capacity to apply “energy” and “dispatch” to their actions.8"
"8","These views and others created an opening for executive supremacists to manipulate Hamilton's words to provide evidence for their perspective. They have broadened his meaning and cited him selectively.9 Their reading of Hamilton has helped modern presidential administrations reinforce the legitimacy of their claim to expansive unilateral powers.10"
"9","Unlike Hamilton, who sees a certain continuity between British prerogative and the American president, Madison understands the powers of war and peace as deliberative by nature.11 Madison states that “our reason and constitution” provide surer guidance than theories of the separation of powers espoused by “the most received jurists” because they wrote “with their eyes too much on monarchical governments, where all powers are confounded in the sovereignty of the prince.”         "
"10","These “received jurists” placed war powers in the hands of monarchs, as the head of state must have the sovereign power. They did not benefit from these subjects being “illuminated by the events and discussions which distinguish the very recent period.” According to Madison, therefore, the powers over war and peace belong to the legislature, and men such as John Locke and Montesquieu did not properly understand.12 Madison goes even further, however, linking the power to initiate war with the power to judge whether war should be declared.13 He denied the president any share in the power to judge.14"
"11","According to Madison, the American Constitution represents a decided break with the British model. While Madison does suggest changing Congress's power from “make” to “declare” war in order to allow the president to repel sudden attacks, in his view, the president is otherwise subservient to the legislature. The Constitution empowers the president to execute laws once they are created and does not empower him to interpret them.15"
"12","This early debate between two previously close allies demonstrates the Corwinian view of the Constitution: it “creates an invitation to struggle.”16 We see here, as Gordon Wood describes, that there is no “‘correct’ or more ‘true’” understanding of the Constitution, even at the founding.17 When looking to this period for clues and sifting through quotes, court cases, and the text itself, it is clear, as Jack Rakove notes, that “[w]here we look for precise answers, the framers and ratifiers were still struggling with complex and novel questions.”18 Understanding the Constitution as providing ambiguous and ambivalent answers in this realm more accurately reflects the diversity of opinions and precedent over the course of U.S. history.         "
"13","Understanding the Constitution as an “invitation to struggle” has fallen by the wayside as divisions have broadened and calcified. Executive supremacists assert a capacious definition of presidential power. According to Yoo's account, the president has the authority to act so long as he does not encroach on Congress's power to declare war. In Yoo's reading of the vesting clause and historical accounts of that power, the ability to repel sudden attacks becomes a grant to initiate and conduct hostilities short of “total war” without explicit or implicit congressional sanction.19"
"14","In Yoo's opinion, Congress does not have the power to initiate hostilities unilaterally. For example, if Congress wants to “engage in war with France,” it could go so far as to “declare war against France, [but] the president could still prevent hostilities from breaking out simply by refusing to order the armed forces to attack.”20 Congress's power is intended to “make known the state of international legal relations between the United States and other nations.”21 This puts the nation in a state of “total war,” allowing the federal government to expand its powers.22 Giving Congress the power to “declare war,” Yoo says, “prevented the President from unilaterally igniting a total war, yet simultaneously barred Congress from encroaching on his exclusive authority to conduct hostilities short of that.”23"
"15","On the other side of the debate are legislative supremacists, who endlessly critique executives for usurping congressional powers. Legal scholars ground their reading in the constitutional text, select words from select Framers, implied powers, inherent powers, historical records, and judicial decisions in order to determine the scope of presidential action during a crisis.24 They say that presidents have illegally cut Congress out of the conversation about military affairs. They generally provide prescriptive arguments, seeking to persuade members of each branch to fundamentally change their interaction.         "
"16","Some take an especially hard line. David Gray Adler claims that “[t]he framers did not give the president the right to intervene in foreign wars or to choose between war and peace”; moreover, “[n]o delegate to the convention ever suggested that ‘executive power’ is a ‘fountainhead of power to make war.’”25 Louis Henkin says that the president's foreign affairs power “was in effect a derogation from Congressional power, eked out slowly, reluctantly, and not without limitations and safeguards.”26"
"17","Louis Fisher presents a more Hamiltonian view, saying that the Founders looked to thinkers such as John Locke and William Blackstone, who presented executive prerogative as “nearly related to, and plainly derived from, that other of making war.”27 Fisher says that “[t]hese models of executive power were well known to the framers . . . [h]owever when they declared their independence from England, they vested all executive powers in the Continental Congress.” This gave the body “[t]he power over perfect and imperfect war.” Despite accepting war powers as executive in nature, Fisher claims these powers “would remain with the U.S. Congress.”28 His seminal work Presidential War Power shows how presidents, especially since World War II, have gradually usurped congressional powers over war making.         "
"18","Brien Hallett follows Fisher to a certain extent, saying that the decision to divide “the king's divine right power was unprecedented.” The Founders hoped to diminish the likelihood that “a powerful individual would . . . decide when, or if, the people's blood would be shed,” placing that power in a “representative body” instead.29 Hallett diverges from other legislative supremacists, however, by blaming congressional inaction rather than executive overreach. He says “[t]he president has not deprived” Congress of its power to declare war; instead, “congressional incapacity . . . has deprived” the country of “a republican division of the sovereign war powers.”30"
"19","These two sides of the argument do not struggle with one another as Hamilton and Madison did. Instead, presidents follow Yoo by acting unilaterally and producing constitutional arguments to support those actions. Congress allows it, and legislative supremacists critique it. Therefore, there is no dialogue within the literature or between the branches. Both groups have overlooked the “invitation to struggle” created by the Constitution, opting instead to claim they have found the definitive reading of the Constitution. This problem will come to the fore by examining the military actions in Bosnia and Libya under Presidents Clinton and Obama, respectively.         "
"20","After the dissolution of Yugoslavia, ethnic tensions caused a brutal civil war in Bosnia, impelling the UN and NATO to intervene. While the American people expressed lukewarm support for intervention, the United States helped NATO enforce a no‐fly zone in 1993, established by UN Resolutions 781, 786, and 816.31 By February 1994, U.S. forces had shot down Serbian bombers, and Clinton reported to Congress that his “constitutional authority” provided him with all of the legal ground necessary to initiate combat. More airstrikes occurred in April and August, continuing through 1995. This caused increasing tension between the political branches, with Congress calling on Clinton to recognize its war powers.         "
"21","Importantly, Congress never provided explicit statutory authorization for military action and failed to provide the president with a clear statement of its opinion.32 In 1992, the Senate passed Resolution 770 stating that the military should not be introduced without clear objectives. In 1994, the Senate called on the United States to end the arms embargo and claimed that Congress should authorize ground troops prior to their deployment.33 The House did not act on either measure.34 In an effort to clarify executive–legislative relations with regard to peacekeeping activities, Senator Bob Dole introduced the Peace Powers Act in 1994 and another bill of the same name in 1995 to clarify the War Powers Resolution. Both bills died in the Senate.35"
"22","The 1994 Defense Appropriations Act included a section stating that “none of the funds appropriated” should be used for the “United States Armed Forces to participate in the implementation of a peace settlement in Bosnia‐Herzegovina.”36 And yet, during this time, American planes engaged in “pinprick” strikes against Serbian targets in Bosnia, giving Congress more than enough time to oppose or support the actions (Republicans had an even greater incentive to weigh in after they took control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections).         "
"23","By December 1995, the Dayton Peace Agreement had facilitated a much larger deployment in service of maintaining a hard‐won peace. Subsequently, the United States introduced approximately 20,000 troops to support NATO's command of the UN Protection Force. Even at this stage, the House and Senate voted on a variety of bills but failed to produce a clear message supporting or opposing military action.37"
"24","Meanwhile, instead of courting Congress, Clinton consistently asserted his power “to conduct U.S. foreign relations” and his power “as Commander in Chief.”38 He also said as much to the press. When asked by a reporter whether he would deploy troops without congressional approval, Clinton said, “I am not going to lay down any of my constitutional prerogatives here today.”39 Clinton's OLC supported this assertion.         "
"25","The OLC provided a great deal of background information to demonstrate the long‐standing commitment of U.S. forces to NATO and UN missions in Bosnia. The OLC stated clearly that “[t]he President has determined that, without this substantial contingent of United States troops, the NATO force is unlikely to be able to prevent renewed fighting in Bosnia.”40 If the peace agreement were to fail, it would “injure America's national interests,” plunge European countries into “violence and atrocities of the sort not seen in Europe since the end of the Second World War,” damage the credibility of the UN Security Council, and diminish the effectiveness of its peacekeeping mission.41"
"26","According to the OLC, the president had the authority to act unilaterally because “[the] power to deploy troops abroad . . . is the most clearly established exercise of the President's general power as a matter of historical practice.” Here we see the OLC looking back over 40 years of bipartisan precedent to support Clinton's action in Bosnia. From using “the Navy to ‘open up’ Japan, and President Johnson's introduction of the armed forces into the Dominican Republic in 1965,” the OLC demonstrated a consistency that has important implications: presidents and their lawyers have developed the institutional habit of initiating hostilities unilaterally.42 This, in turn, provides precedent for future presidents looking to do the same. The OLC went on to mention a variety of other instances in which presidents had deployed troops, claiming the “proposed deployment to Bosnia . . . is no innovation.”43"
"27","This mission supported a peace signed by the warring parties. “[T]he operation does not aim at the conquest or occupation of territory” or regime change. Based on these factors, “it is not likely that the United States will find itself involved in extensive or sustained hostilities.”44 Therefore, it did not amount to “war” as understood by the Constitution, and Clinton did not encroach on congressional powers. Moreover, according to the OLC, the War Powers Resolution actually reinforced this interpretation by giving the president the ability to initiate hostilities without prior congressional approval within a certain window.         "
"28","This interpretation obfuscates an important requirement of the War Powers Resolution: there must be “imminent” hostilities necessitating immediate presidential action. Instead, the OLC's argument about the constitutional meaning of “war” echoes Yoo's argument presented earlier.45 Moreover, Yoo presents a very similar reading of Clinton's action in his work. He says that Clinton did not require authorization to “send the air force into combat in Bosnia or Kosovo, because his commander‐in‐chief and executive powers already gave him sufficient constitutional powers to do so.”46"
"29","It is important to note, as Jack Goldsmith does, that the Clinton administration's OLC provided “more cautious” presentations of “aggressive military powers” than George W. Bush's OLC and focused on “humanitarian rather than security ends.” “[T]hese differences,” however, “do not mask” the underlying objective of the executive branch's legal counsel. In Goldsmith's opinion, “the Clinton lawyers—like all OLC lawyers and Attorneys General over many decades—were driven by the outlook and exigencies of the presidency to assert more robust presidential powers.” This drive pushed the OLC to go beyond the limits “officially approved by the Supreme Court” or “generally accepted in the legal academy” and “Congress.”47 There is an institutional drive best summed up by Miles's law: “where you stand depends on where you sit.”48"
"30","The reaction to this argument from legislative supremacists is predictably remonstrative. Adler suggests that Clinton's rhetoric would allow our “allies such as England and France to replace Congress . . . in matters of war and peace.” In his article, he claims it is not logical that “extra‐constitutional bodies” have the power to “direct or replace creatures of the Constitution.”49 Fisher complains that “Clinton continued to avoid any suggestion that he needed authorization from Congress.”50 Ryan Hendrickson starts out hopeful, saying that “a number of conditions existed that appeared conducive to a reassertion of congressional powers,” only to see that in the end “congressional deference remained the rule.”51 The “invitation to struggle” did not reappear after the end of the Cold War; executives continued to assert unilateral power, and Congress continues to allow them to do so. This disconnect becomes even more evident in the Obama administration.         "
"31","In the spring of 2011, popular uprisings plagued many leaders in North Africa and the Middle East. In Libya, Muammar el‐Qaddafi cracked down violently in a desperate attempt to maintain control. The UN condemned his actions, as did the African Union and the Council of the League of Arab States. As the situation escalated, the UN Security Council authorized the creation of a no‐fly zone and the use of military force to protect civilians with the hope of eventually overthrowing Qaddafi.52"
"32","On 21 March 2011, Obama sent a letter to Congress informing it of the initiation of “military operations against Libya.” The president determined he had to act to “prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and address the threat posed to international peace and security by the crisis in Libya.” In the letter, Obama linked Libyan instability to instability in the region and claimed it had “dangerous consequences to the national security interests of the United States.” He cited UN Security Council Resolution 1973 as authorization and his powers as “Commander in Chief and Chief Executive” to “conduct U.S. foreign relations.” He assured Congress that the actions would “be limited in their nature, duration, and scope” with a “rapid, but responsible” transition to other “organizations.”53"
"33","After several weeks, however, the operation in Libya grew in scope and objective. While the administration initially denied any collaboration with rebels, in April, Obama authorized “the use of armed Predator drones against Qaddafi forces,” bombing of Qaddafi's residential and military complexes in Tripoli, and the release of $30 billion of frozen Libyan assets to the rebels.54 In May, the New York Times quoted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as saying, “Clearly on our agenda is looking for the most effective way to deliver financial assets and other means of supporting and helping” the opposition.55 The administration provided $25 million in nonlethal military support and $66 million in humanitarian aid and asked Congress to release previously frozen Libyan assets to help the people.56"
"34","By June, the administration had passed the 60‐day War Powers Resolution clock, which caused many to demand a drawdown or congressional authorization if the operation had to continue. The House of Representatives passed House Resolution 292, asking the president to give it the national security justification for continued actions in Libya as well as an explanation for why he had not sought congressional authorization throughout the operation. Rand Paul openly claimed that President Obama had overstepped his constitutional powers, calling on him to obtain legislative approval.57 Representative Dennis Kucinich went even further, presenting a resolution calling for the removal of all American forces from Libya. This congressional initiative failed by a vote of 148–265.58 When this did not work, Kucinich and a few other members of Congress tried to bring the matter to the courts. As in most other instances, the courts opposed mediating these squabbles and claimed it did not have standing.59"
"35","The House and Senate could not come to an agreement. While the House “delivered a symbolic rebuke by voting 295–123 against a measure” to give Obama authorization, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution to authorize American involvement in Libya for up to a year.60 In one of the few successful measures, Speaker of the House John Boehner called on Obama to provide a report to Congress regarding several elements of the operation.61"
"36","In response, the administration presented vague national security concerns, similar to those in the 21 March letter, only adding that U.S. actions would demonstrate to “the people of the Middle East and North Africa that America stands with them at a time of momentous transition” as well as insisting on the necessity of American participation because of its unique military capability.62 After establishing that the transitional government had no known links to extremist groups, the administration completed its explanation of the link between national security and U.S. actions in Libya.         "
"37","Obama reiterated this position to the press. When answering questions about Congress's assertion of their constitutional powers, he said, “We have engaged in a limited operation to help a lot of people against one of the worst tyrants in the world . . . [a]nd this suddenly becomes the cause célèbre for some folks in Congress? Come on.” He added, “[a] lot of this fuss is politics.”63 These actions and their justification echo the capacious definition of executive power presented by Yoo.         "
"38","The OLC deepened and strengthened the legal claim. It stated that Obama had the authority as long as he did so to protect national interests and provided that Congress had not “specifically restricted” him from acting.64 The OLC went on to say that presidents had used military force throughout history without prior congressional approval, claiming that “historical practice is an important indication of constitutional meaning.”65 Once again, the OLC argued that the president cannot use force in “an engagement that constitutes a ‘war’ within the meaning of the Declaration of War Clause,” and the operation in Libya fell short of war.66"
"39","Wars for the OLC must be “prolonged” and involve “substantial military engagements, typically involving exposure of U.S. military personnel to significant risk over a substantial period.” Moreover, the OLC argued, the War Powers Resolution echoed this sentiment in providing the president with the capacity to use force in “limited engagements,” ignoring the section regarding imminent threat, just as Clinton's OLC did.67"
"40","According to the OLC's reading, this allowance demonstrates that “Congressional authorization [is] most critical for ‘major, prolonged conflicts,’ such as the wars in Vietnam and Korea.”68 Using the precedent provided by actions in Haiti and Bosnia, the OLC concluded that it is necessary to have “at least two national interests” at stake. In this instance, “regional stability” and “the UNSC's credibility” justified unilateral presidential use of force.69 Much like Clinton's OLC, this reading of precedent, the War Powers Resolution, and executive power echoes Yoo and stands in opposition to the views of legislative supremacists.         "
"41","Many scholars saw significant flaws in Obama's actions and reasoning on Libya, blaming Congress,70 the president,71 or a flawed reading of the Constitution.72 As Chris Edelson writes, “Congress had not authorized the use of military force and Libya had neither attacked nor threatened an attack against the United States or U.S. forces.”73 Hendrickson notes that there was an opportunity for Congress to assert itself, but it decided “to follow Obama's lead and avoided questions surrounding the constitutionality of the president's conduct.” He concludes that Obama continued the practice of previous presidents, asserting “wide constitutional powers as Commander in Chief.”74 Fisher looks back to Obama's view as a candidate, saying with dismay that “[h]e abandoned the legal principles he had articulated . . . and decided to follow the unconstitutional precedents established by Truman in Korea and Clinton in Bosnia, Haiti, and Kosovo.”75"
"42","These authors, and many more, consistently point toward the need to have more congressional involvement in the decision to initiate hostilities. This leads back to the central question of this article: if legislative supremacists are correct and executive supremacists are wrong, why have presidents successfully presented a broad reading of presidential power without serious legal or political repercussions?"
"43","Selective reading of the Founders, the ratification debates, and judicial decisions leads many scholars, such as Adler, Edelson, Fisher, and Hendrickson, to see presidents as regularly and abusively overstepping their constitutional bounds. The history of U.S. military engagements reads like a laundry list of executive overreach."
"44","Conversely, cherry‐picking other documents and cases leads Yoo to the opposite conclusion. He claims that “the common understanding of war powers did not require the executive to receive formal legislative approval to commence hostilities.”76 Administrations have consistently followed this logic. This precedent provided the OLC with the tools needed to state that Obama had an accurate understanding of his “constitutional authority” and the “‘historical gloss’ place[d] on the Constitution by two centuries of practice.”77 On both sides of the argument, there is an underlying assumption that they have presented the understanding of the Constitution. This fails to account for two important elements: ambiguity and politics.         "
"45","As U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson notes, “a judge, like an executive adviser, may be surprised at the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power as they actually present themselves.”78 Moreover, as Mariah Zeisberg points out, “[t]he Constitution . . . fails to provide for one authoritative institution to settle this controversy” and the judiciary itself “has chosen to limit its scrutiny of ‘political questions’ like the nature of constitutionally authoritative procedures for going to war.”79 This gives the political branches the opportunity to battle over war powers without a judicial umpire (for the most part). Despite this fact, there are also elements of their powers that compel action on the part of the other branch. As Corwin notes, “[w]here—how—is a line to be drawn between these logical incompatibles? The answer seems to be, “that depends.”80 The result is a lack of fixed rules giving the “political process” more control over policy than the text of the Constitution.81"
"46","In the realm of foreign affairs, presidents benefit from having as much agency as possible, and it is in their interest to use formal powers to justify their authority.82 Getting congressional consent before or after the fact typically involves the expenditure of precious political capital as well as the very real possibility that the body as a whole will not provide the sought‐after authorization. Presidents have the advantage here because they and their legal teams usually have the opportunity to shape the debate. When it comes to “foreign relations and war powers . . . this first word is often the last word.”83 By consistently acting before getting congressional approval, presidents have developed “institutional routines and individual habits” that provide them with a broad scope for unilateral action.84 Armed with these facts, a plausible reading of the Constitution, a great deal of legal precedent, and an increasingly docile Congress, it is perfectly understandable that presidents do not often seek authorization before engaging in limited hostilities.         "
"47","Presidents consistently use constitutional language to achieve the political objectives they have. For example, Obama wanted to aid NATO allies and oust Qaddafi. It took longer than expected, and he needed to find a way around the restrictions created by the War Powers Resolution. The OLC's argument did not provide a sufficiently unilateral reading of the Constitution, so Obama turned to Harold Koh, a legal adviser in the State Department and arguably the embodiment of Miles's law.85 As Koh explained to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the air strikes in Libya were not hostilities and therefore did not even fall under the umbrella of the War Powers Resolution. The actions in Libya were not hostilities for several reasons. First, the actions were “virtually unique” in their limited scope because of the “constrained and supporting role” the United States played; second, members of the armed forces faced very little danger; third, there was limited risk of escalation; and fourth, “we are using limited military means, not the kind of full military engagements with which the War Powers Resolution is primarily concerned.”86"
"48","Koh's understanding took presidential power one step further than the OLC's Yooian argument. Here congressional oversight only applied to the initiation of military actions above an executive defined threshold. Insofar as the OLC recognized that there were hostilities and did not dispute the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution, it implicitly accepted some level of congressional oversight in longer and larger engagements. Koh's argument calls into question whether Congress has any constitutional authority to control presidential actions unless presidents deems their approval necessary.         "
"49","In turn, Congress does not stop presidents from engaging in these actions because doing so goes against legislators’ political interests. If an action leads to a loss of American life or if there is mission creep, legislators do not want the responsibility associated with voting to approve the engagement. When war becomes unpopular, so do the legislators who supported it. This reality leads to a lot of posturing on their part. As discussed earlier, in both instances, Congress tried to both support and oppose the president's actions. In both instances, Congress attempted to demand that the president seek its approval. In each case, he did not receive or court it. While Congress occasionally asks the court to weigh in and support its request for power, the courts are rarely interested in getting involved in these situations. In both instances, the courts did not weigh in, claiming that they lacked standing.87"
"50","The public, in turn, does not meaningfully punish presidents for unilaterally initiating small‐scale military actions, as we see in the positive reaction to the assassination of Osama bin Laden.88 The public punishes military failure.89 In the case of Bosnia, support rose when researchers asked about contributing troops after they signed a peace agreement and fell without it. The desire to intervene also rose when the United States would be part of a multinational UN‐led effort.90 As the engagement continued, approval increased, although an indeterminate end date caused a dip in support. At best, the public was lukewarm about the operation. Interestingly, support did not change dramatically based on party, demonstrating fairly bipartisan support, despite limited input from a very Republican Congress.91"
"51","The circumstances were slightly different under Obama. He initially received popular support for the action.92 That support waned as the operation moved into late June 2011, but the erosion came predominantly from concerns over the substance of the operation rather than its legality.93 The vast majority of those who disapproved thought that the United States should not be involved in Libya. Conversely, only 29 percent of Americans disapproved because the president had not obtained the necessary approval.94 It is important to note, however, that limited public approval may have helped contain the extent of military action in both the Bosnian and Libyan instances.95 It appears that people think presidents have the power to initiate hostilities unilaterally. The president can do whatever people perceive he is allowed to do, and he is constrained by their approval.         "
"52","This points to the biggest concern in the current system. While the debate between Hamilton and Madison demonstrates an “invitation to struggle,” the current debate does not. Even though Clinton and Obama expressed a desire to distance themselves from the use of military force, both used it, and both circumvented Congress when doing so. This indicates strong institutional incentives to engage in these kinds of activities. Based on the evidence, it appears that executive supremacists, often associated with the George W. Bush administration, look like the ones who are accurately analyzing the constitutional text and the influence of precedent. Comparatively, legislative supremacists have difficulty pushing executives—and the legislature—to act in the way they deem appropriate. The current debate, therefore, does not produce remarkably different administrations, unlike the administrations in the early days of the Republic. It simply produces executive justifications that are not accepted by a group of scholars."
"53","Extensive precedent and congressional inaction leads to the conclusion that below a certain threshold, presidents can initiate hostilities without congressional consent. Is this a problem? To quote Corwin, “that depends.”96"
"54","From a particular angle, through oversight committees and the power of the purse, Congress still contains presidential war making,97 albeit less regularly and aggressively than some might hope. Alternatively, according to Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, the expansion of the executive power is a net positive. The prior system “has proven unworkable,” leaving Congress and the judiciary to slowly cede power to the executive. In their opinion, “this trend is not due solely to the advantages inherent in the executive office, but also to a general sense among the political elites that the erosion of the separation of powers has not been a bad thing.”98 While this may be the case, it is impossible to think that presidents should enjoy carte blanche. It is important to find ways of constraining their actions.         "
"55","One might look for novel ways to restrain the president through law. Bruce Ackerman thinks there should be a Supreme Executive Tribunal that binds the executive to the Constitution.99 James Baker III and former representative Lee Hamilton think there should be a law forcing the president to consult with Congress for any operations lasting longer than a week.100 If the OLC's and Koh's arguments do not prove the point, precedent can: presidents have a remarkable ability to manipulate the meaning of law to justify a wide variety of actions. There is no reason to assume that new laws will suddenly overcome this systemic problem. These are legal solutions to a political problem.101 We should not, therefore, look to the law for a solution; we should look to the theory behind the separation of powers. The fundamental assumption underlying this constitutional order is that the branches jealously guard their powers and fight off any other branch that encroaches.102 Therefore, Congress needs an incentive to come back to the struggle.

"56","While it is easy to see the separation of powers as antiquated, it is necessary to remember that the institutions require certain kinds of behavior from the branches. The system invites debate. Attempts to create an established process to circumvent this struggle cannot solve the problem; in fact, these attempts serve to exacerbate it.103 Problems do not arise when one branch asserts excessive powers. Problems arise when other actors do not push back. At present, therefore, it is clear that Congress has a collective action problem.104"
"57","Over the course of American history, after aggressive assertions of presidential power, Congress has collectively asserted itself against the executive, leading to periods of relatively strong legislatures and weak presidents.105 The last very throaty assertion of congressional unity came after Richard Nixon's blatant abuse of power.106 Since that time, Congress has become significantly more partisan, losing a great deal of popularity, and even party unity cannot always overcome the strident adherence to ideological positions required for reelection in certain districts.

"58","As The Federalist Papers state plainly, “power is of an encroaching nature, and . . . it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it”; creating a system that provides these restraints is “the most difficult task.”107 In this instance, Congress has failed to recognize its own self‐interest and use its power to guard against executive encroachment. Further research in this area should explore how to restore branch unity in an age of ideologically divided parties. Research should also focus on how public opinion and the courts can aid in the restraint of presidential actions. The executive should not be responsible for restraining itself. This type of self‐restraint is not built into the structure of the formal powers and will never provide a sufficient check. After all, “it has eternally been observed that any man who has power is led to abuse it; he continues until he finds limits. Who would think it! Even virtue has need of limits.”108 109"
