"1","Establishing limits for executive power, in theory and in practice, remains a central challenge for students of American politics and law. Michael Genovese's A Presidential Nation: Causes, Consequences, and Cures takes a systematic and historically informed approach to these questions. Tracing the development of the American presidency from the founding through the administration of George W. Bush, Genovese makes the case for constitutionally limited executive power, outlines the excesses of the contemporary presidency, and offers suggestions for reform.         "
"2","Genovese's account has several key strengths as an addition to the literature on presidential power and as a book for possible classroom use. First, the book raises (and attempts to answer) interesting questions. It also balances the impact of individual presidents with the influence of structure and context. Finally, it highlights the evolution not only of the presidency itself, but also of scholarly understandings of presidential power."
"3","A Presidential Nation addresses several questions surrounding the nature and scope of presidential power. Thomas Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase, Andrew Jackson's populist rhetoric, and Theodore Roosevelt's “personal” presidency are among the events that Genovese examines as part of the development of the office as we know it today. In addition to asking how the United States became a “presidential nation,” the book also examines questions about how to place limits on presidential power. The section on Jefferson presents and then challenges an “end‐justifies‐the‐means” approach to presidential power. In chapter 5, Genovese tackles different philosophical approaches to the presidency in the context of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, interrogating the premises of the “unitary executive theory” that informed some decisions in the administration of George W. Bush. Finally, in chapter 6, Genovese asks what may be the most interesting and crucial question of all: What is to be done? In answer to this question, he lays out several possible approaches to reform, including structural reform of Congress and the repeal of presidential term limits.         "
"4","The historical analysis presented in this book is multi‐dimensional. The historical account examines the choices and personalities of individual presidents in the context of changing ideas, technology, and social forces. Through this approach, Genovese subtly challenges the idea that the presidency can be reduced to great men and great leadership, while simultaneously highlighting the role of decision making within the conditions that presidents inherit. Each chapter also examines currents of thought and scholarship about presidential power, which helps the reader engage with the book's central question about the proper scope and use of such power. This condensed intellectual history culminates with a very useful chart in chapter 5 that summarizes a range of perspectives on presidential power."
"5","Two weaknesses detract from what is otherwise a very clear and insightful book. First, the historical treatment is a bit uneven. This can be very difficult to avoid, inasmuch as detached historical perspective on recent events often proves elusive. Nevertheless, there is a substantial change in focus as the book moves through history, with more attention to legal theory and less to political context in the later chapters. Similarly, the book could have incorporated the role of other actors in a more‐systematic and uniform fashion. In the final chapters, Genovese considers possible changes in the roles of Congress, the courts, and the public. Parallel analysis of these institutions and actors during the time of Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, or John McKinley (for example) would have made the book even more unique and insightful."
"6","A Presidential Nation invites readers to consider presidential power at the intersection of Constitutional thought and practical politics. It raises questions about the institutional arrangements most conducive to democracy, and about leadership and power in the contemporary world. For students and scholars of the American presidency, it is a worthwhile and enlightening read.         "
