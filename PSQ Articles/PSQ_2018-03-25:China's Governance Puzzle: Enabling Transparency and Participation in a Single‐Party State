"1","China's governance, whether it is improving or deteriorating, whether it is leading to democratization or revitalized authoritarian rule, has been at the center of many discussions in recent years. China's Governance Puzzle is the product of a well‐funded five‐year research project bringing together wide‐ranging methodological and country expertise. Jonathan R. Stromseth was the country representative for the Asia Foundation in Beijing; Edmund J. Malesky is a professor of political science, previously at the University of California, San Diego, and now at Duke; and Dimitar D. Gueorguiev is a professor of political science at Syracuse University. This team worked closely with Chinese collaborators, Wang Xixin, vice dean of the law school at Peking University, and Lai Hairong, a well‐known expert on Chinese governance at the Central Compilation and Translation Bureau in Beijing. They recruited 75 research assistants to collect 130,000 data points on 1,000 indicators and information on all 31 provinces over a period of two decades. This extensive collaboration allowed them to pursue both quantitative and qualitative indicators of China's governance. I know of no other project on Chinese governance that is as methodologically sophisticated or as comprehensive.         "
"2","Overall, they conclude that there has been notable progress in China's governance, particularly in terms of lower corruption and enhanced legal compliance. These improvements in governance, they argue, “depend on a broader societal ecosystem that includes an active media and robust civil society” (p. 1). Using the annual report of the Chinese National Audit Office as a proxy measure of corruption, they conclude (1) that the level of corruption has generally declined (when measured as a percentage of gross domestic product) and (2) that there is variation among provinces, with Guangdong and Zhejiang in particular showing dramatic reductions (pp. 69–71). They further argue that these declines reflect an improvement in transparency regarding government decision‐making, public policy output, and the government power structure and allocation (p. 84). But are these conclusions warranted? In 2015, the Central Discipline Inspection Commission reported that up to the end of 2014, more department (ting) level cadres had been investigated in Guangdong (48) than any other province. And it was in Zhejiang that Shang Guosheng, a district party secretary in Hangzhou, declared, “to be a little department head (kezhang) without spending money—show me. If you really have this ability, I will call you my daddy.”         "
"3","Apart from corruption, Stromseth, Malesky, and Gueorguiev are interested in why an authoritarian political system would open itself up, even to a limited extent, to public participation. They argue that allowing a degree of public participation through public hearings, comments on legislation, and so on, gives the government information about public preferences, generates legitimacy, and helps forge consensus. No doubt these are real benefits, but one has to show how these benefits are perceived and implemented by specific units with specific interests. For instance, the authors point to Shanxi's implementation of public hearings in 1999 as starting a process of greater public participation (p. 173). But we know from the revelations since Ling Jihua's fall that Shanxi is one of the most corrupt provinces in China, burdened by deep factional ties. Can a few public hearings break up these webs of relations and interests? Apparently not.         "
"4","What is included and not included is also curious. Although they discuss corruption, the logic of adopting participatory models, and public policymaking in different provinces, nothing is said about the “three rural” (sannong) issue that gripped China in the first half of the 2000s and prompted many reforms. What is missing in the authors’ explanation is attention to the way the party operates and the different interests of the party in different departments and at different levels.         "
"5","In short, this is a fascinating effort to come to grips with a slippery subject, but one that leaves one with more questions than answers."
