"1","There appears to be a perpetual era of good feelings toward the young, charismatic, and highly educated Newark, NJ mayor Cory Booker, as evidenced by the documentaries, television shows, and national and international press stories. In her thorough and very timely work, Andra Gillespie provides an overview of Booker's electoral rise, but does not lose herself in the whirlwind that continues to surround the mayor of “brick city.” Gillespie paints with a wide brush to expose the complexities of the new vanguard of black political entrepreneurs, as well as the historical analyses, to present a larger and more‐complex narrative of the history of black electoral politics. Throughout this important work, she exposes the “delicate tightrope” of the twenty‐first‐century black politician who relies on multiculturalism because of limited ties to historical black institutions, all while balancing the demands of racial solidarity by diverse black constituencies. Gillespie begins the complicated conversation pertaining to how new black political entrepreneurs initially set the tone for the potential infighting they cause, that is, simultaneously linking the civil rights successes of their predecessors while exposing their poorly implemented leadership and failures on broad economic issues."
"2","The New Black Politician provides a robust theoretical analysis linking Cathy Cohen's Boundaries of Blackness theory of advanced marginalization of black groups by black elites to what Gillespie defines as elite displacement, the process by which “black political challengers seize on both the moral and policy failings of incumbent black leaders to challenge them for political office” (p. 3). Gillespie walks the reader through her theory of elite displacement, using Booker as a case study, conducting extensive qualitative interviews, and supporting her theory with historical examples that articulate the overarching themes and debates in African American electoral politics. One of the greatest strengths of Gillespie's text is the micro and macro outlook on African American local, state, and national electoral politics. Booker, his campaign, and the city of Newark are just three of the prominent actors in this book, and Gillespie makes seamless comparisons linking the ambitions and struggles of entrepreneurial black candidates to larger themes of candidate, campaign, urban, class, and race politics. Because of these inclusions, this book is of use to scholars who are interested in how substantive campaign and governance processes are addressed in the context of urban, African American, electoral politics and historical processes.         "
"3","Writing about an individual can be a precarious task for a scholar. How do we balance and maintain “proximity, objectivity, and professional distance” (p. 253)? For the most part, Gillespie maintains a scholarly distance from the aura of Mayor Booker, and her retelling of several community interactions in which community (and city council) members are quite vocal about their distrust of Booker presents a portrait of Newarkans that is not intertwined with her ties to Booker, his family, and members of his campaign team."
"4","The New Black Politician is a timely and necessary contribution that should be mandatory reading for any scholar interested in urban, electoral, or African American politics more broadly. Gillespie concludes that black political entrepreneurs have a dual responsibility, not only to uplift their communities but also to transcend classist assumptions that may assist their personal careers. She finds, however, that these individuals ultimately are able to do little to address and rectify the plight of persistently underserved black communities. The foundation laid in this text and the conclusions reached, leave readers to think about the futures of the growing number of black entrepreneurial politicians across the country—on the local, state, and even national levels.
