"1","Garrett Epps has written a short, readable book appropriate for a popular audience. In American Justice 2014, he provides an overview of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2013–2014 term, arguing that the justices have become more political and polarized over time. Epps supports his thesis by analyzing the jurisprudence of each of the nine justices through the lens of a Supreme Court decision.         "
"2","Epps wears two hats. First, as a law professor, he is able to clearly discuss the major cases that were decided during the 2013–2014 term. Second, as a contributor to The Atlantic online, his press access to the Court allows him to provide firsthand descriptions of justices during oral argument and the announcement of opinions. Epps uses this unique position to guide the reader through some of the Court's most significant recent decisions.         "
"3","In addition to an introduction and epilogue, there are nine numbered chapters that correspond to each justice. Most of the chapters follow a similar pattern, except for the chapter on Justice Antonin Scalia, which reviews his dissent in United States v. Windsor, decided the previous term. The chapter focuses almost exclusively on Scalia's gay rights jurisprudence and provides little biographical information.         "
"4","Each chapter begins with an interesting anecdote about the justice followed by a brief biographical sketch. This offers insight into their backgrounds and how they came to sit on the Court. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, grew up in Georgia under de jure segregation. Epps uses this to provide insight into Thomas's sharp questioning of counsel in the 2002 case Virginia v. Black, which dealt with whether cross burning is a form of protected speech.         "
"5","Epps then gives a brief overview of the justice's jurisprudence and his or her unofficial role on the Court. For instance, the importance of Justice Anthony Kennedy as the swing justice is explored. Although he is labeled as a conservative, Justice Kennedy has tended to vote liberal in certain areas of the law. This helps illustrate the interpersonal dynamics at play in the Court."
"6","The final part of each chapter is devoted to a significant case that was decided during the October 2013 term. Particular attention is given to how the decision fits with the justice's overall jurisprudence. The cases range from the well known, such as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, to the less familiar, such as Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus. It is in this part of the chapters that Epps's analysis crosses into editorializing. In the preface, Epps describes the book as a “traveler's diary” and says that he is not a “dispassionate observer” (p. 3). Although he is candid about this, the book is the strongest when the analysis has a more scholarly tone.         "
