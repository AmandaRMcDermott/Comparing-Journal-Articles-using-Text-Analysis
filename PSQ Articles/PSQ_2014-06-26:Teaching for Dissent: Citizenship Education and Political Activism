"1","Guided by a pragmatist ideal of deliberative, inclusive, and participatory democracy, Sarah Stitzlein argues that “American children have the right to an education that cultivates the skills and dispositions of dissent” (p. 77). By this she means two different things, although she rarely highlights the distinction between them. Children should be taught both (how) to think critically about their society's existing political arrangements and (how) to advocate for change when they judge those arrangements to be defective. The first of these claims is commonly made by theorists of liberal democratic civic education. Stitzlein repeatedly acknowledges the work of Harry Brighouse without ever explaining how her call for civic education to promote critical thinking differs from his position. And she seems to believe (wrongly) that all other liberal theorists of education are concerned only with teaching children to think critically about personal (as distinct from political) matters (p. 87)."
"2","The book's real contribution lies in its argument for teaching all children (how) to articulate dissenting views and engage in reform‐oriented (collective) civic action. Chapter 3 identifies and analyzes four types of dissent(er), and Stitzlein's book is most valuable when it spotlights the skills and dispositions needed for the various types of dissent: “verbal persuasion, consciousness‐raising, coalition‐building, and others” (p. 88) and prescribes forms of education well‐suited to cultivate those skills and dispositions. I would liked to have seen this important analysis developed more fully in place of Stitzlein's much more familiar advocacy of education for critical thinking about politics."
"3","Chapters 3 and 7 describe what dissent looks like at its best. Although it can be laced with anger, it should be constructive and oriented to the achievement of social justice (rather than merely the selfish defense of one's own interests). In particular, Stitzlein emphasizes, dissent should be grounded in hope that is “realistic, informed, and generative” (p. 49). Noting the vigorous activities of the Tea Party and its counterparts on the left (such as various ‘Occupy’ movements), she argues throughout the book that the “unique historical moment of widespread political dissent currently unfolding in America” (p. 185) affords a special opportunity: we can and should use schools to help shape this outpouring of (angry) dissent in accordance with Stitzlein's pragmatist vision. That emphasis on contemporary conditions in the United States partially explains why Stitzlein claims to be writing (only) about America and grounds her account in American intellectual history (chapter 2), but most of her arguments are eminently generalizable to other liberal democratic countries."
"4","Chapter 5 provides a good analysis of the many ways in which most U.S. schools today fail to teach children (how) to dissent. And chapter 6 develops the interesting proposition that teachers would serve their students well by modeling dissent (about education policies, specifically). In keeping with the analysis in chapter 5, Stitzlein usefully explains why American teachers today rarely do so. But chapter 6 then takes a lengthy detour through the results of a survey designed to show whether and how teachers dissent in online blogs and discussion forums. The author herself acknowledges that teacher dissent is relevant to her argument only when it is observed by students, so it is hard to understand why she devotes a dozen pages to this point. Similarly, it is odd that chapter 7 often dwells on the challenge of generating and sustaining hope in teachers rather than in their students."
"5","In short, Teaching for Dissent offers a persuasive account of the importance of dissent in a democratic society and helpfully identifies both the barriers to and opportunities for using schools to cultivate and appropriately shape dissent in the contemporary United States.         "
