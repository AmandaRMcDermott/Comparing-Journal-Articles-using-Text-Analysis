"1","Initially, readers of Nina M. Moore's book may be skeptical about the author's bold contention that most prior theorizing—both liberal and conservative, at both the micro and macro levels—about racial disparities in the American criminal justice system has been unable to adequately explain these pervasive injustices. Moore argues, generally, that racially discriminatory treatment of blacks within criminal justice endures primarily because policymakers and the public have allowed it; they are complicit in its perpetuation. She then describes how the influences most commonly proffered to explain these racial disparities—discrimination by individual criminal justice practitioners, laws that target blacks, disparate involvement of blacks in crime, and cultural differences—can exist only within a structural framework that sustains them. The imperative asserted here is that we must consider the role of the entire body politic, including citizens, courts, policymakers, lobbyists, academics, and mass media, rather than identifying single contributors to the problem. Thus, Moore's thesis is not, in fact, mutually exclusive of prior research, thereby making her arguments compelling for readers with wide‐ranging views on race and crime (although she does find certain theories more credible than others)."
"2","Political Roots of Racial Tracking identifies a two‐pronged phenomenon that negatively impacts blacks, regardless of whether they even become officially involved in the criminal justice system. First, Moore argues that there are racially distinct modes of American criminal justice that vary not only in extent and application but also in intensity according to whether an individual is black or white. Blacks are stopped, prosecuted, and punished more often and more harshly than whites. Compounding these disparities is the fact that whites receive special privilege and lenient treatment by officials throughout the criminal justice process that blacks rarely ever experience. Thus, the first premise is that there are two separate, racially distinct tracks of criminal justice. The second premise is that the American public and policymakers—blacks and whites alike—have been negligent, inept, and uncommitted to confronting the existence of this two‐tiered criminal justice system, in large part because the media is not conveying the message that this should be a priority and because the public favors individualistic explanations for behavior.         "
"3","I enthusiastically agree with Moore's general argument that holistic political context regarding race and crime has been underappreciated in previous examinations; prior research (briefly yet nicely summarized in this text) shows there are many contributors to racially disparate criminal justice treatment that have not been sufficiently explored in conjunction with one another. Yet some of Moore's assertions strike me as somewhat oversimplified and not entirely original. Within the disciplines of criminology and criminal justice, for instance, it has long been recognized that there are implicitly separate practices and policies (or tracks, as she calls them) that affect both rates of black involvement as well as severity of treatment in the criminal justice system. Further, much theoretical development and research have previously addressed the influence mass media exert on public beliefs; however, those studies often find reciprocal effects, making conclusions about whether the media reflects or projects public opinion that are possibly more complicated than portrayed here. Given the recent social movement following the killing of young black men by police officers, it is inaccurate for Moore to say there is an “absence of public outrage” over racially disparate justice, even if it has yet to produce tangible reform.
