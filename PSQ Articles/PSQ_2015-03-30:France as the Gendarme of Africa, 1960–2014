"1","THE EMERGENCE OF FRANCE AS THE GENDARME OF AFRICA goes back to the 1960s and the independence of its African colonies. Unlike other European colonial powers, such as the United Kingdom, France was faced late with decolonization and, most of all, wished to maintain an exclusive influence over its former colonial empire. French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa disappeared, but France sought to maintain privileged and lasting political, cultural, economic, and military relations with the former colonies. The new African regimes would receive military and technical assistance from France in return for backing its international policies. Paris thus established a type of nested neocolonial association with these sub‐Saharan states of limited sovereignty. This defined France's pré carré in Africa, its area of exclusive action.         "
"2","To understand this vigorous French policy, it is paramount to highlight what Paris's former colonial empire meant for its international status as a major power. Paris was able to obtain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council in 1945 because of the importance of its colonial empire, which remained considerable at the time, in addition to the role of the Forces Françaises Libres (Free French Forces) during World War II. Therefore, after those territories achieved independence, and in order for Paris to be still regarded as a major power, President Charles de Gaulle believed that he had to maintain France's influence over Francophone Africa so that it would remain the main guarantor of the balance of power in the sub‐Saharan pré carré. This neocolonial policy was also motivated by the loss of Indochina and Algeria in 1954 and 1962, respectively, two French colonies that were granted independence after bloody wars and, in the case of Indochina, after a humiliating military defeat in the battle of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. Perpetuation of a coherent French pré carré, by the use of military force if needed, was thus fully part of de Gaulle's foreign policy of grandeur.         "
"3","The sum of formal and informal French networks and lobbies related to Africa were referred to as Françafrique, a term coined by the first president of Côte d'Ivoire, Félix Houphouët‐Boigny, in 1973 to describe the permanent link between Paris and its former African colonies.1 This paternalist attitude defined France's relations with the newly independent states and also offered mutual advantages to Paris and its client states, as African rulers were sometimes able to push French involvement further than what Paris initially wanted. Furthermore, African elites were eminent parts of the French political landscape in the 1950s and 1960s. For instance, Félix Gaillard's 1957 government included four members born in sub‐Saharan African colonies: Modibo Keïta, Hubert Maga, Hamadoun Dicko, and Houphouët‐Boigny.2 The first three men became presidents of the republics of Mali, Dahomey (present‐day Benin), and Côte d'Ivoire, respectively, and thus were fully involved in the creation of influential Françafrique networks. Yet these bilateral relations remained highly unequal, especially regarding the use of military force.         "
"4","From the time of independence onward, the French presence in its former African empire was based on three pillars. The first was a monetary pillar through the franc zone that included 14 African states sharing the same currency, the franc de la Communauté Financière Africaine (CFA), which was directly indexed on the value of the French franc. The second pillar was composed of a network of French experts present at the state level of African countries, in financial, institutional, and educational structures. The third and most important pillar was the military one, expressed through the presence of French soldiers in several permanent bases scattered across the continent in Senegal, Djibouti, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Central African Republic (CAR), and elsewhere, in addition to the presence of numerous French advisers in the related African armies.3 The first and most influential actor in this African policy was Jacques Foccart, President de Gaulle's adviser and director for 16 years of the cellule africaine, the presidential cabinet in charge of African affairs. Foccart was responsible for all the operations of the French secret service in sub‐Saharan Africa and enjoyed a great deal of autonomy that was granted by de Gaulle.4 Through his intimate ties with African leaders, and under direct or tacit presidential mandate, Foccart created a coherent Francophone block. To a large extent, he truly made France the gendarme of Africa. Some scholars have even described this neocolonial order as a “Pax Gallica,” in reference to the Pax Romana imposed over the Roman Empire.5                     "
"5","Consequently, Foccart made sure to establish a well‐defined legal status to legitimize French interventions and to ensure a lasting military cooperation with the countries of the pré carré through two distinct types of bilateral agreements: technical military accords, or accords militaires techniques, ensuring the presence of French military advisers, training, and equipment in the African armies, and defense accords that legally authorized French interference in the sovereign affairs of the recently independent states. These two types of accords were signed between 1960 and 1961 by 12 countries, later joined by Djibouti and the Comoros in 1977–1978.6 The defense accords are by far the most important and legally binding. They concerned—and still concern in renewed forms—eight African states: Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, the CAR, Djibouti, and the Comoros. For instance, consider the 1961 defense accords signed between France, Côte d'Ivoire, Dahomey, and Niger. Article 1 stated that those four republics would “assist each other to organize and carry out their defense,” and Article 4 added that the three African countries would grant the French Republic the right to “freely dispose of the military facilities needed to carry out defense … concerning: circulation in the territories, air space and territorial waters. … The use of port, maritime, river, road, rail and air transport infrastructures as well as the postal and communication networks.”7 Those accords allowed Paris to intervene in cases of internal or border turmoil in any of the concerned states, but as long as Foccart was in charge of the cellule africaine, the French interventions would always need to be requested directly by the local presidents or delegates, as in Gabon in 1964.8                     "
"6","French African activism did not necessarily come in the form of military interventions, so to speak, but rather through mere mobilization of troops in the concerned capitals. The French military usually tried to act in order to prevent further escalation of violence. A good example of this took place in Dakar, Senegal, in 1962, when a coup d'état was stopped by loyalist Senegalese troops under French leadership with a simple mobilization of the local permanent French units. Public order was thus the main element that France's forces would always try to maintain. Of course, direct military interventions occurred as well, as in Gabon in 1964, when President Léon M'ba was kidnapped by a group of rebellious officers. Paris sent paratroopers, settled the situation in a day, and M'ba came back to power. Under Foccart's action, the military was thus considered a tool that would eventually allow for a political solution. That being said, Paris did not interfere automatically whenever a friendly regime was endangered. In 1966 in the CAR, Colonel Jean‐Bédel Bokassa seized power while France remained deliberately inactive and favored a wait‐and‐see strategy instead of sending its troops against Bokassa. Three years earlier, Paris had already refused to intervene in Congo‐Brazzaville to protect Fulbert Youlou's regime against internal political turmoil."
"7","It is worth noting that French activism in the African pré carré was carried out amid a constant decline of the actual military presence in the continent and Madagascar. The number of French troops dropped from 58,500 in 1962 to 21,300 in 1964 and went as low as 6,700 in 1981.9 The actual level of threat in fact remained quite low and did not call for important deployments. President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's foreign affairs minister, Louis de Guiringaud, even made a famous statement in the late 1970s when he declared that Africa was “within France's reach, in accordance with its means, the only continent where it is still able to change the course of History with only five hundred men.”10 He was commenting on the 1979 Operation Barracuda, by which the French military overthrew Bokassa, the self‐proclaimed emperor of central Africa, and returned to power former president David Dacko, who was transported to Bangui in the hold of a Transall aircraft of the French air force. Paris's policy in Africa was hence extremely profitable to its international image as a major power by providing it with the respectable role of gendarme of Africa with only modest military deployments.            "
"8","Another example of this took place in May 1978 with Operation Bonite (or Léopard), when French Foreign Legion paratroopers jumped into the city of Kolwezi in Zaire (currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC) and rescued 2,000 European nationals threatened by a local armed rebellion. The French operation consequently saved President Mobutu Sese Seko's regime. This intervention was a triple success for France in its pré carré: it asserted its international status, especially toward its European allies; it confirmed its role as the gendarme of Africa; and, finally, it secured a regime favorable to its economic and political interests. All this was achieved in a month, with light forces—a few hundred legionnaires—and modest casualties: five French soldiers killed and 20 injured."
"9","In a number of cases, Paris resorted to undercover military action to ensure the survival of its African client regimes or to cause the collapse of others. The most notorious case was Biafra, an oil‐rich coastal province of Nigeria that proclaimed its independence from Lagos in May 1967. Foccart and the French secret service (Service de documentation extérieure et de contre‐espionnage, SDECE) saw this as an opportunity to destabilize English‐speaking Nigeria, the most populated country in the French pré carré. France thus organized a complex system of arms trafficking and military training for the Biafran rebellion. This was achieved thanks to the French mercenary Bob Denard, Foccart's ally of convenience in Biafra, but also with the direct support of the French forces in Gabon and Côte d'Ivoire.11 Weapons were sent from France to its military base in Libreville, officially for Ivorian and Gabonese forces, and then shipped to Biafra by the SDECE. However, in spite of Paris's efforts, Nigerian forces crushed the Biafran rebellion in 1970.            "
"10","The end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s witnessed a notable evolution of the French military policy in the Francophone sphere toward almost systematic intervention. At the time, France resorted to what has been described as “Jaguar diplomacy,” a reference to the name of the French‐British military aircraft.12 Paris regularly used those jets to carry out brief airstrikes in Mauritania, Chad, and Libya to achieve military and diplomatic goals, much like the European powers did with the so‐called gunboat diplomacy of the nineteenth century in China and elsewhere. Although President François Mitterrand (1981–1995) was a socialist and had long expressed harsh criticisms of his right‐wing predecessors regarding their African policies, his stances on Africa during his first mandate were no different from conservative de Gaulle's 20 years before, especially concerning the work of the cellule africaine. As a matter of fact, Mitterrand resorted to military intervention more often than Foccart, especially in Chad, where three successive operations (Tacaud, Manta, and Epervier) took place between 1978 and 1986—that is, mostly during Mitterrand's mandate.13 At the time, Chad was undoubtedly the main battlefield for France in Africa. French forces intervened several times in the country to remind all international actors, particularly neighboring Libya, of the geographic limits of the French pré carré.            "
"11","Finally, French interventionism in sub‐Saharan Africa was taking place in the global context of the Cold War, as the newly independent states were rapidly transformed into peripheral proxy battlefields between the United States and the Soviet Union. American decision makers then perceived France as the sole European power able and willing to act in sub‐Saharan Africa in order to maintain those territories inside the Western bloc. Therefore, France acted, perhaps unconsciously, as the United States' de facto gendarme in Francophone Africa. Relevant proof can be found in the memoirs of George Ball, undersecretary of state in the John F. Kennedy administration, who recognized Africa as a “special European responsibility,” just as European nations were expected to recognize “our [U.S.] responsibility in Latin America.”14 Consequently, a parallel can be drawn between the French interventionist policy in its African pré carré and the United States' protectorate policy in Latin America in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In his 1999 book A Century's Journey, Robert A. Pastor identifies constants in U.S. interference in Latin America using three instruments: “marines, dollars and elections.”15 This pattern is very similar to that of France in sub‐Saharan Africa, where those three instruments could be paratroopers, the CFA franc, and regime change. Pastor also notes that Washington asked the government of the local country to sign a Platt‐type amendment granting the United States the legal right to intervene in its domestic affairs—in other words, the American equivalent of France's various defense accords. All those elements defined France's military policy in Africa from the 1960s onward, but the fall of the Berlin Wall was to bring significant changes to these constants.            "
"12","With the Cold War coming to an end, it became clear to French policymakers that the basis of their African policy had to match the new realities of the post–Cold War era, notably, the emergence of democratization movements in eastern Europe and in Africa. In spite of his rather conservative African policy, President Mitterrand initially embraced these movements in a speech he gave in June 1990 during the 16th French‐African Summit held in La Baule, west of France. In this famous speech, he stated that African states would now benefit from French aid, on the condition that they carry out actual democratic change. Despite this so‐called La Baule doctrine, France's aid programs, and military support continued for African regimes favorable to French interests and influence, no matter whether they were truly committed to democratic changes, as with Juvénal Habyarimana's regime in Rwanda in the early 1990s."
"13","This self‐proclaimed doctrine announced the beginning of notorious transformations in the French African policy, which mostly occurred in 1994. Three major events occurred that year. The first was the death of Ivorian president Houphouët‐Boigny (in power since 1960), whose funerals were held in 1994. To a large extent, Houphouët‐Boigny was himself a pillar of Françafrique, a network that he helped create. The second event directly affected the financial pillar of the African pré carré: the CFA franc was devaluated by Paris for the first time since 1948. But the most important event occurred between April and June 1994 with the Rwandan genocide, which drowned the gendarme of Africa in a bloodbath outside its traditional pré carré."
"14","Rwanda is a former Belgian colony that France integrated into its sphere of influence under the presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in the late 1970s. In the early 1990s, France was supporting the Hutu regime of Habyarimana against external threats, mainly the forces of the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) that were launching occasional attacks from neighboring Uganda. Between October 1990 and December 1993, France led a typical military support and training operation (Operation Noroît) for the benefit of Habyarimana's forces. Paris may have believed in Habyarimana's willingness to negotiate with the Tutsis in accordance with the outcome of the Arusha Accords of 1993, which should have allowed for more power sharing between Tutsis and Hutus, but it seems that Paris dramatically underestimated the strength of tribal hatred in Rwanda and the genocidal dimension it held.16 In October 1993, France pushed for the creation of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda and simultaneously withdrew its last soldiers from the country, leaving it open to mass killings. During the following spring, the RPF launched a series of offensives from Uganda, and on 6 April 1994, President Habyarimana was killed when his plane was shot down near the capital city of Kigali. The assassination was the starting point of a hundred days of massacres of Tutsis and, to a lesser extent, of moderate Hutus, in which government forces played the absolute leading role.            "
"15","Apart from France's blindness over the genocidal intentions of the Kigali regime—willful or not, the controversy still goes on today between Paris and Kigali—some authors have highlighted another aspect of France's support for Habyarimana: the French‐ versus English‐speaking competition in central Africa. During the Cold War, an economic rivalry had already started between France and (primarily) the United States in the French pré carré, but this competition reached a new level in Rwanda. The Tutsi RPF guerrillas were arguably supported by Uganda and “perceived by French policy makers as hostile to France” and “under Anglo‐Saxon influence.”17 Uganda and Paul Kagame (leader of the RPF) had long been currying favor with the U.S. policymaking establishment, and as such, the RPF's incursions of the early 1990s were perceived by President Mitterrand as the beginning of a regional domino effect that could eventually lead to English‐speaking domination over central Africa, to the detriment of France and the Francophonie. The very status of France as a power would then be at stake.            "
"16","On 21 June 1994, more than two months after the beginning of the genocide and the abandonment of Rwanda by the entire international community, France finally launched, alone, Operation Turquoise with the approval of the UN Security Council. This operation, which was justified on humanitarian grounds, can be considered a political error and highly dubious, as Paris was still deploying troops to second and protect the regime of Habyarimana “to the limit of direct participation” only six months before the start of Operation Turquoise.18 It can also be argued that the “Safe Humanitarian Zone” that the French operation established to protect Rwandan refugees actually allowed for Hutu genocide perpetrators to flee the country and for massacres to be committed inside the zone.19,20 A whole body of literature exists—on both sides—concerning the actual role of French forces in Rwanda and whether accusations of complicity in the genocide are accurate, but this essay will not pretend to give a definitive answer to those lasting questions.            "
"17","The 1994 Rwandan genocide was a turning point in Paris's policy in Africa and a hard blow to the role of gendarme of the continent that it still pretended to play. In addition to this, a number of contradictions about France's support for democratization processes occurred during President Jacques Chirac's first mandate (1995–2002). In Niger in 1996, Paris refused to help the former democratically elected authorities and pragmatically worked with the new military regime of Colonel Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara despite a formal commitment by Minister of Cooperation Jacques Godfrain stating that France would intervene to reinstate a democratically elected government, if a defense treaty had been signed with that country.21 These contradictions did not prevent essential transformations of the French African military policy toward multilateralism, a lesson learned from past errors, mostly in Rwanda, and in relation to Paris's shrinking military capabilities. In this respect, the 1997–2002 period has to be highlighted. In 1997, in a failed attempt to get a larger parliamentary majority, President Chirac dissolved the French National Assembly and, paradoxically, allowed for the election of a left‐wing majority. Socialist Lionel Jospin then became prime minister, while Chirac remained president. This cohabitation would change quite drastically France's military policy vis‐à‐vis its dissolving pré carré. First of all, the French armed forces tremendously evolved in the 1990s in their format, means, and geographic zones of deployment for several new conflicts emerged outside the African continent, in Iraq, Cambodia, Bosnia, Haiti, and Kosovo, among other places. Moreover, the format of the French military was seriously altered by Chirac's 1996 decision to launch a professionalization reform, as written in the 1997–2002 military planning law. This reform implied that the armed forces would progressively move toward a reduced format adapted to frequent overseas deployments. Consequently, the army's personnel dropped from 239,000 to 135,868, the navy's from 63,000 to 43,000, and the air force's from 89,000 to 63,000 between 1995 and 2005.22 Accordingly, the 1994 Livre blanc establishing the French military strategy for the next 15 years stated that France should be able to deploy a maximum of 50,000 soldiers abroad and 100 aircrafts. This reduced operational framework necessary meant that Paris would reconsider its presence in sub‐Saharan Africa toward more multilateralism.            "
"18","Prime minister Jospin proposed a new partnership with Africa in which the French commitment would remain, but the core of the policy was revised. Paris would no longer take the primary role in ensuring relative stability and security in the former pré carré. Troop numbers would decrease, and as a consequence, some permanent bases would be closed, notably, in Bangui. When Jospin came into office in 1997, French forces in Africa numbered 8,125 soldiers in seven states: Cameroon, the CAR, Chad, Djibouti, Gabon, Côte d'Ivoire, and Senegal. When Jospin's mandate ended five years later, the personnel level had been reduced to 5,300.23 Up to that point, the French military role in Africa had been largely unilateral, but Jospin was willing to introduce more multilateralism. As he declared on 20 December 1997 before French forces of Cap‐Vert in Senegal, “France cannot ensure alone the security of its African partners.” This new commitment came in several forms. The most frequently named was the regional and cooperative peacekeeping initiative RECAMP (Renforcement des capacites africaines de maintien de la paix). The concept of RECAMP symbolized the reorientation of the French security policy in sub‐Saharan Africa. It was introduced at the United Nations in December 1997 and developed through close coordination with the United States, a partner program to its Africa Crisis Response Initiative, and with the United Kingdom, which at the time was increasingly present on the continent as France seemed to be starting to pull back. Between May 2000 and September 2001, London even led a rare military intervention in one of its former colonies, Sierra Leone, with more than 1,000 British soldiers. Like France, the United Kingdom thus proved that it was also willing to play a decisive military role to end a civil war in a former sub‐Saharan colony.            "
"19","RECAMP was designed to provide both training and equipment to allow African states to ensure security and stability on the continent so as to eventually enable them to carry out peacekeeping operations on their own. For instance, in 1999, this equipment function was provided by France to the Senegalese battalion to the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo thanks to Paris's permanent base in Dakar. If those inter‐African solutions did not succeed in restoring peace and security, the French would now resort to action through the United Nations. As Foreign Minister Hubert Védrine argued in 1998, “The Security Council must retain the primary responsibility in questions of maintenance of international peace and security, in Africa and elsewhere.”24 Being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, along with the United Kingdom, France posed several times as the main advocate of African security issues, pushing for more UN involvement, as with peacekeeping missions in the CAR and Côte d'Ivoire.            "
"20","Multilateralism actually contributed to the relegitimization of the French military posture in sub‐Saharan Africa, along with the relevance of its prepositioned forces in the post–Cold War world. These evolutions still allowed for frequent interventions, yet new justifications would be summoned. The defense of client regimes would be neglected in favor of universal principles such as territorial integrity, endangered elected authorities, or human rights violations. Two main tactics were used to legitimize French interventionism: coercion by means of force and the mastery of irrational violence. This allowed France to intervene 42 times in Africa between 1997 and 2001 through actions ranging from mere mobilization of troops to sizeable military deployments or airstrikes. Among those interventions, only eight were multilateral UN operations.25 Another element that kept justifying military intervention—and still does today—was the protection of Western nationals, as in 1997 in the Republic of the Congo, where Paris sent 850 soldiers to secure its nationals from intermilitia fighting and then carried out the evacuation of 5,700 civilians.26                           "
"21","In all, France might be multinationalizing its military policy toward more African involvement, but the partnership remains unequal because France still owns, in comparison to its African or European allies, the almost‐exclusive means to use military force in sub‐Saharan countries. Coming back to the RECAMP program, the French État‐major des armées (staff headquarters) still defines the actions of the national armed forces that wish to participate, creates the multinational exercises, defines the topics of RECAMP seminars, and outlines how French support will be employed. Therefore, France vastly defines the reality of what is supposed to be a multilateral initiative. The quality and quantity of equipment are equally criticized by African forces themselves, as the RECAMP depots always seem to be empty, equipment is always out being used, and the depots need to be replenished. What is more, France has established since 1996 several Écoles nationales à vocation régionale (ENVRs) where French instructors train African officers in African schools. These structures aim to ease the propagation of France's military culture in the related armies—in other words, they are a tool to preserve its military footprint in the former pré carré. ENVRs are a particularly acute illustration of Lionel Jospin's formula describing the new French African policy: “Not to do less, but to do better.”27                           "
"22","Arguably, this period of transformation of the military role of France in sub‐Saharan Africa ended with its intervention in Côte d'Ivoire. On 19 September 2002, an armed rebellion tried to overthrow President Laurent Gbagbo in a failed coup d'état. This attempt divided the country for several years between a northern part controlled by rebels and a southern pro‐Gbagbo zone. Beginning in the very first days of the crisis, France refused to apply its defense accords with Côte d'Ivoire despite President Gbagbo's demands. Indeed, the two parties had different views on the nature of the conflict. For the Ivorian authorities, rebellious forces backed by foreign countries were attacking Côte d'Ivoire, thus allowing it to summon its defense accords with Paris on the basis of self‐defense. To the contrary, Paris believed the defense accords should not be applied in what it considered a purely internal conflict that should be handled within the regional African framework.28                           "
"23","France thus initially limited Operation Licorne to the protection of French and other countries' nationals. Once a regional response with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and a UN‐backed response (UN Mission in Côte d'Ivoire) were triggered, through strong French diplomatic efforts, Paris extended Licorne's mission to enforcing peace. That being said, when the situation deteriorated in 2004 to the point that France had to evacuate its nationals and deeply involve its forces in the field, it became abundantly clear that this type of direct military involvement was no longer the appropriate answer to the conflicts of sub‐Saharan Africa.29 Gbagbo's supporters were able to use the numerous skirmishes that took place in Abidjan and elsewhere between Licorne forces and Ivorian groups in November 2004 to undermine the legitimacy of the French intervention, especially during the Hôtel Ivoire events, when French soldiers reportedly opened fire on civilian protesters. A 2006 report of Amnesty International on these events even declared, “On some occasions French forces made an excessive and disproportionate use of force while they faced protesters who did not represent a direct threat to their lives or the lives of other persons.”30 Côte d'Ivoire was thus a turning point insofar as France had to admit it could not be the lone gendarme of Africa anymore, even in the country with which it had once developed the closest and most successful partnership in its pré carré.            "
"24","Let us now provide elements of analysis about the recent French military posture on the African continent. Generally speaking, Africa has lost a lot of importance for France. Several factors can account for this. In economic as well as militarily terms, new priorities for Western powers are mostly set in Asia or South America. Political changes in African states and in France have brought to power new generations of elites that are less inclined to summon former colonial ties. Rwandan president Paul Kagame is an acute example of these leaders in the former French sphere of influence who are now attracted to new partnerships. This is at least one of the reasons why Rwanda officially became the fifty‐fourth member of the Commonwealth in November 2009."
"25","In addition to the evolutions of the post–September 11 world, a number of relatively new security actors have entered the core of the former French pré carré. China and the United States are the two most notorious cases. Both those countries are now military cooperators in Africa. By 2008, the United States and China had signed military cooperation agreements with 18 and 15 African countries, respectively.31 The fight against terrorism, among other strategic interests, even pushed the United States to open a permanent base in 2002 in Djibouti, which is also home to France's biggest foreign military base. Quite symbolically, the American contingent settled in the former French barracks known as Camp Lemonnier. It is also worth noting that Japan opened a modest military base in Djibouti in 2011, the first one since World War II.            "
"26","Washington boosted its military presence in the sub‐Saharan region and the Horn of Africa in the 2000s, predominantly as part of the global war on terror. This relatively new presence materialized in the creation in 2007 of a dedicated U.S. military command, AFRICOM, providing yet another indisputable token of the end of France's exclusive role as gendarme of sub‐Saharan Africa. Since then, the United States has provided African forces with counterterrorism training and equipment and has increased its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance presence in the Horn of Africa, with Reaper and Predator drones, and later in the Sahel region, at the very core of the former pré carré. A few hundred U.S. Special Forces were even deployed by President Barack Obama in Uganda in October 2011 and reinforced in March 2014 to support the African Union's efforts to hunt down warlord Joseph Kony and his organization, the Lord's Resistance Army, operating across Uganda, the CAR, South Sudan, and Congo. Even more recently, the 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa allowed for a significant U.S. military effort on the continent, albeit not part of a conflict resolution initiative, as the Obama administration announced its willingness to deploy 3,000 military personnel in the afflicted region to supply local authorities with medical and logistical support."
"27","Furthermore, China has recently started to play an active military role in the Francophone sphere and elsewhere in Africa through its contribution to peacekeeping operations. In 2008, 75 percent of the 1,975 Chinese personnel deployed in peacekeeping operations were located in Africa.32 Earlier, in 2007, a Chinese general was even appointed force commander of the UN mission in the western Sahara, asserting China's willingness to contribute to peace and stability on the continent. More recent proof of this was Beijing's offer to deploy a 500‐men‐strong contingent to Mali in 2013, one of the United Nations' most exposed peacekeeping operations to date.33                           "
"28","More importantly, the sub‐Saharan states themselves have emerged as security actors in their own region through UN, ECOWAS, or even national interventions. Nigeria, for instance, was the leading nation in the ECOWAS mission in Liberia in August 2003, albeit with important U.S. support, while Rwanda became a frequent troop contributor to peacekeeping operations in Africa, namely, in the DRC and the CAR. As a matter of fact, Rwanda and Nigeria were the fifth and seventh personnel contributors, respectively, to UN peacekeeping operations for September 2014.34 At the same time, the Nigerian armed forces remain focused on the domestic front, where they regularly fight the militants of the Boko Haram extremist group in violent and deadly clashes in the northeastern part of the country. Finally, in recent years, Chad has started acting like a regional power in the former French pré carré, as seen with its military deployments in the CAR in late 2012 to fight Séléka rebels and in northern Mali since January 2013 to combat armed Islamist movements, against which Chadian forces suffered heavy losses.            "
"29","In the meantime, Paris's interest in sub‐Saharan Africa has decreased but has never stopped being a key strategic focus. To this extent, President Nicolas Sarkozy's mandate (2007–2012) provides a relevant case of hesitation between the not‐so‐ancient role of gendarme and imperatives for a strategic shift to the east, namely, the Arab Gulf. In 2008, a new Livre blanc was published, establishing strategic guidelines for the coming decade. It defined the “arc of crisis” of France as reaching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, with sub‐Saharan Africa being one of the key zones, as “France and Europe can't disregard the closest continent to them.”35 However, the Livre blanc did push for a strategic pivot to the Arab Gulf, which took the concrete form of a new French military base that opened in Abu Dhabi in 2009, the first outside Africa. Accordingly, the Livre blanc advocated the closure of two permanent French African bases (in Dakar and Abidjan), considering that Paris's shrinking financial and military means did not allow for them anymore. Yet, as for today, these two bases are still functional, albeit in lighter format and under Senegalese and Ivorian sovereignty, respectively.36,37 Paris and the related authorities, it seems, have realized they have mutual interests in keeping a modest French presence on their territory.            "
"30","On 28 February 2008, President Sarkozy delivered a speech in Cape Town, South Africa, in which he tried to explain his vision for the future of the French military presence in Africa: “It is not France's role to maintain armed forces in Africa indefinitely, Africa has to take responsibility for its security problems. … This does not mean in any way that France is disengaging from Africa. It's the exact opposite. I want France to work more closely with the African Union on building the collective security system that Africa needs.” This statement highlights two objectives that Paris holds for the future: remaining an indispensable military actor in Africa, but through cooperation and multilateral action rather than unilateralism. France thus revised and published its eight defense accords with the former African colonies: Togo and Cameroon in 2009; Gabon, the CAR, and the Comoros the following year; Djibouti and Senegal in 2011–2012; and, finally, Côte d'Ivoire in 2014. If those are appreciable evolutions of the French policy in Africa, only time will tell whether they bring actual changes in the way France acts. Other aspects of multilateralism do appear in the sustained efforts to empower African forces through the ongoing work of the 17 ENVRs—for which France spends €10 million each year—as well as small teams of military instructors (known as DIOs, or Détachement d'instruction opérationnelle) and other training initiatives supervised by the Direction de la coopération de sécurité et de défense, the armed wing of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the whole, 20,000 African soldiers are trained each year thanks to those means.38 What is more, Paris pushed for the emergence of a rather modest international actor in Africa in the early 2000s: the European Union (EU). The EU has deployed several military operations in Francophone Africa, starting with Operation Artémis in 2003 in the DRC and, five years later, Operation EUFOR (European Union Forces) Chad/CAR, providing the discrete European defense policy with some international visibility. Operation EUTM Mali (European Union Training Mission in Mali) and EUFOR CAR, launched in 2013 and 2014, respectively, are the two most recent examples of this trend.            "
"31","All these evolutions did not prevent France from playing a decisive role in African conflicts in recent years, even under European or UN mandates. Many reasons account for this, the two most obvious being expertise and intelligence. France can still undeniably rely on a vast network of experts in African matters in government, academia, and the private sector. In the French armed forces, centuries of colonial and postcolonial expeditions have created a deep knowledge of the culture of sub‐Saharan Africa's peoples, perpetuated by their historic expeditionary units: the Foreign Legion and the Troupes de Marine (comparable to the U.S. Marines). Officers from those units traditionally hold high‐ranked positions in the French command structures and African embassies, such as military attaché or adviser. They act as a well‐organized lobby that is able to shape France's African policy.39 Above all else, the use of a common language (in the former colonies) allows French forces to relate to the local African populations and to gather precious human intelligence and enables French political leaders to create or maintain strong relations with key African leaders, whose support is eventually decisive.            "
"32","Hence, France continues to be a leading military actor in sub‐Saharan conflicts, sometimes to the limits of direct interference. The French policy in Africa was rarely—if ever—limited to the strict role of an impartial arbiter, and the 2008 conflict in Chad is a key example of this certainty. In February 2008, Sudanese rebels crossed the Chadian border and rushed to N'Djamena to overthrow President Idriss Déby. France argued that it would not intervene as in the past and would simply carry out the evacuation of French and foreign nationals. In the end, Paris led an old‐style type of intervention in which its troops prevented the Chadian regime from collapsing by holding the Ndjamena airport, coordinating Deby's forces, and providing 12 tons of tank ammunition to the Chadian regime through Libya.40                           "
"33","Concerning European foreign policy, often described as the desirable future of the French policy in Africa, European missions would never have been possible without France's military means. French forces accounted for 80 percent of the 2003 EU forces deployed in the DRC (Operation Artémis), command structures were located in Paris, and all the technical and air support came from French bases in Chad and Gabon.41 The same was true five years later with Operation EUFOR Chad/CAR: 27 member states took part in it with a total force of 3,500 soldiers, nearly half of whom were French, while Paris provided nearly all the logistical and air support. In all, the EU has become a visible international actor in Africa, but most of the time through intensive French lobbying. Those European mandates are therefore new forms of legitimacy for Paris's action in its former pré carré. They also tend to be increasingly useful as French expeditionary capabilities keep decreasing.            "
"34","In addition, the emergence of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, along with the fight against piracy in Somalia and, to a lesser extent, the Gulf of Guinea, all called for a relegitimization of France's military presence in Africa. French Special Forces are now present in the Sahel region, France's naval forces are an active component of Operation Atalanta off the coast of Somalia, and Paris led several hostage release operations between 2008 and 2013 in Somalia and Niger."
"35","Most of all, France made a spectacular military comeback in Africa in 2011 under UN mandates by intervening simultaneously in Libya in March against Muammar el‐Qaddafi's forces (Resolution 1973) and in Côte d'Ivoire (Resolution 1975) in April. In Côte d'Ivoire, French soldiers, armored vehicles, and helicopters ultimately put an end to 10 years of political crisis by playing the leading role in ousting Laurent Gbagbo and his supporters, who were denying the results of the presidential elections of late 2010 and the victory of Alassane Ouattara. Still, there is a significant difference between current French interventions in Africa and those of the 1960s or even 1990s: France now seeks explicit multilateral guarantees before any major military action in Africa—from the UN Security Council, ECOWAS, the African Union, or the EU—in order to ensure it will not act alone and to prevent accusations of neocolonialism. This new pattern is the main reason France was initially so careful regarding a possible intervention in Mali."
"36","Unexpectedly, 2013 witnessed a second French military comeback in sub‐Saharan African, first in Mali and later in the CAR, with both operations sharing some structural similarities. To a large extent, the French intervention in Mali in January 2013 was a strategic surprise. The vast majority of foreign policy analysts had assumed that Paris was no longer able or willing to conduct direct and audacious military actions in Africa. The crisis emerged in January 2012 when a large military offensive was led from the northern part of the country by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, Tuareg nationalists of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, and Tuareg Islamists of Ansar Eddine. In addition, Amadou Haya Sanogo, a captain of the Malian military, overthrew Malian president Amadou Toumani Touré on 22 March 2012. Paris did not react at the time, mainly because French political leaders were then far busier with the coming presidential elections of May than with Mali. In accordance with the multilateral goals of the French policy toward Africa, Paris turned to its African and European allies to solve the crisis through conciliation and indirect actions. France pushed for a vote on Resolution 2071 at the UN Security Council in October 2012 to allow ECOWAS to send a 3,300‐strong multinational force to northern Mali, and at the same time, it put pressure on its European allies to launch a training mission, EUTM Mali, to rebuild the Malian military. Newly elected French president François Hollande and his advisers hoped that by doing so, they would avoid an all‐out intervention, much like what the Obama administration had intended to do in Libya in 2011 with the so‐called leadership from behind strategy: providing key assets such as air support, logistics, and intelligence with the lightest possible military footprint."
"37","These multilateral goals remained rhetorical. On 11 January 2013, northern Mali jihadists launched an unforeseen offensive to the south, reaching the outskirts of Sévaré, perhaps because they did not believe France would dare to react. President Hollande immediately ordered French helicopters based in neighboring Burkina Faso to stop the rebels' advance upon the written request of Mali's transitional authorities. This was the starting point of a vast military intervention, codenamed Operation Serval, that materialized in the deployment of 4,000 French soldiers from neighboring African bases and from the mainland, using a large variety of means: heavily armored vehicles, attack helicopters, infantry, airborne assets, fighter jets, drones, and artillery. French forces eventually retook control of the northern cities, allowing for a progressive return of Malian forces in the north, and hunted down jihadist rebels in their sanctuary of Adrar des Ifoghas with the help of Chadian forces. As French Colonel Michel Goya said in his own words, “France made a clear break with years of hesitation over the use of force in order to strike directly and violently a well‐defined enemy. Unlike generally‐accepted ideas it appeared unilateral action was still possible as long as a there was a strong political will to deploy forces on the ground and to take risks.”42                           "
"38","Although the French intervention in Mali and the one that was later launched in the CAR on 5 December 2013 (codenamed Operation Sangaris) were quite different in their objectives, they both underline the fact that successive French presidents Sarkozy and Hollande refused to take serious action at an early time when both crises had just started. In those two cases, France was later forced to get involved in what had become intricate armed conflicts in which only coercive force would be able to bring visible and rapid changes. Perhaps this statement is even more relevant for Operation Sangaris than it is for Operation Serval, considering that the mandate of the Sangaris forces was nothing less than preventing mass massacres in a country the size of France and disarming opposing sectarian‐based militias, Christian anti‐balakas, Muslim Sélékas, and other local armed groups."
"39","Both operations can be described as French responses to African conflicts, although precious European and American freight and intelligence means were provided to French troops in Mali, and despite the valuable participation of Chadian forces in the battle of Adrar des Ifoghas. Because of a lack of a credible alternative, France imposed itself as the sole power willing, capable, and, most of all, expected to act in sub‐Saharan conflicts. French forces in Mali were greeted by most Malians as liberators as they were making their way toward Islamists' northern positions, just as, a few months later, the inhabitants of Bangui, CAR's capital, expressed “relief” when French plans to restore peace in the country were made public.43,44                           "
"40","These military interventions additionally illustrate Paris's “European fatigue” regarding its African policy. The lack of involvement from EU members, whenever the issue of actual or just foreseeable intervention is raised, can alone explain this trend. France prefers to be the main non‐African actor in sub‐Saharan conflicts than to be merged in complex European missions that often lack in efficiency, when they do not stay purely virtual.45 In the CAR, France could not rely on European reinforcements at the date they were expected to start securing Bangui's airport, so that French soldiers could be redeployed elsewhere. The financial and military means promised by EU members for Operation EUFOR CAR took months to materialize, so much so that both the French ministers of defense and foreign affairs had to submit a joint declaration in March 2014 calling EU members to take responsibility and fulfill their pledge toward EUFOR CAR.46                           "
"41","Finally, both operations stress one notorious failure: French, European, and U.S. efforts to promote African military empowerment. This statement is particularly true regarding the Malian armed forces that collapsed in a couple of days when faced with the Islamist offensive of 2012, in spite of all the that training Paris and Washington had provided them. Moreover, the long‐expected ECOWAS forces only deployed after the beginning of Operation Serval."
"42","Perhaps one of the least expected consequences of both Serval and Sangaris was to prove the relevance of the numerous French military facilities in Africa, which all contributed to make those two operations logistical achievements. As a consequence, France's posture in sub‐Saharan Africa is now expected to be organized as follows: two “operational cooperation pools” in Gabon and Senegal; three “forward operational bases” in Côte d'Ivoire, United Arab Emirates, and Djibouti; and a network of military infrastructures in the Sahel region, including French forces in Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Chad, and Mauritania.47 In those five last‐named countries, nicknamed “Sahel's G5,” France reorganized its forces under a single command, known as Operation Barkhane, on 1 August 2014. This vast antiterrorism operation, headquartered in N'Djamena, relies on 3,000 French soldiers, 6 jet fighters, 20 helicopters, and 4 drones.48 Paris's military presence in Africa was therefore reinforced by Operations Serval and Sangaris, in clear contradiction of the guidelines of the 2008 Livre blanc, which had called for the closure of two French bases in Africa.            "
"43","That being said, this nested network of facilities, bases, and outposts is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and finance, as the French armed forces are facing yet another restructuring plan that should result in the loss of 24,000 personnel between 2015 and 2019. France's sustained activism in sub‐Saharan Africa in the 2008–2014 period is thus paradoxical, to say the least, given the country's limited budgetary margins and declining military means. In such a context, one would have expected French deployments in Africa to become scarce. Yet the exact opposite occurred. Since 2008, France has carried out or been involved in five sizeable deployments in Chad, Libya, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, and the CAR. Paris did so because it has interests in doing so, but also, perhaps more important, because a number of international actors, either African state leaders, the UN, other world powers, or even Africans themselves, expect France to act whenever destabilizing events arise in Francophone Africa. France consequently chose voluntarism as a foreign policy guideline in this region by choice as much as by international pressure."
"44","This undeniable overseas activism makes France quite unique in comparison to the vast majority of its European partners, which have long chosen to quit playing a direct role in international security. By doing so, France has tried to demonstrate that it is still able to shape world events in the twenty‐first century. Although all French leaders since Lionel Jospin have called for a normalization of France's relations with African countries, the ongoing French military role in this region illustrates the fact that Paris still believes that it has a unique role to play in sub‐Saharan Africa, albeit in multilateral ways, such as the Elysée Summit for Peace and Security in Africa, held in Paris in early December 2013, and gathering delegations from 53 African states as well as from international organizations. Given its political alliances in Africa; its numerous economic interests; its tens of thousands of nationals living on the continent; its vast network of schools, media, and cultural institutions; and, last but not least, the presence of its military forces in Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger, Chad, Gabon, the CAR, and Djibouti, France remains today the main, if not the sole, gendarme of sub‐Saharan Africa."
