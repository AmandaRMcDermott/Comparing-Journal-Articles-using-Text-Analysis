"1","At 30 years old, the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies has matured into a nationwide network of more than 40,000 academics, practitioners, judges, politicians, and law students dedicated to restoring conservative and libertarian legal values to America's institutions. Although it is acknowledged by both friend and foe as an organization of significant consequence, scholars and political scientists have only recently started to grapple with the important question of how exactly we ought to understand its influence on the shape and direction of American law and policy. With The Federalist Society, Michael Avery and Danielle McLaughlin enter this conversation. Written by two lawyers and targeted at a popular audience, the Federalist Society suffers from a bit of an identity crisis; it is part legal analysis, part popular journalism, and part social science. By trying to increase its audience appeal in this manner, unfortunately, The Federalist Society fails to do any of these exceedingly well.         "
"2","While it does not introduce any new evidence or original interview data, The Federalist Society's introduction and opening chapter aggregate and summarize existing scholarly and journalistic work that has been done on the Federalist Society, detailing the founding, rise, and general policy project and shared principles of the organization (pp. 1–46). The five chapters that follow vacillate between doctrine‐driven and legalistic analyses of conservative developments in several areas of constitutional law (property law, race and gender discrimination, the right to privacy, and international law) and a kind of soft process tracing that attempts to link these conservative shifts in the law to the ideas and actors of the Federalist Society network.         "
"3","While Avery and McLaughlin's research approach as they describe it (“[w]e have traced the development of the ideas of society members from articles, books, panels, and debates into legislative proposals, citizen referenda, legislation, legal briefs, court opinions, and White House policy,” p. ix) is appropriate, this approach is not carefully or rigorously executed throughout the book. For example, the authors have no systematic method for determining who is and who is not a Federalist Society member. Thus, anyone who factors prominently in their narratives of conservative influence becomes a Federalist Society “member” or “ally” (Appendix B, pp. 205–225). Because the resulting causal story is only weakly tied to the Federalist Society itself, Avery and McLaughlin manage to demonstrate only that conservative lawyers have helped bring about conservative outcomes in the law."
"4","This finding, while not ground‐breaking, if situated within a broader discussion of legal entrepreneurs and their roles in constitutional development, would have added some scholarly value to the book. However, there is no attempt in The Federalist Society to connect this case study to broader academic discussions of the mechanisms of legal and constitutional development. This is a frustrating casualty of the authors' desire to market the book to a more‐popular audience.         "
"5","Citizens and observers of American politics might benefit from Avery and McLaughlin's narratives of the history and direction of constitutional law in these critical areas. As a work of social science, however, it falls well short of the bar. Moreover, because the authors attempt to distill and discuss nuanced legal doctrines in a “common‐sense way” (p. ix), legal academics and those steeped in the law might find fault with their treatment and interpretation of these complex and complicated legal topics. In sum, as a result of the authors' attempt to reach a broader audience, The Federalist Society's contribution to serious legal or social science scholarship is disappointingly minimal.         "
