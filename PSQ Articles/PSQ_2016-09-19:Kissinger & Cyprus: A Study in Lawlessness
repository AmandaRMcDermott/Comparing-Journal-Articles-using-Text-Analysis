"1","Henry Kissinger, despite his dubious reputation outside the United States, is generally treated in this country as the equivalent of a diplomatic demigod. He is popularly revered as the most brilliant, successful practitioner of Realpolitik to have ever presided over American foreign policy. Yet Kissinger's diplomacy produced or contributed to a series of disasters in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia whose scope and magnitude was, until the administration of George W. Bush, arguably unprecedented in the history of American foreign policy."
"2","A welcome addition to the critical studies that separate the Kissinger myth from the actual historical record is found in Kissinger & Cyprus: A Study in Lawlessness by Gene Rossides. This volume is of particular interest and value for its careful and thorough deconstruction of a specific case study that offers evidence for an indictment of Kissinger's broader foreign policy record as national security adviser and later as secretary of state for Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, from 1969 to 1977. Indeed, Rossides's meticulous study underscores the catastrophic effects of Kissinger's policy for the Republic of Cyprus and, in the process, throws into sharp relief the tactics and norms that explain why Henry Kissinger has been a net loss for America's strategic interests and moral authority in the world.         "
"3","Kissinger's contempt for Cyprus's sovereignty and the country's nonaligned status since its independence from Britain in 1960, his personal hostility toward Cyprus's democratically elected president, Archbishop Makarios, and, finally, his collusion with Turkey, a state that shared Kissinger's hostility toward Cyprus, all converged in 1974 to produce a crisis. Backed by the bumbling U.S.‐dependent military dictatorship in Athens, on 15 July 1974, ultranationalist Greek Cypriot opponents of the Makarios government carried out a coup d’état, briefly toppling Makarios from power. Five days later, Turkey launched an invasion of the island's north on the pretext of restoring the constitutional order of the Republic of Cyprus. Although the coup plotters quickly capitulated and constitutional order was reestablished by the legitimate Cypriot government, ending Turkey's pretext for intervention, Turkish forces responded by expanding their invasion, occupying the northern third of the island, and forcing a mass exodus of Greek Cypriots into the south, thereby achieving Ankara's actual long‐standing goal: the partition and ethnic cleansing of Cyprus."
"4","For four decades, Kissinger has denied any role in the events that took place in Cyprus in 1974. In stark contrast to these claims, Central Intelligence Agency documents released to the public in 2007 confirm Kissinger's extensive involvement in the anti‐Makarios coup and multiple assassination attempts against Cyprus's president as well as the greenlighting of the Turkish invasion and support for Ankara's illegal occupation and forcible partition of Cyprus. Through his synthesis of primary and secondary sources, Rossides makes it clear that Washington, led by Kissinger in the midst of the collapse of the Nixon presidency, was a party to the pointless, violent destruction of Cyprus's sovereignty, an action that only served to promote instability in the eastern Mediterranean, crisis and dysfunction in NATO, enormous suffering and loss of life, and, in the final analysis, the subversion of U.S. interests, regionally and beyond."
"5","Rossides writes, “in the middle of the twentieth century, the United States led the way toward the institutionalization of international law, giving democratic voices around the world a chance to be heard. In the twenty‐first century, it should be a truism that American credibility and prestige suffer when it itself turns away from the rule of law. Yet, time and again we have had to re‐learn this lesson. It was under Henry Kissinger's tenure that many of the worst episodes of the United States acting counter to international law in the service of a mistaken sense of national interest occurred” (p. 191). The greatest worth of this case study lies in the universal relevance of its policy message conclusions."
