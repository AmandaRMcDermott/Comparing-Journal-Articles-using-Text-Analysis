"1","INTELLECTUALS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AMONG the foremost advocates of political reform in repressive autocratic states. During the early decades of the twentieth century, scholars and writers served as chief witnesses to the atrocities arising from events such as the Spanish Civil War, Nazism, and the Stalinist purges. Later, they formed the basis of the samizdat movement that played an integral part in the destruction of European communism.1 Indeed, the leftist intelligentsia of the former USSR and its satellites became some of those regimes' most ardent critics and the instigators of revolutionary political change.2 More recently, intellectuals have led calls for liberalization in the Color Revolutions of central and southern Europe, as well as sub‐Saharan Africa and the Middle East, in some cases even transitioning from academic life into new roles as politicians.3 The late Václav Havel in Czechoslovakia and Kosovo's Ibrahim Rugova are just two of the most ready examples.         "
"2","Political scientists have shown a particular inclination to support reform, and indeed, many in the Western academy regard the advancement of freedom, justice, and democracy in the world as a matter of professional duty. For instance, Samuel Huntington argued in his 1987 presidential address to the American Political Science Association that “Political science is not just an intellectual discipline, but also a moral one…. Political scientists want to do good, [and] the impetus to do good in the sense of promoting political reform is embedded in our profession.”4 Likewise, Lucian Pye stressed the responsibility of political scientists “to enlighten the world about the current crisis of authoritarianism,” conveying a similar ethic of democracy promotion in his own address three years later.5 This spirit of normative entrepreneurship reflects what Jerome Karabel calls the “moralist tradition” in the sociology of knowledge, which counts Seymour Martin Lipset, John Stuart Mill, Karl Mannheim, Ivan Szeleny, Alvin W. Gouldner, Robert J. Brym, and Pierre Bourdieu among its adherents. One problem with this view, however, is that it provides “an idealized normative form of reference for thinking about intellectuals rather than an empirically grounded analytical one [emphasis in original].”6 This article adopts this more empiricist outlook by developing and then testing a three‐part schematic of democratizing forces in political science—autonomy from the state, internal pluralism giving voice to minority or opposition views, and the articulation of those views through scholarly criticism.         "
"3","An interrogation of extant predictions concerning how political scientists behave under the variable constraints imposed by different structural conditions serves as the basic building block of this approach. One view, which might be termed the “structuralist‐functionalist” approach, contends that intellectuals not only serve the state but can be found almost anywhere. “As the symbiosis of political and intellectual institutions advances, so does the eventuality of intellect speaking for rather than to power” [emphasis in original], argues one author writing from this perspective.7 However, the nature and effect of that service is, to a large extent, determined by the institutional context in which intellectuals are embedded. In dictatorships of Leninist stock, the configuration of domestic structures typically results in intellectuals being co‐opted into bureaucratic alliances, leaving them with little choice but to serve state interests.8 What is not anticipated by this view, however, is the voluntary complicity of scholars in preserving authoritarianism after those states begin to liberalize.         "
"4","By contrast, the moralist tradition treats intellectuals, including political scientists, as an avant garde class that is inherently and constantly in conflict with (or critical of) state power. In the context of an authoritarian state, the approach anticipates that scholars will challenge the prevailing patterns of domination and exclusion, and push for a democratic alternative. The landmark study of György Konrád and Iván Szelényi, for example, envisions intellectuals as a revolutionary social class motivated by a conviction that “the dictatorship of the proletariat is a myth, an ideology which legitimizes the power of an oppressive new social force.”9 In some formulations, the objectives of political scientists in particular are deemed so antagonistic to the interests of autocrats that the discipline cannot meaningfully exist under those circumstances. As Huntington writes            "
"5","It is impossible to have political scientists in the absence of political participation, and political science has only developed with the expansion of political participation. In a society in which there is no participation—no competition for power—political scientists would have nothing to do. Consequently, it is not surprising that a market propensity tends to prevail among economists and a participatory or democratic propensity among political scientists. Command economies have no use for economists, nor authoritarian politics for political scientists."
"6","Thus he articulates his central empirical premise:            "
"7","Where democracy is strong, political science is strong; where democracy is weak, political science is weak. Authoritarian societies may produce and in some cases have produced Nobel Prize‐winning physicists, biologists, novelists and statesmen; they do not produce great political scientists. The emergence of democracy encourages the development of political science and the development of political science can and has in small ways contributed to the emergence and stabilization of democracy.10"
"8","Put another way, democracy and political science tend to develop in tandem and are mutually reinforcing. Thus, in strong authoritarian states, we generally expect to observe at most a stunted, anemic version of political science, and even where gradual liberalization facilitates the blossoming of political science, we should expect it to help further and consolidate democratic opening, not reinforce the status quo. On the other hand, one recent study showed that Chilean political science not only survived but thrived under Augusto Pinochet, experiencing higher levels of research output during his rule than it has since his downfall, suggesting that the propensity for intellectual resistance not only increases with state repression, but that the authoritarian climate in which Chilean scholars operated drove the reformist project.11"
"9","Crucially, however, neither of these approaches sees its predictions borne out in the case of China, where political science has developed against a backdrop of rigid authoritarianism, as in Chile, yet produces much research that promotes authoritarian durability, not democratic reform. From the moralist standpoint, this simply should not be, since political scientists are naturally predisposed to challenge state power and promote change. Moreover, if political reform encourages political science, and vice versa, as the Huntingtonian variant of moralism suggests it should, China's slow but steady liberalization since 1978 should have produced a change toward democracy‐promoting research in its national political science community. Likewise, if political scientists in authoritarian regimes serve the state because the configuration of domestic structures leaves them little choice, as predicted by the structuralist‐functionalist model, then the declining significance of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) apparatchiks in institutions of higher learning in recent decades should have led to more authentically democracy‐promoting scholarship."
"10","Instead, modest increases in intellectual freedom have been used to advance research agendas abetting the CCP's efforts to relegitimate itself, and have thereby helped to strengthen and perpetuate authoritarian rule rather than end it. A small but genuinely liberal movement within the discipline peaked around 1989 and then declined, only to be replaced by a “new left” that is highly critical of democracy, and a neo‐authoritarian right emphasizing practical, policy‐oriented research that meets the needs of the government. Most recently, the movement to indigenize Chinese political science has rejected “Western” political science paradigms and has instead focused on developing home‐grown approaches to specifically address the Party's most‐pressing governance challenges and therefore strengthen its power monopoly. In real terms, this suggests that the normative proclivities and mission of political scientists may not be the same everywhere, and may even be diametrically opposed in certain cases. As Theodore Lowi writes, “Consonance between the state and political science is a problem worthy of the attention of every political scientist.”12 Never was this more true than in a situation in which political science actively supports and strengthens dictatorship.         "
"11","How would we know whether political science was strengthening democratic reform in a given context? What signs might we look for? Recognizing democracy‐promoting political science when we see it is not only the first step toward understanding the discipline's role in China, but is important because the collapse of authoritarian states can sometimes occur with little or no warning.13 For the purpose of testing the relationship between political science and democratization, democracy is understood here as “a system of governance in which rulers are held accountable for their actions in the public realm by citizens, acting indirectly through the competition and cooperation of their elected representatives,” and therefore as conceptually and measurably distinct from authoritarian regimes where these conditions are absent.14"
"12","When and where democracy and political science are mutually reinforcing, the discipline normally exhibits three distinct but interrelated characteristics. First, it typically shows a nominal degree of autonomy from the state in which it exists. This means that the discipline maintains its own set of preferences, unanchored from those of the state, which exercises no formal controls over political science curricula, textbooks, or research agendas.15 In this sense, it bears the same relationship to the state as civil society organizations in liberal democracies more broadly, where the separateness of such groups helps ensure that their activities are not functionally dependent on the state.16 Of course, a relationship with the state is a feature of political science in developed democracies.17 The requirement of autonomy does not mean that political scientists in these places cannot or do not address government concerns, or that their interests do not overlap with those of the state from time to time. One author even calls U.S. political science “a product of the state,” owing to the pervasiveness of state‐oriented methods and approaches found there.18 Moreover, all states have a stake in higher education and in supporting the research capability of faculties, just as most scholars have ample enough motivation to accept that support. Thus, democratic governments may bankroll political scientists to some degree, as is the case in Canada, where a federal granting body, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, is a leading supporter of political science research. In such cases, however, the lack of formal control or oversight of political science makes state‐centric or state‐serving research a strictly voluntary enterprise, something that originates within the discipline itself and is more the product of professional norms than of government pressure.         "
"13","Second, where political science promotes democracy, it tends to be more internally pluralistic. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, for example, the formal autonomy of scholars from the state fosters a diversity of academic interests, resulting in an “ill‐defined, amorphous, heterogeneous discipline,” rich with a variety of intellectual traditions, agendas, and objectives.19 This is because, as Mannheim wrote more than 75 years ago, the intelligentsia comprises “the most diverse social classes and groups with all possible points of view,” and therefore represents “the fullest possible synthesis of the tendencies of an epoch.”20 Greater pluralism within academic communities serves to strengthen democracy by promoting a sense of inclusiveness and voice through the formulation and execution of research programs on subjects that other actors, including the state, may sometimes ignore. Indeed, as one member of the discipline argues, it is the job of political science “to explore in the most rigorous ways all topics that are arguably politically fundamental, with special attention to those that are predictably neglected, for both intellectual and political reasons, by governmental and private‐sector analysts, politicians and the media. … That is about as scientific and serviceable to democracy as we can honestly get.”21"
"14","In addition to reflecting a breadth of interests and groups in society more generally, democracy‐promoting political science also tends to encompass a wide range of ontological, epistemological, and methodological profiles. As Lowi puts it, “there is not one science of politics, but several” that contribute to the health of democracy.22 In the United States, historic intra‐disciplinary rifts such as the one between behavioralists and non‐behavioralists in the 1960s, or the much more recent backlash of the perestroika movement against the perceived hegemony of quantitative and formal methods, speak to the considerable divergence of intellectual perspectives among American political scientists, and to the internally diverse, “big tent” nature of the discipline. One recent study found that although U.S. political science has become more developed and professionalized over the last few decades, it is, in fact, a community of specialists, with most scholars contributing only to their subfield or specific areas of interest.23 Outside the United States, these intra‐disciplinary camps may be even larger and more numerous, considering the greater breadth of ontological profiles found among scholars in places like the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.24"
"15","Third, democracy‐promoting political science is critical, meaning that it serves as a check on state power, blowing the whistle when governments overstep their bounds, systematically exclude, or ostracize one group in favor of others, or otherwise behave in non‐democratic ways. Exercising and protecting this function is the purview of all political scientists, since the fundamental responsibility of intellectuals is, as Noam Chomsky once put it, “to speak the truth and expose lies.”25 Fulfilling the role of watchdog requires more than bold inquisition, however. It also depends upon the dissemination and consumption of political research in society more broadly.26 The ability of scholars to impart democracy‐promoting values that become embedded in society largely rests with their ability to mobilize “cultural capital” and wield influence as educators.27 Thus, teaching is among the most politically significant duties of political scientists, who best promote democracy when they give their students the necessary tools to become critical citizens.         "
"16","If autonomy, pluralism, and scrutiny of state behavior are the hallmarks of political science in liberal environments, then political science in liberalizing countries should show some signs of becoming increasingly autonomous, pluralistic, and critical as well. Yet, despite more than 30 years of reform, political science in China shows little progress on any of these accounts, a fact that raises doubts about the universality of the discipline's democracy‐promoting character and suggests significant variation in the normative proclivities of political scientists internationally. Indeed, as the remainder of the article indicates, many of China's political scientists throughout the reform era have served state interests above those of genuine democratization, and today play an active role in reinforcing CCP rule."
"17","As with virtually all intellectuals in China during the Cultural Revolution, political scientists were denigrated by Mao as the “stinking old ninth” of class enemies.28 Thus, it was not until after his death and the initiation of Deng Xiaoping's reform program that modern Chinese political science began to emerge in its present form. On 30 March 1979, in a speech commissioned by the CCP's Central Committee concerning the practical challenges of economic restructuring facing the Party, Deng declared, “We have neglected political science, law, sociology and the study of world politics over the years, and now we need to make up the missed classes as soon as possible.”29 Over the next two years, new departments of political science were created at Wuhan and Jilin Universities, and those that existed prior to 1949 at Fudan, Peking, and Tsinghua were reopened. The Chinese Political Science Association (CPSA), having been initially created in 1932, was also re‐established in Beijing in 1980, together with a new Political Science Research Institute housed within the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Local professional organizations, such as the Shanghai and Hubei Political Science Associations, emerged soon thereafter. The CPSA also became a member of the International Political Science Association in 1984, and several notable Chinese political scientists, including Wang Huning—who served as a key adviser to Jiang Zemin and later became head of the Central Secretariat of the CCP and Director of the Policy Research Office—participated in international disciplinary gatherings.            "
"18","The most important tasks during the initial phase of reemergence were to clearly define what political science was and what its relationship to China's reform process and political system should be. At the CPSA's inaugural meeting in December 1980, conference delegates approved a five‐year National Program of Political Science Research (1981–1985), articulating a general consensus among members that the activities of the discipline should assist in the country's modernization. According to Article 3 of the newly adopted CPSA bylaws, the express purpose of the organization was:               "
"19","Under the guidance of Marxism, following the principle of combining theory with practice, [to] implement the policy of ‘letting 100 schools of thought contend,’ affirm the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, carry out creative research on political theories, on history of political thought, on political systems, on [the] history of political systems, on political parties, on administration and management, on international relations, and on other problems of political science, in order to enliven the enterprise of Chinese political science, in the service of reforming and perfecting the socialist political system, to build China into a strong, socialist country which is highly democratic, highly civilized, and modernized [emphasis added].30"
"20","Throughout the Deng years, there remained a strong impetus for political scholars to justify their existence in terms of government needs. Writing for PS: Political Science and Politics, one mainland scholar pointedly stated at the time that “the revival and strengthening of political science research in China now is mainly intended to improve our socialist system.”31 Similarly, a review of the journal Zhengzhixue Yanjiu [Political Science Research], argued that in order to “demonstrate the need for the study of political science, its practitioners had to show its utility in terms of the Four Modernizations”—the official name given to Deng's plan to relegitimize socialism as the country transitioned from Maoism to markets.32 In practice, this meant privileging public policy analysis, foreign affairs, and other areas of research yielding directly relevant and practicable insights beneficial to the regime, in accordance with the Party's 1987 recognition of the discipline's instrumental value.33"
"21","China's opening to the outside world did bring about the internationalization of its revitalized political science community, however. Although most of the country's leading thinkers on political questions during the totalitarian period were not trained as political scientists at all, the relaxation of Maoist controls allowed more mainlanders to receive their professional training from foreign institutions, especially in the United States, Japan, and Europe, though most continued to be educated domestically. A straw poll of two of the country's largest departments reveals that 28 percent of the faculty at Peking University held foreign doctorates, mostly from the United States and Japan, while 32 percent do not have a PhD. At Fudan, about 14 percent are foreign‐trained, with 21.6 percent having no doctorate.34 Additionally, the 1980s saw an increase in collaboration and exchange between Chinese political scientists and several high‐profile figures in the American discipline, including Robert A. Dahl, Gabriel A. Almond, Martin Lipset, and David Easton.35 The result was the import of explanatory paradigms and approaches prominent in the United States to China. “Scientific socialism,” as it had traditionally been studied, was pushed into the background as the Chinese discipline came to more closely resemble its Western counterpart epistemologically, methodologically, and theoretically.36 The import of American‐style political science also brought with it a foreign professional culture imposing new standards of excellence that still affect the Chinese discipline today. For example, the publication of research findings in English rather than Chinese remains highly prized in many mainland departments.37"
"22","By far the most important consequence of increased exposure to the Western discipline during this period was the transformative influence of modernization theory. The introduction and translation of several seminal books in the mid‐to‐late 1980s, especially Almond and Sydney Verba's The Civic Culture, Huntington's Political Order in Changing Societies, and Dahl's Participation and Opposition, marked the emergence of a distinctly liberal tradition in Chinese political science, one that envisioned regime change as the endgame of China's economic development and took a strong, normative, even teleological stance in support of democratization.38 Many adherents of liberalism in this 1980s cohort of Chinese political scientists sought to reconcile the goal of political reform with the needs of China's social market economy, portraying social democracy as a bona fide branch of socialist theory compatible with China's development and even praising Scandinavian‐style social democracy as a possible model for emulation in China.39 Some also addressed village self‐government as a means to develop a template for democratization at higher levels.40 Others, however, advocated more‐profound structural changes at the uppermost echelons of government. Chief among them was Yan Jiaqi, director of the Institute of Political Science in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a close adviser of reformist then‐Premier Zhao Ziyang. As Yan himself would write in 1987, “the basic aims of [liberal reformers] are to alter the highly centralized system to create a socialist political system with a high degree of democracy.”41"
"23","The immediate aftermath of the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989 saw the regime go on the attack against political science as a locus of counter‐revolutionary support. As the public face of support for democracy among political scientists, Yan Jiaqi was forced into exile for his attempts to replace the regime with a “Western bourgeois republic.”42 A series of measures designed specifically to limit the political impact of the discipline were also introduced, including a decision of the State Education Commission not to allow the further enrollment of students as political science majors, the removal of existing students with a concentration in the social sciences from their home institutions, and the imposition of strict limits on the number who could go abroad, in order to minimize exposure to Western ideas. For a period of two years following the protests, a virtual moratorium was imposed on foreign scholars visiting Chinese departments. Additionally, some faculty and students remaining in the discipline were required to submit a 5,000‐word paper assessing their behavior over the previous year and, in some cases, to file a “confession and exposure form” detailing their participation in “counter‐socialist crimes.”43"
"24","The more lasting effect of the crackdown, however, was a sea change in the ideological composition of the discipline, which effectively ended calls for democratization. To be sure, state responses to the protests deepened the resolve of some observers to encourage democracy, but these sentiments were primarily restricted to isolated pockets of Chinese‐born scholars working abroad. In China proper, liberals only comprised a tiny minority of intellectuals.44"
"25","More importantly, however, the domestic climate after the Tiananmen Square protests was such that discussions of regime change were shelved. Joseph Fewsmith describes the “emergence of an intellectual universe…very different from that of the previous decade,” divided against itself, in which many Chinese intellectuals, including political scientists, came to more closely identify with and defend the actions and interests of their government in response to the uproar of foreign human rights organizations, and U.S. outcry in particular.45 Liberal ideology was the prime casualty. In one especially famous example, famed novelist and liberal Ha Jin was publicly scolded by his colleagues, including some U.S.‐educated former liberals, for “engaging in a polemic that portrayed the Chinese as ignorant and repressed.”46 Professor Liu Yiqing, who led the charge against Ha, referred to him as a “tool used by the American media to vilify China.”47"
"26","By the late 1990s, several other factors had arisen contributing to a growing sense of disillusionment with modernization theory, further eroding support for democratic reform. Most importantly, substantive political change had failed to materialize, while Deng's authoritarianism had succeeded in stimulating economic growth. With modernization theory's credibility already strained by a lack of systemic change, mainland scholars began to write openly and frankly about the failed predictions of modernization theory and the “poverty” of liberalism.48 This sentiment was only exacerbated by the more‐general downturn in Sino‐U.S. relations with which it coincided. The American role in the 1996 Taiwan Straits missile crisis, the perceived Western capitalist causes of the 1997 Asian economic meltdown (including U.S. pressure to participate in a floating currency exchange, which the Chinese refused but nevertheless saw as a catalyst of financial strife throughout the region) and the accidental 1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy by an American plane in Belgrade all added to the mounting malaise with U.S.‐style liberalism.49 In little more than a decade, this gave way to new disciplinary alignments reflected, on the one hand, by a “new left”—represented by the work of Cui Ziyuan, Pan Wei, and others—that was highly critical of liberalism and eager to promote socialist and in some instances Maoist ideas, and on the other hand, disenchantment over the slow pace of reform, economic and otherwise, that led some observers such as Wang Huning to advocate a distinct brand of neo‐authoritarianism geared toward serving the interests of the Party‐state.50 As Fu Zhengyuan explains, “neo‐authoritarianism started with the assumption that the price to be paid for economic development was authoritarian politics.”51 Taking their cues from regional exemplars like South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, where dictatorship provided a steady basis for development, Chinese political scientists sought to more earnestly promote political stability—and hence, economic growth—under the auspices of authoritarianism.52 Lynn White relates that the idea of Chinese neo‐authoritarianism “received crucial support from abroad,” and notes young Chinese intellectuals, many of them U.S.‐educated, as being among its advocates.53"
"27","Over the next decade, these seemingly disparate critiques crystallized into a unified movement within Chinese political science against what had come to be seen as the long‐standing hegemony of Western concepts in the discipline. Inspired by the landmark volume of Wang Shaoguang, Chu Yunhan, and Zhao Quansheng, this so‐called “indigenization” of political science in China is premised on the uniqueness of China's political system and culture, the inability of foreign theories to sufficiently understand or explain them, and the need to develop distinctly Chinese tools and approaches to meet the needs of China's government.54 As one supporter of the movement contends, “paradigms of western comparative politics cannot be a reliable basis for analyzing China's political practice. As researchers, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance” against the influence of alien political theories.55 Others write of the “stagnation” of Chinese political studies caused by a lack of indigenous research methods.56 Although grounded partly in a belief in the advancement of knowledge for its own sake, these sentiments are also driven by an unapologetic desire to serve the interests of the authoritarian state. According to Fu, “The ‘Chinese character’ expressed in scholarly work includes the idea of infallibility of the political leader whose views should be defended by social scientists.”57 One advocate proposes creating a “Political Science with Chinese Characteristics” that is both “nation‐centered” and “service‐oriented,” the upshot of which he envisions as the demonstrable usefulness of the Chinese discipline while “American political science struggles for relevance outside of its academic setting.”58 In some instances, scholarship of this type carries the protection of single‐party hegemony a step further by attempting to derail possible alternatives. For example, some speak of the “ulterior motives” behind deliberative democracy experiments, which, they claim, are meant to lay the groundwork for democratic citizenship and eventual regime change.59"
"28","Such views are not apocryphal, but reflect a great and growing consensus among mainland political scientists. To wit, in 2009, a roundtable convened by the Fudan Institute for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences posed Western and Chinese political studies as competing and fundamentally divergent models of the discipline, revealing significant support for a regime‐serving vision of Chinese political science.60 First‐hand observers of the meeting likened support for indigenization to the perestroika movement in American political science, something that suggests that its endorsement is not confined merely to isolated pockets of the mainland discipline but reflects a broadly shared and altogether different interpretation of what Chinese political science is and ought to be.61 The Journal of Chinese Political Science also devoted a set of special issues to indigenization in 2009–10, which collectively highlights the salience and widespread approval of the movement's central mission and message. Writing of the break‐down of Cold War‐era liberal/socialist schisms, one proponent of the movement refers to the growing unity of purpose among political scholars as the “new dogmatism” in Chinese political science.62 Likewise, Yu Keping has recently argued for a “unified” brand of Chinese political science that is reformist, yet ultimately regime‐serving and committed to Marxism.63 For these reasons, one scholar visiting from the United States in 2009 “found the country's academic culture to be at odds with its embrace of the West and change.”64"
"29","As with other areas of intellectual inquiry, the study of politics in China has historically been subject to the interests of the state, far more so than was the case for the disciplines of either North America or the United Kingdom. Consequently, political scholars in China have found their moral and intellectual autonomy severely limited by the structural constraints and prohibitions imposed by the government of the day.65 China also has a long tradition of co‐opting “scholar‐officials” [shi daifu] into bureaucratic alliances in a manner that tends to reinforce rather than undermine prevailing institutional conditions. Such was certainly the case during the Maoist years, when all forms of political science save the study of scientific socialism were seen as inimical to the goals of the revolution, and were banned. However, Chinese scholars now enjoy greater academic freedom than at virtually any point since 1949.66 The increased structural autonomy afforded political scientists by more than 30 years of reform and opening up means that they support the regime more and more by choice. Indeed, the great irony of political science in China today is that indigenization is a scholar‐led rather than a state‐led phenomenon, and, through its emphasis on the special characteristics and needs of China's political system, embodies a conscious, concerted effort to improve—and therefore bolster and prolong—authoritarian governance. The regime itself does little to enforce this state of affairs, though it certainly benefits from and encourages it.67"
"30","This largely voluntary focus on developing Chinese tools and theories to tackle specifically Chinese problems has only stunted the development of greater pluralism in Chinese political science. As one participant in the Fudan roundtable suggests, indigenization inherently stifles diversity by choking off the full range of methods and approaches found in political science internationally.68 Thus, it exacerbates the already‐acute lack of ontological variance in the discipline; empirical articles based on behavioralism, rational choice, or new institutionalism comprise some 96 percent of all research published in the China Academic Journals full‐text database.69 Areas of study geared toward justifying or advising CCP policy are also highly developed relative to those that are not. Recent surveys indicate that political theory (especially studies of the Chinese variants of Marxism) and policy analysis are the most‐prominent subfields, with public administration yielding by far the largest overall proportion of published research.70 By contrast, comparative politics is woefully underdeveloped. Adherence to an exceptionalism that views China as impervious to social science predictions about democracy and economic development and that treats the use of non‐Chinese paradigms as a form of intellectual imperialism has caused many to turn their backs on comparative generalizing, limiting the potential for diversification and expansion of the field.71 While the study of China's political process stands to gain from the increased attention of the indigenization movement, it, too, lags behind, the potential for its future development hamstrung by a preoccupation with serving Party policy. Indeed, studies of China's political system remain remarkably narrow, considering the improvements in access to political officials and opportunities for innovative fieldwork made possible by post‐Mao liberalization. At present, most research in this area abets authoritarianism directly through a focus on the improvement of governance capacity (zhizheng nengli), the cultivation of a relatively well‐off society (xiaokang shehui), and the maintenance of political stability (zhengzhi wending), all of which have been named as top priorities by the Hu‐Wen administration and are seen as essential, non‐negotiable pillars of continued CCP legitimacy.72 An increasing proportion also addresses questions of Party legitimacy directly, recognizing it as “the key element reflecting the governance capacity of the ruling party, as well as an important factor for the party to hold a stable ruling position.”73 Two separate studies point to a steep increase since 2002 in articles dedicated to shoring up legitimacy in Party School journals, to which political scientists are regular contributors.74"
"31","A similar lack of diversity can be found in Chinese international relations(IR), where realism has been far and away the dominant perspective since the 1980 s.75 The most‐obvious explanation for this is that the inherently state‐centric focus of realism dovetails neatly with the central government's vision of China as an ascendant world power. For example, Yan Xuetong, probably China's most well‐known IR scholar and Director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University, has written extensively on the geopolitics of China's rise and is heavily influenced by realist thought.76 However, as Steve Chan explains, “Chinese views on international order have been closely tied to, and indeed inspired and motivated by beliefs about the nature of proper domestic order.”77 This explains the growing clamor among mainland scholars for a distinctly “Chinese School” of IR theory influenced by (yet clearly differentiated from) “western” realism.78 It also suggests why liberal approaches—the chief rival to realism in U.S. universities—are not more prevalent in Chinese departments; such theories are replete with references to the way in which domestic factors such as public will act as constraints on state behavior, and are thus more given to hypothesizing about how different types of domestic structures might influence the voicing of opposition viewpoints, and hence the conduct of China's international affairs. Approaches rooted in a unitary conception of the national interest suit the current concerns of the Party far better.         "
"32","Of course, the prevalence of realism in Chinese IR at present hardly forecloses the future development of home‐grown approaches to China's place in global politics. Several mainland scholars have explored the potential for uniquely Chinese IR theory, with many arguing that the country's growing economic, political, and military strength necessitates the cultivation of native thinking.79 A leading contender in this regard is the concept of tianxia (meaning “all under heaven”), which, its proponents claim, is a distinctly Chinese vision of world order premised on “a universal agreement in the ‘hearts’ of all peoples.”80 Rooted in ancient Chinese philosophy and culture, tianxia essentially envisions the reconstitution of all political relationships along the lines of the family, according to the principles of loyalty, obedience, and filiality. Such a theory not only lends moral authority to the CCP's policy of facilitating China's rise and international prestige through soft‐power projection, but also helps to restore its image domestically, lending credibility to existing patterns of representation and decision making.81 As described in one recent monograph, the concept of tianxia “refers to a hierarchical system that values order over freedom, ethics over law, and elite governance over democracy and human rights.”82"
"33","Finally, China's political science community has not become appreciably more critical as liberalization has proceeded. In part, the absence of critical discourse is a function of the lack of internal diversity in the discipline. Most varieties of critical theory that gained acceptance in North America in the early 1990s and remain especially popular in European political science have never taken off in China. For example, little if any mainland scholarship focuses on gender hierarchies, and the subfields known as gender in politics or women in politics are virtually unknown in Chinese departments.83 Jing and Wang show that articles based on feminist approaches to research account for just 2 percent of all those appearing in the China Academic Journals Full‐Text Database.84 Other so‐called critical approaches fared no better, with “interpretive” theories registering just 2 percent collectively, whereas post‐modernism was not even included among those sampled in the study.         "
"34","To the extent that criticism does exist, it is largely expressed through official channels in order to maximize policy benefits. As one mainland scholar put it, “Criticism is tolerated and even welcomed if the goal is to provide recommendations on how to solve public policy problems.”85 This corroborates the finding of Gu and Goldman that although “some establishment intellectuals may criticize the regime, the majority do not. Critical establishment intellectuals may seek to promote reform of the regime or even a transition of the regime, but none seek the regime's collapse. They want reform within the establishment.”86 Thus, scholarly critiques generally come in the form of constructive recommendations geared toward improving state responsiveness to social demands for better, more‐efficient public goods provision. Often this takes place by way of political scientists' participation in state‐sponsored think tanks and research institutes, which have played an influential role in the design, implementation, and improvement of many local governance innovations, among other areas.87 Some have also noted extensive cooperation between Party School branches and academic institutions in exploring options for ideological adaption, which is vital to the task of (re)legitimating the CCP and preserving its rule.88 Delivered in this way, through connections to a network of quasi‐governmental bodies, critical research forms the crux of a new policy complex in which the authoritarian state is the chief client of political science, and is provided with advice enabling “endogenous” or contained institutional reforms, the main effect of which, as Kellee Tsai has argued, is to forestall larger uncontained changes.89"
"35","The case of political science in China confounds the expectations of two leading schools of thought concerning how political scientists behave under authoritarian conditions. First, contrary to predictions of the moralist tradition, the discipline actively supports the current regime instead of undermining it. Second, while increasing intellectual autonomy from the state, the slackening of authoritarian structures since 1978 ultimately failed to produce the sort of substantive changes in cooperation and service from political scientists that the structuralist‐functionalist model suggests it should have. As demonstrated by the three‐part framework developed here, Chinese political science has regressed in this and other measurable ways conventionally associated with the discipline's promotion of democracy; it is neither particularly pluralistic nor critical of the regime it serves, but instead fortifies CCP rule through the provision of policy advice beneficial to Party performance and legitimacy. The indigenization movement engenders some of the most‐recent evidence to this effect, working cooperatively but voluntarily with the Party‐state. Using theories and methods designed to meet the CCP's political and developmental agenda, it displays a preference for criticism within the system over criticism of the system, and a devotion to rehabilitating rather than replacing authoritarian rule.

"36","In making this discovery, this paper has laid the foundations for a rethinking of the conventional intelligentsia‐state nexus, one suited to a world in which authoritarianism appears resilient and adaptable. Criticism of the status quo has long been at the heart of the very definition of intellectuals, conventionally conceived. However, several factors discussed here suggest why Chinese political science deviates from this pattern. Disaffection with modernization theory and the decline of liberalism, the related sentiments that Chinese political science was for too long dominated by “western” analytical approaches, that these are ill‐suited to understanding China, and that Chinese political science should have practical applications that advance state interests all speak to an antipathy toward “foreign” and democracy‐promoting models of the discipline. Of course, there is no guarantee that just because political scientists in China are not pushing for democratization at present means they could not or would not do so in the future. It is certainly true that there is ample room under the current political climate for new fields of inquiry to open up, with probably the greatest room for expansion being in comparative politics. What is of most concern, however, is the question of how and why the mainland discipline may further blossom. If the current trajectory holds, then it is likely that the maturation of Chinese and comparative politics will continue to aid and abet one‐Party rule. This assertion is not meant to discourage those who seek to advance democracy in China and abroad from following their conscience, but rather to suggest that this task should be approached with humility, sobriety, and a realistic sense of what can be accomplished. Given that political scientists can and in some cases do as much to inhibit democratization as promote it, claims about their role as reformers need to be re‐examined and expectations re‐calibrated. Generalizations about the connection between political science and political reform may in fact be heavily bounded and subject to qualification, as the most‐insightful generalizations often are. One possibility is that regimes, be they democratic or authoritarian, tend to reproduce types of political science that are self‐strengthening. Another line of inquiry worth pursuing involves taking stock of the plurality of epistemic communities that comprise the discipline of political science internationally, mapping the cross‐national variance in attitudes toward the attainment of different social goods, including order, democracy, or pursuit of the former at the latter's expense. At the very least, we in the Western academy should be prepared for the possibility that the motivations and moral imperatives of political scientists around the world might be more differentiated than previously thought, or that the creature known as political science in authoritarian settings may be a different kind of animal altogether."
