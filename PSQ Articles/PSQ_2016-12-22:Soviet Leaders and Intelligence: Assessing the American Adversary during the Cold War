"1","There are very few people who can write about Soviet leaders’ thinking and the role that intelligence played in shaping their views with the authority that Raymond Garthoff can and does in his new book. For students of the Cold War, Garthoff's work is widely recognized. Among others, he has written two important books on the Cold War: Détente and Confrontation: American–Soviet Relations from Nixon to Reagan and The Great Transition: American–Soviet Relations and the End of the Cold War. In his new book, Garthoff seeks to answer a more precise question, on which current scholarship is scant at best: how did Soviet leaders use intelligence to assess the American threat during the Cold War? The question cannot be more timely: as much as leaders in the United States are trying to gauge the intentions of their nondemocratic adversaries, they are equally interested in understanding how the adversary reaches conclusions about the United States’ intentions and capabilities.         "
"2","The unique combination of Garthoff's background as a Central Intelligence Agency analyst on Soviet affairs during the Cold War and (later) as U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria allows him to take us beyond the available official and declassified record of how Soviet leaders and intelligence officers perceived and at times misperceived—U.S. intentions and goals during the Cold War. He leverages a host of sources to address this important question, drawing on newly declassified documents as well as interviews and conversations with former Soviet intelligence analysts and officials in the Soviet leadership."
"3","The book is organized chronologically, beginning with Joseph Stalin and ending with Mikhail Gorbachev. Each chapter is dedicated to explaining how the perceptions and policy objectives of each Soviet political leader and his respective intelligence chiefs intersected and the extent to which intelligence assessments shaped (or more often, were shaped by) the views of primary decision makers. Garthoff's account of how Soviet leaders used, ignored, and misused intelligence is fascinating. It concludes that “overall, intelligence fared poorly in competition with other influences and sources of information and that, in the end, a bold decision by the USSR's last leader to alter fundamentally the Soviet conception of international politics ended America's status as the Soviet Union's main adversary” (p. ix). Garthoff additionally finds that Soviet leaders’ judgments were informed largely by their own experiences and that intelligence played a larger role in unearthing U.S. military and technological capabilities but was weak on understanding U.S. intentions. As a student of intelligence assessments and intentions, I was greatly encouraged to find that Garthoff's conclusions are consistent with the findings of my own book—Knowing the Adversary: Leaders, Intelligence, and Assessment of Intentions in International Relations—regarding how American and British leaders evaluated Soviet and German intentions, respectively. Remarkably, notwithstanding important differences between the different countries, very similar patterns of behavior hold.         "
"4","Garthoff's book makes several important contributions to scholarship on the Cold War, intelligence studies, and international relations theory. First, for a variety of reasons, most of our understanding, and theorizing, about the role of intelligence comes from studies of how intelligence functions in democratic societies. Soviet Leadership and Intelligence thus sheds important light on the dynamic between decision makers and intelligence in nondemocratic countries. Second, this study, unlike many in the intelligence literature, is not preoccupied with explaining a particular “intelligence failure”; rather, it provides a more nuanced, intriguing, and convincing interpretation of a pattern of behavior across Soviet leaders with regard to their use of intelligence that explains how they reached conclusions about U.S. intentions. Finally, this book adds to a growing literature on the role of intelligence in perceiving or misperceiving intentions. The conclusion that intelligence did not play a primary role in shaping basic Soviet perceptions of the United States is not trivial, and it carries with it significant policy implications.         "
