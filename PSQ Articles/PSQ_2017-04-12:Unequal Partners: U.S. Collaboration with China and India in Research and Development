"1","FOR MORE THAN SEVEN DECADES, leadership in technological innovation has sustained the unique position of the United States in the international system. From nuclear energy to the Internet, U.S. preeminence in pioneering new technologies has been an important source of the country's economic affluence and military might. In this context, it is not surprising that scholars now debate how rapidly emerging powers—particularly China and India—are developing their own capacities for innovation. Thus far, this debate has reached no consensus. Some scholars are impressed with the Asian giants' innovation trajectories, others criticize various weaknesses in their national innovation systems, and still others remain essentially undecided.1"
"2","While this debate has featured impressive scholarship, it has left a critical question unaddressed: how important have China and India become as partners for the United States in technological innovation? Whereas multinational companies in the past moved manufacturing overseas but conducted research and development (R&D) in their home countries, more and more of them now conduct R&D abroad. In 2013, for example, U.S. companies invested more than US$49 billion in R&D overseas through their foreign affiliates.2 In fact, some U.S. firms are establishing R&D networks that span the globe: IBM Research, for example, now has 12 labs on six continents.3 As a result of these processes, scholars and pundits frequently refer to “the globalization of R&D.” The roles of China and India in this phenomenon have attracted particular attention in recent years.4"
"3","To what extent is the globalization of R&D leading to American reliance on the world's two most prominent rising powers? It may be that China and India remain marginal players in this process. There are other possibilities, however. In 2005, Thomas Friedman of the New York Times described the world as increasingly “flat”—a global economy in which high‐tech industries and jobs flow easily from one country to another, with both China and India increasingly important players.5 Some have even suggested that U.S. innovative capacity is “hollowing out” as multinationals take advantage of less expensive but well‐educated technical workers in the Asian giants.6 For its part, the U.S. National Intelligence Council has argued that “a shift in the technological center of gravity from West to East and South, which has already begun, almost certainly will continue as the flows of companies, ideas, entrepreneurs, and capital from the developed to the developing markets increase.”7 Others suggest we may be witnessing the beginning of “a historic shift in the global loci of innovation and power” as China and India become bigger players in global R&D.8"
"4","If one of these latter visions is more accurate, the impact on U.S. global standing could be significant. At the outset of the post–Cold War era, the United States was less vulnerable than China and India were to a disruption of bilateral economic ties: Washington needed Beijing and New Delhi less than they needed it. While U.S. vulnerability has grown since then, particularly vis‐à‐vis China, U.S. preeminence as a source of new technologies remains an important asset—and a key reason that both China and India seek to remain connected to it. If China and India are emerging as essential partners for U.S. firms in R&D, however, then the United States is becoming more vulnerable to a disruption of these relationships than it has been thus far. The point here is not to exaggerate the potential leverage that China or India would enjoy under such circumstances. Rather, it is to highlight the potential for lessened U.S. leverage if its own vulnerability were to increase substantially."
"5","This article finds that the globalization of R&D has generated a complex form of interdependence between the United States and the Asian giants, but one that generally favors Washington in political terms. U.S. corporate R&D in China and India is more significant for the latter than it is for the United States, and this asymmetry is potentially a source of power for Washington. Nonetheless, a range of constraints make it difficult for the U.S. government to exploit this potential. In contrast, Chinese and Indian R&D in the United States offers less potential leverage for Washington, but the U.S. government has greater latitude to take advantage of this leverage. All in all, the globalization of R&D has created a new and generally asymmetric form of interdependence between China, India, and the United States, but one that features varying degrees of potential and actual power."
"6","The remainder of this article proceeds as follows. The first section explores the relationship between interdependence and power, drawing on both seminal works and more recent studies. The second section draws on this discussion to characterize the nature of interdependence created by U.S. corporate R&D in China and India. The third section then focuses on the interdependence generated by Chinese and Indian corporate R&D in the United States. The final section concludes."
"7","The relationship between economic interdependence and national power has attracted scholarly interest for centuries.9 In his classic study, Albert Hirschman noted that every country possesses the sovereign power to interrupt its trade with other countries.10 To the extent that a given country relies on such commercial exchange less than its partners, he argued, that country can derive leverage from threatening to impede such commerce. While Hirschman's focus was trade, his basic logic—that uneven levels of dependence between states can be a source of influence—could be applied to many kinds of exchange between states.11 Subsequently, Kenneth Waltz, as well as Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, differentiated between two types of interdependence: sensitivity and vulnerability.12 The former refers to the degree to which conditions in two interconnected countries covary. The latter refers to the opportunity costs of breaking a relationship. As Keohane and Nye noted, it is asymmetry in the pattern of vulnerability (rather than sensitivity) that generates power in a given relationship. Two states might be highly sensitive to each other, but if both have ready alternatives to the relationship, then neither one is vulnerable and neither one has power over the other.         "
"8","Assessing power in interdependence, then, means comparing the vulnerability of the actors involved. That is, we must ask whether the states involved have alternatives to each other as partners. If not, how costly would a disruption of the relationship be? Market size is often cited as a key variable in this regard: states with large and diverse economies can more easily forgo commerce with smaller economies than vice versa. Nonetheless, as Keohane and Nye noted, the leverage derived from asymmetric vulnerability is not a source of power so much as potential power.13 Actual power reflects other variables as well, such as the intensity of state preferences concerning the issue in dispute, the political cohesiveness of each government, and the distribution of other relevant resources—including interdependence in other areas.         "
"9","More recent scholarship has illuminated a number of variables that further complicate the exercise of potential power. Regulatory capacity—the ability to formulate, monitor, and enforce a set of market rules—is one such variable.14 Such capacity allows powerful states to make specific demands on foreign authorities and to monitor and enforce compliance. In the absence of such capacity, the power of even the largest states is only latent. Recent work has also highlighted the agency of subnational actors, such as firms, and their capacity to pursue their own interests through a variety of means. Such actors may pursue their interests through either domestic or cross‐national institutions, depending on the particular venues and opportunities that exist.15 This can constrain the agency of states when the agenda of such actors conflicts with that of national leaders. Recent work has also explored how states actively hedge in order to manage the risks posed by interdependence.16 States may limit their exchanges with a particular partner, they may strengthen ties with other partners, or they may increase exchanges in other spheres with the same partner and thereby increase its vulnerability. These developments may take place for strategic or nonstrategic reasons, of course; states may diversify their trade for reasons unrelated to hedging. Either way, the key point is that these developments can attenuate instances of asymmetric vulnerability.         "
"10","In short, asymmetric interdependence remains an important source of power in international politics, but it is a form of potential power. The exercise of such potential is constrained by a number of contextual variables. With these points in mind, let us turn to the interdependence between the United States, China, and India in R&D."
"11","This century has seen U.S. R&D in both China and India take off. In 2013, R&D spending by U.S. firms in China and India reached $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, striking increases in both cases from just five years earlier. Even so, U.S. firms continue to spend far more on R&D in Europe. The first section below explains how this situation confers significant potential power on the United States. The second section then outlines several important constraints on actual U.S. leverage."
"12","While U.S. R&D in China and India has grown rapidly in recent years, this growth has meant different things to the three countries concerned. Let us first consider the United States. Total R&D spending by U.S. firms overseas remains a fraction of business R&D investment in the United States. In 2013, for example, that share was 15 percent.17 U.S. firms' R&D spending in China and India, in turn, remains a small fraction of all U.S. R&D spending overseas. In 2013, China's share was 4.5 percent, while India's share was 5.2 percent. These shares were comparable to Japan's share (4.9 percent) but far below that of Europe (60.6 percent). The top U.S. partners in Europe were Germany (16.8 percent) and the United Kingdom (10.9 percent). Moreover, Europe's share has been fairly stable since 2009, as shown in Figure 1.            "
"13","Share of U.S. R&D Spending Abroad (percent)"

"15","Of course, one must take price differences into account here. Indeed, one reason that foreign companies began to conduct R&D in China and India was to access talented but relatively cheap labor. The cost of conducting R&D in these rapidly developing countries has increased significantly in recent years, however. For China, an estimate in 2012 suggested that junior staff were 25 percent to 30 percent cheaper than in the United States or Europe, that middle managers were equally expensive, and that senior managers could cost 20 percent to 25 percent more because of short supply and competition to attract the best talent.18 Estimates from India around the same time suggested that Indian R&D centers were roughly 25 cheaper than those in China.19 These figures suggest that the foregoing data slightly understate the value of R&D spending in China and India but do not greatly understate their value, at least in terms of purchasing power.            "
"16","China and India's limited importance as R&D platforms for the United States is clearer still if we consider trade in R&D services. American imports of such services are often heavily influenced by the activities of U.S. foreign affiliates, which export their services back to their parent companies in the United States. In 2014, China and India accounted for 7.4 percent and 8.6 percent of all U.S. imports of R&D and testing services, respectively. While these figures exceeded Japan's share (4.6 percent), they were far below Europe's share (54.1 percent).20"
"17","A few caveats are in order here. First, it should be noted that some prominent U.S. firms have made significant commitments to doing R&D in China and India. This is particularly true among firms specializing in information and communications technologies (ICT). Microsoft Research Asia, for example, was established in Beijing in 1998 and has become the company's second‐largest research organization, after its counterpart in the United States. Cisco, meanwhile, has invested heavily in India. By 2014, in fact, 17 of Cisco's top 84 engineers were based in the country.21 More generally, China and India accounted for roughly a quarter of U.S. overseas R&D spending in “professional, scientific, and technical services,” a category that includes computer systems design and software development, in 2013.22 In addition, the R&D of foreign firms in China and India often plays an important role in allowing them to compete in these markets. In these cases, the firms are not concerned with doing globally relevant R&D but with adapting their existing products to make them attractive to Chinese and Indian consumers. While this sort of R&D may not be pushing back the technological frontier, it is significant to the extent that it allows U.S. firms to access these large and growing markets.            "
"18","There are also some important constraints on the R&D that U.S. firms do abroad, however, particularly in China. U.S. firms have traditionally protected themselves from intellectual property theft in countries with weak protections by limiting the kinds of R&D they do in those countries. Among other tactics, they have focused on developing technology that must be integrated with complementary resources located elsewhere in the firm to become valuable, complicating the challenge for would‐be imitators.23 In recent years, however, the Chinese government's interest in “indigenous innovation” has created a more challenging environment for foreign firms. The problem is not simply that the scale of intellectual property theft has increased but also that the government has restricted market access for foreign firms (particularly U.S. ICT firms) in some cases.24 This tendency, along with China's cooling economy, reduces the incentive to develop products for the Chinese market in the first place. The increasing cost of doing R&D in China is also a serious concern for some companies.25"
"19","Overall, then, China and India remain of limited—if growing—importance as R&D platforms for the United States. In contrast, China and India are more vulnerable to a disruption of ties in this realm. Let us start with China. In simple quantitative terms, the R&D of U.S. firms does not loom very large in China. As noted earlier, U.S. firms spent $2.2 billion on R&D in China in 2013, but China's national R&D spending approached $200 billion that year, with businesses performing three‐quarters of the total.26 These figures are potentially misleading, however, because the productivity of Chinese R&D spending is well below that in developed countries.27 For that reason, recent studies have suggested that foreign‐owned R&D centers play an important role in China's national innovation efforts as examples of excellence; in the past, some have suggested that foreign R&D centers “are the Chinese innovation system.”28 Microsoft was a pioneer in this regard, as noted earlier, but there are other examples. The GE China Technology Center in Shanghai is one of four multidisciplinary R&D centers that the company operates outside the United States (a group that also incudes the John F. Welch Technology Center in Bangalore). Intel's China Research Center was established in 1998 and works closely with teams in the United States, Russia, India, and Korea.29 U.S. firms may not loom large in terms of overall R&D spending in China, then, but some of them play a leadership role in terms of the quality and level of research that is done.            "
"20","It is also clear that China does not have abundant alternatives to the United States as an R&D partner. Estimates of total R&D spending by foreign firms in China vary widely. The Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development estimates that foreign funds accounted for 10.6 billion renminbi in R&D spending in 2013—$1.6 billion at the average annual exchange rate—which is less than the U.S. government's estimate of the total for U.S. firms alone.30 The Chinese government, in turn, reports that wholly owned foreign firms spent 46.6 billion renminbi ($7.2 billion) on intramural R&D in China that year.31 Even if the latter estimate is more accurate, it appears that U.S. firms provide an important fraction of the total. This conclusion is reinforced by surveys of foreign R&D centers in China. A survey of 385 foreign R&D centers published in 2010, for example, found that U.S. companies accounted for 149 (39 percent), while Japanese companies accounted for 79 (21 percent).32 No other country accounted for more than 10 percent. In a 2008 study that identified 51 multinational firms carrying out “innovative” R&D (that is, relevant to the firm's global R&D operations), 22.5 firms were American, 9.5 were Japanese, and four were German.33 Data from the U.S. and Japanese governments confirm that the U.S. lead over Japan in particular is substantial. From 2005 to 2013, U.S. companies spent 2.7 times as much as Japanese companies did on R&D in China.34 In short, the evidence available strongly suggests that the United States accounts for a sizable share of foreign R&D investment in China.            "
"21","Let us now turn to India, where the picture is somewhat different. In quantitative terms, U.S. firms' R&D spending looms quite large India. In 2011–2012 (the most recent data available), the Indian government estimates that national R&D spending in the country reached 726 billion rupees. That equaled $37 billion in purchasing power parity terms but only $15 billion in exchange rate terms—and the business share was only 36 percent of this total.35 U.S. firms, meanwhile, reported spending $2.1 billion in R&D activities in India in 2011. There appear to be significant gaps in the Indian data, but even allowing for these, U.S. firms' spending likely represents a significant share of private sector R&D in the country. In addition, India has no clear alternative to U.S. firms as a source of foreign R&D investment. The most recent evidence indicates that U.S. firms accounted for 591 of 897 foreign R&D investments in India (or 66 percent) between 2003 and 2009 in which the nationality of the firm was stated.36 This was well ahead of the second most prominent investor, the United Kingdom, whose firms made 51 of 897 investments (6 percent). U.S. prominence was also apparent in the amount of money invested. Between 2003 and 2009, U.S. firms accounted for 53 percent of foreign spending on R&D in India. Germany was a distant second at 8 percent. Once again, it is hard to imagine any other country substituting for the United States as an R&D investor in this case.            "
"22","In short, both China and India are more vulnerable to a disruption of U.S. R&D investment in their countries than the United States is. China appears particularly vulnerable, despite its rapidly growing domestic R&D spending, because the Chinese government values foreign R&D investment quite highly. Indeed, despite the persistent influence of “techno‐nationalist” thinking in China, key Chinese documents from the past decade emphasize that the country must deepen its integration with the outside world in order to advance—a far cry from Maoist autarky.37 In 2006, the National Medium‐ and Long‐Term Program for Science and Technology Development (2006–2020), known as the MLP, argued that China should try to expand its technology collaboration with the rest of the world.38 Universities and research institutes were exhorted to set up joint laboratories with foreign ones, and multinational corporations were invited to set up more R&D centers in China. In 2011, the 12th Five Year Plan encouraged foreign enterprises to establish R&D centers in China so the country could “actively merge into the global innovation system.”39 And while Beijing worries about collusion between U.S. ICT firms and U.S. intelligence agencies, there is still strong interest within the Chinese government in luring foreign R&D to China.40 In January 2014, in fact, the People's Daily rejoiced that China was “attracting key R&D activities from multinational companies.”41"
"23","The Indian government's economic agenda is not as ambitious as that of its Chinese counterpart. While the government does wish to increase R&D spending within India, the government's top priority is developing the manufacturing sector, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has famously invited foreign companies to “come, make in India.”42 This priority is understandable, as India has traditionally lagged in this regard and manufacturing has greater potential to generate employment for most of the country's growing population. Even so, India's leaders do wish to expand the country's role in global innovation. “There is a growing trend of international collaboration in research and development,” Modi noted in January 2015. “We should take full advantage of this.”43 In September of that year, Modi gave a speech in Silicon Valley, praising the local Indian community's role in high‐tech innovation and exhorting it to play a greater role in India's development.44 If manufacturing is a higher priority, then, India's leaders are nonetheless eager to raise the country's profile in global R&D. This makes India vulnerable to a disruption of foreign R&D investment as well.            "
"24","To what degree is the interest of the Chinese and Indian governments in attracting foreign R&D reinforced or attenuated by subnational actors? In China's case, it is apparent that integration with the outside world has fostered internationalist economic interests within the Chinese political system, particularly local officials who have strong incentives to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to their jurisdictions.45 R&D investments are welcomed by local officials not only for their economic value but also because they are nonpolluting and convey a high‐tech image.46 Even so, the extent of this interest should not be overstated. Rather than integrating into the local economy, many foreign R&D centers in China have weak relationships with local firms. One survey of foreign information technology (IT) companies in five Chinese cities found that most of their local R&D relied on internal development and that they had little collaboration with local organizations.47 Barriers to collaboration include the technology gap between foreign and local firms and concerns about the protection of intellectual property. More wide‐ranging research has revealed important examples of collaboration, particularly between multinationals and Chinese universities, but still found that foreign firms are not deeply embedded in China's innovation system more generally.48 All in all, then, subnational interests may reinforce the Chinese government's interest in foreign R&D only to a limited degree. The driving force behind China's interest in foreign R&D appears to be the convictions of the country's leadership.            "
"25","The situation in India is quite different. India's most prominent information technology firms do a great deal of business with U.S. companies. In 2013, for example, Infosys derived 64 percent of its revenue from customers in North America, while for Cognizant and Tata Consultancy Services, the figures were 78 percent and 53 percent, respectively.49 These relationships often involve close collaboration with U.S. R&D centers in India. As of 2014, for example, Cisco's operations in India were supported by roughly 20,000 personnel in several different Indian firms.50 Moreover, India's top IT companies are quite capable of making their interests known to government.51 India's National Association of Software and Service Companies has developed significant in‐house research capabilities, and it has provided “idea leadership” to relevant government ministries in pursuit of its interests.52"
"26","The influence of India's most prominent IT companies has been particularly evident in policies adopted by the Indian government toward the U.S. H‐1B visa program. Since the 1990s, several Indian companies have used this program to send Indian computer programmers and software engineers to locations in the United States, and it has become a vital part of their corporate strategies.53 Since the late 1990s, therefore, India has pressed the United States to increase the number of H‐1B visas that it makes available and to make it easier for Indians to work in the United States.54 When the U.S. government has created impediments to this flow, particularly by making the visas more expensive, India has protested, even threatening action against the United States at the World Trade Organization.55 India's top IT companies, then, are influential where their interests are concerned. Because they often have close relationships with U.S. firms doing R&D in India, as well as a strong interest in accessing the U.S. market, they presumably reinforce the government's interest in attracting foreign R&D.            "
"27","To sum up, U.S. R&D in China and India has created a situation of asymmetric interdependence for these countries. While these investments are of limited importance for the United States, China and India are more vulnerable to a disruption of ties in this realm. Both the Chinese and Indian governments value foreign R&D investments, and U.S. companies play a vital role as sources of these investments. This implies that this new form of interdependence has conferred some potential power on the U.S. government. How much actual power these investments generate is another question, however, as explained next."
"28","For a variety of reasons, as explained earlier, potential power may not translate into actual power. Some of these reasons are issue specific, such as the intensity of state preferences regarding whatever issue is in dispute. If a government cares more deeply about the issue than its counterpart, it may be more willing to absorb costs in pursuit of its goals, and a disadvantage in the distribution of vulnerability may be offset. In this case, however, U.S. potential power is also constrained by several more general considerations."
"29","The first concerns U.S. regulatory capacity. The U.S. government currently has limited ability to regulate the overseas R&D activity of multinational firms. While U.S. law does extend extraterritorial authority over sensitive U.S.‐origin technologies, the trend in recent decades has been toward a liberalization of export controls.56 In addition, greater technical expertise would be required to regulate the diffusion of processes and intangible know‐how that generate new technologies, and such expertise is not widely available in the U.S. government.57 Recognizing this problem, former U.S. officials have proposed that companies develop risk‐mitigation plans concerning their overseas R&D investments for government consideration.58 This proposal has yet to be taken up on a wide scale, but even if it were, it is designed to help companies protect valuable know‐how—not to empower the U.S. government to exert leverage over other countries.            "
"30","The second point concerns hedging and interdependence in other areas. China and India have limited ability to hedge against their dependence on the United States in this arena. While China is actively trying to reduce its reliance on foreign technology suppliers, it still welcomes foreign investment in R&D, including from U.S. firms, in the hope that such investment will have positive spillovers for the local economy. It would also be difficult for China and India to reduce their dependence on the United States by diversifying their sources of incoming R&D investments, given how large U.S. companies loom in this regard. Even so, both countries are obviously interdependent with the United States in a variety of other arenas, and this creates opportunities for retaliation. While U.S. vulnerability to China as a result of the latter's purchases of U.S. government securities is not as great as it might appear, U.S. government efforts to limit American firms' R&D in China or India could result in retaliatory measures that reduce market access for these firms in the Chinese and Indian markets.59 U.S. restrictions (or the threat thereof) might also undermine cooperation in other areas, ranging from nuclear nonproliferation to energy security to climate change.            "
"31","Lastly, the United States is constrained by the interests and power of its own firms. As noted earlier, some of the companies investing in R&D in China and India are among the most prominent U.S. technology firms, and the R&D of foreign firms in China and India can be important for accessing those markets. Although enthusiasm for China has cooled in recent years, the two countries remain important as potential sources of revenue growth for U.S. high‐tech firms. In this context, it should be noted that legislation proposed in the U.S. Congress to make the “offshoring” of R&D and other services to other countries more costly has encountered stiff resistance from the business community. In 2010, for example, the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act died in the Senate after meeting resistance from industry groups, including a lobbying group representing technology firms called TechAmerica.60 Subsequent attempts to limit offshoring through legislation failed in 2012 and 2014. From these episodes, it is apparent that curtailing U.S. R&D in China and India would be quite difficult to accomplish politically.            "
"32","Overall, the preceding analysis suggests that the U.S. government has little ability to exploit the asymmetric interdependence arising from U.S. R&D investments in China and India. The limits of U.S. regulatory capacity, its interdependence with China and India in other arenas, and the interests of U.S. companies all constrain Washington's freedom of action in this regard."
"33","Chinese and Indian R&D in the United States is a relatively new phenomenon, but it is growing rapidly, particularly in China's case. Figure 2 shows how R&D spending by affiliates of Chinese firms in the United States has increased rapidly to $449 million in 2013, while the spending of Indian firms has increased more modestly to $93 million that year. The first section below explains that these investments have given risen rise to a form of asymmetric interdependence that favors the United States, but it also notes that the U.S. government has less potential leverage here. Even so, as the second section explains, actual U.S. power is more substantial here because the constraints faced by the U.S. government are less severe.         "
"34","Chinese and Indian R&D Spending in the U.S.                     "
"35","Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, “Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S., Majority‐Owned Bank and Nonbank U.S. Affiliates (Data for 2007 and Forward), Research and Development Expenditures,” accessed at http://www.bea.gov/iTable/index_MNC.cfm, 12 January 2017. Data are classified by country of the ultimate beneficial owner of the U.S. affiliate.                     "
"36","Let us start again with the United States. From the U.S. perspective, Chinese and Indian companies are not major sources of R&D investment. China's $449 million spending on R&D in the United States in 2013 was less than 1 percent of the $54 billion that majority‐owned foreign affiliates spent on R&D in the United States that year. Including Hong Kong in China's total does not radically alter the picture: Hong Kong firms spent an additional $43 million on R&D in the United States in 2013. India's $93 million, in turn, was less than 0.2 percent of foreign R&D spending in the United States. And whereas U.S. companies in China and India often act as technology leaders, Chinese and Indian companies are not usually positioned to play the same role in the United States."
"37","There are a few caveats to keep in mind here, however, particularly with regard to China. While China's share remains a small fraction of all foreign R&D spending in the United States, it is growing rapidly, and it could reach substantially higher levels in the future. Chinese firms are also investing in the United States in other ways. China's most prominent Internet companies—particularly Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent—have taken to investing in U.S. start‐up firms in recent years. Chinese buyers have also become active in acquisitions of U.S. technology assets, and largely as a result of such acquisitions, the flow of FDI from China to the United States increased to more than $15 billion in 2015.61 Still, neither of these developments has made the United States heavily reliant on China. As of early 2016, foreign venture capital firms accounted for roughly a quarter of such funding in the United States, and while China has become more prominent in this realm, there are also foreign investors from the United Kingdom, Israel, and Canada, among other countries.62 Total FDI in the United States, meanwhile, reached $385 billion in 2015—far more than China's $15 billion total that year.63"
"38","In contrast, Chinese and Indian R&D spending in the United States is more important for the investor countries. While the total amounts remain modest, particularly for India, they are being made by some of China and India's top technology companies. Chinese companies that have R&D centers in the United States include Baidu, Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE, Alibaba, TCL, and Haier. Indian companies that have established such centers include Infosys, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, and Lupin. These are often important investments for these companies as they seek to become more innovative and to compete with companies from more advanced countries. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, for example, seeks to move beyond generic drugs and into higher value‐added segments of the pharmaceutical industry. In 2013, the company relocated their North American headquarters and set up an R&D facility in Princeton, New Jersey, “to tap into local talent” and establish a presence in a leading center of innovation in the industry, according to the company's chief executive officer.64"
"39","China and India's emerging R&D activities in the United States are thus valuable for some of the most prominent technology firms in these countries. For this reason, the Chinese and Indian governments generally support such investments. In 2006, China's MLP pledged to “support our country's enterprises in their ‘going out’ efforts” in order to promote access to foreign skills and expertise. In particular, it called for “encouraging and helping [Chinese firms] to establish R&D centers or industrialization bases overseas.”65 China's 12th Five Year Plan (2011–2015) also encouraged Chinese enterprises to set up R&D centers in foreign countries.66 While India is not as preoccupied as China with setting up foreign R&D centers, the government has become much more supportive of outward FDI since the early 2000s. As a result, India's outward FDI rose from $1.0 billion in 2000–2001 to $16.8 billion in 2010–2011, although it has declined somewhat in more recent years.67 Allowing Indian firms better access to foreign technology and know‐how has been one of the goals of this more liberal policy. As Harun Khan, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, put it, “the overseas investment of the domestic corporate sector through FDI has provided them better access to global networks and markets, transfer of technology and skills and also enables them to share research and development efforts.”68"
"40","The United States is thus of some value as an R&D platform for both China and India, and the Chinese and Indian governments value the opportunity for their firms to make such investments overseas. In many ways, however, both countries have alternatives to the United States in this regard. Chinese and Indian FDI in Europe, for example, has historically outpaced that in the United States by a considerable margin.69 Data for overseas R&D spending in particular are harder to acquire, but the figures that are available are suggestive. Indian firms spent more than $1 billion on R&D in the United Kingdom in 2011—far more than the $93 million they spent in the United States in 2013—making them the third‐largest source of foreign R&D in the United Kingdom that year.70 A 2010 study comparing Chinese R&D in Europe and the United States also offers some illuminating results.71 The study identified 31 Chinese R&D centers in the United States, 32 in Europe, and 25 in other parts of the world, including 12 in Japan. The Chinese firm Huawei is a striking example: as of 2016, the company had 16 R&D centers overseas spread across Germany, Sweden, France, Italy, Russia, and India, as well as the United States.72 In short, the data available suggest that both China and India rely quite a bit on countries besides the United States to conduct R&D overseas.            "
"41","The point here is not to suggest that opportunities to conduct R&D in the United States are unimportant to China and India. Indeed, there are some ways in which opportunities to invest in Europe or Japan cannot substitute for opportunities to invest in the United States. Chinese and Indian firms may wish to do R&D in the United States to develop or localize products for the large American market, just as American firms do R&D abroad to compete overseas. The United States is also a key investment destination for ambitious ICT firms. Silicon Valley has been a particular magnet for Chinese information technology companies in recent years, and partly for this reason, California has attracted more Chinese investment than any other U.S. state.73 Ambitious Chinese and Indian firms thus sometimes have alternatives to investing in the United States, but not always.            "
"42","The discussion thus far suggests that Chinese and Indian R&D in the United States confers a limited degree of potential power on the latter. While their spending is growing, China and India have yet to become significant sources of R&D investment for the United States. In contrast, these investments are more important for the source countries. In particular, the Chinese and Indian governments have supported them in recent years as opportunities for their leading technology firms to upgrade and advance their capabilities. While China and India often have alternatives to the United States as an R&D platform, particularly in Europe, the United States remains a key investment destination in the ICT sector, and it also represents a large market for many high‐tech products. The United States thus enjoys some potential leverage in this case, but not as much as in the first case."
"43","If the United States has less potential leverage over China and India in this arena, it faces fewer constraints in trying to exercise the leverage it has. Let us first consider regulatory capacity. Current U.S. law is based on the presumption of a generally open economy, and traditionally the United States has been quite open to foreign investment. Even so, the U.S. government has greater ability to regulate foreign R&D in the United States than it does to regulate R&D by U.S. companies abroad. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an executive branch interagency committee, reviews the national security implications of incoming foreign investments and can recommend to the president that some investments be blocked. CFIUS approves far more investments than it rejects, but it has derailed the plans of some prominent Chinese companies. In 2011, for example, Huawei abandoned an attempt to acquire the firm 3Leaf Systems after CFIUS recommended that it be blocked.74 More recently, Tsinghua Unigroup dropped plans to acquire Western Digital soon after CFIUS announced it would review the deal.75 While CFIUS has traditionally focused on foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets, its mandate could be expanded to cover greenfield investments as well, and there have been proposals in recent years to do so.76 The president also has broader powers in response to specific perceived threats. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), for example, empowers the president to block transactions and freeze assets in the United States in response to threats to “the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States” that originate overseas.77 This authority has been used against Chinese actors as well. In December 2013, a Chinese national was sentenced to 57 months in jail for violating the IEEPA by trying to export thousands of pounds of high‐grade sensitive carbon fiber to China for use by the Chinese military.78"
"44","The U.S. government is also less constrained by resistance from domestic actors in this regard than with regard to investments overseas. While U.S. technology companies have fought against restrictions on offshoring, for example, they have not expressed the same degree of concern about CFIUS.79 From time to time, of course, prominent firms have a strong interest in U.S. openness in this regard, such as when IBM has sold assets to Lenovo. Yet there is also potential for countervailing protectionist pressures from U.S. firms. In 2005, Chevron helped derail an attempt by the China National Offshore Oil Company to acquire the U.S. firm Unocal.80 Recent research suggests that U.S. firms have resisted Chinese attempts to invest in the United States in other cases as well.81"
"45","The greatest constraint on the U.S. government's ability to exercise its potential leverage in this area is likely the potential reaction from China and India. In response to U.S. actions or pressure, firms from the two countries could seek to further diversify their overseas R&D investments. Chinese and Indian firms could also lobby their own governments to respond. The Chinese and Indian governments might respond by reducing efforts to protect foreign intellectual property or by restricting the operations of U.S. firms in their own countries. In response to U.S. scrutiny, in fact, China created its own version of CFIUS in 2011. While Chinese commentators have criticized the new body as weak, it could be strengthened in the future, giving the Chinese government some ability to respond in kind to the U.S. review process.82 Alternatively, if the Chinese and Indian governments believed that such protectionist measures did not serve their own interests, they might curtail cooperation in other areas, particularly those in which the United States is particularly reliant on their cooperation, such as climate change. In doing so, however, they would also risk a broader deterioration in relations.            "
"46","All in all, the preceding analysis suggests that the U.S. government has greater latitude to exploit its potential leverage in this case than in the first case above. Yet this latitude is hardly unlimited. U.S. leaders must be particularly mindful of the potential reactions from Chinese and Indian firms and from the Chinese and Indian governments, which could respond to U.S. pressure or actions."
"47","Three broad findings emerge from the analysis in this article. First, the globalization of R&D has given rise to a complex form of interdependence between China, India, and the United States that generally favors the United States in political terms. Simply put, the United States needs China and India in this sphere less than they need it. This asymmetry is a potential source of power for Washington, as it has less to lose from curtailing collaboration than Beijing and New Delhi do. Second, this asymmetry varies across different areas of collaboration. China and India have little alternative to U.S. firms as sources of foreign R&D investment, so U.S. potential leverage is greatest in this regard. In contrast, China and India have more alternatives to the United States as an investment destination, at least in some regards, which limits U.S. potential leverage in this case. Third, the constraints on the U.S. government's ability to exercise its potential power are also unevenly distributed—but in the opposite direction. Potential U.S. power arising from U.S. R&D in China and India is greatly constrained. Potential U.S. power arising from Chinese and Indian R&D in the United States is less constrained, if not unconstrained."
"48","Taken together, these findings imply that the U.S. government can derive more actual leverage over China and India from its scrutiny of incoming Chinese and Indian investments than from the overseas R&D of U.S. firms. This is not to suggest that the U.S. government should actually try to exploit this leverage. In any particular case, the economic and political costs of doing so would naturally have to be weighed against the anticipated benefits. Instead, we might focus on another key finding here: the U.S. government has remarkably little ability to restrict the overseas R&D of American multinationals. For China and India, this is a reassuring finding, particularly given how reliant they are on U.S. firms for this type of foreign investment. For the United States, it is potentially disconcerting. In this context, proposals regarding how the U.S. government might cooperate more closely with industry in protecting valuable R&D know‐how seem well worth exploring.83"
"49","In years to come, the patterns of interdependence documented in this article could change considerably. U.S. R&D spending in China and India is now comparable, but it could become significantly greater in one of these countries in the future. Such divergence might develop, for example, if distrust and political‐military tensions between China and the United States become more pronounced, although recent research suggests that the “stickiness” of commercial ties in a world of global production tends to insulate them from political tensions (if not war).84 It is also possible that Chinese R&D spending in the United States will increase considerably, as noted earlier. This could increase China's dependence on the United States as an R&D platform. Given how much foreign investment the United States receives from other countries, however, it is unlikely that the United States would become highly reliant on China in this regard.         "
"50","Future research in this area could explore a variety of different topics. While this article has focused on R&D, it must be noted that this collaboration takes place within larger web of transnational ties between China, India, and the United States, and some of these are relevant to innovation as well. China and India send thousands of scientists, engineers, and programmers to work in the United States through the H‐1B visa program and other arrangements. The Asian giants are also important sources of students for U.S. universities, particularly graduate students in science and engineering. Future research could explore how interdependence in these arenas compares with that in corporate R&D. Future research might also explore Chinese and Indian thinking on the extent and nature of their own vulnerability in this arena. While this essay has highlighted constraints on U.S. potential power, Chinese and Indian observers might have different views."
"51","Another set of questions concerns how the globalization of R&D is shaping China's and India's trajectories as sources of technological innovation in their own right. Recent work suggests that foreign R&D centers in China have developed more rapidly than those in India.85 Even so, the impact these centers are having on Chinese and Indian companies remains unclear. Economists and business scholars have only recently begun to explore the “spillover effects” of foreign R&D centers in China and India, and there is considerable disagreement as to the net benefits for the host economies.86 Perhaps the safest conclusion at this point is that the globalization of innovation is a complicated process that may generate both positive and negative effects for local companies. In any case, this topic must clearly be revisited in the future as China and India continue to develop.         "
"52","Most broadly, this article has implications not only for U.S.–China and U.S.–India relations but also for how we study globalization in general. The growth of FDI and the globalization of production have received growing attention from international relations scholars in recent years. To the extent that the globalization of innovation has been studied, it has typically been subsumed within these larger topics. Yet the globalization of innovation represents a distinct and more recent development. Indeed, whereas China looms large in global manufacturing, its role in global R&D is more limited, as this article has shown. The globalization of innovation thus represents a new and distinct chapter in the world economy's unfolding story, one that international relations scholars must strive to understand.*"
