"1","Daniel R. Pinello is a distinguished scholar whose past work has incisively argued that litigation has been an important ingredient in the struggle for transformative change in the United States. In this most recent book, he uses sexual diversity as his lens to reenter the long‐standing debate over whether gains secured through courts produce anything other than shallow or pyrrhic victories."
"2","This new volume relies heavily on interviews with same‐sex couples who live in six of the states where expansive “defense of marriage” (DOMA) measures were approved by referenda between 2000 and 2012. These “super‐DOMAs” were designed to prohibit all official recognition of same‐sex relationships, going far beyond marriage. Although these measures were largely undone by the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, Pinella sets out to show how damaging such legal assaults were to the people he talked to while they were in force.         "
"3","Pinella is at his best when he asks how super‐DOMAs were interpreted, in courtrooms and by advocates on either side. Near the end of the volume, in fact, the book's strongest chapter considers in detail the Obergefell decision and lower court rulings preceding it. Here he highlights the irony that famous dissents by Justice Antonin Scalia helped judges, including many appointed by Republican presidents, strike down barriers to lesbian and gay marriage.         "
"4","However, the ethnographic core of the book has weaknesses. One is a certain analytical overreach, attributing too much of the negative experience of same‐sex couples to DOMAs. For example, the development of more inclusive schools has been slow even in states that allowed same‐sex marriage early on, as has been the removal of barriers facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender couples wanting kids. On the other hand, parenting rights claims have been successfully advanced even in otherwise conservative states. Super‐DOMA states, yes, are more likely challenging for same‐sex couples, but presumably much of that comes from a social and political climate that would have made the enactment of such measures possible. There are times when the determined analytical drive of this book marginalizes this complexity."
"5","Another of the book's difficulties in facing the virtually insurmountable challenge of compiling a set of representative interview subjects. To his credit, Pinella acknowledges that his respondents are heavily skewed toward the well educated, professionally employed, and white. More could have been done, though, to highlight testimony that had the widest application across socioeconomic differences and to more elaborately reflect on the differences in experience of those not included in the ethnographic material."
"6","The powerful narratives that Pinella does draw from those he interviews would also have been strengthened by more targeted extracts, avoiding long transcript segments, at times only loosely tied together. This pattern exacerbates a recurring sense of drift away from core themes, with the author and his respondents paddling too far up too many tributaries. Extended discussions of whether prejudice and antigay animus motivated DOMA supporters, and of why couples did not move out of super‐DOMA states, are long and not always sufficiently tied into the book's central questions."
"7","The interview material does show that the DOMA referenda politicized many of the couples affected by them, and it is worth adding that before their enactment, there were countless partners and parents who were driven to everyday advocacy by their need to be recognized. From the early 1990s, the result was a steady increase in the number of states in which same‐sex relationship and parenting rights were recognized in one form or another, a trend undiminished through the period of DOMA enactment. In the U.S. context, marriage rights are important, and DOMA referenda came to symbolize much larger questions of whether sexual diversity itself warranted any official recognition. The rulings that challenged them were crucial, but the “rescue” mission is not as dominated by a single contributor, as this book argues, and the struggle over the legal recognition of same‐sex couples is some distance away from being resolved."
"8","At the heart of this book is the entirely supportable proposition that courts have mattered. Portraying the Obergefell decision (and others leading up to it) as having “brought to an end America's two‐decade‐long war against same‐sex couples and their families,” freeing them of “the shackles imposed on them by federal and state laws” (p. 253) is a step too far.
