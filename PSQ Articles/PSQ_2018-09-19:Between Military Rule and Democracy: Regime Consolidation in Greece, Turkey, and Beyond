"1","Why do some military coups succeed and others fail? Why do some armed interventions give rise to democracies, while others establish authoritarian regimes? These are two of the intriguing questions posed by Yaprak Gürsoy in Between Military Rule and Democracy. To answer them, Gürsoy undertakes a comparative historical analysis of Greece and Turkey—two countries rarely paired for comparison despite such important similarities as their shared Ottoman heritage and their common location on the political and geographic periphery of Europe and the Middle East. The Greece‐Turkey comparison provides “4 periods of authoritarianism, 6 periods of democracy, 10 short‐lived coups with different degrees of success”—in short, an abundance of regime and coup outcomes that together create a “natural laboratory” for the exploration of competing explanatory hypotheses regarding these phenomena (p. 4).         "
"2","Gürsoy's theoretical inspiration is drawn from Robert Dahl's canonical work Polyarchy and his argument that democracy is most likely to emerge when elites calculate that the costs of tolerating the opposition outweigh the costs of suppressing it. Gürsoy embraces Dahl's logic but offers to improve upon it by folding in the role of another independent factor—the military and its proclivity for political intervention. This, she argues, will yield a more powerful theory of regime possibility and change.         "
"3","Gürsoy's faithful reliance on Dahl's original terminology is unfortunate since the terms “costs of toleration” and “costs of suppression” are clumsy tropes that confuse more than elucidate. Better to have embraced more accessible terms such as “sense of threat” (experienced by the elite) and “capacity for repression ” (in the hands of the elite). Both factors clearly drive the dynamics of military intervention and regime change, and Gürsoy's analysis is illuminating for her disaggregation of each concept. For example, a sense of elite threat is triggered by “radical opposition from the lower classes” (demonstrated by massive votes for the communist party and/or an avalanche of protests and strikes), inter‐elite conflict, and challenges to the specific interests of elite groups (economic, professional, ideological). By contrast, capacity for repression is shaped by such factors as the military's internal unity/disunity, its access to resources and foreign aid, its skill at organizing interventions “properly,” the relative strength of the opposition (for example, is the lower class mobilized around a counter‐elite?), and the degree of elite unity. Differential performance on these disaggregated parameters yields a variety of regime and coup outcomes that Gürsoy tracks in her two country cases."
"4","Among Gürsoy's most important insights: military unity and broad elite support for repression are key factors in shaping the success or failure of military interventions, as demonstrated by the cases of Turkey in 1980 (successful coup) and Greece in 1974 (failed coup). Gürsoy also argues persuasively that the absence of mobilized popular opposition is decisive in diminishing the sense of elite “threat” and reducing the chances of descent into authoritarianism. But Gürsoy's analysis is problematic in several ways. First, the work seeks to explain far too many outcomes: the causes of military intervention, the character of coups (fragile, failed, successful, long, and short), the nature of the regimes that follow (democratic or authoritarian, consolidated or not). Each of these outcomes has its own dynamic, and trying to explain them all with one theory leads to confusion and ambiguity. Second, many of the explananda and explanantia are defined in an imprecise and ad hoc fashion, leading to an analysis that at times veers toward the tautological. How can we know whether a military has planned an intervention “properly,” independent of the outcome that this variable is theoretically supposed to explain, namely, coup success?"
"5","Finally, the book offers rich historical accounts of the political economy of Greece and Turkey, but Gürsoy's argument is often not integrated into these narratives. Instead, a proliferation of charts outlining the analysis is offered, almost as an editing afterthought, which is not the most effective way to muster empirical evidence. Overall, close case knowledge is evident, as are interesting theoretical questions. But a narrower empirical focus would likely have yielded a more powerful and persuasive analytic reward."
