"1","My parents cried at their wedding."
"2","Their tears were not of joy, but of sadness. Their wedding took place on 12 April 1945, the saddest day of the twentieth century for American Jews. Franklin D. Roosevelt died that day. My parents, like many American Jews, believed that they had lost their protector."
"3","Revisionist history was to be less kind to FDR. He was portrayed as an anti‐Semite who could have done much more to save European Jews from the Nazi death camps. He was a patrician who could not–and would not–relate to people of a different background."
"4","Richard Breitman and Allan J. Lichtman, two historians at American University, challenge this view. Roosevelt may not have been the savior of American Jews, as my parents viewed him. But he was “neither a hero of the Jews nor a bystander to the Nazis' persecution and then annihilation of Jews…. He had to make difficult and painful trade‐offs…. Roosevelt reacted more decisively to Nazi crimes against Jews than did any other world leader of his time” (p. 315)."
"5","Their research is exhaustive and their conclusion is compelling. Breitman and Lichtman agree that Roosevelt “did little to assist Jews in Germany” in his first term (p. 315). But he became far more proactive after winning reelection by a landslide in 1936."
"6","Roosevelt faced strong opposition virtually everywhere he looked. Anti‐Semitism was rife throughout the world, among our Western allies and within the country. Our British allies had strong links to the Arab world and were thus unwilling to do much to aid the Jews, especially if this meant immigration to Palestine. The State Department was filled with anti‐Semites. Not until 1944 did national Republicans support Jewish emigration to Palestine, and often made common ground with prominent anti‐Semites. African Americans and labor union leaders, who might be expected to be more sympathetic, worried about the effect of mass immigration of Jews to America. Not here, not to Palestine. Where could the Jews go? Alaska was a possibility, memorialized in Michael Chabon's 2007 novel, The Yiddish Policemen's Union. Almost everywhere in Latin America was suggested: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico.         "
"7","No one wanted large‐scale Jewish immigration–and many people did not want any. As Tom Lehrer sang in “National Brotherhood Week” (http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/National‐Brotherhood‐Week‐lyrics‐Tom‐Lehrer/625DBDA1F04F231148256A7D0025A2FC):            "
"8","This is the lesson that Breitman and Lichtman tell and the story is well told, if lengthy."
"9","Organized Jewry was disorganized and thus incapable of putting much pressure on FDR or anyone else."
"10","I am not a historian, so I take the many positive reviews of their book to judge their work as an important corrective to the critique of Roosevelt's hesitation to take stronger action to save European Jews. As a political scientist, I do have some issues with their presentation. The reader never knows that there is a controversy about FDR until the last chapter. The book is history with the emphasis on story. I wish that the larger theme had been introduced at the outset and that the authors had looked more at the Jews, not just at FDR. Jewish support of the Democratic Party did not begin with Roosevelt. Jews voted heavily for Woodrow Wilson in 1916 and for Al Smith in 1928 (see Herbert Weisberg, “Reconsidering Jewish Voting Statistics,” Contemporary Jewry, 32 [2012]: 215–236).         "
"11","But FDR was special. Breitman and Lichtman do not tell us anything about why my parents and so many other members of their generation were so devoted to Roosevelt—or what other Americans thought about Jews. There is little survey data on attitudes toward the Jews or Palestine before 1944, but the Ipoll data base shows 10 surveys of Americans in 1944 and 1945 on these issues. It is a great story as history, but it could have been even better as social science."
