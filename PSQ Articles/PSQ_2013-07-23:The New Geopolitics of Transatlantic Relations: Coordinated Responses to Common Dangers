"1","There was a time not so long ago when writing about the transatlantic community was something of a cottage industry for scholars of international relations, with every NATO crisis providing an excuse to lament the decline of the U.S.–European relationship and the need to reverse the trend. In their time, Henry Kissinger's The Troubled Partnership (1965), David Calleo's The Atlantic Fantasy (1970), and Richard Barnet's The Alliance (1983) captured the anxiety about the changing transatlantic relationship. It is a mark of just how much things have changed since the end of the Cold War that Stefan Frohlich's book is one of the very few serious and thoughtful examinations of the transatlantic relationship in recent years. Crafted in part as a response to Robert Kagan's Of Paradise and Power (2002), which appeared during the height of U.S.–European rancor over the Iraq war, Frohlich's book argues for the continuing importance of U.S. and European cooperation, especially given “the rise of the rest,” the increasing significance of the so‐called BRIC countries (Brazil, China, India, and Russia). Although he spends a considerable amount of time looking at the differences between the United States and Europe over such “values” questions as the death penalty, religion, health care, and even genetically modified foods, Frohlich argues for a “pragmatic” transatlantic cooperation that can transcend such differences. He reminds us that despite the rise of the BRICs, the transatlantic economy “generates a combined GDP of more than $25 trillion—54 percent of the global GDP in terms of value and 40 percent in terms of purchasing power” (p. 230), as well as accounting for four‐fifths of all development aid and assistance and employing about 15 million workers. Despite the divisions over Iraq, the “bilateral ties have grown even stronger since the beginning of this century” (p. 55), with Europe the most important market for American companies and U.S. investment in Europe nearly four times larger than in all of Asia. This underlying economic interdependence, in Frohlich's view, should compel leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to search for more ways to cooperate on such issues as nuclear nonproliferation, terrorism, and the Middle East.         "
"2","But Frohlich ultimately concludes that despite European jubilation over the election of Barack Obama and the end of the polarizing George W. Bush years, we are not likely to recover the relatively close transatlantic ties of the Cold War era. The best we can hope for is something like a “more pragmatic and sober transatlantic partnership” (p. 275). What exactly this means is never clearly defined, and Frohlich tends to preach a form of transatlantic cooperation that may not be politically possible. The book is rightly cautious about the internal political divisions that weaken the EU and the domestic constraints on the Obama administration. But the author's crystal ball was cloudy about some important points. He noted that forecasters expected “substantial acceleration” in the U.S. economic growth rate in 2012 to 4 percent (p. 276). In reality, growth is less than half that. More importantly, the book only contains the most‐cursory treatment of the developing Euro crisis, mentioning the problems in Greece but not fully integrating this issue into its larger portrait of the problems facing the transatlantic community. Indeed the book's picture of an America that needs to accept that the days of “undisputed leadership” (p. 284) are gone and an EU that needs to contribute more to the costs of that leadership seem hopelessly out of date, as both partners in the transatlantic community struggle under the burdens of enormous debt and sluggish economies. Ironically enough, these similar conditions have probably brought about more transatlantic unity in the last few years than have any new leaders or policies."
