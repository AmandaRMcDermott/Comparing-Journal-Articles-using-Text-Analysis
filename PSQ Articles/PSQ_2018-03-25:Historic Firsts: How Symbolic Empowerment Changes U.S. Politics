"1","Evelyn M. Simien provides a lucid and timely analysis of the way that four historic firsts—the Democratic presidential nomination quests of Shirley Chisholm in 1972, Jesse Jackson in 1984, and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008—left a lasting impact on presidential electoral politics. Through these case studies, the book advances a theory of symbolic empowerment, the idea that marginalized groups are inspired and changed by seeing someone who looks like them pursuing the highest level of political office."
"2","The chapter focused on the historic candidacy of Shirley Chisholm makes powerful use of archival data and an explicitly intersectional framework to illustrate how Chisholm's run for president inspired a new group of Americans to get involved in electoral politics and to view the presidency differently. Although the large‐scale, individual‐level data needed to test whether Chisholm's supporters were systematically mobilized by her candidacy do not exist, this chapter provides a compelling narrative of symbolic empowerment. I recommend it as required reading in courses not just on gender, race, and politics but also, even more importantly, in courses on presidential elections and the presidency."
"3","Simien finds that both Jesse Jackson in 1984 and Barack Obama in 2008 acted as mobilizing agents for African American citizens. The African American supporters of Jackson and Obama were not only more likely to vote in the nomination process but also more likely to engage in a range of political actions. Interestingly, African American women were the group most mobilized by Obama's candidacy and, on some measures of political involvement, the group most mobilized by Jackson's candidacy as well. Moreover, Simien finds that Obama's 2008 campaign not only mobilized black voters but white voters, too. The way Jackson's and Obama's candidacies mobilized not only voters who looked like them—African American men—but also other groups across racial and gender lines is an intriguing result worthy of further exploration."
"4","The mobilizing effects of Jackson's and Obama's campaigns on African American women are all the more interesting given that Hillary Clinton's 2008 nomination campaign did not mobilize the descriptive group she pictorially represents, white women. On the contrary, it was Latinas who expressed the most pride in Clinton's candidacy. Simien ponders whether Clinton's status as a well‐known and controversial figure prior to running for president in 2008 undercut possible gender mobilization effects. The lack of heightened emotional connection and sense of empowerment for white women in 2008 is an issue worthy of further study as well, as it may provide insights into Clinton's general election loss in 2016."
"5","The 2016 presidential election, not covered in this book, provides an opportunity to build on the symbolic empowerment framework developed here in three important ways. First, given that 2016 was no longer a historic first but represented Clinton's second bid for the Democratic nomination, it would be interesting to see whether, similar to Jackson's second run in 1988, the empowerment effects of her candidacy particularly on Latinas were less in 2016 than in 2008. Second, 2016 provides the opportunity to explore symbolic empowerment within the context of a Republican nomination contest. The strong performance of Latinos (Cuban Americans) Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz creates an opportunity to investigate whether symbolic empowerment operates in a parallel manner among Republican voters or whether it is a process distinctive to Democratic politics. Finally and importantly, with the first‐ever woman major‐party presidential nominee, the 2016 presidential election provides the opportunity to explore how symbolic empowerment operates in general election environments as opposed to nomination contests."
