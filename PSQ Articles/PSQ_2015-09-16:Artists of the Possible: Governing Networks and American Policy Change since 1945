"1","Matt Grossman offers a compelling and holistic analysis of American federal domestic policymaking since 1945. He explains the slow speed and rarity of policy enactments from the perspective of governing networks. In doing so, he challenges the dominant theories that model policy change as a function of elections, public opinion, and ideology. Although he acknowledges that these traditional factors play a role at times, he argues that the ultimate drivers of change are the networks among politicians, administrators, and interest groups. Such bonds developed over time are necessary to overcome the nontrivial institutional hurdles to policy enactment."
"2","The story that Grossman puts forth in Artists of the Possible is one in which policy enactments are tall orders. We should expect little in the way of policy change, outside of the exceptional times when ties develop among these actors. The networks formed during the Great Society are an exception to the rule of the status quo. Then, major players formed bonds that were maintained well into the 1970s and allowed for unparalleled success at liberal policy enactment. As a testament to his rigorous approach, Grossman also shows that not all political actors are equal. Presidents are particularly good at enacting policy change, but even among them, there is substantial variance. Success is contingent on their ties to legislators and activists, relationships that are often developed with legislative experience. That personal factors, such as the network of relationships a president has built, are crucial to policy enactment has big implications for the presidency literature, which has been moving toward more institutional explanations for presidential behavior and success. Likewise, although most members of Congress are ineffectual, congressional leaders and long‐serving members, as well as prominent interest groups, serve central roles. By working together, these “institutionalized entrepreneurs” are the ones that most often enact policy.         "
"3","In offering such a perspective, Grossman situates his work among a number of groundbreaking recent articles and books tearing down the naive perspective of independent actors in politics. Indeed, he not only dispenses with the inadequate atomistic caricature of policymaking but attempts to model these networks as well—taking seriously the need in studies of politics to cull relational data sets and test relational hypotheses. The strength of the argument is bested perhaps only by his comprehensive collection of data and meticulous empirical analysis. He moves beyond anecdotal evidence, case studies, and particular contexts to provide readers with generalizable empirical patterns. Through content analysis of policy histories, Grossman aggregates micro‐level insights from policy historians with macro‐level patterns of interest to political scientists. His contribution is twofold, offering original insights as well as data that will be of use to scholars for years to come."
"4","Even before he sets his sights on the claims of the extant literature, Grossman provides a detail‐rich review of the major theories of policy change. Likewise, in pulling from studies of policy history, he notes his debt to theoretical building blocks such as separation of powers, historical institutionalism, activist eras, presidential leadership, and advocacy coalitions, among others. Beyond motivating his argument, these reviews serve as a primer to some of the most notable contributions in the literature that should be of interest to students of political science at all levels."
"5","If there is a critique to be leveled against this work, it will come from those searching for something positive about the state of our democracy. From the perspective of normative democratic theory, Grossman's findings are disheartening. Rather than the public‐driven or bottom‐up perspectives of policy change offered by agenda‐setting and macro‐politics studies, his methodical analysis suggests an insulated and irregular group of elite players driving policy enactments. The work is an undoubtedly invaluable contribution to the literature on policy change, even if the findings are at odds with our hopes for democracy."
