"1","Elizabeth Thompson's original and ambitious book begins with the last visit in 1599 of the Ottoman statesman, Mustafa Ali, to Egypt, a province of the empire. Although the date given in the heading for Part I on the “constitutional model of justice” is 1839, it is, in fact, not until after the first 30 pages that Thompson gets to her analysis of the famous Rose Garden (Gulhane) Decree of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul‐Majid in 1839, which granted security of life, property, and equality under the law for his Muslim and non‐Muslim subjects. This historical background, it should be noted, long predates the currency of the terms “Near East” and “Middle East.” The terminal ad quem indicated in the introduction seems to be 11 September 2001, but the last chapter is on Wael Ghonim, the main blogger of the Arab Spring of 2011, when the book was going to press. This is a pity because the interrupted justice of the title is, in fact, the trend toward constitutional rule of law, and Thompson misses the chance to examine the Egyptian constitutions of 2012 and 2014 and the Tunisian constitution of 2014.         "
"2","In such an ambitiously conceived scheme, history is not just a mandatory background but an essential element of the design. So the key questions the reviewer has to ask are the following: Is it right to lump together Shiite Iran and the Arab and Turkish successor states of the Sunni Ottoman empire (with a large Christian population)? And is the umbrella term “justice” adequate for covering the range of politico‐constitutional developments examined over the centuries? The answer to the first question is yes, to the second, no!"
"3","With regard to the first question, it makes good sense to put the constitutional revolution of 1906–1911 in Iran alongside Ottoman constitutional developments from 1839 to 1908 because pre‐modern Ottoman law and Persian public law were by and large the same, as was the reception of Western constitutionalism. It makes equally good sense to put together the oppositional Islamist ideology of the Egyptian Sayyid Qutb and the Iranian Ali Shariati in the period prior to the Islamic revolution of 1979. In both cases, the Sunni Shiite sectarian differences were not all that pertinent to the development of Islamic political ideologies."
"4","Not so as regards our second question. Once we get to the discussion of the “local and collective models of justice” after 1920 (Parts II and III of the book), the rubric of justice proves woefully inadequate for capturing wide‐ranging political, ideological, and constitutional differences in the contemporary Middle East. A very broad range of ideological movements puts local and collective models—late‐Ottoman constitutionalist, Zionist, Palestinian nationalist, Iraqi communist, Syrian so‐called socialist, and Egyptian and Iranian Islamist ideologies—are all treated as alternative paths in the pursuit of justice. Each of these trends is analyzed through the statements of the main protagonists—Halide Edib, David Ben‐Gurion, Musa Kazim and Abu Iyad, Hasan al‐Banna and Sayyid Qutb, Comrade Fahd (Yusuf Salman Yusuf), Akram al‐Hourani, and Ali Shariati, respectively. No wonder the constitutional focus of Part I abruptly shifts to political ideologies and the constitutional developments in twentieth‐century Egypt and the Islamic Republic of Iran are left out altogether. As the relatively precise terminology of constitutional documents and excessively fuzzy ideological statements referring to justice are incommensurable, lumping the constitutional and ideological developments together under “justice” does not prove analytically fruitful, even though, ad hoc, each trend in this broad range of twentieth‐century political movements is insightfully described.         "
"5","Thompson's sketch of what can be called public or proto‐constitutional law aptly begins with an analysis of the “justice decrees” (adalatnameler) of the Sultan in the “uniquely Ottoman model of justice embodying imperial law, sharia, and custom” (p. 19). There follows an analysis of the Rose Garden Decree of 1839 that ushered in the Ottoman reforms (Tanzimat) and, according to Thompson, broadly framed the moral economy of the predominantly Maronite and Christian peasant revolt of 1858–1860 in Mount Lebanon. She then labels the revolt of Colonel Ahmad Urabi “the 1882 Egyptian constitutional revolution” and compares it with Iran's constitutional revolution of 1906 as seen by one of its participants and its subsequent historian, Nazem al‐Islam Kermani. Urabi's conception of justice as the equality of Egyptian and Turkish officers and the defense of the Egyptian homeland is contrasted with the conception (or misconception) of the Parliament established by Iran's 1906 constitution as a “House of Justice” (pp. 74, 78). The notion of justice in this contrast is typically elastic, and Thompson, who is usually careful in documenting her assertions, fails to do so when they touch on what appears as self‐evident in her leftist worldview (for example, pp. 82–85).         "
"6","To see the enormous range of issues glossed over by such an elastic notion of justice, one cannot do better than to turn to Hadi Enayat's painstaking account of the modernization of law in Iran. Enayat discusses the intractable dilemmas faced by the Iranian constitutionalists when they sought to translate the popular notion of the House of Justice (‘adalat‐khana) into a system of constitutional government based on the rule of law from 1906 to 1941, using a more‐consistent analytical framework for dealing with constitutional laws and judiciary organization, with ad hoc explanations being far and far between.         "
"7","The translation of justice into modern law was far more intractable in Shiite Iran than in the Sunni Ottoman empire because the state law (qānun) and the sharia were not integrated but were, rather, under separate jurisdictions, respectively, of the Shah and his governors, on the one hand, and of the Shiite hierocracy, on the other.         "
"8","The legitimacy of monarchy in the Persianate conception was based squarely on justice. The Shah was the “fountain of justice,” and his tribunal for injustices (mazālem), divān‐khāna, was the highest court of justice in the realm. In the course of the reforms of Naser al‐Din Shah (1848–1896) — a weak imitation of the Ottoman Tanzimat—the royal tribunal was first expanded with the installation of “justice boxes” (Sadnuq‐e ‘edalat) in major cities, and then by transforming it into the Judiciary (‘adliyya) (39–46). Hence, the assimilation, in popular conception, of the Parliament demanded by the constitutionalists to a House of Justice (khāna‐ye ‘edalat) in 1906.         "
"9","It soon became clear, however, that the reform of the judiciary (‘adliyya) was not as easy as establishing constitutional government by a royal decree. There were intractable problems, not only in practice but also in theory. As the Shiite hierocracy was the guardian of the sacred law (sharia) of Mohammad, its conception of justice had much closer legal implications than those of the set of twentieth‐century ideologues surveyed by Thompson, who had a free hand in giving justice any meaning they cared. Unlike the Ottoman Sultan, the Shah of Iran had no religious authority, which rested with an independent Shiite hierocracy. The authoritative jurists (mojtaheds) of the Shiite hierocracy exercised this independent authority not only to secure themselves the right to veto all parliamentary legislation through a committee of five “high‐ranking mojtaheds,” but insisted that equality before the law meant the equality of the Muslims and non‐Muslims before state law (qānun‐e dawlati), leaving their patent inequality in the sharia untouched (pp. 63–69). The Supplemental Fundamental Law of 1907 thus acknowledged this inequality by clear implication, hoping it would erode and disappear in the projected course of de facto secularization.         "
"10","The Iranian constitutionalists’ solution in integrating state law and the sharia, carefully detailed and insightfully analyzed by Enayat, is an achievement well worth noting by students of comparative constitutionalism. Although the committee of five high‐ranking mojtaheds provided for in the Supplemental Fundamental Law of 1907 was never established or formally functioned, the great judiciary reformers of modern Iran (Hasan Pirniya in 1907–1911 and Ali Akbar Davar in 1927–1935), secured the cooperation of a number of prominent jurists for their respective reforms. Pirniya's 1911 Law of Judiciary Organization adopted modern procedural law that was at complete variance with the sharia Kadi justice, and did so in close cooperation with the clerical jurist Sayyed Hasan Modarress, who went along on the condition that the reform should not affect substantive law. This condition was, by and large, honored by Davar, who relied on the expertise of reputable clerical and former clerical jurists for the inclusion of much of Shiite law in Iran's Civil Code (1928–1935).         "
"11","With Davar's codification and his new round of judiciary reorganization under Reza Shah Pahlavi, Iranian law became just state law (qānun), which was henceforth the official embodiment of justice to be administered by a judiciary consisting of a modernized hierarchy of lower and appellate courts that divided the old Kadis’ function between the judge and the public prosecutor. Sharia courts were, in theory, and initially also in practice, incorporated into the judiciary, but subsequent laws very quickly restricted their jurisdiction, and they disappeared altogether in practice before long.         "
"12","I leave it to the reader to decide whether the moral of this story is lost or reinforced by its being told alongside Ali Shari‘ati's ideological ruminations during the decade preceding the Islamic revolution in Iran."
