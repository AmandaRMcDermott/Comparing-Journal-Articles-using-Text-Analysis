"1","Transnational activist networks alter world politics by promoting the emergence and diffusion of new international norms. Why do these networks take up some worthy causes but not others? Charli Carpenter tackles this question and offers convincing answers to it in “Lost” Causes. Carpenter shows that gatekeeper organizations—those that are most connected to others and that bridge diverse subnetworks—vet emerging issues. “Agenda vetting” shapes the issue agenda, that is, the set of problems to which governments, international organizations, and other actors pay attention. Carpenter's central argument is that agenda vetting involves not just the power of resources or the power of ideas but also the power of network position. “Lost” Causes is a major advance in research on transnational activist networks and international norm change.         "
"2","The theory advanced in “Lost” Causes emphasizes selection: issues reach, and rise on, the agenda of advocacy networks when they are taken up by organizations that are network hubs. Advocacy elites—who occupy the network's central nodes—decide which new issues to add to their organizations' list of causes. The preferences of these elites are shaped by “perceptions of intranetwork relationships” (p. 53), relationships among people, organizations, and ideas. A hub actor judges how a new issue will fit not just its existing commitments, but also its network connections. Once a network “superpower” (frequently but not always a major nongovernmental organization) adopts an issue, other network actors are more likely to do the same. Equally important, issue adoption by network hubs is a signal to policymakers in states and international organizations. Thus, “network structure exerts a causal effect on issue selection” (p. 27), which, in turn, affects the emergence of global campaigns and, ultimately, policy change.         "
"3","One of the book's strengths is its creative use of multiple forms of data on the people, organizations, and ideas involved in the broad field of human security, systematically coded by Carpenter and her collaborators. The raw data include hyperlinks and issue agendas from the Web sites of human security organizations, responses to an online survey, transcripts from a series of focus groups, and interviews."
"4","Three chapters present detailed case studies of agenda vetting of potential human security issues: compensation for victims of collateral damage in armed conflicts, regulation of autonomous weapons, and prohibition of infant male circumcision. In each instance, political entrepreneurs sought to generate a global campaign in the potentially relevant issue networks (or subnetworks). Advocacy elites in the hub organizations decided whether to adopt a proposed issue, and their decisions, Carpenter shows, were guided by their perceptions of intranetwork relations. Those network ties are central to explaining variation in the degree to which the proposed issues advanced through the vetting stage and moved toward full issue adoption."
"5","Like all valuable books do, “Lost” Causes leaves us with many ideas to think about. For instance, network structures are seen as exerting causal effects on issue selection. Yet the organization Global Witness not only managed to create a new issue area—conflict resources—but positioned itself “as the lead player in this arena” (p. 31). When are network structures more or less constraining? How do network structures (or perceptions of them) interact with attributes of the issues, of the entrepreneurs, and of the hub actors themselves? Carpenter has opened doors for new thinking on these and other research questions and on creative ways to marshal evidence that can answer them.         "
