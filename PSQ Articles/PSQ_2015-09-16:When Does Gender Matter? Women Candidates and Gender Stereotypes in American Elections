"1","Journalists, pundits, laymen, and scholars interested in women's representation have been searching after, for several decades now, the smoking gun in women's continuing underrepresentation in elective office. In When Does Gender Matter?, Kathleen Dolan takes on the prevailing belief and a significant body of academic research suggesting that gender stereotypes have a potent effect in holding women back. This is a bold endeavor given the entrenched conventional wisdom that women in politics are subject to detrimental stereotypes—that stereotypes are the smoking gun.         "
"2","Dolan's panel study first examined potential stereotypes in candidate evaluations, then tied those stereotypes to voters' actual vote choices. Her methods allow her to make a strong and consistent case that women running for office are rarely subject to stereotyping that leads to gender‐based discrimination at the ballot box. She finds that individuals offered inconsistent stereotypical evaluations of both male and female candidates. Furthermore, the stereotypes that were expressed seemed to have little impact on how voters ultimately made their vote choices."
"3","What did matter in both the evaluation of candidates and vote choices was political party. A respondent's party (as well as ideology) predicted everything from attitudes toward women in politics to holding a number of issue‐based gender stereotypes to, ultimately, their vote choices."
"4","Obviously, parties are crucial. Women interested in political office as well as practitioners and voters interested in supporting them should take heart. While combating gender‐based stereotypes that often function subconsciously is a perplexing and uphill battle that can take generations to change, factors such as political party and incumbency may be tackled in real time as more women are running and being elected and seeking leadership roles in the parties. Admittedly, though, these—more often gendered than not—forces have been frustratingly resistant to change in American politics as well."
"5","When Does Gender Matter? leaves open the question of the role of stereotypes in a host of elections in which party is not able to serve as the powerful force that Dolan has identified. Many women get their political start in lower‐level offices where party cues may be less important or nonexistent. Certainly there is a place for gender to serve as an important heuristic in primary elections and in nonpartisan elections. Political scientists have paid little attention to either area, particularly at lower levels of office. Not only are these elections important in their own right, they also serve as a major source for grooming and preparing candidates for higher political office later in their political careers.         "
"6","This work should prompt new approaches to work on gender stereotypes. Perhaps, as Dolan suggests (p. 17), greater emphasis should be put on real‐world data given the limitations of experimental work dealing with political candidates and scenarios. I would also suggest that the way researchers operationalize gender stereotypes may need to change, given the evolution of gender roles in society broadly and in politics specifically. There is much important work yet to be done on the intersection of gender stereotypes and American politics."
"7","Nonetheless, by solidly disputing any significant effect of stereotype‐based discrimination in the electoral process, Dolan leaves us at an important place that is not unfamiliar to scholars of gender and politics: if we want more women in political office, we primarily still need more women to run."
