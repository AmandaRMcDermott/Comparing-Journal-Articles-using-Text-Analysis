"1","Deeply socialized into statistical significance, we too often disregard intuition in favor of statistical analysis. How else to explain the persistent belief that special interest groups freely fund political campaigns expecting little or nothing in return? Yet, because the research in this area has yet to uncover the proverbial smoking gun—consistent patterns of statistically significant relationships between contributions and roll call votes—the agnosticism toward the money‐and‐votes relationship endures. Despite our continuing disbelief, we understand the limitations of this research. Influence lurks within the marrow of democracy and not on its skin. Our lack of findings may reflect poor detection methods rather than the absence of infection."
"2","Lynda Powell's new book, The Influence of Campaign Contributions in State Legislatures, not only understands these shortcomings, it attempts to systematically address them. Readers may find fault with her solution—reliance on elite surveys to capture state‐level political influence—but it is hard not to admire the reach, ambition, and rigor of her work.         "
"3","Reliance on perception rather than on “hard” data to measure influence is inherently problematic, but what other alternatives do we have? Actual prosecutions (or convictions) are limited to only the most‐observable forms of corruption and crude efforts at influence, and are subject to the partisan biases that underlie prosecutorial discretion. Roll call votes only scratch the surface of decision making when real influence is exerted in the drafting of language, control over the legislative agenda, and in the defense of the status quo. Surveys suffer from their own limitations (for example, sampling, measurement, and nonresponse‐related errors), but they may best capture political influence that cannot be directly observed. To Powell's credit, she is not content to simply ask the questions and let the answers speak for themselves, but instead corrects the data for several well‐known biases and engages in rigorous statistical analyses."
"4","Relying on survey responses from 2,982 legislators and all 99 state legislative chambers, Powell explores the amount of time legislators devote to fundraising, their return on investment for time spent, and the perceived influence of campaign contributions. Her findings are unequivocal: Fundraising affects individual behavior and the policy choices of legislatures, though the effects are contextually contingent. Characteristics that make legislative positions more attractive increase the importance of campaign fundraising, the time devoted to fundraising, and the influence of contributions over the legislative process. More‐professional legislatures, larger chambers, and larger districts are also associated with more‐influential contributions. Powell finds little support for the idea that campaign finance regulations limit the influence of campaign contributions. This may reflect the rather blunt nature of the measurement (a dichotomous variable indicating the presence or absence of limits), but it also raises an interesting possibility. If your concern is the influence of money over the legislative process, term limits may be more effective, inasmuch as they reduce the value of legislative office to the incumbent. Term‐limited legislators, however, may spend more time raising money for the party caucus."
"5","The book suffers from a few limitations. First, in the balance between readability and methodological sophistication, Powell clearly opts for the latter. This is understandable, but it may limit her readership to more‐sophisticated audiences. Second, the survey data are from a single year—2002—raising questions about the generalizability of the findings outside of this particular historical context. There is no easy solution here, and Powell does compare the findings to other research, strengthening the validity of her findings. These shortcomings aside, this is excellent research and an important contribution to the literatures on campaign finance and state legislatures."
