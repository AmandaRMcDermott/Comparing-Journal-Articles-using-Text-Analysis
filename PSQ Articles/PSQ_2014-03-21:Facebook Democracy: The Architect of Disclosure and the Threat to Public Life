"1","Without a doubt, the Internet is changing the way we interact with the political world. As citizens, we not only struggle to fully understand how the Internet changes the way we think about the world, but we struggle with understanding how such changes affect behaviors. One of the largest, popular Internet Web sites today, Facebook, is poised at the center of these changes. As a social networking site, Facebook stands as an entity poised to be of critical, if not vital, importance to the manner in which citizens participate in politics."
"2","José Marichal contributes to this discussion with an insightful look at the interplay of citizens and social networking sites. As an examination of the Facebook platform and the philosophy behind how people actually network on the site, Facebook Democracy offers a fascinating contribution to the study of political communication. Throughout this study, Marichal outlines what he terms Facebook's architecture of disclosure. In the opening pages, Marichal describes how Facebook has created an expectation that users should openly share personal information on the social networking site. This sets the stage for a rather dynamic discussion of the medium that pulls from multiple academic disciplines. Marichal supplants this work with a content analysis of 250 Facebook groups from 32 countries. All in all, this is a comprehensive, well‐thought‐out examination of Facebook and its effect on democracy.         "
"3","Prior to the Web 2.0 revolution, human interaction looked and felt much different. Social networks were already in existence, albeit offline. Within traditional face‐to‐face networks, people interact in a way that is communicative. Marichal's book strikes a chord because he describes how Facebook's preference for disclosure encourages a type of interaction that is much more expressive than communicative. Marichal argues that Facebook has encouraged its users to engage in identity performance, where individuals exchange and display information about themselves in a public space. This performance is increasingly becoming a distinct form of interaction in Web peer‐to‐peer communication."
"4","The first third of Marichal's book is dedicated to outlining these ideas in detail. Even early on in these chapters, it becomes clear that the strength of Marichal's book is its ability to generate insight. Very little is known about the societal implications of online social networking. However, the manner in which Marichal explains Facebook's operating principles generates many different ideas about how the social networking site is changing our perceptions of the world around us. To interested citizens, this should be considered important work. As a researcher interested in these issues, this book is invaluable."
"5","The remaining chapters of Facebook Democracy are devoted to several discussions about this current state of affairs and its effect on democratic values and practices. Here, the discussion delves deeper by examining how the architecture of disclosure affects topics such as voice, activism, and privacy. As normative issues, each of these chapters deserves greater attention; they only begin to scratch the surface of each topic. Again, while the strength of Facebook Democracy lies in is its ability to generate insight on these issues, these chapters exemplify the generalist nature of the study. The book leaves the reader with a desire to further examine Facebook and its connection to topics such as sociology, communication, politics, and democratic theory. As we move through the digital age, it becomes clear that the true impact of online social networking on politics still remains to be seen. Facebook Democracy is a thought‐provoking and essential book that helps facilitate our understanding of how the Internet is changing the political world.         "
