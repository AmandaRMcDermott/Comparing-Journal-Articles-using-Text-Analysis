"1","In April 2003, the United Nations (UN)‐patrolled Green Line dividing the free portion of the Republic of Cyprus from the 37 percent of the island under occupation by Turkey's military since 1974 was opened to inter‐communal passage. In the ensuing decade, there have been 17 million incident‐free crossings at five checkpoints at the Green Line. The opening of the Green Line, catalyzed by then‐Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's decision to end his opposition to regular contact between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, was optimistically heralded by international veterans of “the Cyprus Problem” as akin to tearing down the Berlin Wall, and was hopefully interpreted by communal peace groups on the island as the step that would quickly facilitate a resolution of the island's de facto partition. Today, the Cyprus Problem remains unresolved, despite the remarkable frequency of Green Line crossings and consequent plethora of inter‐communal contact experiences, and Nicosia is the only divided capital in a European Union member‐state."
"2","The Past in Pieces: Belonging in the New Cyprus turns on the single question of why the opening of the Green Line has “not led the island any closer to reunification, indeed in many ways has driven the two communities farther apart” (p. i). Rebecca Bryant argues that the Green Line has functioned, paradoxically, to evoke and to harden Greek and Turkish Cypriots' divergent memories of a “past in pieces,” whereby the re‐connection afforded by the Green Line crossings has clarified “what people had begun to call the ‘new Cyprus”’ (p. ix), a new socio‐political reality of separation and division built on the fragmented, incompatible memories of life on Cyprus before 1974.         "
"3","An anthropologist at George Mason University, who has also been involved in the Critical Historical Studies Initiative at the Oslo Cyprus Centre, Bryant lays out the contours of the “past in pieces” through her ethnographic research on both sides of the Green Line (that is, in the southern part of the island controlled by the Republic of Cyprus, and in the northern part of the island under occupation by 45,000 Turkish troops and administered by the Turkish‐Cypriot authorities). However, Bryant's research is overwhelmingly based on her narrative of memories of Turkish Cypriots living in the town of Lapithos. Bryant selects Lapithos as a critical case study for her argument because of the town's pre‐1974 history of ethnically mixed demography and economic prosperity, but above all, because Lapithos is “a town with a violent history” (p. 5)—Greek Cypriots' guerrilla struggle for self‐determination in the British colonial period, Turkish Cypriots' fearful flight to enclaves after episodes of inter‐communal violence in the newly independent Republic of Cyprus, and Turkish military atrocities against Greek Cypriot civilians when the Athens junta's coup against the Nicosia government led to Ankara's invasion of Cyprus in 1974."
"4","The “chronicle of the ‘new Cyprus”’ (p. 15) that Bryant constructs is powerful for the repeated tropes of loss, displacement, and existential pain caused by ruptures in the organic connection between peoples and places, property, and territory. Divided into an Introduction, eight chapters, and a by‐way‐of conclusion, The Past in Pieces compellingly illustrates the logic and mechanics by which the act(s) of crossing have not brought reconciliation and peace in the form of a bizonal, bicommunal, federal solution long proposed by a succession of UN special envoys for Cyprus.         "
"5","The book is strongest in its accounts of Turkish Cypriots' memories of past and witness to present: the post‐1974 chasm between their economic development and wealth standards versus those of Greek Cypriots explains the hardening of Turkish Cypriot memories of life in the Republic of Cyprus as second‐class citizens always at risk of being victimized by Greek Cypriot national chauvinism."
"6","Indeed, this book is best understood as an ethnographic study of the effects of Green Line crossing on Turkish Cypriot narratives of nationalism—not only because Bryant resides in Lapithos, which lies in the northern part of the island, where fewer than 400 Greek Cypriots remain. Bryant largely dismisses Greek Cypriot recollections of the short life (1960–1974) of the independent Republic of Cyprus as a time of acceptable coexistence—although a compromise to majority self‐determination and a period punctuated by episodes of inter‐communal violence—as evidence of self‐serving, Greek‐Cypriot chauvinism. Furthermore, Bryant's research seems to have overlooked completely the centrality of Turkey's occupation for both Turkish Cypriot notions of belonging. Turkey is presented only as an idealized motherland in pre‐1974 memories, rather than as an imperialist motherland whose daily control and settler/migration policies have rendered Turkish Cypriots a minority in the north of Cyprus. Bryant also ignores the Turkish troop presence as a factor in explaining Greek Cypriot interpretations of the past."
"7","The book founders on Bryant's failure to explore “belonging in the new Cyprus” as a reality, for Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots alike, which is defined by the parameters of Turkey's occupation presence (Turkish Armed Forces and mainland migrants). The book's other weaknesses are equally striking, especially for the editorial failures implied by the absence of reference notes and bibliography, omissions rendered even more inexplicable in the face of rich cross‐disciplinary research on “the Cyprus Problem” (Diez and Tocci, eds., 2009; Papadakis, Peristianis, and Welz, eds., 2006) and abundant comparative research on integration and partition in communally divided states (Brown and Ganguly, 1997; Downes, 2006; Kaufmann, 2004, 1996; Kumar, 1999)."
"8","Overall, Bryant's argument about the Cyprus case deserves attention from political scientists working at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations. Bryant's book, albeit flawed, situates Cyprus within the growing collection of cases in which “persons with memories of life together and of specific places that they had lost … have found their own memories altered by changes in the political present, and how such changes have in turn affected the political choices that they are now making” (p. 5)."
