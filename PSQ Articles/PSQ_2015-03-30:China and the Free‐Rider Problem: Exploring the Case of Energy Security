"1","IS CHINA PULLING ITS WEIGHT IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM? In recent years, China has increased its contribution to United Nations peacekeeping, raised its foreign aid to impoverished countries, and made significant commitments to global arms control initiatives.1 Even so, a rising chorus of voices has charged that China is “free riding” on cooperation undertaken by the United States and other countries that provides benefits to the wider international community. Calling China a free rider is nothing new; scholars described China as free riding on nuclear arms control agreements and international environmental cooperation as early as the 1990s.2 Yet with the United States beset by financial and economic woes in recent years, allegations that Beijing free rides on the United States and other countries have grown more frequent and more impatient. Whether the issue is fighting terrorism or preventing nuclear proliferation, it has become routine—particularly in the United States—to complain that China is not doing enough to support international cooperation.3 The number of articles containing both of the terms “China” and “free rider” in the Factiva database, for example, increased from an average of 39 per year from 2005 to 2009 to 75 per year from 2010 to 2013. Chinese observers, meanwhile, argue among themselves whether China free rides (da bian che) on the collective action of other states.4 Some agree that China should be seen as a free rider, at least in some areas.5 Other Chinese writers disagree and reject the notion that China should take on “even more responsibility” for global governance.6"
"2","Should China be understood as a free rider in the international system? If so, what kinds of calculations are driving its behavior? The most critical commentaries depict China as greedily seeking national advantage while the American hegemon staggers under the weight of its global responsibilities.7 Yet a failure to invest in collective action need not reflect a desire to limit costs and exploit others. It could also reflect other considerations, particularly distrust of the other actors involved, as discussed later. Such possibilities must also be considered in China's case. Experienced observers of U.S.–China relations have recently noted how pervasive distrust is in the relationship.8 Moreover, as a new player in many international arenas, China might be expected to renegotiate current modes of cooperation rather than simply accept them as they are. Understanding the considerations behind Chinese behavior is essential if other countries wish to elicit more cooperative behavior from Beijing in the future.         "
"3","To consider these questions more thoroughly, this article focuses on international collective action to provide energy security, particularly with respect to oil. More precisely, it employs a traditional definition of “energy security” and focuses on multilateral efforts to ensure that oil supplies are adequate, reliable, and affordable.9 It does so for three reasons. First, there are multiple international efforts that can be scrutinized in this regard, each of which provides an opportunity to explore China's role in global collective action. This article focuses on multinational efforts to ensure the security of the sea lanes through which oil shipments flow and coordination among the world's major oil consumers to cope with supply disruptions and stabilize markets. Second, China has recently been described as free riding on each of these efforts, as noted later. It is important to explore the extent to which these analyses are accurate and, if so, discern the kinds of considerations that are driving Chinese behavior. Third, participation in the world oil market and cooperation in the provision of energy security represents a key aspect of China's integration into the world economy and global governance.10 In 2013, China represented 12.1 percent of global oil demand, second only to the United States at 19.9 percent.11 China has also emerged as the world's largest oil importer, and net imports now regularly exceed more than half of its demand.12 China's prominence as an oil consumer and importer will undoubtedly rise in years to come, both because of its rapid demand growth and because it is poorly positioned to replicate the “shale revolution” that has made the United States more self‐reliant in oil and gas.13 In short, energy security offers an empirically rich and politically important case study through which China's behavior can be explored.         "
"4","The article proceeds as follows: It begins by reviewing the concept of free riding in more depth explains how one might discern the kinds of motivations that drive free riding in a particular case. It then considers how China has approached efforts to maintain global energy security with respect to oil focusing on the two areas mentioned earlier. The analysis finds that China can be described as free riding or cheap riding in these areas but China's behavior is better explained by distrust than by a preference for exploiting the cooperation of others. The conclusion sums up the findings considers the implications for cooperation with China going forward."
"5","While the basic logic of the free‐rider problem has been appreciated for centuries, modern scholarship on collective action and free riding dates to the publication of Mancur Olson's The Logic of Collective Action in 1965.14 Olson challenged the view that actors with a shared interest will naturally organize to pursue that interest. As he noted, collective action can be costly, and when it produces benefits that are available to noncontributors, some actors will decide not to contribute to the cooperative effort. Olson did not use the term “free rider” to describe such actors, but the essential logic was clear: some actors will choose to enjoy the benefits of collective action without contributing. As Olson noted, this means that the goods produced through collective action are frequently underprovided.         "
"6","The concepts of collective action and free riding have been used to understand a wide range of challenges in international cooperation. Olson and Richard Zeckhauser pioneered this trend, focusing on collective defense and burden sharing among allies.15 Since then, the concept has become part of the basic vocabulary in the study of international politics. Even so, the term “free rider” is not always clearly defined, and it can be used in somewhat different ways, so a bit more precision here will be useful. There are two key elements of free riding as the term will be used in this article, both of which must apply for the term to be appropriate. First, it refers to an actor that enjoys a good produced by the collective action of one or more other actors regardless of its own contribution. In other words, the good that is enjoyed must be nonexcludable (if not necessarily nonrival).16 Second, the actor in question must make a disproportionately small contribution to the collective effort from which it benefits. It may make no contribution whatsoever, in which case the free riding is obvious. Or the actor may make some contribution to the collective effort, but nonetheless its share of the costs remains smaller than its share of the benefits.17 In the latter case, the actor can be described as “cheap riding” rather than simply free riding.18 To be sure, the costs and benefits involved in international cooperation can be difficult to measure with precision. They can be roughly assessed, however, and that is often done. Scholars have argued that some allies make disproportionately small contributions to their alliance's collective effort, for example, even when the contributions in question are not negligible.19"
"7","While free riding always involves noncooperation, it is useful to distinguish between two different types of free riders. The first type is preference driven. In this case, the actor is looking for a “free lunch.” That is, its goal is to enjoy the fruits of cooperation without paying for them. While such an outcome is suboptimal for the community as a whole, it is optimal for the free rider, which enjoys the benefits of others' cooperation while limiting its costs. This understanding of free riding was highlighted in Olson's pioneering work, and it has since been highly influential in international relations. The second type of free rider is driven by distrust. In this case, the actor is worried that it will be exploited by others if it cooperates. It thus chooses not to cooperate or to limit its cooperation significantly. To the extent that the other actors involved do cooperate, the distrustful actor is then effectively free riding or cheap riding on their collective action. The importance of trust, and the debilitating effects of distrust, in collective action has recently received greater attention among international relations scholars. Andrew Kydd, for example, notes that hegemonic powers can promote international cooperation and reduce free riding, but only if other states trust the hegemon to cooperate.20 Aaron Hoffman emphasizes the role of institutional design in building trust and promoting cooperation among states.21 Brian Rathbun maintains that some individuals are simply more trusting than others and that trusting leaders are more likely to support international collective action.22"
"8","Distrust can undermine collective action in more ways than one. If cooperation entails a particular exchange, distrust may undermine expectations of “specific reciprocity”—the belief that the other side will requite cooperation with equivalent value in the required time frame.23 In more open‐ended situations, ones that involve multiple actors and an unspecified time frame, distrust undermines expectations of “diffuse reciprocity”—the belief that cooperation will be requited more generally and over the long term.24 That is, the concern may not be the response to a specific cooperative act but what will transpire within a relationship (or set of relationships) over time.         "
"9","While preference‐driven free riding and distrust‐driven free riding both entail noncooperation, close scrutiny should allow outsiders to determine which dynamic is driving a particular actor's behavior. First, the preceding discussion suggests that different types of free riding have different implications for behavior. Preference‐driven free riders should be willing to make commitments that allow them to limit their costs, even if this entails dependence on other actors. A state that wishes to “pass the buck” to its allies, for example, should be willing to enter into an alliance as a means of keeping its military spending low, even though this means that it depends on other states for national security. Free riders driven by distrust, in turn, should be less concerned with limiting their costs and more concerned with limiting their vulnerability to exploitation. States worried about specific reciprocity, for example, should seek to strengthen monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance from the other party. States worried about diffuse reciprocity, in turn, should avoid open‐ended commitments that leave them vulnerable to exploitation more generally, even if this means that they must endure greater costs and invest in self‐help. Second, different types of free riding have different implications for domestic discourse. If a state is driven by an underlying preference for free riding, its domestic commentary on the issue in question will presumably emphasize the desirability of minimizing one's own costs, as well as the notion that other states will cooperate regardless of one's own actions. In contrast, if a state is driven by distrust, its domestic commentary should emphasize suspicions of one or more potential partners and the vulnerability that cooperation would entail."
"10","With this discussion as foreground, we can turn our attention to the challenge of international collective action with respect to energy security, and oil security in particular. The extent to which China is free riding on such efforts, and the kinds of considerations that are driving its behavior, are considered in the following section."
"11","There are multiple collective goods produced by the world's major oil consumers as they pursue energy security. The following discussion considers two key areas of cooperation in particular: efforts to maintain security in the sea lines of communication (SLOC) through which oil shipments flow and efforts to cope with supply disruptions."
"12","In 2011, world oil production was roughly 87 million barrels per day, and more than half of that total was transported by tankers along maritime routes.25 With thick hulls, compartmentalized holds, and sophisticated fire‐suppression systems, large oil tankers are not easily sunk.26 Tankers are slow moving and typically have little ability to defend themselves, however, so they are hardly invulnerable to attacks from pirates, terrorists, or national military forces. Moreover, tankers often travel through narrow choke points, and transit through these points can be impeded or even blocked for a period of time. The Strait of Hormuz is by far the most important choke point, both because of the volume of shipping involved and because of the lack of alternative routes available (see Table 1).            "
"13","Traditionally, the U.S. Navy and allied forces have led efforts to maintain security in the world's major SLOC. The U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, for example, has historically focused on the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and parts of the Indian Ocean. The Fifth Fleet typically includes a carrier strike group, an amphibious ready group or expeditionary strike group, and other ships and aircraft, with nearly 30,000 personnel serving afloat and ashore.27 During heightened tensions in 2012, the United States beefed up its presence around Hormuz by dispatching an additional aircraft carrier and other military assets to the region.28 It also held large naval exercises in the area, with an emphasis on mine‐clearing operations, with vessels from more than 20 other countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Jordan, Yemen, and Estonia.29 The U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet, in turn, has an area of responsibility that includes the Pacific and much of the Indian Ocean, including the Malacca Strait. Patrolling in the latter is politically complicated. The three littoral states—Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore—have asserted that they possess the sole right to provide security in the strait, and the three governments have different priorities and conflicting maritime claims. The United States does conduct naval exercises with the three states on an annual basis, however, and the United States and Japan have both provided various forms assistance to improve strait security.30"
"14","The cost to American taxpayers of protecting the flow of oil worldwide is very difficult to calculate with precision. The forces involved can be used for multiple missions and can serve multiple purposes at the same time. Nonetheless, one particularly thorough study suggests that the U.S. military could eliminate two aircraft carrier battle groups, nearly three army divisions, and 344 bombers and fighter jets, thereby saving $67.5 billion annually, if protecting the production and transit of oil were not one of its missions.31 The same study concluded that an additional $8 billion per year could be saved through reduced operational costs. Other estimates of the annual cost of protecting the supply and flow of oil have ranged as low as $13 billion and as high as $143 billion.32 In short, while the exact figure remains uncertain and subject to dispute, the cost to the United States of protecting the flow of oil worldwide is substantial.            "
"15","China is often described as free riding on U.S.‐led efforts to ensure SLOC security.33 Is the label appropriate? There is little doubt that China benefits from and desires safe passage for international shipping. China relies heavily on seaborne trade for both exports and imports, and its energy imports in particular come primarily by sea. In recent years, China has obtained more than three‐quarters of its oil from Africa and the Persian Gulf, making it heavily reliant on both the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of Malacca, even as it has sought to rely more on overland sources.34 It thus benefits from international efforts to maintain security in these areas, and it would not be practical to prevent China from enjoying these benefits. The oil in a given tanker can change ownership many times in a given journey, so efforts to interdict Chinese oil shipments in transit would be exceedingly difficult. While a blockade of Chinese ports could be attempted, this would be considered an act of war, making it impractical in peacetime.35"
"16","Chinese leaders appear to believe that naval patrols are an important element of SLOC security. In 2004, President Hu Jintao encouraged the Chinese military to prepare for less traditional tasks, such as providing security at sea beyond China's territorial waters, as part of the Chinese military's “new historic missions.”36 One might still ask, however, how much Chinese leaders value current U.S.‐led efforts to enhance SLOC security. China has objected to the U.S. Navy's presence and activities in the South China Sea, for example, where China has territorial disputes with several Southeast Asian countries. In February 2012, the People's Daily complained that the United States and Japan were using piracy as an “excuse” to “encroach” on the South China Sea.37 Shortly thereafter, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that “navigation freedom and safety in the South China Sea has never been a problem” in response to the suggestion that the U.S. Navy helps maintain sea lane security in the area.38 The claim was remarkable, given that the aforementioned People's Daily article had described piracy in the South China Sea as “utterly rampant” (shifen changjue).            "
"17","Farther from China's shores and outstanding territorial and maritime claims, however, Beijing's views appear more nuanced. The Strait of Hormuz is a particularly important case to examine, given the volume of oil that passes through it, the prominent role played by U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, and the fact that Washington and Beijing often differ significantly on how to deal with Iran. During the Iran‐Iraq War in the 1980s, China condemned attacks on neutral shipping in the Gulf, but it also called for the United States to withdraw its forces from the area, leaving the region's security affairs to the Gulf countries themselves.39 Yet China's approach has changed in recent years as it has come to rely heavily on the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. In late 2011, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, prompting the United States and other countries to step up their naval presence in the area. In contrast to its response in the 1980s, the Chinese government did not criticize these increased efforts, even though it has criticized U.S. and European efforts to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. In fact, China seems to have quietly supported U.S. efforts to keep Hormuz open. In late 2011, Beijing dispatched Deputy Foreign Minister Zhai Jun to Tehran for talks with Iranian leaders during which they “exchanged views over international and regional issues.”40 In January 2012, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that “the importance of the Strait of Hormuz is self‐evident” and that “China hopes to see peace and stability in the region, which serves the common interests of all countries”—a clear signal that it did not wish for Iran (or anyone else) to escalate the situation.41 Chinese premier Wen Jiabao subsequently visited the Persian Gulf in February and pointedly did not visit Iran, traveling to other Gulf States that could be alternative energy suppliers for China, particularly Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar.42 During his trip—the first ever by a Chinese premier to the last two countries—Wen expressed concern about the security of Hormuz, stated that normal shipping should be guaranteed regardless of the circumstances, and cautioned against any “extreme move” with regard to the strait.43 In short, China's tacit support suggests that Beijing values U.S. efforts to keep oil flowing from the Persian Gulf, at least as long as the United States does not use the issue to initiate conflict with Iran. This point is reinforced by interviews with Chinese experts, who note that China benefits from U.S. military deployments that bring security to sea lanes in the Middle East and that China therefore does not oppose such efforts.44 Or, as Chen Weidong of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation wrote in 2012, “we understand that the United States' presence and influence in the Middle East is a key factor behind that region's stability.”45 Chen added that China does not “wish to see the United States completely withdraw from the Middle East”—a concern that has arisen recently as the United States has become less reliant on oil imports from the region.46"
"18","To be sure, more hardline officials have argued that China should strengthen Iran against U.S. “hegemony” in the Persian Gulf through weapons sales and support for Iran's nuclear program.47 Since 2006, however, China has supported four United Nations Security Council resolutions to limit Iran's access to military technologies. In addition, U.S. government sources report that Chinese arms sales to Iran have declined significantly since 2007, with actual deliveries falling from around $200 million between 2004 and 2007 to less than $50 million between 2008 and 2011.48 While China's ties with Iran improved in 2014, with military exchanges and the Chinese navy's first‐ever visit to an Iranian port, China has not called for the U.S. Navy to withdraw from the Persian Gulf.            "
"19","If China's leaders value at least some multinational efforts to ensure SLOC security, to what extent does China contribute to them? China's efforts in this regard have increased in recent years. Since December 2008, Chinese naval vessels have participated in antipiracy operations off the coast of Somalia along with naval forces from a wide range of other countries. In August 2014, China claimed that that its vessels had escorted more than 5,670 ships in this effort and that they had rescued or aided 60 others.49 In addition, along with 19 other countries, China has acceded to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP). Located in Singapore, ReCAAP's Information Sharing Center allows member countries to pool information about incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships, helping them focus their patrolling efforts. China participates in this system, which also makes incident reports available online, and it has seconded staff and made modest financial contributions to support ReCAAP's operations.50 China has also provided foreign assistance to the Malacca Strait's littoral countries in the past.51 Nonetheless, one well‐known Chinese energy security analyst laments that China has not done more to promote sea lane security near the Malacca Strait. In his view, greater assistance to the littoral countries would help address the charge that China “free rides” on other countries' efforts to provide energy security.52"
"20","Indeed, while China's role in the provision of SLOC security is growing, it is not doing the heavy lifting of providing sea lane security in critical areas such as the Persian Gulf. As one Chinese analyst concedes, “the U.S. is the main provider of international energy security.”53 China's limited contribution reflects, in part, the limitations of its navy, which faces substantial challenges in trying to maintain a presence in the Indian Ocean.54 Nonetheless, the idea that China would do more if only its navy could do more is belied by Chinese behavior: China has declined some opportunities to become more involved in cooperative efforts to promote sea lane security. In 2005, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Mullen proposed the “1,000‐Ship Navy,” an effort to foster greater cooperation amongst naval forces around the world against shared threats such as terrorism and piracy. The effort was launched in a context of growing technological sophistication of navies around the world, which was creating new challenges to cooperation, and was designed to promote real‐time data sharing and improve interoperability.55 The idea was later dubbed the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative, and various efforts have been made under this banner to strengthen international maritime cooperation. In 2007, Mullen invited China to become involved in the initiative when his Chinese counterpart was visiting Washington.56 China declined this and subsequent invitations, however.            "
"21","China and the United States have recently increased their naval cooperation as military ties have improved. For the first time ever, China attended the International Sea Power Symposium at the U.S. Naval War College in 2014, and Chinese vessels participated in the Rim of the Pacific naval exercises that year as well. Chinese and U.S. vessels have also held joint antipiracy drills off the coast of Somalia in recent years. Even so, the United States would like to increase antipiracy cooperation with China.57 U.S. antipiracy efforts in the area are channeled through the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), a 30‐country partnership headquartered at U.S. military facilities in Bahrain. China's naval vessels (and those of several other countries) operate independently of the CMF. Although the efforts of the various forces in the area are coordinated through “deconfliction” meetings, which minimize duplication of effort in the absence of a centralized command, such coordination does not enable the same level of cooperation that is possible within the CMF. The latter benefits from a unified command structure as well as more secure communications. China remains uncomfortable with such intimate cooperation, partly because it would require the installation of U.S. communications technology on its vessels.58"
"22","Despite China's increasing role in SLOC protection, therefore, it is fair to say that China is cheap riding (if not free riding) on the efforts of other countries in this regard. What are the considerations behind this behavior? If China's cheap riding were driven by a preference to exploit the cooperation of others, it should take advantage of the provision of sea lane security by other countries to maintain low defense expenditures, at least in the naval sphere. However, China is engaged in a substantial naval modernization effort. This effort has been enabled by striking increases in Chinese military spending since the 1990s, which have made the Chinese defense budget the second largest in the world by a wide margin.59 The results of these efforts are becoming apparent. China's first aircraft carrier, a refurbished vessel originally purchased from Ukraine in 1998, began sea trials in August 2011. While this carrier's capabilities remain quite limited, the U.S. Department of Defense projects that China will build multiple indigenous carriers and support ships over the next decade.60 Other scholars have estimated that each carrier battle group that China builds will cost roughly $10 billion, with annual maintenance costs of about $200 million, to say nothing of the opportunity cost such expenses represent in a developing country.61 While scholars have debated whether China's naval expansion reflects popular nationalism or evolving national interests, the point here is simply that China is investing in substantial new naval capabilities rather than simply trying to minimize its costs.62 Such behavior is more compatible with the hypothesis that China's limited cooperation reflects distrust than with the idea that it wants a “free lunch.”            "
"23","If we examine China's domestic deliberations, the evidence available reinforces the hypothesis that distrust is the main driver of Chinese behavior. Specifically, there is little expectation that diffuse reciprocity would obtain if China were to become more involved in multinational efforts in this regard. Naval cooperation to ensure SLOC security is an open‐ended endeavor, and there is little belief within China that it can count on American goodwill over the long term. Mullen's initial invitation to join the 1,000‐Ship Navy, for example, prompted a range of commentary in China, much of which was suspicious of U.S. intentions.63 Chinese admiral Yang Yi, then director of strategic studies at China's National Defense University, published a particularly thorough analysis of how China should react to the proposal.64 While open to the idea of increasing Sino‐American naval cooperation, Yang was also wary of American intentions and advised proceeding with caution. As he wrote,               "
"24","What is the deeper U.S. strategic intention of the [thousand ship navy] program in addition to the declared purpose of fighting global terrorism? Does it fit in with China's foreign policy to participate in such a program? How will participation impact China's national security interests? Can China open its ports and provide logistic support to the U.S. Navy? These suspicions of U.S. intentions go beyond a few individuals and include a significant group of people in China, for good reasons.65"
"25","Chinese commentary often suggests that the “deeper strategic intention” of the United States is to maintain its preeminence by controlling multilateral initiatives. The People's Daily, for example, has argued that seeking naval cooperation with other countries was “the inevitable choice for sustaining (U.S.) maritime hegemony,” given that the United States could not guarantee maritime security worldwide by itself.66 Other Chinese writers worry that the United States is “strengthening its hegemony through the process of international cooperation.”67 In short, as other analysts have noted, there is clear evidence that distrust plays a key role in Chinese deliberations about closer cooperation with the U.S. Navy.68"
"26","Since the early 1970s, the world's major oil importers have coped with supply disruptions through what Robert Keohane has called “the consumers' oil regime.”69 The focal point of such cooperation is the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA's 28 members must provide energy data to the organization in order to improve market transparency, and each member is required to maintain oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports for the previous year. In a supply crisis, IEA members hold consultations concerning efforts to restrain their demand and to bring additional supplies to the market through the release of reserve stocks. The IEA has made three such releases in its history: in response to the first Gulf War in 1991, to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005, and to the Libyan civil war in 2011. In theory, IEA allocation decisions can be made by majority vote, but in practice, they are made by consensus.70"
"27","Recent studies have suggested that China (as well as other oil‐importing countries outside the IEA) free ride on the cooperation of IEA members.71 But does the Chinese government believe that the IEA performs a valuable service? In some respects, Beijing appears uncertain. Some Chinese officials reportedly worry that the level of transparency required by the IEA provides fodder for speculators rather than reassuring markets.72 China certainly does not disclose as much information about its domestic oil system as the IEA would require. China does participate in the Joint Organisations Data Initiative, which aims to provide comprehensive energy data worldwide, but its latest submission for oil was rated “fair” (a middling grade between “good” and “poor”) in terms of completeness. By comparison, India's and Brazil's submissions were rated “good.”73 In other respects, however, China seems to believe that the IEA provides a valuable service. Following the IEA's announcement of a stock drawdown in response to the Libyan civil war, China's National Energy Administration stated that it “appreciated and supported” the IEA's move, and it called on the international community to play a more “active and constructive” role in ensuring that global oil prices were at “reasonable” levels.74 More generally, the fact that China is now investing in its own strategic petroleum reserve (SPR)—and doing so in an era when oil prices have been relatively high—is a clear vote of confidence in the idea that national reserves perform a valuable function. The first phase of China's SPR has already been completed and holds about 100 million barrels. The second phase is currently being filled and will reportedly expand China's holdings by another 210 million barrels. The third phase, which is scheduled to be completed by 2020, will expand China's SPR to more than 500 million barrels.75"
"28","China thus seems to believe that the IEA performs a valuable service, at least with respect to the maintenance and management of strategic reserves. Because it is not a member of the organization, however, it does not contribute to the provision of this service. To some extent, it is hard to blame China for this. Although the United States supports China's joining the organization, there are a number of hurdles to Chinese membership.76 The agreement establishing the IEA in 1974 envisioned the group's members being drawn from the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD). As China is not an OECD country, special arrangements would have to be made for it to join the IEA. China also maintains that it cannot yet comply with the IEA requirement that its reserves (including both its SPR and industry stocks) equal 90 days of net import demand.77 It is also unclear whether the IEA's Governing Board can reform its voting structure in a way that satisfies both its 28 existing members and its potential members, which could include not just China but also other countries such as India and Russia.78 Finally, it has been suggested that some IEA members are unenthusiastic about the idea of Chinese membership because their power within the organization would be diluted if it were to take on new members.79"
"29","These hurdles may seem daunting, but they are not insurmountable. As IEA director Nobuo Tanaka stated in 2009, “we have sent a message that if they wish (to join), there is a way.”80 The most important hurdle to closer cooperation, then, is China's own reluctance to work with the organization. To be sure, China has participated in some IEA activities in recent years as a “major dialogue partner,” and Chinese representatives have observed several IEA ministerial meetings since 2005. More recently, the IEA has announced an “association” with China, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa.81 It remains unclear what this will mean in practice, but it clearly will not mean full Chinese membership in the IEA.82 In fact, it may not even lead to China's conducting an emergency response exercise with the organization. In May 2012, India conducted such an exercise with the IEA in New Delhi—a breakthrough for relations between the two, given that it involves sharing sensitive information concerning how the government would act in the event of a supply crisis. So far, China has not agreed to conduct a comparable exercise with the IEA.            "
"30","For now, then, China appears to be free riding as far as its relationship with the IEA is concerned. While it would be complex undertaking for China to join the organization, particularly in the short term, China has not been eager to affiliate itself more closely with the IEA. Nor is it taking all the opportunities it could to contribute to the agency's efforts as a nonmember. What explains this stance? If China's behavior were driven by a desire to exploit and profit from the collective action of others, it should take advantage of extant cooperation to limit its own costs. Yet it is difficult to describe China as preoccupied with limiting its costs: it is actively investing in a large reserve system. Cost considerations were a major concern in the debate within China over whether to build the SPR, and some analysts suggested that China could spare itself the expense because countries such as the United States and Japan already had major reserve systems.83 China's leadership clearly rejected that argument, however, and the country is now engaged in building what will likely become the world's second‐largest SPR. While the total cost of China's system is difficult to estimate with precision, one study by scholars at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has projected that the total cost will fall between US$15 billion and US$65 billion, depending on variations in the price of oil and the impact of Chinese purchases on the oil market.84 In short, China is not simply trying to minimize its costs; it is engaging in self‐help at considerable expense. This stance is more compatible with distrust‐driven free riding than with preference‐driven free riding.            "
"31","If we scrutinize deliberations within China, it is clear that China's policy toward cooperation with the IEA is being debated.85 Some observers, including analysts at state‐run think tanks, have argued that China should seek closer ties with the organization.86 These writers cite a number of benefits that could flow from such a relationship, including reassuring the outside world about China's rise, giving China a stronger voice in international energy governance, and allowing greater access to the IEA's expertise and experience. For now, however, arguments against joining the IEA have prevailed. Some suggest that joining an organization of “rich” countries would undermine China's claim to developing country status—a point that could have implications for China's position in climate change negotiations and other issues.87 Most important for this article, Chinese writers also worry about the intentions of key IEA members, particularly the United States. As Xu Ying, an expert on international organizations and Chinese diplomacy, has written,               "
"32","Leaving aside the fact that China's SPR has not yet reached 90 days [of net import demand] and that China as a developing country is not a member of the OECD, the true strategic intentions of the so‐called “democratic” countries who are members of the IEA are enough to make China “look before it leaps.”88"
"33","Xu proceeded to suggest that the IEA announcement in July 2010 that China had surpassed the United States as the world's largest energy consumer was designed to put China on the defensive prior to the climate change summit in Cancun at the end of the year. Interviews with Chinese energy experts suggest that this was a widespread perception in Beijing at the time.89 Other writers worry that attempts to bring China into the IEA are part of a broader effort by Western countries to control China. Citing the IEA case as an example, Pang Zhongying of People's University in Beijing has argued that Western governments try to persuade China to enter new international institutions on Western terms “so that they can use international institutions to ‘govern' China.”90 In short, there is concern in China that the IEA can be manipulated by Western governments to put pressure on China over energy‐related issues or to gain control over China's decision‐making processes. While this view might seem unduly pessimistic, Chinese experts report that there is real concern within the Chinese government about the loss of autonomy that becoming more formally affiliated with the IEA would entail.91"
"34","The public debate in China thus suggests that distrust is driving its behavior with respect to the IEA. As in the case of sea lane security, it is not a question of specific reciprocity—there would be no specific quid pro quo for China if it were to work more closely with the IEA. Instead, it is a question of diffuse reciprocity and, in particular, whether the United States and its allies would exploit Chinese membership in the IEA in some fashion."
"35","Recent Chinese diplomacy also suggests that distrust is a key concern for China. In early 2012, Chinese premier Wen Jiabao proposed creating an “administrative mechanism” for the global energy market under the G20. The grouping would include energy‐exporting countries, energy‐importing countries, and transit countries. Wen explained that the group would develop “binding international rules through consultation and dialogue” and “build multilateral coordination mechanisms covering forecast and early warning, price coordination, financial regulation and emergency response.”92 Wen's proposal was striking in its failure to mention the IEA and the apparent overlap between the proposed mechanism and some of the IEA's functions—particularly “emergency response.” Chinese energy experts have since indicated that Wen's proposal is but one of several options for global energy governance under discussion in China. The others include reforming and expanding the IEA, strengthening energy initiatives that have larger memberships (such as the International Energy Forum and the Energy Charter Treaty), and creating a wholly new institution.93 In each case, the dominance of Washington would be diluted considerably. Evidently, China is not averse to multilateral energy governance, or even binding international rules in this area, so much as wary of joining a group that consists of the United States and its OECD friends and allies.            "
"36","This article finds that China is cheap riding or free riding on two key aspects of global energy security cooperation. With respect to sea lane security, China is cheap riding: it benefits substantially from multinational efforts in this regard without making a proportionate contribution. With respect to the oil consumers' regime, it is free riding: it benefits from extant international cooperation without participating. Of course, China has only limited ability to contribute to sea lane security, and there are various barriers to its joining the IEA. Even so, China has had opportunities to be more cooperative than it has been, but it has not taken them. It is thus difficult to claim that China's level of cooperation has been dictated by its limited naval capabilities or the membership requirements of the IEA."
"37","China is hardly the only country that free rides or cheap rides on multinational efforts to enhance energy security, but its growing wealth and power make it the most important actor in this regard. It is thus important to ascertain the considerations behind its behavior. If China were motivated primarily by a preference for exploiting others' cooperation, Beijing should be trying hard to limit its costs while it free rides. Yet China has chosen to embark on a significant naval modernization effort and to construct a large SPR system. These investments in building up China's capabilities, along with the suspicions evident in Chinese writings, suggest that distrust is the main factor behind Beijing's reluctance to be more cooperative. As noted earlier, the problem is not worries about specific reciprocity but broader concerns about diffuse reciprocity. Both sea lane security and the oil consumers' regime involve open‐ended cooperation with the United States and its allies, and there are real concerns in Beijing about the vulnerabilities that China would incur vis‐à‐vis these states if it were to become more cooperative."
"38","This diagnosis of China's behavior has important implications for improving cooperation with Beijing going forward. The classic solution to free riding involves the use of selective incentives—rewards for cooperation and punishments for noncooperation.94 Depending on the circumstances, either of these measures may be useful to reduce preference‐driven free riding. When free riding is motivated by distrust, however, punitive measures could strengthen suspicions of hostility and thus prove counterproductive. Promises of rewards, in turn, particularly rewards that are substantial enough to motivate a significant change in behavior, may not be believed by distrustful actors. In such cases, efforts to reduce distrust are obviously needed.         "
"39","Reducing distrust between the United States and China will not be easy. In fact, the most realistic short‐term goal might be preventing distrust from becoming even more pronounced. Even so, there are useful steps that could be taken in the realm of energy security. First, the United States should exercise restraint in IEA deliberations. The IEA decision to release oil stocks in 2011 followed four months of debate within the organization, during which time the United States overcame resistance from other members, and the final decision did not reflect strong support from Germany or Italy.95 Such decisions reinforce the perception that the IEA is dominated by Washington rather being than a consensus‐based organization. IEA members should also show interest in China's ideas for reforming international energy governance. China is concerned that the IEA is dominated by the OECD, so greater efforts to engage developing countries on a multilateral basis ought to be made. The aforementioned effort to create an “association” between the IEA and China—one that also includes India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa—is a welcome step in this direction, but it is unlikely to be sufficient. The ultimate goal should be membership for many of these countries as well. In the realm of sea lane security, progress will be complicated by the fact that distrust is particularly pronounced between the U.S. and Chinese militaries, and such intense suspicion will be difficult to dispel. Recent efforts to expand military ties between the two countries, however, are an important opportunity to clarify each side's intentions. Clear communication is particularly important now, not only because China is expanding and modernizing its navy but also because some Chinese analysts worry that the United States will become less interested in the Middle East as the “shale revolution” continues to reduce its dependence on energy imports.         "
"40","Future research should compare China's behavior in energy security with that in other areas. In the environmental realm, China has traditionally resisted binding international commitments to curtail its greenhouse gas emissions, even as it has supported limits for developed countries.96 Beijing's reluctance to cooperate here is also informed by distrust, but there are other considerations at work, including a belief that richer countries bear the most of the responsibility for climate change.97 With respect to arms control, the picture is arguably more complicated. Since the 1980s, China has modernized its nuclear forces even as the United States and Russia have signed agreements downsizing their arsenals—behavior that has been described as free riding.98 On the other hand, China did sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996, even though it was hardly an enthusiastic proponent of the treaty initially. While neither the United States nor China has ratified the CTBT, both countries have maintained a moratorium on nuclear testing since signing the treaty nearly two decades ago, notwithstanding tests by India, Pakistan, and North Korea in the interim. China's behavior in this latter case indicates that it can engage in significant cooperation alongside the United States, even in the military sphere, particularly when there is strong normative pressure on it to do so.99 This suggests that China's aversion to working closely with the United States in energy security should not be seen as an indelible feature of its foreign policy but as a challenge that both countries should strive to surmount.*"
