"1","Is inequality endemic to federalism? Pablo Baramendi's The Political Geography of Inequality challenges the prevailing view, inherited from Lowi and Wildavsky, that political unions necessarily perpetuate or exacerbate inequality across their regions and citizens. In a timely and theoretically compelling contribution, the book seeks to explain why some political unions—such as Spain and Germany—are quite redistributive across regions, while others—such as the United States and the European Union—tolerate greater levels of inequality among their constituent units.         "
"2","Baramendi explains these divergent levels of inequality by distinguishing between two axes of redistribution that characterize political unions. First, patterns of interpersonal redistribution (from rich to poor citizens) are, he argues, driven by economic geography. Where income and risk are heterogeneous across regions, there is a wider gap in preferences for interpersonal redistribution across regions. As a result, regional governments devise their own policies for redistribution among citizens, without extensive recourse to inter‐regional transfers or central government coordination. Alternatively, where income and risk are more homogenous, individual redistribution tends to be centralized under the federal government."
"3","Second, inter‐regional redistribution (from rich to poor regions) is explained by the prevailing level of inter‐regional labor mobility. Where mobility is high and individual redistribution decentralized, wealthier regions have an incentive to redistribute to poorer regions (to stave off migration by the poor from poorer regions to richer ones)."
"4","The system of political representation further mediates these redistributive patterns. In “centrifugal” representation systems, which tend to have malapportioned legislatures and weak national elections and parties, cross‐regional differences in income and risk lead to decentralized systems of redistribution. And in “centripetal” systems, which have less‐severe malapportionment and stronger national party organizations, political competition lessens the impact of cross‐regional differences, and thus facilitates the adoption of centralized systems of redistribution."
"5","A series of five carefully chosen historical case studies form the heart of the book's empirical contribution. Three of these capitalize on two natural experiments, one economic and one political, which illustrate how economic geography and labor mobility have shaped social protection policy. First, Baramendi highlights how the Great Depression produced vastly different redistributive outcomes across North America. Canada, with low levels of regional economic specialization and high labor mobility, developed centralized unemployment insurance; the United States, with high regional economic specialization and lower levels of mobility, left unemployment insurance to the states. And next, he shows how during the reunification of Germany, the West was willing to engage in massive redistribution to the five poorer Eastern länder in order to insure against a massive immigration of dependents. Two other cases are chosen to illustrate the dynamics of divergent representation systems. Centripetal Spain is examined for its remarkable preservation of a unified social security system across its highly unequal regions, while the centrifugal European Union is studied for its reluctance to develop a centralized social protection system for citizens across the union (despite a willingness to redistribute inter‐regionally through structural funds).         "
"6","Each of these chapters makes fascinating reading in its own right, and together they illustrate the far‐reaching explanatory power of Baramendi's theoretical contribution. They also presciently point to the specific dividing lines and pressure points that will characterize fiscal policies in these political unions—and others like them—in coming years as they emerge from the Great Recession. Ultimately, the book reminds us that convergence, so long predicted across economies under globalization, is no more likely under federalism than it has proven to be across other political units."
