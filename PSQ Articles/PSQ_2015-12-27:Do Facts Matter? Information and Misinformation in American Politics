"1","WAS BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA BORN OUTSIDE the United States, so that his presidency and all laws passed under it are unconstitutional? Are two out of every five Americans black? Did the crime rate rise during the first 15 years of the twenty‐first century?"
"2","These are questions of factual information, to which there are correct answers—respectively, no, no, and no. Knowing the right answer to each question is important for making appropriate political choices and policy decisions. And yet in opinion polls, mainstream media, and general public discourse, many sensible and educated Americans have answered yes to each of these queries. They are wrong, and their views are likely to be associated with—and may even contribute to—consequential and problematic political actions or public policies."
"3","Consider another set of questions: Do higher taxes reduce car owners' consumption of gasoline? Do more Americans vote in local elections, where their vote has a much greater impact, than in state or national elections, where their vote may be substantively trivial? Can intensive tutoring improve reading and math skills of inner‐city students? These are slightly more complicated questions of fact because they involve causal links. But they, too, have correct, or at least generally consensual, answers—respectively, yes, no, and yes. Many Americans would concur with these answers and support the implied policy or political goals—and yet do not select the actions that would seem to follow directly from them."
"4","These two sets of questions point to two problems for political discourse and action: the use of incorrect information and the failure to use correct information. These problems stand in opposition to the view of almost every serious thinker who has considered how to make democratic governance stable and effective. Sympathetic observers of democracy have consistently emphasized the need for a knowledgeable citizenry that uses relevant information to inform public choices. Let us allow Thomas Jefferson, in his “Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge,” to speak for the many:            "
"5","Even under the best forms [of government], those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny; and it is believed that the most effectual means of preventing this would be, to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of the people at large, and more especially to give them knowledge of those facts, which history exhibiteth, that . . . they may be enabled to know ambition under all its shapes, and prompt to exert their natural powers to defeat its purposes.1                "
"6","Factual knowledge about politics is a critical component of citizenship, one that is essential if citizens are to discern their real interests and take effective advantage of the civic opportunities afforded them. . . . Knowledge is a keystone to other civic requisites. In the absence of adequate information neither passion nor reason is likely to lead to decisions that reflect the real interests of the public. And democratic principles must be understood to be accepted and acted on in any meaningful way.2                "
"7","This article addresses the various ways in which people acquire—or do not acquire—and use—or fail to use—correct information of the type to which Jefferson and subsequent scholars of democracy refer. Our starting point is Jefferson's ideal: that is, knowing and using correct information to make policy or political choices. However, we pay more attention to two deviations. The first is knowing but ignoring correct information, as when people smoke despite their knowledge of cancer or buy gas‐guzzling SUVs despite their awareness of global warming. The second deviation from Jefferson's ideal is believing and using incorrect information, as when voters oppose the Affordable Care Act because they incorrectly believe that it establishes “death panels.”         "
"8","Understanding these three alternative relationships between facts and politics will, we hope, help residents of the United States pursue Jefferson's ideal and ward off the risks he warns of. Our task is given urgency by the fact that the first deviation, people's unwillingness or inability to use relevant facts in their political choices, may be frustrating—but the second deviation, people's willingness to use mistaken factual claims in their voting and public engagement, is actually dangerous. It may be empirically true that “politics and facts don't belong in the same room,” as Lee Atwater purportedly said, but it is not normatively true."
"9","The disparity between knowledge and behavior creates dissonance for the inactive informed, which makes their stance inherently unstable; they may be as frustrated as the people who are trying to entice them into active use of correct information. But that very frustration or dissonance means that they can sometimes be persuaded into political or policy support that is factually appropriate."
"10","In contrast, for the active misinformed, political activity and knowledge of incorrect facts become mutually reinforcing through the mechanism of group membership. The concordance with like‐minded others between beliefs and actions, even if the beliefs are mistaken, renders attitudes far more stable. Thus the active misinformed are remarkably difficult to edge toward the Jeffersonian ideal of informed activity. Persuasion is usually a waste of time; what may be required is conversion."
"11","This sort of stability among the active misinformed is dangerous to democratic politics. “Danger” is not an overstatement; people have died as a result of the actions described below."
"12","Consider Operation Iraqi Freedom. On 5 February 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke to the United Nations, reporting the American government's evidence that the government of Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Powell had a reputation as deliberate and cautious, and he was known to be skeptical about the virtues of invasion, so his speech was a defining moment both internationally and domestically."
"13","At least three‐fifths of American adults reported reading about or hearing Powell's speech, and a majority found his argument and evidence convincing. A tenth even reported that they had opposed intervention before the speech but changed their minds as a consequence of it.3 More generally, several survey organizations repeatedly asked a question about support for the proposed invasion during the months preceding the sending of troops; three of those series showed an upward spike in support just after Powell's speech. The higher level of support persisted through the day of the invasion and several weeks thereafter, at which point the focus of survey questions shifted.4 By mid‐March 2003, at least two‐thirds of Americans, and more in many polls, enthusiastically endorsed or unambiguously accepted the U.S.‐led invasion of Iraq.         "
"14","Powell's assertions to the United Nations about Iraq's weapons were in crowded and bipartisan company. The main spokesperson, of course, was President George W. Bush. In his 29 January 2002 State of the Union speech, Bush described Iraq as one‐third of an “axis of evil” and reported that “the Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger.” On 28 January 2003, President Bush again pressed the case for war against Iraq and its frightful weapons:            "
"15","Saddam Hussein . . . agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next twelve years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons: not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. . . . The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. . . . Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans, this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes."
"16","President Bush and his secretary of state were preceded and followed by many others of varied political persuasions, as the following sample of public officials' comments suggests:            "
"17","Mainstream media also reported the views and words of Bush administration officials much more than those of either Democrats or Republicans outside the administration.7          "
"18","Ordinary Americans, of course, had no direct evidence about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. But they appear to have been listening carefully to their leaders, as Figure 1 shows with crystal clarity.         "
"19","Percentage Agreeing that Iraq Has or Had Weapons of Mass Destruction, 2002–2011"
"20","Source: iPoll.                     "
"21","Surveys seldom show agreement to any query in the 80 percent to 95 percent range over a long period of time and with different sampling procedures, question wording, or response categories. Yet that is the proportion of respondents who mistakenly “knew” or thought it highly likely that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction before and during the invasion."
"22","It is no surprise in this context that half or more of Americans endorsed the invasion and that many supported the war over the next few years. What is more surprising is how many continued to believe that the United States was saving the world from biological, chemical, or nuclear attack months and even years after no weapons were found. Some Americans were so persuaded that Iraq possessed such weapons that in April 2003, 36 percent agreed that the United States had “been successful in . . . finding evidence of” them.8 A quarter believed that the weapons had been found through August 2003 and a fifth through the fall of 2003; since 2004, the proportion of believers has remained between 15 percent and 40 percent.9          "
"23","Not only did large segments of the American population hold mistaken views about Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction, but also—as is necessary for them to be in the category of the active misinformed—these beliefs were strongly associated with their political and policy views. Figure 2 shows the link between supporting the Iraq war and believing that Iraq possessed such weapons. We randomly selected four surveys from the large set shown in Figure 1: one before Colin Powell's speech, one after Powell's speech but before the invasion, and two after coalition forces invaded Iraq. For each survey, we compared support for the war among those who incorrectly believed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction with those who were not misinformed in this way. Our awkwardly worded “not misinformed” category includes both respondents who thought that Iraq did not have such weapons and respondents who said “don't know” to queries on the topic.         "
"24","Percentage Supporting the Iraq War, Misinformed versus Not Misinformed, 2002–2003"
"25","Sources: Authors' analysis of CBS/New York Times, 2 September 2002; Gallup/CNN/USA Today, 7 February 2003, 22 April 2003; CBS News, 12 June 2003.                     "
"26","As Figure 2 shows, both long before, shortly before, and after the invasion, those who mistakenly thought that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction were at least twice as likely as their correctly informed counterparts to endorse the Iraq war.         "
"27","Agreement that Iraq possessed such weapons was associated with political partisanship even long after the invasion; Republicans were more likely to believe it initially and more likely to maintain the belief. One study found that, after the Bush administration stated in the fall of 2004 that it was unlikely ever to find the weapons it sought, “Democrats concluded that the WMDs had not existed,” and Republicans believed that “Iraq moved the WMDs.”10 In March 2006, 18 percent of a national adult sample agreed that the United States had found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. There were no substantively or statistically significant differences by age, education, gender, income, or region among those who agreed—but Republicans were almost five times more likely than Democrats (27 percent to 6 percent) to report that the weapons had been found.11          "
"28","However, crucial for our analysis, the connection between beliefs and policy preferences was not simply a matter of partisan identification. Running the same cross‐tabulations as in Figure 2 for only Democrats showed that misinformed Democrats—although 10 percentage points less likely to endorse the war than the misinformed public as a whole—were still far more likely to support the war than were Democrats with a more accurate view of the situation. Misinformed Democrats held views more like those of correctly or incorrectly informed Republicans than like those of correctly informed Democrats.         "
"29","Perhaps the United States would have gone to war in Iraq even if Americans had not strongly supported the invasion. Or perhaps Americans would have supported the invasion even if they had not believed (because they were consistently told) that Saddam Hussein possessed and planned to use vastly harmful weapons. After all, leaders hinted at at least one other apparently good reason to invade Iraq—that “Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the September 11th terrorist attacks,” to quote one widely used survey item. Perhaps, that is, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn were the right policy choices, for the United States or for Iraq. We cannot replay history."
"30","But we do note two incontrovertible and deeply destructive outcomes.First, many Americans became (even more) alienated from their elected officials. As early as May 2003, half of the respondents to a National Public Radio poll agreed either that “the war in Iraq was a success but was not worth the cost in U.S. lives and dollars” or that “the war in Iraq was not a success.”12 By July 2003, two‐fifths of respondents in a Gallup poll agreed that “the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public about whether Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.”13 In November of the same year, more than half thought that President Bush was either lying or “hiding important elements of what he knew.”14 By 2011, half or more Americans agreed that the outcome was a “stalemate” or “defeat,” that the war was not “morally justified,” that the war's cost was harming the U.S. economy, that the war had a “negative effect on life in the United States,” or that the invasion and occupation would not prevent civil war and violence in Iraq or terrorism at home.15 ABC asked respondents to weigh “the costs to the United States versus the benefits” six times between January 2009 and November 2011; in five of the six cases, three‐fifths or more said “not worth it,” and a majority concurred in the sixth case.16          "
"31","Second, and even more important, 4,497 Americans died in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn between March 2003 and January 2012, and an additional 32,246 were wounded, according to the Department of Defense.17 Estimates of non‐American deaths range from 170,000 to more than a million.18 The latter figure is almost certainly too high, but regardless of the actual number, there were a lot of casualties.         "
"32","Opposition, disillusionment, and deaths do not themselves mean that the war was a disastrous mistake. But if, as our analyses suggest, the invasion was made more likely by the American public's support, which was itself partly attributable to misinformation intentionally or inadvertently purveyed by political leaders, one must think hard about the role of facts in politics. Even if the causal arrow goes in both directions or is reversed—that is, even if Americans engaged in “inferred justification”19—the entanglements among wrong beliefs, public support for war, politicians' manipulation of the facts, and hundreds of thousands of deaths raise deep concerns about policymaking in a democratic polity.         "
"33","Few Americans had independent information about whether Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction in the early 2000s; they took their cues from an almost uniform set of elite messages.20 We have just argued that such an acceptance and use of misinformation is dangerous to a democratic polity and to individuals in (and outside of) it. Another case, however, shows that using misinformation that derives from the failure to accept an almost uniform set of elite messages also endangers people in a democratic polity.21 These two cases differ on whether mainstream elites are responsible for the public's acquisition and use of misinformation; they are united in showing that acting in accord with misinformation can get people killed.         "
"34","Despite scientists' consensus that there is no connection between autism and vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), a large and growing number of communities in the United States have immunization rates well below 95 percent—roughly speaking, the level of herd immunity. “An overwhelming percentage of those are left‐leaning, well‐educated enclaves. . . . The consequences of these trends are as tragic as they are predictable.”22 In 2009, California saw a resurgence of pertussis greater than any since 1947, before a vaccine came into wide use. Ten children died from the infection, all but one of them infants. France had almost eliminated measles in 2007, but more than 20,000 people had the disease between 2008 and 2011. The head of the World Health Organization's office on vaccine‐preventable diseases and immunization commented, “This is a lot of cases. . . . There's been a buildup of children who have not been immunized over the years.”23 In 2015, “Vaccine Refusal Helped Fuel Disneyland Measles Outbreak” according to a study headlined in the Los Angeles Times.24 Those researchers calculate that “MMR vaccination rates among the exposed population in which secondary cases have occurred might be as low as 50% and likely no higher than 86%.”25          "
"35","Even the sober New England Journal of Medicine has inveighed against the “damage to individual and community well‐being from outbreaks of previously controlled diseases, withdrawal of vaccine manufacturers from the market, compromising of national security (in the case of anthrax and smallpox vaccines), and lost productivity.”26 Referring to the 1998 article by Andrew Wakefield that first drew public attention to the purported harmful effects of vaccines, one pediatrician said, “That paper killed four children.”27 Epidemiologists predict that more people will become seriously ill or die from infectious diseases in the foreseeable future, as it takes some time for such diseases to take hold and spread.         "
"36","Active resistance to vaccination in the United States is low overall but growing in some states and high in some localities. Despite the 95 percent threshold for herd immunity, among the 15 vaccines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks, no more than 53 percent (for hepatitis A) or 69 percent (for rotavirus) of young American children had received the recommended doses as of 2012.28 Either religious or philosophical exemptions enabled 5 percent of Oregon's public school kindergartners and 10.3 percent of its private school kindergartners to avoid vaccinations; comparable figures for Vermont are 5.1 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively. These rates do not include medical exemptions, which add a few more percentage points to the set of unvaccinated children.29 Nor do they account for homeschooled children, who are not subject to school regulations. In California, some private schools have vaccination compliance rates of less than 20 percent. Even among public schools in the state, vaccination rates can be distressingly low; fewer than three‐fifths of the kindergartners in one of Malibu's three elementary schools were up to date on their vaccinations in 2013.30 In New York City, “vaccination rates at some . . . private schools are worse than those of developing countries.”31          "
"37","Americans are relatively tolerant of others' refusal to vaccinate their children, and acceptance may be growing. In 2001 and again in 2009, 6 percent of a national sample agreed that vaccines are “dangerous” or “not safe,” and another few percent did not know. Since then, between one‐fifth and two‐fifths have responded to a plethora of poll questions in ways that imply sympathy for or agreement with nonvaccinators, or at least caution about vaccination—and many other respondents do not venture an opinion.32 In 2012, 3 in 10 flatly agreed that autism is “linked to vaccines,” and in 2014, only 38 percent were willing to say that the purported link is “definitely not true.”33          "
"38","As is no surprise, parents with doubts about vaccine safety are responsible for a disproportionate share of unvaccinated children. In 2010, 13 percent of parents of young children reported following an “alternative vaccination schedule” from that recommended by pediatricians. Most alternative‐schedule parents refused only certain vaccines, but more than three‐quarters rejected H1N1 or seasonal influenza vaccines altogether, and more than 4 in 10 rejected rotavirus or varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. Others delayed the vaccination until the child was older than recommended or prolonged intervals between doses. Two percent of the sample refused all vaccines, including polio and hepatitis. “The vast majority of parents identified as alternative vaccinators had anti‐vaccination attitudes (80%–95%, depending on the attitude statement).”34 Only a small share of alternative‐schedule parents were concerned that unvaccinated children would spread infections to other people.         "
"39","Case studies of school districts and some (although not all) systematic evidence suggest that parents who resist vaccination are disproportionately well off and often politically liberal. In a 2009 Pew survey on parental choice, respondents with at least some college education and relatively high incomes were more likely to endorse choice than those with a high school education or less or the poor. Whites endorsed choice more than blacks or Hispanics. A study of all 39,000 newborns in Colorado in 2008 found that mothers with “higher education, private insurance, and white race” were less likely to have their newborns vaccinated against hepatitis B than Hispanic mothers, those with little education, and those without private insurance, that is poorer mothers.35 Similarly, in a 2010 survey published in Pediatrics, nonblack parents were significantly more likely to follow an alternative schedule (no other parental characteristics attained statistical significance in the multivariate model), and parents with higher incomes were more likely to hold antivaccination beliefs.36 CDC data show that private schools have a much higher rate of exemption than public schools in almost all states that permit philosophical or religious exemptions from childhood vaccines.         "
"40","The link between political partisanship or ideology and opposition to childhood vaccination is complex. Opposition stems largely from mistrust of the federal government and large corporations—a position occupied by both libertarians and some liberals. The school districts with the highest levels of nonvaccination—Malibu, California; Boulder, Colorado; and Ashland, Oregon—tend to be communities with many residents who see themselves as progressives. But in the two 2009 surveys with large enough samples to permit cross‐tabulations, one shows Republicans (but not conservatives) and the other shows conservatives (but not Republicans) to be slightly more opposed to vaccination than their opposites. Members of Congress who have raised public doubts about vaccination have been Republicans."
"41","In short, people who hold and act on misinformation about childhood vaccination may be liberal, conservative, or libertarian, but they are united in their rejection of medical expertise on this topic and in their apparent indifference to the links between acting on misinformation and children's deaths."
"42","The social status of the active misinformed with regard to vaccination is not our central concern; the fact that many people occupy that category with dangerous consequences is what matters here. But the vaccination case reminds us that education, affluence, social status, and liberal politics are not necessarily associated with holding and using correct rather than incorrect information. Some of the most sophisticated people in the most progressive communities in the wealthiest Western societies are using what scientists have shown to be misinformation to make decisions that endanger the health and lives of their own and others' children."
"43","This case also reminds us that the meaning of a group can be very flexible. Most of the time, explaining which category a person is in involves a group that is large, stable, and visible—a political party, a race or ethnicity, an economic stratum. In the case of antivaccinators, the group is either amorphous and not mutually recognized (people who have no political affinity except for their mistrust of the government and large corporations) or small and almost serendipitous (a school district in which a critical mass of like‐minded people happen to reside and talk with one another)."
"44","Scholars are increasingly aware of how important social networks can be; even friends of friends are statistically associated with whether one is obese, a smoker, or fearful of one's neighbors.37 Apparently, a few influential parents with the right connections can also constitute a publicly consequential group.         "
"45","Given that the active misinformed can be impervious to persuasion—and, at a minimum, have strong social supports and therefore no strong incentive to change their views—and that their behavior can be destructive to a democratic polity and its residents, we might expect public officials to combat the use of misinformation vigorously. Some do. But many do not, which raises a further obstacle to the attainment of the Jeffersonian ideal of informed activity. We turn now to the question of why."
"46","Absent strenuous effort, the pulls of inertia, group loyalties, or perceptual filters function to keep people in the state of active use of misinformation. It is easier not to act than to take action; it is easier to maintain one's beliefs than to question and then change them; it is safer to encourage or tolerate use of misinformation than to challenge falsehoods among one's associates. Conversely, the unease generated by cognitive, emotional, or behavioral inconsistency functions to urge people out of the state of inactivity when they hold correct information. There is an imbalance, in short, between the likelihood of people's staying informed but inactive, or staying misinformed and active, and the likelihood of their moving out of either position toward active use of correct information. From the politician's vantage point, people seeking to promote Jefferson's ideal of actively using correct information in the political arena are usually no match for those promoting the active use of misinformation. We turn now to explaining why, by analyzing the deep asymmetries embedded in the dynamics of politicians' acts of shaping and using political information. The cases already discussed reveal some of the crucial dynamics; others are best illustrated through new cases."
"47","We focus on three crucial asymmetries that emerge as one views the role of facts in politics from the vantage point of political actors. First, inertia is more likely than change—for people in any category. Second, conditional on the general inclination toward inertia, actors who focus on the inactive informed have the goal of moving people out of that category (into the active informed), whereas actors who focus on the active misinformed have the easier task of encouraging people to remain as they are. Thus, inertia works against the first set of actors and on behalf of the second set. Third, and relatedly, politicians' incentives to keep people misinformed but active tend to be much more powerful than (other) politicians' incentives to try to move people away from using falsehoods into using facts. Cumulatively, these asymmetries underline the importance of, and help explain, our central concern: from the perspective of Jefferson's ideal democracy in which knowledgeable citizens take appropriate action, those who know but do not act can be exasperating, but those who act on wrong knowledge are dangerous."
"48","This point is not very controversial, although its political implications have perhaps been underdeveloped. Up to two‐fifths of Americans, albeit with “extreme partisan differences,”38 continued to believe for years after the 2003 invasion that Iraq harbored weapons of mass destruction, despite the fact that none were found and that almost all political actors stopped claiming that they would be found any day now. Two‐fifths of Americans continue to believe that the Affordable Care Act includes “death panels” despite their nonappearance in the five years since the act was implemented. The polls have shown little change since July 2010 in the proportion of respondents who are mistaken on this issue.39             "
"49","Inertia affects activity as well as beliefs: although many Americans accept scientists' concurrence on the certainty and momentum of human‐induced global warming, their support for government action beyond encouraging companies to save energy and individuals to recycle newspapers remains stably low to moderate.40             "
"50","“The industrial East is lost anyway, sure to support Kennedy. So is the northern Negro vote, overwhelmingly Democratic. Therefore, in [Barry] Goldwater's words, the Republicans should . . . ‘go hunting where the ducks are.’ The ducks are in the electoral votes of the West, the Middle West and the South.”41 Goldwater was quoting an old adage, used with equal aptness by contemporary scholars seeking once again to explain candidates' micro‐targeting: “Turn on the local news during campaign season, and you're likely to see a political ad. Watch MTV for an hour, and you probably won't see any ads at all. Parties and candidates hunt where the ducks are, airing messages that will be seen by potential voters. . . . The new media environment presents parties with new opportunities to communicate with their core, committed supporters. This has facilitated fundraising, the recruitment of volunteers, and mobilization.”42             "
"51","In other words, parties in campaign mode (are there any other modes?) not only seek to induce supporters who are already informed and active to vote and contribute time or money but also try strenuously to mobilize copartisans who are informed but inactive. Those are the ducks—they already endorse the party's candidate but need to be hunted down so that they will act on their knowledge by contributing or voting. Hunting where the ducks are is the job of campaign activists, from precinct captains carrying turkeys and buckets of coal to media whiz kids with Facebook pages and Twitter feeds."
"52","As all of that activity suggests, adding action to partisanship is not easy, as inertia is more likely than change. Seldom do more than three‐fifths of the voting‐age population turn out even in presidential campaigns, and many fewer contribute time or money. Nevertheless, parties commit large and perhaps increasing amounts of resources and effort to identifying and mobilizing passive supporters, even at the expense of general broad‐gauged advertising of candidates or positions."
"53","Some analysts attribute Barack Obama's 2012 win partly to his campaign's extensive and sophisticated operation to hunt where the ducks are. Discussing the campaign's 125 million voter contacts, Obama's national field director Jeremy Bird assured reporters that “many [field campaigns] have historically favored quantity over quality. We do not. . . . They are personal outreach conversations. . . . In each conversation we have with the voter, our goal is to make a difference.”43 Critical for our (and their) purposes, “persuasion wasn't part of the [volunteer's] assignment; the people on the list have already been identified as potential Obama voters. The point was to make sure they turned out”44—that is, that they moved from inactive to active use of factual information. Obama's opponents agree on this point, if on no other: “In retrospect, the Romney team is in awe and full of praise of the Obama operation. ‘They spent four years working block by block, person by person to build their coalition,’ says a top aide. . . . ‘We did everything we set out to do,’ says a top strategist about the Ohio effort [for Romney]. ‘We just didn't expect the African‐American vote to be so high.'”45             "
"54","Some researchers are skeptical about the impact of the Obama ground game. Many factors contributed to Obama's election, and even Donald Green and Alan Gerber, the most eminent researchers who promote strategies for getting out the vote, calculate that “as a rule of thumb, one additional vote is produced for every fourteen people who are successfully contacted by canvassers”—confirmation of the first asymmetry, that inertia is more likely than change.46 The most extensive analysis of the 2012 presidential campaign found that Obama's “field operation . . . likely did not decide the election.”47 However, other scholars found the targeted ground game to be highly effective—by one calculation, it was enough to turn three uncertain states into Democratic victories in 2008.48 Regardless of its precise impact in a given election, evidence is accumulating that persuasion directed at people whose views are in tension with their actions can motivate some to reduce that dissonance by moving from inactivity to the active use of valid information, at least for a while. The dozens of reports of the surgeons general since the early 1960s (understood, broadly, as a sustained antismoking campaign) have, after all, been associated with a considerable reduction in Americans' cigarette consumption.            "
"55","What about the other side of this asymmetry—not working to persuade the inactive informed to act, but rather working to persuade the active misinformed to attain and use correct factual knowledge? Green and Gerber pay little attention to the possibility of persuading active adherents of one party to vote for the candidate of another, and usually neither do party operatives. Large‐scale party switching is rare enough that its exemplars are given labels—Reagan Democrats, Labour Thatcherites, targets of a wedge strategy49—and searching for them is hunting where the ducks seldom roost. To the contrary: since the active misinformed unite their purported knowledge and their political actions, they have little incentive to abandon old beliefs, accept new ones, abandon old allegiances, find a new group, and change their behavior. So party activists largely ignore the active misinformed who support their opponents and instead concentrate on keeping their own supporters, regardless of whether they are misinformed, politically active.            "
"56","A dramatic case of politicians yielding to the temptation of encouraging the active misinformed to remain in that condition is that of (what their opponents call) birthers—people who believe that Barack Obama was born outside U.S. borders and therefore is not constitutionally permitted to be its president. A lot is at stake here; as one wistful columnist put it, “If (and it is a very big if) it could be proved that Obama was born outside the United States, then the legitimacy of any legislation he has signed into law would be instantly questionable. So long, Obamacare?”50 It is also a clean case; where Obama was born is not genuinely in dispute or subject to alternative interpretations.            "
"57","Although Hillary Clinton's chief strategist inadvertently started the birther snowball rolling,51 Republican elites boosted, or at least permitted, its growth into an avalanche. Thirteen Republican members of Congress cosponsored a bill in 2009 requiring presidential candidates to “include within the [campaign] committee's statement of organization a copy of the candidate's birth certificate” along with appropriate documentation. In 2011, to choose only one year, legislators in 17 states filed bills requiring presidential candidates to prove their constitutional citizenship before being allowed onto a state ballot.            "
"58","Most nationally prominent Republicans have been a bit more coy. House Speaker John Boehner (R‐OH) observed that “the state of Hawaii has said that President Obama was born there. That's good enough for me.” But when asked his response to members of Congress sponsoring the birth certificate bill, he demurred, “It's not up to me to tell them what to think” (6 January 2011). Then‐Representative Michele Bachmann (R‐MN) declared that “it's not for me to state [whether the president is a native‐born citizen or a Christian]. That's for the president to state. . . . I think we should take the president at his word” (17 March 2011). Asked about Obama's birth certificate, former Arkansas governor and hopeful presidential candidate Mike Huckabee responded, “I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough” (1 March 2011); would‐be presidential candidate Herman Cain made a similar comment (31 March 2011)."
"59","The list continues: Sarah Palin observed, when asked about aspiring presidential candidate Donald Trump's focus on the issue of Obama's birth, “You know, more power to him. He's not just throwing stones from the sidelines. . . . He's digging in there. He's paying for researchers to know why President Obama would have spent $2 million to not show his birth certificate.” She agreed that Obama was in fact born in Hawaii but, “obviously, if there's something there that the president doesn't want people to see on that birth certificate. Then he seems to go to great lengths to make sure it isn't shown, and that's kind of perplexing for a lot of people” (10 April 2011). A spokesperson for Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal reported that a bill requiring confirmation of a candidate's birthplace “is not part of our package, but if the legislature passes it we'll sign it” (19 April 2011)."
"60","As John Zaller's model of followership would predict, many, though not all, Americans followed this lead, agreeing mistakenly that Obama was born somewhere in Africa, or perhaps Asia, but at least not in the United States. How many actually believed it, any more than elites did, remains an open question, but Figure 3 shows the proportions willing to declare themselves birthers or to state that the question remained unresolved. The totals and partisan proportions vary greatly over time, depending on methodological differences among survey houses in sampling rules, question wording and response categories, our classification choices for disparate response categories, and public discourse just before the poll was taken. These views, in other words, are not firmly fixed for many Americans. Nonetheless, although our methodological choices were cautious, the crucial point comes through clearly: from mid‐2009 through the spring of 2011, a substantial proportion of Republicans (and conservatives, not shown) agreed that Obama was born outside the United States or were uncertain or unwilling to venture an opinion.

"63","Not merely partisanship, but also its intensity, is associated with birtherism. In 2012, 52 percent of self‐defined strong Republicans, but only (!) 32 percent of weak Republicans, agreed that Obama probably or certainly was born outside the United States; in comparison, 8 percent of strong Democrats and 13 percent of weak Democrats concurred.52 Self‐defined supporters of the Tea Party were often even more willing than Republicans or conservatives to agree that Obama is not a constitutionally legitimate president. In the January 2010 Field Poll of California's registered voters, for example, 22 percent of Tea Party supporters, compared with 18 percent of conservatives, agreed that Obama was born outside the United States. In an ABC/Washington Post poll a few months later, a quarter of Tea Party supporters, compared with just under a fifth of Republicans, concurred. In another 2010 national survey, 46 percent of Tea Party supporters, compared with 37 percent of other Republicans, agreed that Obama was not native born.53 Identification with the Tea Party is especially important for our purposes because it signals the second of the two criteria for the active misinformed: holding political or policy views, or voting, in accord with one's misinformation.            "
"64","The direction of causality among belief, emotion, and action is unclear here, as is the degree to which birtherism is a genuine expression of false belief rather than exploitation of any chance to express hostility to the president. On the one hand, according to the former head of polling at ABC News, “People in fact may voice an attitude not as an affirmed belief—a statement of perceived factual reality—but rather as . . . ‘expressed belief’—. . . to throw verbal stones at that which they so thoroughly dislike.”54 On the other hand, Adam Berinsky's careful analysis of the “verbal stones” hypothesis shows that agreement with partisan‐inflected misinformation is usually a genuine belief.55 We have little at stake with regard to the causal question; what matters politically is that many Americans are wrong about this state of affairs, link it to their partisan identity, are emotionally invested in their position, and have been encouraged to maintain this stance by partisan elites.            "
"65","President Obama initially found birtherism amusing; at the 2011 Gridiron Club Dinner, he asked Bruce Springsteen to play “Born in the U.S.A.” But in the face of apparently growing skepticism about his American birth, in April 2011, the president requested the State of Hawaii to release his “long form” birth certificate. Facts do matter: as Figure 3 shows, birtherism plunged in the days immediately after the document was made public. Even among conservative Republicans, the proportion agreeing that Obama was born outside the United States was cut in half from a year earlier. Donald Trump, who had been running for the Republican presidential nomination largely on the birther issue—“Barack Hussein Obama has made mincemeat out of our great and cherished Constitution!” (7 April 2011)—withdrew from the race shortly thereafter. Asked about the future of this story, Representative Bachmann, no ally of Obama, told CNN, “I guess it's over” (20 April 2011). Speaker Boehner's spokesperson declared it “a settled issue” (27 April 2011). Most Republicans seemed ready to follow Karl Rove's advice from a few months earlier: “Stop falling into the trap of the White House and focus on the real issues” (17 February 2011).            "
"66","But facts may not matter for everyone, or matter for long, especially when politicians cannot resist the temptation to give misinformation a friendly boost. Although 14 percent of respondents in one postrelease survey admitted, “I had my doubts, but now I am satisfied that the President was born in America,” 18 percent “still [had] doubts,” and another 10 percent remained “sure that the birth certificate . . . is a forgery.”56 The latter groups were presumably gratified by comments of some of Obama's opponents, even long after the April 2011 release of the birth certificate:               "
"67","Except for Trump's sinister hint, at one level these comments are simply teasing, examples of politicians breaking the tedium of campaigning with a joke at one another's expense, like Obama's reference to Romney's dog Seamus.57 Furthermore, birtherism's persistence may be in part merely an instance of citizens' more general ignorance; a tenth of Americans are not sure whether Hawaii is a state in the United States.58 But sophisticated, ambitious politicians would not keep on raising the issue of Obama's citizenship if there were not a more serious edge to it, and the many comments would not matter if repetition had no independent impact. But it does; demagogues have known for centuries, and systematic research has shown, that the more people hear an assertion of fact, the more inclined they are to accept it as true.            "
"68","Republican politicians may not be actually trying to persuade Americans that Obama is an unconstitutional president. They may instead be keeping the issue of his American‐ness salient, as Obama himself does in the opposite direction with the ever‐present U.S. flag lapel pin. If, by framing him as a literal outsider in supposed jokes, Republican leaders can add anxiety about whether Obama is a metaphorical outsider to their other disagreements with him, their followers have that much more motivation to go to the polls to vote against the president and his party. Salience, or what one reader of an earlier version of this argument called available information as distinguished from true information, matters a great deal in politics."
"69","But birtherism goes a step beyond usual get‐out‐the‐vote tactics. It does not rise to the level of war casualties and infants dying of pertussis or measles. Nevertheless, we see politicians' continual return to the issue as harmful for democratic governance rather than merely a subject for amusement or bemusement. There are three reasons for the slightly melodramatic language of danger in this case."
"70","Obama and Rove both pointed out the first reason: birtherism wastes scarce resources of energy for and attention to politics. The president noted that top network anchors attended the press conference at which he announced the release of his birth certificate only because of rumors about developments on the issue; they would not interrupt scheduled programming for a speech on national security, the proposed federal budget, or his social welfare goals. “During that entire week the dominant news story wasn't about these huge, monumental choices that we're going to have to make as a nation. It was about my birth certificate.” Obama then moved beyond presidential pique into genuine disquiet: “I just want to make a larger point here. We've got some enormous challenges out there. . . . We're not going to be able to do it [“solve these problems”] if we spend time vilifying each other . . ., if we just make stuff up and pretend that facts are not facts . . ., if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers. . . . We do not have time for this kind of silliness. We've got better stuff to do. . . . We have got big problems to solve” (27 April 2011)."
"71","Some in the media agreed. In a classic case of postmodern self‐referencing, the New York Times capped its report on Obama's comments about the media's excessive attention to the issue of his birth with yet another report headlined, “In Trying to Debunk a Theory, the News Media Extended Its Life.” The Times reporter noted with some exasperation that “in waves of media coverage . . . reporters tried to debunk those theories. . . . There was distaste evident in the voices of television anchors,” and many talk show hosts found the issue “ludicrous.” Nevertheless, they kept talking about it—the liberal MSNBC more than the neutral CNN or the conservative Fox News—and “the very fact of the debate caused the issue to fester in more minds.”59 Given most individuals' limited taste for politics, attention to birtherism arguably detracted from attention to more consequential concerns.            "
"72","Birtherism is also harmful, as well as irresistible to some politicians, because it stokes citizens' ineffective frustration with contemporary American politics. Conservative commentator Christopher Caldwell quoted a Tea Party member: “The birther issue definitely isn't part of our core values, but what Donald Trump is doing is questioning things and saying, ‘Why do we have to just accept everything?’” and then observed, “To hold the birther view is to affiliate oneself with an attitude, not a truth claim. . . . Your average Trump supporter may think that the proper attitude to have toward America's politicians is contempt.” Caldwell himself opposes this stance: if people use birther claims to express “a laudable cynicism toward those in power, . . . then a terrible trap has been laid: the more absurd the untruth, the more politically trustworthy the one who peddles it.”60             "
"73","Setting aside any causal claim based on cross‐sectional data, the evidence is clear that people who doubt Obama's birth in the United States are also especially mistrustful of the federal government. In the 2012 American National Election Study (ANES), 58 percent of those who accepted Obama's native‐born status were highly mistrustful of the federal government—but a full 73 percent of those who rejected his native‐born status also rejected the government. The pattern persists, somewhat more weakly, with controls for party identification. Even more dramatic, three‐quarters of birthers and three‐fifths of those who thought Obama was “probably” born in the United States agreed that the federal government's power posed a threat to the rights and freedoms of American citizens, compared with only (!) 37 percent of those who were certain of Obama's native‐born status. Even with controls for party identification, Republican birthers are significantly more likely than Republican nonbirthers to say that the federal government threatens its own citizens."
"74","Finally, as an extension of the earlier point about get‐out‐the‐vote mobilization, birtherism may tempt politicians as a respectable vehicle for reinforcing some individuals' view that Obama's race or foreign ancestry pushes him out of the legitimate American mainstream. This too is dangerous for a democratic polity. As Michael Tomasky limns this view,               "
"75","The president is . . . an Other with a capital O, who, to their way of thinking, could not possibly have been legitimately elected the president of any United States they know. . . . A conspiracy of immense proportions, concocted all the way back in 1961, had to be the only explanation for how this black man got to the White House. And if you think race isn't what this is about at its core, ask yourself if there would even be a birther conspiracy if Barack Obama were white and named Bart Oberstar. If you think there would be, you are delusional.61                   "
"76","Survey data support Tomasky's argument. In the 2010 Evaluations of Government and Society Survey (part of the ANES), even with controls for party identification and ideology, racial resentment was positively related to whites' doubts about Obama's American birth.62 Another survey found not only an association between resentment of blacks and birtherism but also that, even with controls for partisanship, ideology, and birtherism, “individuals with the most favorable impression of Muslims were 45 percentage points more likely to say Obama was American‐born than were those with very unfavorable feelings about Muslims.”63 In the 2012 ANES, birthers were much more likely than nonbirthers to agree that blacks and Hispanics—but not whites—have too much influence in American politics. The pattern remains highly significant even when one controls for partisan identification, as Figure 4 shows.            "

"78","Source: ANES 2012.                        "
"79","As Michael Tesler and David Sears's analysis suggests, birtherism and the related assertion that Obama is a Muslim may reflect, and provide a legitimate way to express, hostility to some foreigners as well as to African Americans. Representative Bachmann assured her listeners that “most Americans are wild about America and they are very concerned to have a president who doesn't share those values” (or, more simply, Obama may have “anti‐American views” [17 October 2008], which she later called a misstatement). Governor Huckabee not only found the purported ambiguity about the birth certificate “troubling” but also observed, with several mistaken claims rolled into one, “One thing I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits for example, [is] very different than the average American. . . . His perspective as growing up in Kenya with a Kenyan father and grandfather, their view of the Mau Mau Revolution in Kenya is very different than ours because he probably grew up hearing that the British are a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather” (1 March 2011)."
"80","In short, politicians flirt with birtherism and thereby encourage people to maintain belief in and act on false statements of fact for several reasons—to be witty, to distract voters from more difficult issues, to reinforce hatred of government, and to promote hostility to Obama and all that he personifies. Albeit similar on the surface, Romney's joke about Obama's birthplace is not really comparable to Obama's joke about Romney's dog."
"81","How much can we generalize from the vaguely bizarre birtherism trope? Even given strong ideological commitments, over the long term, most successful politicians are pragmatists. To win an election, persuade fellow legislators to vote for a cherished bill, or induce busy colleagues to invest scarce resources in their agenda rather than some other, they can seldom afford a lot of illusions or chase after many unwinnable goals. Candidates cannot instruct voters how to act; they must meet them where they are and then exhort or nudge them toward somewhere else."
"82","Looking at democratic decision making from the opposite vantage point, ordinary people live in social networks, and their attitudes typically align with those of people with whom they identify or regularly associate. Most individuals devote only slight attention to politics and policy choices, and most prefer to hear opinions or pronouncements with which they agree rather than those that seem wrong or challenging.64 Most people want to view themselves as rational and consistent, as well as honorable and sensible; as Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels once titled an essay, “It Feels Like We're Thinking.”65             "
"83","In combination, both fairly obvious points have distinct implications for the acquisition and use of facts in politics. As we have noted, the status of being inactive informed is unstable, which makes one susceptible to a hint about being irrational or having weakness of will. Others in one's social network are likely to feel a similar unease or to be acting already on their knowledge, so connections with others can reinforce a concern about inaction. Looking at this point from the perspective of a pragmatic political actor, one would expect him or her to invest resources in trying to induce people to resolve this dissonance."
"84","As we have also pointed out, the status of being active misinformed, in contrast, can be highly stable, which makes it hard to persuade a person that he or she is not being rational or sensible. Others in one's social network are likely to be wrong about the same things and to be taking the same actions, so connections with fellow group members can reinforce a sense of rationality and coherence. A pragmatic political actor realizes that the investment of resources goes much further in efforts to work around, accommodate, or even encourage the active misinformed than in efforts to move people out of that category. There is, in short, a deep asymmetry between political actors who seek support from the inactive informed and those who seek support from the active misinformed. The former promote the Jeffersonian ideal of informed activity; the latter undermine it."
"85","Politicians do try occasionally to move the active misinformed. Obama held a (rare) press conference to announce the release of his birth certificate; a few members of Congress insisted that the Affordable Care Act does not include death panels; governors and members of Congress have urged parents to have their children vaccinated. Public officials certainly make considerable efforts to correct harmful misinformation about themselves or their policy positions. To understand more fully when and why political actors contest or accommodate individuals who are active but misinformed, we turn to the third asymmetry—the fact that politicians' incentives to keep people acting on misinformation are almost always greater than (other) politicians' incentives to move those individuals into the Jeffersonian ideal or even into inactivity."
"86","Assume for the sake of argument that political elites know that the active misinformed are indeed mistaken and are acting on their misapprehensions politically—thus probably working against their own true interests or against the interests of the polity as a whole. These elites have three basic choices: to encourage people to remain misinformed, to ignore the dangers of actively using misinformation and work with people wherever they are, and to try to move people into the ranks of the active informed. The first is easiest and potentially advantageous, the second is a reasonable choice for a pragmatist, and the third is hard but best for democratic governance."
"87","Let us look first at the temptations to encourage people to stay active and misinformed. What might appear to an observer as a challenge to democratic governance may be an opportunity for some actors to deploy public opinion in pursuit of a cherished goal. Consider again the issue of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction in 2003. Neither President Bush nor many other leaders sought to correct misperceptions about the presence of such weapons even months after the coalition forces found none. After all, the belief reinforced support for the Iraqi invasion, which was, in this view, what mattered most. This need not have been (only) a cynical calculation; Saddam Hussein was a terrible person and bad ruler, and arguably Iraqis as well as Americans were better off with his defeat and the subsequent Coalition control of Iraq."
"88","Taking political or policy advantage of the active misinformed can be more or less assertive. President George W. Bush and his administration probably condoned public misinformation well past the point of themselves believing that there were Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. A decade earlier, President George H.W. Bush had taken a step further into encouraging the use of misinformation by deliberately reinforcing misperceptions about what the American Bar Association (ABA) meant in declaring then‐judge Clarence Thomas “qualified” to be a Supreme Court justice. The ABA's rating was intended to be, and was understood by the knowledgeable as, “arguably the worst rating ever given to a Supreme Court nominee. . . . It was—or should have been—a stunning blow to Thomas.”66 But to the vast majority of Americans who know nothing about the ABA, “qualified” seemed, sensibly enough, to mean what it said—that Thomas was qualified to be on the Court. Despite the White House staff's deeper knowledge, the president's spokesperson simply stated that “we are very pleased that the A.B.A.'s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has found Judge Thomas qualified to be an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.”67 Senator John Danforth concurred that “as the ABA will testify, he is certainly qualified for the job.” It was a brilliant move: “How could it be explained . . . that when the ABA said qualified, it really meant barely acceptable. To most people, qualified sounds like an endorsement.”68             "
"89","Sarah Palin moved even deeper into boosting the use of misinformation by inventing and continuing to foster belief in nonexistent ACA death panels during the debate over passage of the health care bill. She is not alone in creating rather than merely tolerating or encouraging misinformation. In 2011, Senator Jon Kyl (R‐AZ) falsely stated on the Senate floor, “If you want an abortion, you go to Planned Parenthood, and that's well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.” Not so: fewer than 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's services are abortions, and none is federally funded. In these cases and others, one set of political actors or one policy position benefited from the stability of the category of active misinformation and sought to raise the salience of particular bits of misinformation."
"90","Not all political actors condone, encourage, or create citizens' active use of misinformation. One member of Congress, for example, declared to Richard Fenno that “I have the best platform from which to educate of anyone in the country. To me, there's no difference between leadership and education. . . . What is politics if it's not teaching?” His hearer, however, observed soon thereafter that “the only generalization supportable by the evidence is the apparent paucity of educational effort.”69 To test the disparate claims of Fenno and his informant—more broadly, to examine how energetically elected officials work to spur the active use of facts—we conducted two parallel studies. One analyzed district‐wide constituent newsletters from two different sessions of Congress. We focused on representatives who had been elected at least twice, on the grounds that winners of at least two elections have presumably worked out the right answer to the question of how much information to convey to voters, better, at any rate, than their opponents did. We examined newsletters because, given the rules and norms of congressional communication, they present the most direct, unmediated communication from politicians to all constituents. Furthermore, the newsletter format encourages communication of facts more than, say, meeting notices or campaign ads do—so if Fenno's informant is right, we should see evidence of educational efforts in successful legislators' newsletters.            "
"91","In particular, we explored politicians' provision of what we term “social facts”—pieces of information that might provide a context for legislation through factual statements about society at large. Such statements could be precise states of affairs, explicit or implicit comparisons of one state of affairs to another, or even causal claims. Examples include “Oil prices have risen by 33 percent,” “Oil prices are rapidly rising,” “Oil prices are higher than they've ever been,” and “Conflict in the Middle East is causing oil prices to rise.”"
"92","We found that members of Congress are mostly uninterested in purveying social facts. Roughly 14 percent of all coded paragraphs in the 2004–2005 and 2006–2007 congressional sessions contained a social fact. And even when politicians do seek to educate their constituents, in both years, more than half of the social facts appeared in the same paragraph as partisan appeals or David Mayhew's categories of position taking, advertising, and credit claiming.70 In contrast, newsletter writers provide many legislative facts, that is, bits of information about bills, new laws, and speeches or other procedural activities; examples include “The House voted 403–30 to pass the housing bill” and “This new law offers tax breaks to families making below $10,500.” In both 2004–2005 and 2006–2007, well over half of the coded newsletter paragraphs contained legislative facts either alone or combined with partisan or personal appeals.            "
"93","Thus, elected officials tell their constituents a great deal about the good things that Congress is doing and vigorously urge them to ensure that their representative can continue doing those things—but they give constituents little information that provides context, explains and justifies, or simply makes sense of the plethora of legislative facts and personal or partisan appeals. Almost by definition, because we sampled newsletters from electorally successful candidates, this strategy is electorally successful. But it does not support a claim that “educating your constituency . . . [is] the most important job we have.”71             "
"94","Our second study of political actors' commitment to educating their constituency paralleled the first but focused on State of the Union addresses. We analyzed the first State of the Union addresses given by George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama after their initial elections and, if relevant, their reelections. The results are uncannily similar to those of members of Congress; recent presidents have devoted an average of 16 percent of the paragraphs in these speeches to educating their listeners about social facts. The proportion of paragraphs devoted to social facts was also surprisingly similar given the presidents' very different styles, ranging from 10 percent for George H.W. Bush's analyzed speeches to 25 percent in Barack Obama's."
"95","This consistency in levels of social fact provision suggests that successful elites have evolved a norm of occasionally, but infrequently, trying to nudge citizens into the active use of knowledge. More often, they seek partisan or policy gains by starting where citizens are substantively and trying to galvanize them politically from that starting point. They seek to make some facts more salient than others, and the information they promote may be more accurate than the information they deemphasize. But the level of accuracy may be accidental, and providing explanation or context is not a priority; politicians seeking (re)election have more pressing goals than pursuit of the Jeffersonian democratic ideal."
"96","That conclusion, however, has exceptions, even beyond the occasional assiduous efforts of politicians to correct misinformation about themselves. A political actor who perceives that people's misinformation is linked to a harmful partisan or policy view may devote resources to try to explain to them the real situation and then persuade them to use their new knowledge. The issue of vaccination provides a good example of both the motivation for and the difficulties of moving people from active misinformation toward the Jeffersonian ideal. The CDC has a Web site partly devoted to convincing people to vaccinate their children (motto: “Love. Protect. Immunize.”). The CDC tracks the number of very young children who have gotten measles from travel abroad since 2001 (the year after “measles was declared eliminated in the United States”) and points out that almost all sickened babies had not been immunized and that some were hospitalized and developed complications. Carefully avoiding blame, the CDC notes that “all of these infections and the associated sequelae were potentially preventable through adherence to recommendations for vaccination of children traveling outside the United States.”72             "
"97","The CDC also sponsors National Infant Immunization Week, “an annual observance to highlight the importance of protecting infants from vaccine‐preventable diseases and celebrate the achievements of immunization programs and their partners in promoting healthy communities.” Promotions range from fact sheets and growth charts for parents in English and Spanish to coloring sheets for children. Community outreach programs include informational sessions for parents and child care providers as well as “Safe Summer Slam, a youth empowerment event and neighborhood festival.” Researchers urge public health officials also to “engage in more proactive social marketing campaigns . . . [including] newer media such as social‐networking sites and Twitter.”73             "
"98","Other public actors join the CDC, with varying degrees of urgency and efficacy. The American Medical Association's Web site offers a rather bland page on “Pediatric Vaccination” with a stern message: “Unfortunately, the immense success of vaccination in America has lulled many parents into complacency with regard to vaccine preventable diseases. . . . In order for previous successes to be maintained, the public and their appointed legislators must realize these diseases still exist and can still debilitate and kill.” It assures readers that there is “no relationship between thimerosal vaccines and autism” and that “infant immunizations [are] not shown to be harmful to infants' systems,” but it expends little energy on a persuasive message. The American Academy of Pediatrics tries harder, with Web pages featuring colorful pictures of cute children, stories about presumably real patients, an FAQ page, an information‐filled page dedicated to families, and an invitation to “Pediatric Best Practices: Submit Yours!”"
"99","But it is unlikely that any of these efforts reached more than a small fraction of the people who heard Representative Bachmann state that “a mother . . . told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter” (12 September 2011), or those who saw actress Jenny McCarthy's heart‐rending 45‐minute interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show:               "
"100","What number [of autism diagnoses] will it take for people just to start listening to what the mothers of children who have seen autism have been saying for years, which is, “We vaccinated our baby and something happened.” Right before his [her son's] MMR shot, I said to the doctor, “I have a very bad feeling about this shot. This is the autism shot, isn't it?” And he said, “No, that is ridiculous. It is a mother's desperate attempt to blame something,” and he swore at me, and then the nurse gave [Evan] the shot. And soon thereafter—boom—the soul's gone from his eyes.74                   "
"101","Few elected officials challenge these “mother warriors,” as Winfrey describes the courageous mothers of autistic sons, despite the concern that declining vaccination rates are linked to deaths from infectious diseases. At Winfrey's invitation, the CDC responded to McCarthy's comments with a long, carefully worded, and sympathetic statement that might be compelling to medical professionals but had none of McCarthy's flair.75 Even worse, CDC‐type responses may be not only ineffective against mother warriors but also counterproductive. In one study, subjects were shown a CDC flyer countering “myths” about flu vaccination. Those asked to recall the information immediately after reading it did so accurately, but those asked to recall the information a half hour later were significantly more likely to perceive myths as facts than the reverse and less likely to say that they would get a flu shot than those who had responded immediately. In short, the effort to correct misinformation about vaccines backfired.76             "
"102","Even if providing information does not backfire, note once more the asymmetry between action and inaction. A public actor can expect little success from efforts to induce people to abandon their false beliefs, reject the views and behaviors of their group, acquire new knowledge, and change their activity accordingly. That may be especially true for parents of young children, but it holds more generally. Such an effort requires a large investment of resources, probably over a long period of time and for many group members simultaneously. There are always battles to be fought and important policies to be promulgated; except for those with a professional responsibility to do so, trying to move frightened parents from the active use of falsehoods to the active application of correct information may seem, and be, a poor use of scarce resources."
"103","Despite the three asymmetries that cumulate in the great stability of the active misinformed, it is at times possible to persuade individuals to stop acting on falsehoods in their political or policy choices. Facts matter. Or, as Newt Gingrich put it when confronting his failed presidential campaign, “I think you have to at some point be honest with what's happening in the real world, as opposed to what you'd like to have happened” (25 April 2012). On occasion, large numbers of people eschew incorrect information in favor of knowledge. A proof of principle case is that of African Americans' views of Justice Clarence Thomas."
"104","Asymmetry operated powerfully with regard to views on his confirmation to the Supreme Court. During the crucial few months of his nomination, Thomas's supporters had only to reinforce, or merely not contest, many blacks' mistaken expectations about Thomas's likely liberalism once confirmed. Supporters were highly strategic; Thomas's confirmation process inaugurated “a new style of ‘judicial campaigning’ for membership on the Court.”77 Although some wanted to promote his conservatism, those who managed his nomination mostly sought to “duck volatile issues and go with crafting the image of a man who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps from Pin Point, Georgia.” As one White House source put it, “Their main strategy was . . . to split the black community, get public pressure, particularly on the Southern Democrats.”78          "
"105","President Bush initiated that strategy, mentioning Pin Point, Georgia, in the second paragraph of his nomination speech. Although race purportedly played no role in his choice of a justice (“I . . . pick[ed] the best man for the job on the merits”), Bush noted “the fact that he's a minority—you heard his testimony to the kind of life he's had, and I think that speaks eloquently for itself.” Senators Strom Thurmond, John Danforth, and others made similar statements, often using similar words."
"106","Thomas was no less forthcoming in his own opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee: “My earliest memories . . . are those of Pin Point, Georgia, a life far removed in space and time from this room, this day and this moment. . . . We lived in one room in a tenement. We shared a kitchen with other tenants and we had a common bathroom in the backyard which was unworkable and unusable. It was hard, but it was all we had and all there was.” His trajectory since then has proved that “hard work and strong values can make for a better life.”"
"107","The quotations could easily be multiplied but are unnecessary; careful framing enabled Thomas and his supporters to take advantage of the beliefs held by a majority of blacks that Thomas “understands the black experience” and “would do a good job representing people like me,” in the language of a Time/CNN poll in July 1991. Thomas's opponents had a much more difficult task, which they failed to accomplish. They needed to make the delicate argument that a very dark‐skinned black man who had worked his way up from deep poverty and racism in a tiny southern town did not deserve to sit on the Supreme Court. In particular, opponents had to convince African Americans that they were mistaken in believing that their race would benefit from having the only available black man elevated to the Court, that they were misinformed about his racial solidarity, or that their predictions of how his racial solidarity would be manifested in judicial decisions would prove wrong. Given their own political and racial liberalism, the actors most concerned about Thomas's ideology and plausible future rulings were precisely those who found it most difficult to tell black voters that their views were naive and wrong.         "
"108","Thus, opponents tended to tie themselves into knots trying to prevent the active use of misinformation while maintaining their own and Thomas's dignity. The national NAACP's statement provides an unfortunately good example:            "
"109","The story of Judge Thomas's rise from the poverty of his youth to his present eminence is captivating and inspiring. . . . We have no basic quarrel with Judge Thomas's devotion to self‐reliance and self‐help. Indeed, we share it. What is overlooked in the emphasis on self‐reliance is any concern for what government and other sectors of society ought to do to alleviate many problems in the minority community. . . . We earnestly desire the appointment of an African‐American to the supreme bench. But if there is reason to believe the African‐American nominee would join in the further and continued erosion of threatened civil rights gains, we don't need that appointee.79                "
"110","This message may have been subtle, profound, and correct—but it was hard to convey. Opponents never found a way to counter Thomas's declaration that “as a child, I could not dare dream that I would ever see the Supreme Court—not to mention be nominated to it. . . . Only in America could this have been possible” (1 July 1991). Had more than a third of blacks used accurate information, a few senators' votes would probably have been different, and Thomas would have been denied the confirmation he craved. But the incentives captured by the phrase “political asymmetry” meant that Americans were much more likely to act on their misinformation than to use a painful set of facts appropriately."
"111","The logic of asymmetry between active misinformation and active information did not change after confirmation. What did change was the dissemination of new information about Thomas's positions on the Court—positions that made him by far the most conservative justice since 1937, when the Martin‐Quinn scoring system began.80 The number of people of any race who ponder Martin‐Quinn scores is miniscule. But the media quickly and consistently made the scores' message clear to the public. From 1 June to 1 October 1992, that is, in the four months immediately after his first Supreme Court term, the words “Clarence Thomas” and “conservative” appeared in 79 television or radio transcripts tracked by Lexis‐Nexis. A CBS News show observed that “Justice Scalia is holding the far right. He is frequently joined . . . more and more by the newest justice, Clarence Thomas, who certainly is every bit as conservative as his supporters hoped he would be and as his critics feared he would be. He has headed with Justice Scalia often to that distant right that would do a lot of changing of the country, I think.” Another Charles Kuralt Sunday news show, also in 1992, described “an extraordinary diversity of leadership . . . [among blacks, including] Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. His is one of a growing number of conservative black voices.”         "
"112","Mainstream print media echoed television. The Houston Chronicle editorialized, “If you are ever tempted to think that being black, Hispanic, or any other minority automatically means being tolerant, sensitive, and compassionate, from now until the end of your life you should remember Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. . . . Give Thomas a chance, said minorities and pragmatists alike. President Bush was going to nominate a conservative to succeed retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall, no matter what. And better a conservative of color than one who was not. Live and learn.” Conservative James Kilpatrick praised him in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution in an article headlined, “Justice Thomas Is Off to a Good Start after a Solidly Conservative First Term.” The St. Louis Post‐Dispatch noted in 1992 that “Rookie Justice Thomas Pleased Conservatives.”         "
"113","Media oriented toward nonwhite audiences conveyed the same message, almost always without Kilpatrick‐type approbation. As of April 2014, ProQuest's Ethnic NewsWatch database identified 1,525 items in minority‐oriented newspapers and magazines since Thomas's confirmation that contained the search terms “Clarence Thomas” and “conservative.” Headlines include “African American Conservatives Surface” (Big Red News, 7 December 1991), “Clarence Thomas: Cruel and Unusual” (Call and Post, 12 March 1992), “Clarence Thomas Isn't the Victim We Thought He Was” (Philadelphia Tribune, 3 April 1992), “All We Get from Thomas Are the Sounds of Silence” (Tennessee Tribune, 3 January 2001), and “Clarence Thomas Should Be the Last Person to Whine about Race” (Chicago Defender, 26 February 2014). In a 2007 appearance on The Tavis Smiley Show, the president of the National Urban League described Thomas as “hostile towards [black] advancement.”         "
"114","In short, African Americans had plenty of opportunity in the years after confirmation to learn that their predictions of Thomas's likely behavior on the Supreme Court were wrong. And they did learn it. In the year after confirmation, blacks on average continued to feel relatively cold toward Anita Hill (on a feeling thermometer) and warm toward Thomas.81 But support for Thomas eventually eroded. Figure 5 shows the decline in African Americans' favorable view of Justice Thomas from confirmation through the most recent relevant poll question we could find, from 2012. The proportion of supporters dropped from roughly three‐fifths in the first year to less than a third about five years later. By 2012, black support for Thomas remained low at 40 percent.         "
"115","Percentage of Black Survey Respondents with Favorable Views of Justice Clarence Thomas, 1991–2012"
"116","Sources: In addition to surveys in iPoll, see Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, July 1992, 3 January 1996, 5 September 1998; National Black Politics Study, 4 December 1993; National Black Election Study, 9 September 1996; 2012 Outlook Survey.                     "
"117","In more analytical terms, by the late 1990s, most African Americans had given up the liberal optimism, racial nationalism, or commitment to the Horatio Alger story that had spurred them to rely on mistaken causal claims about the relationship between Thomas's race or background and his judicial actions. They moved into the Jeffersonian ideal (ironically named in this case) by realizing that Justice Thomas is a conservative whose views differ from those of most black Americans. As one person put it in 1998, “Ultimately, this is how people have to be judged: how their actions, activities, decisions, power, influence etc. impede the growth and advancement of African Americans. So far, Thomas has been a major—and concrete—impediment.”82 From a more scholarly perspective, “the thesis that any Black could be counted on to defend the interests of all Blacks was substantially valid as long as Jim Crow segregation lasted. . . . [But with the] development of a more class‐divided Black America, . . . descriptive representation no longer worked with bureaucrats and politicians such as Thomas, who feel no sense of allegiance to the historic Black freedom struggle.”83          "
"118","Justice Thomas was 43 years old when appointed and could easily serve on the Supreme Court for four decades. The active use of misinformation was a costly mistake from the perspective of most African Americans."
"119","People can unlearn long‐held views and learn new ones; if facts are “presented in a way that ‘hits them between the eyes’ . . . such information can have a substantial effect.”84 A majority of Americans eventually stopped believing that Iraq harbored weapons of mass destruction; a majority of African Americans eventually stopped believing that Justice Thomas would rule in ways that matched their understanding of their race's interests; some parents whose children got infectious diseases rue their failure to vaccinate.         "
"120","But substantial changes of this sort are rare. It is hard for a political actor to move people to action even when they hold correct information, and it is yet harder for an overstretched political actor (is there any other kind?) to change what people think they know and then to move them to action based on newly acquired facts. From the perspective of the individual, moving from inactive to active use of knowledge requires some effort but has the reward of reducing dissonance—whereas moving from the active use of misinformation to actively applying new understandings of facts not only requires great effort but also increases dissonance and discomfort because it entails abandoning communities of belief. A conversion experience is profound but rare. From the perspective of the political actor, it makes no sense to hunt where the ducks seldom roost."
"121","Nevertheless, change can occur. Our motivation for writing Do Facts Matter? is to enhance democratic governance, and the book contains a variety of strategies for promoting membership in the category of active informed. They range from education to persuasion to shaming, and from confronting citizens directly to working around them through experts or rules. It is perhaps fortunate that there are relatively few cases in which a painful experience—a child's measles, a war in Iraq, or a sense of betrayal by a prominent member of one's racial group—is the only thing that moves people out of a state of misinformed activity. Nonetheless, a democratic polity would be much better off if other, less traumatic, strategies could move people away from the dangerous stance of political activity based on misinformation. As Will Rogers once remarked, “It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble. It's what we know that ain't so.”*          "
