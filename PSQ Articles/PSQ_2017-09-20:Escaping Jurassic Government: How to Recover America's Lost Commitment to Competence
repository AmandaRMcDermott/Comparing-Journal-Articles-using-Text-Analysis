"1","My reaction upon reading the first few pages of this book was disgust. I had to suppress a strong desire to hurl it across the room. Wait, citizens, hear me out! My disgust has nothing to do with Donald Kettl's excellent book. It has everything to do with the failure of our discipline even to entertain a full and frank discussion of the issue that Kettl raises: the decline in our nation's commitment to competence in government programs."
"2","Kettl argues persuasively that the old Progressive consensus that whatever government choses to do (the “what”), it ought to do it well (the “how”) has collapsed. Democrats expanded programs without clear professional models of implementation. They supported privatization and what Kettl terms interweaving—indirect, private sector systems for program implementation to broaden government—but this led to increasing complexity and difficulty in establishing accountability. Republicans found they were unsuccessful in reversing the addition of programs, so they turned to undermining the funding and implementing of these programs, undermining them to cause them to fail. The result was declines in performance leading to increasing skepticism about government's ability to solve problems.         "
"3","Kettl sketches four possible paths into the future based on the extent to which government implements programs or uses private entities to do so and on the extensiveness of the use of evidence to guide policy. Empowered government follows John DiIulio's argument that government should reverse privatization and restore a professional civil service as the central core to government programs. Leveraged government, Kettl's favored alternative, recognizes the reality of a federal government intertwined with private organizations but demands reliance on evidence and a highly professional core of government managers to manage complexity. The final two scenarios are degenerate forms: strong government presence in programs but a lack of reliance on evidence (weakened government) and intertwined government without reliance on evidence (musclebound government).         "
"4","Evidence distinguishes the productive from the degenerate paths. If evidence is dismissed, overly politicized, or not collected, then the restoration of a good government consensus must fail. Government can succeed under DiIulio's empowered government or Kettl's leveraged government, but it fails if the evidentiary component is weak."
"5","There are several points where Kettl misses the mark. First, Kettl fails to distinguish between evidence of the severity of a problem to justify government intervention and evidence for the design of solutions, a distinction that Frank Baumgartner and I stress in the Politics of Information. The two types of program‐relevant information are intertwined. If Republicans reject evidence that a program is justified (as is the case for the expansion of health insurance coverage), they will reject evidence that would improve that program—as it was never justified in the first place. Perhaps the fundamental problem isolated by Kettl cannot be solved through a consensus on evidence.         "
"6","Second, the idea that government performance is so abysmal in comparison with the past or private service delivery is a doubtful. That citizens and some political elites do not see that performance is certainly problematic, but it is a different issue."
"7","Third, the parties really are asymmetric on many issues, and that includes the acceptance of an evidentiary basis for policymaking. Much of that difference is attributable to Republican resistance to expansion, but this resistance bleeds into lack of support for program improvement."
"8","None of this undermines the exceptional work Kettl has done. I wish I could conclude with a statement on the certainty of political scientists fully debating these issues. But I cannot. We are consumed with the match between the preferences of voters or elites and what they get out of government, not on how government does or does not solve problems in a complex society."
