"1","Voters summarily ousted Herbert Hoover from the White House in 1933, and casual readers of history might assume that he promptly disappeared from the public scene, lost in the shadow of Franklin Roosevelt. As late author Gary Dean Best's extremely detailed and expansive Keeper of the Torch demonstrates, however, Hoover was, in fact, a visible and active former president, working tirelessly and for decades to revive his legacy, nurture his ideology, and rescue his Party's political fortunes. Prior works by Best and others have portrayed Hoover as a remarkable man diminished by the presidency, a man whose keen intellect was unsuited to the mire of politics. This volume picks up that theme in 1933, offering a portrait of the post‐presidential Hoover as a brilliant, complex character, sometimes angry, often shrill and contentious, relatively unskilled in the art of politics but always engaged in public affairs.         "
"2","The meticulous historical scholarship on display in Best's final volume is impressive, as the author essentially retraces Hoover's steps over the course of 31 years, at times providing a day‐by‐day chronicle of events. The detail can, at times, be overwhelming, a limitation explained in part by the production process behind the volume. Best died after producing the manuscript. Academic referees felt it unwise to alter Best's work without the author's input, and thus it was published in its entirety."
"3","The scope of the book is daunting but Best skillfully escorts the reader through Hoover's post‐election anger at being collared with responsibility for the Great Depression, his misinterpretation of the Nazi threat, his post‐war work to feed Europe, and ultimately Hoover's late‐in‐life emergence as what Best calls “The Grand Old Man of the Grand Old Party” (p. 447)."
"4","The secret to this extraordinary work of scholarship, of course, resides in Hoover's own active mind and prolific pen. The former president was a keen observer, ever able to express the meaning of events as filtered by a political philosophy he referred to as “historic liberalism.” Hoover clearly saw himself as the protector of his conservative worldview, and he labored to promote it, working 12 hours a day into his eighties. He produced seven books between the ages of 85 and 90. That voluminous record provided Best with an enormous cache of data as well as a complex task, analyzing and distilling it into a narrative. Dense with facts and citations, Best's final scholarly work is undoubtedly an important and useful account of Hoover's post‐presidential life."
"5","Throughout his post‐presidency, Hoover labored to keep his brand of conservatism alive and to pass it along to new generations. Hoover died in 1964, a few weeks before the electoral defeat of GOP conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who, according to Best “embodied the principles he [Hoover] believed in” (p. 462). Ultimately, Best's final volume provides a compelling argument that the Reagan revolution of conservatism owed much to Hoover's combative, 31‐year, post‐presidential evangelism of “historic liberalism.”"
