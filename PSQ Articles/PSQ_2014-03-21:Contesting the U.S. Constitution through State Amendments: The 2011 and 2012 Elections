"1","IN MARCH OF 2013, REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS in North Dakota agreed to challenge Roe v. Wade by forwarding a “personhood” amendment to voters that will appear on the 2014 ballot. Such an amendment would change the state's legal definition of personhood to include unborn fetuses—a move that backers have explicitly discussed as part of a challenge to a Supreme Court decision they view as having been wrongly decided.1 The Court may pronounce itself the final arbiter of the Constitution, but Americans outside of Washington, DC do not necessarily agree.2"
"2","Such efforts by state actors to take the Constitution away from the courts mirror a recent shift in political‐legal scholarship, in which court‐centered accounts of constitutional interpretation and construction have been rightly condemned.3 Scholars have turned instead toward a renewed emphasis on the political contestation of non‐judicial actors in enforcing the Constitution.4"
"3","As John Dinan has observed, state constitutional amendments have become a part of that conversation about the U.S. Constitution.5 This is not, of course, the first time in which federal and state constitutionalism have been in sustained conversation; in the 1980s, for example, the so‐called “New Federalist” movement, based on a seminal address by Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, attempted to overcome the judicial conservatism of the Rehnquist Court by turning to state constitutions for more‐expansive rights claims.6 State constitutions do more than offer such advantages to out‐party judges, as their greater flexibility makes them more democratic, accountable, and more protective of positive rights.7 There are, of course, reasons to be concerned about the democratic quality of the initiative process, easily captured by interest groups and the wealthy.8 However, the public conversation about these high‐salience, national constitutional issues assuages this fear somewhat, or at least as much as anything arguably can in American democracy. Moreover, the specificity of their amendment process arguably sends a clearer signal of popular understanding than do representative elections and other instruments favored by popular constitutionalists.9 Finally, to the extent that we view an active and well‐informed citizenry as closer to the deliberative ideal of constitutional self‐government, public campaigns on salient initiatives may help produce a better‐informed body politic.10"
"4","Such developments would make James Madison smile. The Federalist Papers offer, as part of their effort to ensure a decentralized politics in spite of a stronger federal government, the reminder that states should and will help cabin Washington within its proper constitutional boundaries. In addition to the famous Papers 10 and 51 discussing the general competition between jealous officers on behalf of liberty, on several occasions, Publius specifically calls for states to police federal expansion.11 In order to appease moderate “anti‐Federalists”—who did want a stronger government than the one set up under the Articles, but who nonetheless retained primary allegiance to their states—Publius's Federalist allies recirculated these arguments in the ratifying conventions as well.12 Thus, a vibrant constitutional debate in the states would be precisely in line across the spectrum of Founding‐era thinkers. Moreover, the variety of state constitutions helps create a system of competitive federalism on behalf of liberty, as well as multiple sites in which to work through constitutional principles.13 However moribund such federal–state debate was in midcentury America,14 it is clear that Madisonian contestation—especially outside the courts, inside the states—is back, as this year's election continued to show.         "
"5","This article draws on the last two election cycles—in 2011 and 2012—to argue for the increasingly central role of state constitutions within our battles about the U.S. Constitution. In so doing, it will survey the debate in state constitutional politics that took place in these quasi‐federal state amendments.15 The breadth of national issues considered suggests that state constitutions are not the battleground of an isolated interest or two but have been embraced as sites of contestation by a wide variety of activists and legislators. Thus, in considering changes to their own state constitutions, Americans explored concurrent federal constitutional controversies on abortion, race and voting, firearms, gay marriage, eminent domain, health care mandates, separation of church and state, campaign finance, and marijuana. Pro‐life North Dakotans, then, are not alone.         "
"6","More importantly, I make three observations about the contours of these debates that will help us understand their direction going forward—and, as the planned vote in North Dakota shows us, they will go forward."
"7","First, while not directly challenging judicial supremacy, state actors do believe they should contribute to national constitutional discourse instead of leaving the field to the courts alone; the resulting constitutional consideration seems more substantive than the anemic debates on Capitol Hill. Whether due to greater fluency among candidates or political responsiveness in the wake of constituent pressure, elected officials and platforms have increasingly mobilized around constitutional dialogue.16 However, members of Congress seem less keen on that constitutionalism once actually elected; Mitchell Pickerill's recent study shows that national legislators tend to rank constitutional considerations quite low among their priorities.17 The ongoing struggle over the health care law suggests the problems arising when such a constitutionally activated public sees Congress neglect its duties. As Neil Devins laments, the Affordable Care Act seems to be an issue where constitutional debate followed the vote to pass legislation, rather than serving as an antecedent to it.18"
"8","Second, while some of these initiatives are home‐grown, national interest groups are key backers of most quasi‐federal state amendments, using states as platforms to support positions on the federal Constitution. Recent scholarship has emphasized the key influence of legal networks in constitutional politics, especially since the civil rights revolution.19 By extending those insights to the field of state constitutional politics, we can see the permeability of national and state constitutionalism—indeed, paradoxically, in some cases the vindication of state prerogative is achieved by nationalized networks, as the early Jeffersonians and their successors hoped to do with the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions and the early Democratic Party itself.20"
"9","Third, conservatives appear more comfortable or eager to engage in this constitutional debate (and especially to frame it as opposition to the federal government), although liberals also use the means and occasionally language of constitutional pushback in their own quasi‐federal state constitutional amendments. Commitment to federalism is most publicly associated with conservatives and libertarians, and conservative groups and politicians often prominently voice support for pushback on Washington.21 That the majority of these amendments come from the political right, as broadly construed, should not be terribly surprising. Perhaps more surprising is that scholars and actors on the political left are also rediscovering federalism's virtues, albeit in more moderate forms than occasionally circulate on the other end of the spectrum.22 While less common, liberal state amendments did appear in 2011 and 2012. In fact, during that period, the left provided what was arguably the most specifically counter‐interpretive effort (the attack on Citizens United) as well as the most significant in its policy consequence (decriminalizing marijuana). Its hands forced by state initiatives, the Barack Obama administration now finds itself in an unenviable position in deciding to prosecute federal drug laws in unfriendly states. As a result, a group of predominantly Democratic cosponsors proposed a bill that would end federal preemption of such states' marijuana laws, calling it the “Respect States' and Citizens' Rights Act of 2012.”23 The response—albeit still tepid—of Washington to those statewide votes reminds us of the permeability of constitutional politics between Denver and DC, on both right and left.         "
"10","Abortion again proved a site of attempted resistance to the Supreme Court within states' constitutions, continuing activists' longtime efforts to evade and undermine the holdings in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton.24 Relatively few anti‐abortion efforts have succeeded in passing, and the earliest successful amendment actually codified a Court decision holding that the right to an abortion did not entail a right to abortion funding.25 Until very recently, voters approved only four abortion initiatives—either statutory or constitutional—since Roe: two in Colorado, Arkansas's Amendment 68 in 1990, and a Washington initiative reinforcing and funding abortion rights in 1991.26 Nonetheless, such efforts continue, and anti‐abortion activists' proposals in the last few years represent all the elements of a typical quasi‐federal state amendment: first, insistence on the authority to offer a correct interpretation of the Constitution in spite of what the Supreme Court has pronounced; second, mobilization by groups beyond the states' borders; and third, a conservative orientation couched in explicitly constitutional language.         "
"11","Activists brought two abortion amendments to voters in the last two years, with many others falling short of the ballot. In 2011, with much fanfare, Mississippians voted on Proposition 26, the so‐called “personhood” amendment. This amendment would have modified the Mississippi constitution to define rights‐bearing personhood to “include every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the functional equivalent thereof.” The personhood amendment's authors, an extreme anti‐abortion group of the same name based not in Mississippi but in Colorado, explicitly offered this as a direct challenge to Roe—a challenge that the justices themselves had discussed when considering the case originally. As both the oral arguments and Harry Blackmun's analysis in the written opinion observed, a legal finding of “personhood” would have made the court's eventual holding impossible. Personhood USA tried to make this abundantly clear: one of their online clips features audio excerpts from Roe's oral argument in which Justice Potter Stewart agreed that accepting a personhood argument would effectively end the case.27"
"12","An equivalent proposal by the amendment's authors had already failed by a lopsided 30‐70 margin in the group's Colorado backyard in 2010, and it did so again by a 42‐58 vote, even in the extremely pro‐life state of Mississippi.28 The amendment failed in spite of the 2011 vote representing one of the best chances to ratify a personhood effort—in perhaps the most extremely socially conservative state, during an off‐year election.29"
"13","Nonetheless, Personhood USA had helped generate a conversation that remained a live constitutional discussion at the presidential level. During a South Carolina Republican presidential primary debate, conservative Princeton professor Robert George pointedly asked the candidates whether they believed Congress could use its enforcement powers in Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to so define personhood in a way that would threaten Roe.30 However, it seems that personhood is a constitutional conversation its backers are on the losing end of—at least for now. Even in an ideal Mississippi climate, “personhood” mustered only 42 percent of the vote, and Personhood USA has struggled to get it on other ballots.         "
"14","Although the group continued with its efforts after Mississippi, no other “personhood” ballot initiative actually reached the voters in 2012. Oklahoma's Supreme Court cited controlling Supreme Court precedent to block an amendment from that state's ballot, while Alaska's Attorney General and Lieutenant Governor—both Republicans—did the same to an initiated statute the year before.31 Efforts to gather signatures in Ohio, Montana, and Nevada failed in 2012. 32 Thus, it appears that even many pro‐life Americans agree with Justice Antonin Scalia in refusing to find a constitutional ban on abortion based on individual rights of personhood, rather than believing that textual silence empowers states to ban or allow the procedure as they see fit.33 Political actors and activists continue to contest whether the Constitution allows states the power to restrict abortion, but, for now, the constitutional dialogue on personhood amendments, across a diverse swath of states, suggests something close to a consensus.         "
"15","In 2012, only one abortion amendment actually reached the ballot, a largely in‐house effort to more closely attach Florida state law to federal law. The first of its two prongs would again codify the Hyde Amendment and Harris v. McRae in preventing the use of state funds for abortions except in the cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of a mother.34 (The resulting policy change of the amendment would limit state employees' insurance access to abortion services, but otherwise, the status quo would remain.)35 The other prong of the amendment held that “[t]his constitution may not be interpreted to create broader rights to an abortion than those contained in the United States Constitution.”36 The latter section sought to override Florida courts' more expansive interpretation of their own constitution by hitching state jurisprudence to a federal standard, a fairly well‐documented practice.37 As noted earlier, liberals behind the “New Federalism” movement had pressed for divergence between state and federal constitutional law in the 1980s, and Florida's strong privacy amendment made such expansive abortion jurisprudence particularly easy to implement.38 Closing that divergence had also been conservatives' objective in 2004, when the state's voters amended their constitution to allow parental notifications—again, explicitly attached to federal, not state, constitutional privacy—by almost a 2‐to‐1 margin.39"
"16","By a roughly 45‐55 margin (Florida's amendments require 60 percent approval), the state's voters rejected the amendment and kept their abortion law somewhat decoupled from federal standards."
"17","Florida's abortion politics thus remain something of a draw—especially considering an electorate's particularly foul mood that rejected 8 of 11 amendments—but Mississippi clearly did not turn into the personhood vanguard its supporters wanted either.40 However, Personhood USA did manage to generate a widely covered debate, though citizens simply did not share its interpretation. Personhood USA already has plans to try again in Florida in 2014, but the next two conflicts are already lined up.41 As noted in the introduction, North Dakota will see a personhood provision that year, and Tennessee voters are scheduled to vote on an amendment to override the state supreme court's wide‐reaching interpretation of abortion rights.42 Personhood may be a losing proposition, for now, but its sponsors still believe the best way to go after Roe is through state constitutional politics.         "
"18","In 2011 and 2012, citizens in four states—Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, and Minnesota—cast ballots on race and voting issues that were swirling more broadly in the national constitutional discourse. Three of these (blocking affirmative action, and a split on voter ID) represented efforts by right‐wing groups to steer the impact of Court decisions, while the fourth, more‐symbolic endeavor resulted from a conservative state legislator's unsuccessful elimination of dormant language that had once resisted the civil rights movement."
"19","November's election was only the most‐recent effort by activist and former University of California regent Ward Connerly and his organization to put similar amendments on state ballots, which they have done since California voters first restricted affirmative action in 1996 with Proposition 209. The Supreme Court's guarded imprimatur of affirmative action in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003 generated perhaps the most‐prominent of these “Civil Rights Initiatives,” namely, the 2006 vote to block the Court's decision in Michigan.43 The 6th Circuit, in turn, recently invalidated that amendment, and three weeks before the November 2012 election, the Supreme Court itself heard oral arguments to reconsider Grutter in the case of Fisher v. University of Texas.44 Thus, this remains very much a live issue, and as in Michigan, the national conservative group placed a “Civil Rights Initiative” on the Oklahoma ballot to interject a quasi‐federal state amendment into a live constitutional controversy. As a result, Oklahoma citizens became the fifth to constitutionally forbid such preferences, which may have some special relevance to the Court's decision making—Sandra Day O'Connor's precedential Grutter opinion itself explicitly observes the importance of social trends in considering affirmative action jurisprudence.45"
"20","At the same time that Oklahoma voters were considering preferences, a proposed Alabama amendment dealt with the intersection of race and education, though it was less a part of contemporary constitutional discourse and more a refusal to engage it. In November, voters in Alabama considered Amendment 4, which would have struck language guaranteeing segregated schools, a poll tax, and other obsolete language from their constitution. All of this is dead language—inert in light of Supreme Court holdings and congressional legislation—but it continues to remind citizens of the wretched legacy of Alabama's 1901 constitution. That infamous document—noteworthy for its comical length of 800 amendments, as well as its fundamentally racist origins—has been the subject of other recent efforts to prune its white supremacist beginnings.46 In 2000, Amendment 667 revoked a miscegenation ban, but a 2004 effort to eliminate much of the same segregationist language failed.47"
"21","Somewhat surprisingly, organized opposition to Alabama's 2012 amendment appeared predominantly from the left, as education groups feared the modified language would drop the constitutional obligation to maintain public schools. Thus, a combination of racial conservatism and voucher politics totaled 61 percent opposition to the amendment, and Alabama voters refused to ratify Brown v. Board of Education in the most notorious constitution in America.48"
"22","State constitutions have recently become battlegrounds, as courts grapple with the constitutionality of voter identification laws, which supporters contend maintain the integrity of the ballot and critics claim serve primarily partisan ends achieved through voter suppression.49 In 2008, Justice John Paul Stevens joined the Court's conservatives and authored an opinion approving Indiana's voter identification law in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Stevens's opinion held that maintaining the integrity of elections was a satisfactory end and that registration schemes that offered low‐cost or free identification did not impose an intolerable financial burden on the right to vote.50"
"23","While state constitutions often contain fairly detailed discussions of voting procedures—for example, who may cast an absentee ballot—and a majority of states have voter ID laws, no state amended its constitution to include them until 2011—this is very much a post‐Crawford phenomenon. During the same off‐year election in which Mississippi voters considered the “personhood” amendment, approximately 62 percent of Mississippi voters approved a voter ID amendment, becoming the first such state to ratify Crawford and constitutionalize this policy. In November 2012, a majority of Minnesotans voted against becoming the second, as initially favorable polling evaporated closer to election day.51"
"24","Although voter ID was approved in principle in Crawford, an appellate court recently distinguished the Texas photo identification law from the original case, claiming a pattern of suppression in the Lone Star State.52 Should Texas v. Holder reignite a constitutional debate about voter identification, voter ID may join absentee voting as a common element of many state constitutions. The decision in Fisher punting Grutter will very possibly do the same for affirmative action.         "
"25","One of the major controversies working through both federal and state constitutional politics in recent years has been eminent domain, in the long wake of Kelo v. New London.53 Post‐Kelo amendments have resulted from a combination of local policy entrepreneurship and external pressure from national conservative groups—with a particularly celebratory tone emphasizing the error of the Court's ways and the righteousness of overriding Kelo.         "
"26","Kelo generated a massive response, notable both for its wide scope and for the intensity of its anti‐Court opposition. In addition to the states that already had stronger property protections, as well as those that imposed them by statute after Kelo, eight states modified their constitutions to minimize the decision's effect within their borders between 2006 and 2010.54 The response, then, was quite broad.         "
"27","It was also rather contentious, perhaps needlessly so. In the majority opinion, John Paul Stevens offered a capacious interpretation of “public use” in which increased tax revenue could justify government takings. The opinion actually invited states to add more protections with a more‐stringent definition, insisting that the justices were merely taking a hands‐off, states' rights position.55 Officials and property rights groups scrambled to appease an angry populist backlash demanding the protection of property rights against a Supreme Court that evidently would not.56 Indeed, one observes that Kelo critics framed the addition of stronger property protections as “rejecting” Kelo when, in fact, Stevens had explicitly invited states to do so and simply denied a federal claim. For example, the Institute for Justice, the national libertarian property rights group whose Castle Coalition project helped spearhead activity in this area, claimed that Mississippi's vote made it “the 44th state to reject the Kelo v. New London ruling.”57 Interest groups have obvious advantages in mobilization and maintenance when rallying around, or against, a legal decision, but Kelo is striking in the extent to which conservative actors pitched their activities as anti‐Court.58"
"28","This constitutional dialogue continued, with two more states adding such protections since 2010: Mississippi ratified one in 2011, whereas Virginia voters approved a 2012 amendment championed by Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli.59 It is possible that such amendments might continue, especially in the many states that passed clarifying statutes in response to Kelo, but, unlike personhood, this appears to be a successfully concluded constitutional campaign. When counting clarifying statutes, the many states with pre‐existing constitutional clauses, and now ten post‐Kelo amendments rejecting eminent domain transfers to most private businesses and individuals, there may be little room for expansion on this front. In short, conservative groups appear to have used state constitutions to successfully wrest the meaning of “public use” to the Kelo dissenters' position.         "
"29","Because many states have gradually liberalized the gun provisions in their constitutions over the last 40 years, relatively little activity on firearms has occurred recently. Indeed, DC v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, although couched in originalist reasoning, are arguably the culmination, not the beginning, of this conversation.60 As a result, only one such amendment was voted on in the last two elections, with Louisiana modifying Article I, Section 11 of its constitution in 2012. Going beyond pre‐existing state language already guaranteeing individuals the right to keep and bear arms, the new, much more expansive text asserted that the right to “acquire, keep, possess, transport, carry, transfer, and use arms for defense of life and liberty, and for all other legitimate purposes is fundamental and shall not be denied or infringed, and any restriction on this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.” While the amendment expanded the categories of gun rights, the text's final words are its most important part. McDonald and Heller remained somewhat cagey in specifying the jurisprudential standard with which courts should interpret infringements. By adopting the extremely restrictive strict scrutiny standard, Louisiana seems to be charting the way in the hope that the Heller majority does the same.         "
"30","In addition, four states—Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, and Wyoming—voted on hunting rights provisions endorsed by the National Rifle Association's (NRA's) legislative wing and which critics see as potential backdoor gun rights protections.61 Such amendments have been appearing since Alabama's Amendment 597 in 1996, with four also appearing on the ballot in 2010. (Arizona rejected its amendment, while Arkansas, South Carolina, and Tennessee passed them with massive 80 percent plus supermajorities.) However, these appear to be preemptive and plausibly movement building, rather than speaking to any current or even prospective controversy around the Constitution. Like Kelo, guns are an area where national conservative groups largely succeeded in using quasi‐federal state amendments to reinterpret the U.S. Constitution. As a result, in most states, they have reached a point of diminishing returns such that non‐controversial, largely redundant hunting rights are all that is left to pass.         "
"31","As California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act made their way through the judiciary—with the Supreme Court considering Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor—citizens in several states again considered whether to include (or extend) same‐sex marriage as a fundamental constitutional right.62"
"32","Strictly speaking, most of these amendments have not been in response to federal judicial activity on behalf of gay marriage but in response to state courts, thus making them somewhat different than some of the other issue areas considered here.63 Although not yet pitched as correcting the U.S. Supreme Court due to its hesitation, this issue nonetheless looks similar to the mobilization of other quasi‐federal amendments, with assistance from outside state groups and a willingness to push back on judicial decision making. Indeed, anti‐gay marriage amendments to state constitutions have led to claims, most notably by Gerald Rosenberg, that judicial activity in the field has on the whole been counterproductive to the movement for same‐sex marriage equality.64 That relationship remains contested, but what is clear is that state judicial decisions have clearly bled into a conversation on federal constitutionalism and equal protection, as DOMA in 1996, the discussion of a “federal marriage amendment” in 2004, and the recent cases attest. Assistance from and mobilization by out‐of‐state groups generated a good deal of controversy in each of those political battles. Moreover, as Thomas Keck argues in resisting Rosenberg's backlash account, an overly narrow focus on gay marriage neglects the broader constitutional conversations—including the Supreme Court's sodomy decision in 2003—which suggests that a judicially involved dialogue on equality has been a net winner for lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender individuals.65 In short, the state constitutional battle over marriage has been a prospective effort (like guns), blurring state and federal constitutionalism.         "
"33","The year 2012 marked a potential turning point in the popular constitutionalism of gay marriage, arguably the most significant since 2004. In separate elections last year, two states, North Carolina and Minnesota, considered constitutional proposals to block gay marriage. Although some speculated that North Carolina's narrow vote for Barack Obama in 2008 suggested a realignment toward a more progressive politics, its voters easily approved the measure in a May special election. Minnesota's narrow defeat of a gay marriage ban, however, made it the first state to block one.66 Three other states (Maine, Maryland, and Washington) also voted on initiatives and referenda to extend or confirm statutory approval of same‐sex marriage; all three passed. While it is possible that the recent court decisions will intensify conservative backlash, as Rosenberg would predict, for now it seems the electorate's heretofore solid consensus against applying equal rights logic to gay marriage may be dissipating.         "
"34","Although Chief Justice John Roberts's decision to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act seemed to foreclose further judicial challenge, voters in several states remained unmoved by the Court's pronouncement and proceeded to ratify constitutional protests against it nonetheless.67 Continuing a trend begun shortly after the bill's passage, when Arizona and Oklahoma passed amendments protesting health insurance mandates, in the last two elections, four other states considered changing their state's fundamental law to go on the record against the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 68 Even though the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the U.S. Constitution makes such amendments and declarations functionally useless, supporters still have insisted on ratifying them to protest what they see as usurpation of federal authority beyond its enumerated powers.         "
"35","In 2011, Ohio voters debated whether to change Article 1, Section 21 of the state's constitution to include a clause holding that “No federal, state, or local law or rule shall compel, directly or indirectly, any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in a health care system.” Backers, including Attorney General Mike DeWine, conceded that it would be symbolic rather than functional in challenging President Obama's recent health care bill, but they insisted it was important to go on the record anyway. While the case worked its way up federal dockets, Ohio's voters made their statement, approving the amendment by an almost two to one margin.69"
"36","Even after the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) received a judicial imprimatur (at least on tax grounds), legislators in three other states wanted their constituencies to similarly assert their constitutional interpretation. As in Ohio, backers in these other states conceded the essentially symbolic nature of the protests, but they insisted that the importance of attacking Obamacare by any means possible made it worth doing.70 Citizens in Wyoming and Alabama concurred, with strong majorities in both voting to ratify their protest months after NFIB v. Sebelius. Florida voters, however, added the health care amendment to the state's 2012 amendment graveyard, killing eight of their eleven proposed amendments, including the three discussed in this piece. By a 48‐52 margin (requiring a supermajority of 60 percent to pass), Floridians became the first to refuse ratification of a constitutional protest against the PPACA.71"
"37","Even after Sebelius, state constitutional wrangling and recriminations over the Affordable Care Act will probably continue. In addition to the three amendments above (as well as an analogous Montana statute put to voters), the 2012 election saw voters in Missouri cast ballots in the next ACA battleground: state exchanges. With that statute, Missouri joined the many Republican‐governed states refusing to set up health care exchanges as part of the effort to resist and ultimately cripple President Obama's signature legislation.72 As Devins noted, this major legislation received little constitutional debate in Congress. 73 State legislators consequently seem more than willing to assert constitutional checks where they think their national counterparts failed to do so—and where they think constituents will reward them for picking up the slack.         "
"38","Three states grappled with amendments advanced by the religious right, amendments that would weaken the separation of church and state in two cases and drastically expand freedom of conscience claims in the third. All of these, however, were largely the product of local politicians rather than out‐of‐state groups."
"39","In Florida, voters considered a century‐long debate on the constitutional separation of church and state, as controversy over the “Blaine Amendment” reignited 137 years after Senator James G. Blaine's first effort to crush financial support for religious, and specifically Catholic, institutions. (The ACLU argues that whatever anti‐Catholic bigotry underlay the original Blaine amendment, Florida's 1885 clause did not have similarly Protestant supremacist roots.) While Blaine failed in enacting a federal amendment, most states nonetheless implemented such clauses in their own constitutions, often at the behest of Congress, which required territories to forbid funding to sectarian schools.74 Thus, the text of most state constitutions actually enacts a much stronger barrier between church and state than even the most separationist Supreme Court precedents have required. For example, in 2002, the Supreme Court held that the use of school vouchers at religious schools did not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution.75 Those who agreed with the four dissenters consequently have to turn to state constitutions, while those pleased by the federal decision nonetheless have their hands bound by the so‐called “baby Blaine” amendments.         "
"40","Florida's Amendment 8, dubbed the Religious Freedom Act by its sponsors, would have eliminated the state's no‐aid provision had it passed in 2012. The amendment's senate sponsor argued that the primary motivation was to protect prison ministries, soup kitchens, and other church‐based social services in the face of an ongoing state legal challenge, but he conceded that strengthening the legal case for educational choice was also a possible benefit.76"
"41","Although much of the discussion of Amendment 8 involved the question of vouchers—with teachers' unions opposing the measure as a backdoor school privatization plan—it is unclear whether the removal of the Blaine Amendment would actually help the case for school vouchers at all, or whether it accidentally became a “proxy campaign” obscuring a broader discussion of church and state. While the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, one of the key sponsors behind Amendment 8, has argued elsewhere that Blaine Amendments block vouchers to religious schools (and hence should be repealed), the organization insisted that voucher politics were not at issue in this amendment.77 Florida court cases would seem to bear this out: while the Florida Supreme Court did strike down Governor Jeb Bush's Opportunity Scholarship Program, it did so on grounds that the program violated the uniform school requirement in Article IX, Section 1 of the state's constitution and not the no‐aid‐to‐religion provision. (A lower court had overturned the program on no‐aid grounds, but Florida's justices explicitly disavowed that ruling and relied entirely on the uniformity provision.)78"
"42","Whether necessary to vouchers or not, Florida's Amendment 8 failed, like nearly all of the constitutional amendments on the state's ballot in 2012. If the cases challenging Florida prison ministries go forward and raise the salience of this issue, a more‐precise discussion of the separation of church and state—instead of a scattered, orthogonal conversation on vouchers—may occur. Nonetheless, this amendment is better understand as operating within a long‐established, though now largely inert legacy of federal constitutionalism rather than an ongoing battle."
"43","That is not necessarily the case with other special elections earlier in the year, where voters in Missouri and North Dakota considered the other side of the First Amendment's religious protections, namely free exercise. By a huge, 60 percent margin, Missourians passed an amendment that, in addition to requiring the posting of the Bill of Rights in schools, guarantees the right of adults and state employees to pray on public grounds, of students to pray in schools, and, perhaps most controversially, guarantee that students do not have to “perform or participate in academic assignments or educational presentations that violate his or her religious beliefs.”79 Critics of the amendment argued that most of its principles were already present in both state and federal free exercise clauses and jurisprudence. Where expanded, critics charged, the amendment would functionally lead to constitutional conflicts on establishment grounds (due to officials' prayers), to say nothing of the logistical nightmares from students demanding immunity and exemption from disagreeable information and coursework.80 It is now the law of the land in Missouri; whether it generates the prophesied conflicts between free exercise and establishment remains to be seen.         "
"44","North Dakota voters continued to grapple with the problem of religiously neutral laws burdening religious beliefs and practices, siding with Congress in a long battle with the Supreme Court. In 1990, the justices took a fairly constrained view of free exercise rights, with Employment Division v. Smith holding that free exercise offered no shield against laws written for general applicability and without religious animus.81 Three years later, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which raised the threshold needed to justify incursions into religious practice—in effect, blocking Smith. The Court then struck down the RFRA, contending that Congress had exceeded its authority to implement the Fourteenth Amendment against the states (but not against the federal government itself).82 Sixteen states then passed their own RFRAs, which usually require a compelling government interest and narrowly tailored policies in order to justify substantial burdens on religious practice.83"
"45","North Dakota's proposal however, was far more expansive. Unlike conventional RFRAs, North Dakota's proposed amendment would not have been confined to stopping “substantial burdens” against free exercise but merely incidental burdens. The amendment's text also clarified that “a burden includes indirect burdens such as withholding benefits, assessing penalties, or an exclusion from programs or access to facilities.” Arguably, private religious schools could potentially marshal such expansive language to demand funding earmarked for public schools as well. In short, as Marci Hamilton, the law professor who successfully contested the federal RFRA before the Supreme Court in Boerne, observed, North Dakota's amendment would “unilaterally adjust public policy to fit each religious individual's and organization's worldview.”84"
"46","North Dakota voters agreed with Hamilton's assessment, and overwhelmingly rejected the amendment by a roughly 2‐1 margin. Thus, as with personhood amendments, super RFRAs may advance claims even very conservative electorates find uncomfortably beyond the meaning of current jurisprudence or an appropriate reading of the Constitution's text."
"47","The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC, upholding the right of corporations and unions to air political advertisements, has triggered a constitutional discussion on corporate personhood reaching back to 1886 and forward to 2012.85 Other than its origins from the political left, campaign finance is indistinguishable from more‐typical quasi‐federal amendments: backed by a national movement and explicitly couched in constitutional language, with a strong anti‐Supreme Court pitch. Serving the analogous role of the NRA or Personhood USA, the interest group Common Cause pushed several ballot initiatives aimed at eventually overturning Citizens United, succeeding in getting Amendment 65 on Colorado's ballot in addition to a host of advisory questions on other local ballots.86"
"48","In overwhelmingly adopting Amendment 65, Colorado voters revised both their constitution and their statutes to serve as gestures against money in politics. Article XVIII, Section 1 of their constitution, which had called for voluntary campaign spending limits, now seeks the establishment of mandatory caps, along with statutory instructions to “the Colorado congressional delegation to propose and support, and the Colorado state legislature to ratify, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that allows Congress and states to limit campaign contributions and spending.” 87 In incorporating instructions into Colorado's constitution, Common Cause and the anti‐Citizens United forces followed the strategy of Term Limits USA, which waged a multi‐stage conflict with the federal government in the 1990s by embedding a series of amendments, each replacing the last struck down by courts.88"
"49","In Montana, Democratic Governor Brian Schweitzer and Republican Lieutenant Governor John Bohlinger joined Common Cause in backing the state's equivalent anti‐Citizens United effort, initiative I‐166.89 Earlier in the year, Montana's Supreme Court nominally distinguished Citizens United in rejecting its applicability for state election laws. Excited journalists contended that Montana's justices had “defied” the orders from the Marble Palace in so preserving Montana's strict 1912 law.90 The Supreme Court agreed, rejecting Montana's justices with a terse, single paragraph observing that “Montana's arguments…were already rejected….or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.”91 The state's voters, however, continued to press back, not only approving the initiative by a huge margin but choosing as their next governor Steve Bullock, the attorney general who had vigorously defended the state's campaign laws against Citizens United.92"
"50","Perhaps the most widely covered constitutional clash in 2012 was the ongoing assault on the criminalization of marijuana. It also represents perhaps the most abnormal case: while almost exclusively funded by an outside, national lobbying group (the DC‐based Marijuana Policy Project contributed 60 percent of the lobbying dollars in Colorado, compared to a mere 10 percent raised in‐state), the marijuana amendment was pushed primarily by those on the political left and scrupulously avoided explicit constitutional dialogue and language.93"
"51","In November, Colorado, which already had a 2000 constitutional amendment enabling a medical marijuana program, legalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana and instituted a legal regime akin to alcohol regulations.94 This was in addition to two successful initiatives—a similar decriminalizing statutory initiative in Washington and a more‐limited medical marijuana initiative in Massachusetts. (A medical marijuana initiative failed in Arkansas.) Such efforts continued a slow process first begun in 1996, when California implemented the first medical marijuana program by ballot initiative. Between 1996 and 2010, 13 states passed similar legislation or initiatives, while Nevada joined Colorado in embedding medical marijuana in its constitution.95"
"52","Of course, marijuana continues to be illegal under federal law, with the Obama Department of Justice additionally relying on support from a relatively recent court case. In 2005, Gonzales v. Raich upheld the power of the federal government to bring drug possession charges against individuals holding California medicinal permits. Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia abandoned their usual federalist allies and agreed with the Court's left in vindicating federal power on a 6‐3 vote, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas backing the states' rights challenge to the law. 96 When California voters considered decriminalizing marijuana in 2010, the Obama administration reminded them of Raich's lesson: state legalization did not immunize against federal law.97"
"53","Marijuana activists continued their efforts despite the federal pressure applied in California, though they shied away from advancing states' rights language in the face of Raich. Some effort was nonetheless made to appeal to libertarian‐leaning Republicans on states' rights grounds, with former Republican Representative and presidential candidate Tom Tancredo the most prominent backer in Colorado, but the text itself makes no reference whatsoever to the federal government. Instead, the amendment invokes the language of fiscal prudence, efficient law enforcement, and a passing reference to individual freedom. To some extent, this may be a function of most marijuana activists being political liberals, in this case concerned more with a single issue than a more‐abstracted discussion on the allocation of powers—where most would presumably favor a strong central government.98"
"54","Strictly speaking, such legalization merely refuses to employ state officials to duplicate and concurrently enforce federal policy, and thus does not rise to the traditional standard of nullification in which state officials proactively resist federal activity.99 One could easily argue that such a policy constitutes a de facto nullification against the spirit of federal laws—a position advanced in the 1920s and 1930s by some Republicans (even anti‐prohibition but nonetheless law‐and‐order ones) who blocked similar repeal of alcohol prohibition laws.100 Even so, the situation is indeed closer to benign neglect than the interjection of state power as conceived in classical nullification theory, nearly implemented in 1832 South Carolina with the tariff, and currently advocated by hardline libertarians.101"
"55","Although the amendment was not primarily waged on states' rights grounds, Coloradans, including conservatives ambivalent about the merits of marijuana legalization, are more strongly embracing such claims after the fact. As noted earlier, Colorado Democrats Diana DeGette and Jared Polis joined eight other Democrats and two Republicans in sponsoring the “Respect States' and Citizens' Rights Act of 2012” to terminate federal enforcement in states that accept marijuana.102 In addition to the libertarian‐leaning Ron Paul, the other Republican to back the bill was Colorado Representative Mike Coffman, who had opposed Colorado's amendment but backed his constituents' right to do so.103 Right‐wing hostility in Colorado Springs and other bastions of traditionalism may not all be transferring into support, but long‐time opponents largely remained on the sidelines.104"
"56","Although federalism was, at best, a second‐order question in the recent 2012 marijuana vote, it is still joining with a broader popular constitutionalist conversation about the extent of federal interstate commerce powers. The Obama administration's response has been decidedly mixed; the President has suggested that enforcing the Controlled Substances Act in decriminalizing states is “not a priority” but observed that he has to enforce a law until Congress modifies it. Federal attorneys have continued to enforce it, although Washington's governor claims to have made fruitful progress in discussions with Attorney General Holder.105 National polls since the 2012 election have started to detect a tension between substantive views on marijuana and beliefs about federalism, with voters opposed to its legalization as a policy matter nonetheless uncomfortable with federal enforcement in decriminalizing states.106 Some influential Republicans show an interest in capitalizing on this trend. Outgoing Republican Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana offered similar sentiments and, though achieving little success, Gary Johnson, the former Republican Governor of New Mexico running on the Libertarian ticket, attempted to rally behind precisely this issue in 2012. Perhaps most significantly, Republican Senator Rand Paul, who has expressed interest in a 2016 presidential run, suggests incorporating a states' rights position on marijuana as part of his broader Republican attack on federal power.107 Other states will probably follow suit in coming elections, keeping the question of marijuana, and federalism more broadly, circulating in public discourse. Indeed, the development of a broader discussion of constitutional powers has developed independently of marijuana backers' wishes. The outgrowth of Colorado's experience reminds us of the basic Madisonian wisdom of low ambition working to advance more‐abstract principles;thus, we should understand selective opportunism as a plausible means to ensure that particular interests strongly vindicate the constitutional order.108"
"57","Elections during the last two years confirm political scientists' intuitions that state actors can be both comfortable with, and sometimes insistent on, a role in national constitutional politics. As scholars have begun to note, state constitutions in general, and state amendments more specifically, serve as sites in which to debate the core principles of the U.S. Constitution. Popular constitutionalists and others who would see extra‐judicial politics as a key part of their interpretive dialogue ought to take particular interest in these single‐issue expositions of constitutional thought."
"58","If not exactly a mythically intense instance of dualist democracy (like the Founding, the Civil War, or the New Deal),109 this interplay between state and federal politics nonetheless offers what is arguably the most realistic and substantive site of constitutional discourse short of these Olympian moments. To be clear: these are not distilled moments of pure and refined discourse. Florida's Baby Blaine discussion had sidetracks in voucher politics, for example. The deliberations on federalism, whether in Arizona's state sovereignty amendment or Colorado's marijuana legalization, would never be mistaken for the Webster–Hayne–Livingston debates.110 However, neither are they the timid, unhappy discourse of congressional politics, in which senators admit to considering “policy issues first, [then getting]… a consensus to pass the bill, six other things, then constitutionality.”111 The personhood amendment triggered a debate that looked more like the Supreme Court's grapplings with Roe than Congress's largely perfunctory stamping of “affects interstate commerce” in the preface of the Guns‐Free School Zone Act after Lopez.112"
"59","Of course only a small minority of state constitutional amendments do involve federal controversy. As Table 1 shows, of the 144 constitutional amendments that appeared on state ballots in 2011 and 2012, roughly one sixth (23) involved federal constitutional questions.113 The vast majority of the remainder are confined within a small set of fairly technical and administrative issues: taxes and bonds, school boards, governmental organization, and gambling. State constitutions thus remain documents of essentially local governance.         "
"60","However, as this discussion has shown, national interest groups have realized that state amendments can influence thinking about the U.S. Constitution. Interest groups and state legislators have not advanced aggressively anti‐Court theories of nullification or a state analog of departmentalism. They do, however insist on responding to the Court in strategically useful ways, indicating that subscribing to basic assumptions of judicial supremacy does not entail judicial fetishism. Stated another way, political actors insist that courts can be challenged, within reason, and from statehouses as well as Congress.114"
"61","Quasi‐federal state amendments serve both agenda‐setting roles (as with the personhood amendments) or as potential signals to courts and Congress (as with the health care protests). Critics of these initiatives might suggest that the effect is primarily to drum up electoral support and turn out the base, especially in swing states.115 That is no doubt true, but, with Florida and its 11 amendments a marked exception, many, if not the majority, of these amendments were in states out of reach for the 2012 election and were sponsored by interest groups far from the good graces of party leaders and strategists. Mississippi Republicans did not exactly need personhood on the ballot to win an off‐year election in 2011—nor did they want it.         "
"62","Instead, state legislative input, while obviously related to position‐taking, may also be a long overdue response to institutional change.116 In the 1930s and 1940s, members of the New Deal court effectively ceased enforcing federalism claims, a change most prominently defended by legal scholar Herbert Wechsler.117 Wechsler instead argued that the political processes would and should remain the primary guarantors of federalism and the implementation of states' interests.118 With the Supreme Court still functionally endorsing the bulk of Wechsler's controversial thesis, it should not be surprising that non‐judicial actors—especially those who may see their interests and ideology most ignored—would eventually forward protest amendments to their constituents.119 The much‐heralded political processes seem to have answered the call implicit in judicial non‐intervention. This does not, of course, mean that state protest is an equally effective way to vindicate state interests, but it is a response that Wechsler's logic would seem to suggest.         "
"63","One lesson that the state constitutional literature has taught is that efforts to draw up a strict conceptual dichotomy between state and federal constitutional discourse, especially on individual and negative rights, is a difficult, if not largely impossible, task. America's liberal heritage and fondness for “rights talk” ensure as much, and thus the discourse from the one often easily bleeds into the other; this is particularly true of issues that achieve the salience of popular constitutionalism.120 (The conceptual difference between federal enumerated powers and plenary state police powers minimizes blurring among positive rights, but even that gap is not impassable. For example, in the 1920s, positive rights provisions at the state level led to wider conversations about whether the federal Constitution did or ought to include such protections.)121 Instead of a stark divide, the relationship between state and federal constitutionalism is arguably something closer to a spectrum, especially in rights conflicts, with the tightness of the relationship conditional on developments in both.         "
"64","By this standard, Obamacare protests are closer to the purely federal side, clearly temporally responsive to developments in Washington, DC and without any discernible controlling effect on internal state politics. Others, especially those seeking to overturn state judicial decisions decided wholly within the confines of the state's constitution, more closely resemble regular domestic affairs like bond issues. Most rights amendments, however, are in the middle—which, though conceptually muddled, actually follows the logic of American constitutionalism; as Madison says of the Constitution's hybrid amendment and ratification processes in The Federalist 39, “We find it neither wholly national nor wholly federal.” In this middle ground would be efforts to resurrect seemingly dormant spheres of constitutional law that would determine policy within states but also serve as potential agenda setting for the federal sphere. (The “super RFRA” amendment proposal is an example of such an agenda‐setting amendment trying to reignite an issue in which the current Supreme Court has shown little interest.)         "
"65","Like the “New Federalists” a generation before, scholars dissatisfied with the direction of national politics have suggested a turn toward state politics and constitutions.122 The recent history of state amendments, however, suggests a theoretical wrinkle resulting from such an approach. Paradoxically, many of these critiques of national governing institutions or states' rights claims that are being embedded in state constitutions are pushed by interstate groups. Thus, in some ways these resemble yet another manifestation of the legal networks centralizing constitutional discourse rather than demonstrations of localist power.123"
"66","Though arguably the two most significant types of amendment (marijuana and Citizens United) came from political liberals during the period under consideration, the majority were conservative. Indeed, some, like North Dakota's super RFRA or Mississippi's personhood amendment, advanced constitutional positions that Antonin Scalia would not defend.124 Unsurprisingly, considering the movement's current professed devotion to constitutional principles, conservatives appear more comfortable with constitutional language framed as explicitly rejecting federal developments—though, again, Citizens United suggests at least some convergence. And, with interest groups and legislators already lining up several such skirmishes for elections in 2014, this dialogue is poised to continue.125"
