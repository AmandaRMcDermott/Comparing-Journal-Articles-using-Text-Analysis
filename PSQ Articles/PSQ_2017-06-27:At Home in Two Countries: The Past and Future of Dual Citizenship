"1","In this book, Peter J. Spiro expands on his earlier works with a tour de force of modern citizenship practices, their normative evaluation, and the repercussions at the international level. The meticulously researched monograph offers a well‐written account of the development of declarations, decisions, and practices over time to allow or disavow dual citizenship. The book complements other recent volumes showing that countries increasingly embrace multiple citizenship, such as Thomas Faist and Peter Kivisto's Dual Citizenship in Global Perspective: From Unitary to Multiple Citizenship and David Cook‐Martín's The Scramble for Citizens: Dual Nationality and State Competition for Immigrants. It also highlights the need to understand the link between dual state membership, individual identification processes, and economic or political behavior.         "
"2","Going beyond legislative and administrative practices, Spiro also looks at the role of public international law, domestic courts, official narratives, public discourses, and the politics of citizenship, which ultimately define the law on the books as much as the law in action. He showcases the difficulties of transposing sociological concepts, such as “divided loyalty,” onto legally enforceable categories, for example, stripping citizens of their citizenship when they move back to their country of origin or vote in another country."
"3","Efforts to ban dual citizenship were originally aimed at reducing the influence of foreign governments rather than dual citizens’ sentiments of dual belonging. Limiting dual citizenship often protected citizens who would otherwise be harassed by their countries of origin to fulfill military duties. However, with changes in conscription practices, the waning of explicit duties of citizens toward their country of citizenship, and more transnationally active people, the underlying arguments against dual citizenship crumbled. Spiro shows that “beneath the loyalty verbiage” (p. 58), there are smaller, technical problems that can be easily addressed in today's world. Arguing against simplistic notions of competing allegiances, he stresses individuals’ loyalties to religions, ethnic communities, and families that may rank higher than loyalties to a state. Although Spiro's argument about national and social identifications is convincing, these claims would have benefited from a stronger foundation in social psychology and social identity theory."
"4","Relevant for current debates, Spiro elaborates on investor citizenship and dual nationals as security threats. The focus on “dual citizen terrorists” is not warranted because “counter‐terror cultures don't map well onto a dual citizenship frame” and loyalties are not constructed along a citizenship axis (p. 77). In a chapter on diaspora citizenship, Spiro highlights why emigrants are often interested in maintaining legal membership in their country of (ancestral) origin, while acquiring citizenship in countries of residence is a practical and normative imperative for many to safeguard their rights and be full members of their societies."
"5","Importantly, based on the freedom of association and liberal autonomy values, Spiro argues for an individual right to acquire and maintain dual citizenship (Chapter 7). This follows from the interest of individuals and the lack of compelling state interest to inhibit or restrict such a status. At Home in Two Countries is a compelling study of dual citizenship that is relevant for citizenship scholars and broader audiences alike. While the book mentions international diaspora citizenship practices, one limitation is its overall focus on the United States. With over 70 percent of the world's countries accepting dual citizenship, future works should also include in‐depth analyses of countries in the Global South, which are not only countries of origin but also increasingly countries of destination.
