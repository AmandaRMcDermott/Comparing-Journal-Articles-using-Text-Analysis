"1","OVER THE PAST DECADE AND MORE, observers of contemporary Chinese society and politics have noted a growing credibility gap in that country. While the faith of ordinary Chinese in the virtuous intentions of their central government in Beijing has remained high, popular attitudes toward sub‐provincial governments have been marked by widespread and growing anger and distrust.1 In this article, we examine a key source of the growing frustration and alienation experienced by substantial numbers of Chinese citizens with the agencies of local governance: the rise of powerful patronage networks involving local government officials, and newly affluent entrepreneurs, investors, and developers. Acting in concert, members of these patron–client networks work to exploit loopholes in the regulatory mechanisms that govern market‐driven economic activity. In so doing, they seek to advance their own private interests, often with little evident concern for the common weal.2 In the view of some prominent Chinese public intellectuals, such unholy clientelist alliances constitute a serious and growing threat to the stability and potential survival of the Chinese Communist regime.3 While acknowledging that this same regime has successfully engineered macro‐economic growth averaging 10 percent annually over the last three decades, this article focuses on the problematic micro‐societal byproducts of that success, many of which, by the regime's own admission, have caused widespread popular alienation, thereby undermining the country's socio‐political stability.4 The existence of a perverse but well‐entrenched incentive structure that rewards a “growth‐at‐all‐costs” mentality on the part of local officials is not, we argue, likely to be effectively remedied absent systemic reforms that sharply increase the accountability of local officials to their grassroots constituents.         "
"2","Contrary to classical democratic political theory, patron–client relationships are near‐universal, existing across the entire spectrum of regime types.5 However, their particular forms and functions may vary greatly across time and place, with widely differing consequences for the political systems they inhabit.6 Stripped to its bare essentials, clientelism exists whenever two or more actors (or groups of actors) of unequal political status engage in an informal, extra‐legal pattern of voluntary, particularistic exchange in which public resources are traded for private benefits.7 In a democracy, such particularistic exchanges often take the form of a politician–patron granting special favors (such as political access, jobs, or legislative sponsorship) to a small, exclusive subset of citizen–clients in exchange for the latter's support, either electoral, financial, or organizational.8 In an authoritarian system such as China, on the other hand, a semi‐marketized economy coexists with a powerful one‐party administrative state. In the absence of competitive elections, patron–client relationships tend to involve alliances between appointed local government officials, who have the authority to allocate scarce (and hence potentially valuable) administrative resources, such as commercial licenses, zoning variances, and land development permits, and entrepreneurs seeking preferential access to such resources. In recent years an unflattering label has been attached to such state‐centered, semi‐marketized clientelism: “crony capitalism.”9"
"3","On a one‐time basis, such informal, extra‐legal exchanges—generally in the form of gifts or material benefits offered in consideration for favorable official dispensations—are commonly labeled “bribes.” In contrast, the defining characteristic of a patron–client bond is its entrained quality, involving ongoing mutual expectations of diffuse reciprocity, rather than narrow, one‐off quids‐pro‐quo. While bribery is a simple transaction, clientelism requires what the Chinese refer to as guanxi—an ongoing “relationship.” Like bribery, however, clientelism is frequently classified as a form of corruption, since its benefits are normally allocated to individuals preferentially, in violation of universalistic legal and administrative norms.10 Depending on the particular incentive structures involved, clientelism may either be pro‐developmental or predatory in nature, growth‐enhancing or parasitic in effect. But it always involves officials tilting the playing field to favor some players over others.11"
"4","Variations in the form and function of clientelism arise due to the wide variety of political institutions encountered in the contemporary world.12 What makes the Chinese case so interesting is that its dominant pattern—which we have termed “local commercialized clientelism”—differs substantially from those encountered in other Asian states, both democratic and authoritarian. In China, the absence of any meaningful electoral mechanism, either national or local, means that clientelist networks are essentially unchecked by the need for acceptance by ordinary citizens.13 Unlike electoral authoritarian regimes elsewhere in Asia (such as contemporary Singapore, Taiwan before 1992, South Korea before 1988, and the Philippines before 1986), where a modicum of political responsibility and accountability has flowed from the existence of semi‐competitive elections within a centralized dominant‐party state, in Chinese regional and local governments, whose leading officials are appointed from above rather than elected from below, are essentially free to ignore the vox populi. Although there exist legislative bodies—people's congresses—at every level of Chinese government, they are indirectly elected, under Communist Party leadership, and do not “represent” popular constituencies in any meaningful sense. So long as they meet or exceed their assigned economic growth, tax, birth control, and investment targets, and manage to avoid the destabilizing effects of mass social or political unrest, local officials need not be overly responsive to the quotidian concerns of their constituents in order to keep their jobs or secure promotion.14"
"5","Clientelism itself is hardly new in post‐reform China. In the Maoist era, “neo‐traditional” patron–client relations were embedded in the ubiquitous danwei (work unit) system. Under this system, managers of state‐owned enterprises controlled virtually every aspect of the working life of their employees—including task and work‐shift assignments, housing allocations, and distribution of ration coupons needed to procure food, clothing, and cooking oil, inter alia. Managers could also protect employees from criticism—or alternatively, single them out for it—during periodic mass political campaigns.15"
"6","Within each danwei, workers were in a situation of “organized dependency” vis‐à‐vis enterprise managers. Although they enjoyed an “iron rice bowl”—that is, guaranteed lifetime employment and welfare benefits—workers' lives could be made considerably easier or more difficult by the discretionary actions of their managers. But managers, too, were vulnerable. Disgruntled employees could institute a work slowdown, or perform shoddy workmanship, or—even more serious—commit acts of willful sabotage. In such cases, managers would be held responsible for their failure to meet monthly production quotas and quality control standards. This could result in a “black mark” being entered in their official dossiers, leading to criticism and possible disciplinary action by higher‐level authorities.16 Because such an outcome could seriously jeopardize their career prospects, a tacit clientelist bargain emerged: danwei managers would treat workers paternalistically, while workers would undertake to be reliable and cooperative. Since workers and managers alike were assigned to a particular enterprise at the pleasure of the state, often for life, and could not voluntarily change either the place or the terms of their employment, they were essentially locked into a situation of lifelong mutual dependence; and it was thus in the interest of all parties concerned to display cooperativity and reciprocity.17"
"7","A similar situation characterized the agricultural sector in the Maoist era, with village cadres controlling the job assignments, work‐point assessments, and communal welfare benefits available to the peasants in rural jurisdictions. In return, cadres were dependent upon peasants to fulfill higher‐level production and grain‐delivery quotas. In normal times, this fostered a relationship of mutual dependence and reciprocity between cadres and villagers. But in times of exceptional hardship, such as the Great Leap Forward, when village cadres faced higher‐level demands for dramatically increased crop yields, local cadres were forced to either coerce the peasants or face harsh criticism and discipline from above."
"8","In post‐reform China, such neo‐traditional danwei patronage has disappeared. Under Deng Xiaoping's market reforms, workers gained greater socioeconomic and personal freedoms; but in so doing they gave up the security they enjoyed in the era of danwei socialism. By smashing the “iron rice bowl,” marketization fundamentally transformed management–labor relations in China. With managers coming under mounting pressure to operate efficiently and profitably in a competitive marketplace, workers were stripped of their managerial patronage and forced to work harder simply to keep their jobs.  Upwards of 35 million industrial workers were laid off in the industrial restructuring that occurred between 1998 and 2001—the single largest wave of layoffs in modern Chinese history. The result was a leaner, meaner workplace, one in which ordinary workers were essentially unprotected from the Darwinian effects of market competition, while managers, in turn, were only as safe as the black ink on their latest balance sheets.18 In this connection, it is interesting to note that many older Chinese workers, having experienced a transition to the high‐stakes, dog‐eat‐dog world of competitive enterprise profit maximization in the post‐reform era, have expressed a nostalgic preference for a return to the days of secure, low‐wage neo‐traditional clientelism.         "
"9","Along with the abolition of danwei patronage, China's post‐Mao reformers also abolished the traditional Maoist campaign style of mass political mobilization. Designed to generate popular enthusiasm for the principles and policies of the Chinese Communist Party, mass campaigns in the pre‐reform era—from land reform in the early 1950s to the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s—were periodically used to launch new policy initiatives and to conduct “criticism and struggle” campaigns against putative “class enemies.”19 Though such populist movements were carefully orchestrated by higher‐level authorities, and hence were non‐democratic, they nonetheless amplified the voices of otherwise‐disenfranchised workers and peasants, thereby providing an incentive for local officials to pay at least a modicum of attention to the weal and woe of the masses—lest they themselves be singled out for future criticism and “rectification.”         "
"10","In addition to periodic mass campaigns, Maoist doctrine also emphasized the “mass‐line” style of leadership, which enjoined Party and government officials to pay close attention to the welfare and working conditions of ordinary workers and peasants. To ensure close rapport between elites and masses, cadres at all levels were required to spend a substantial part of their time laboring alongside workers and peasants on the “front lines” of production, rather than sitting comfortably in their offices issuing orders.20"
"11","With the advent of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978–1979, the Party's mass line leadership method fell into desuetude, while the campaign style of direct, populist mass mobilization was officially renounced as chaotic and destructive. Although widely hailed as a victory for “rational” policy implementation, the abandonment of the mass line and mass campaigns was not accompanied by the introduction of any new democratic participatory mechanisms. Under these circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that in many parts of China, the common people or laobaixing (lit: “old hundred names”) have openly displayed nostalgia for the “good old days” of mass movements.21"
"12","Just as marketization did away with the twin systems of danwei patronage and grassroots populism, additional forces were at work that substantially transformed the political economy of elite–masses relations in China. Early in the post‐Mao era, reform leaders decided to radically decentralize the central government's traditional monopoly on the ownership and management of state assets—including land, housing stock, industrial plants, and equipment. Under the decentralization measures initiated by Premier Zhao Ziyang, regional and local governments gained substantial discretionary authority over the allocation and commercial valuation of state assets within their geographical jurisdictions, along with the right to regulate local economic activity.         "
"13","In the interest of stimulating local economic innovation, creativity, and experimentation, the central government in the 1980s abandoned its traditional practice of appropriating all locally collected commercial and industrial revenues, allowing regional and local governments to retain a significant portion for themselves.22 Under the pre‐reform socialist “command economy,” the central government had extracted all fiscal revenues and, in return, provided funding for government operations at all levels—an arrangement that had the well‐known effect of discouraging local economic initiative. Now, in exchange for the right to retain a share of local revenues, local governments were required to assume major responsibility for financing their own budgetary outlays—including payroll obligations, administrative expenses, and the provision of basic public goods and services. In this manner, regional and local governments entered into a utilitarian bargain with the center: in exchange for localities paying their own way, they gained substantially greater control over their own economic operations, performance, and profits.23 Such a decentralization was so substantial that some China observers labeled the Chinese central–local government relation as “federalism in Chinese style.”24"
"14","To encourage local entrepreneurship and innovation, the center allowed local governments to experiment with a wide variety of growth‐inducing economic arrangements. As long as the key quantitative success indicators—such as gross domestic product (GDP) growth, tax revenues, and new commercial investment—continued to trend significantly upward, and social stability and low birth rates were maintained in the process, the central government did not concern itself with closely scrutinizing just how these results were obtained. Particularly in poor rural and interior areas of the country, this “growth above all” mentality soon led to the studied neglect of such non‐economic success indicators as environmental quality, public health, education, welfare, and even social justice.25 By delegating the authority to oversee and supervise local governments to provincial and county‐level bodies, whose own merits were gauged primarily by their success in accelerating local economic growth, fiscal revenues, and new investment, central leaders unwittingly contributed to the problem of runaway clientelism. Over time, as these local networks of collusive interests became deeply entrenched, central authorities found it extremely difficult to reestablish their once‐formidable “top‐down” capacity to exercise command and control over local governments.         "
"15","With local officials transformed for the first time into economic stakeholders by the Deng‐Zhao reform policies, they had a strong incentive to enter into close working relationships with local entrepreneurs, investors and developers—people with the skills, ingenuity, and resources needed to make economic growth happen. Many officials became entrepreneurs themselves. With the accumulation of private capital having been de‐stigmatized in the early 1980s (“To get rich is glorious,” went one well‐known slogan of the time), such people acquired a new veneer of social legitimacy, along with a degree of political influence proportionate to their expanding wealth. The result was the rise of local clientelist coalitions built around mutually beneficial relations—or guanxi—between governmental patrons and their entrepreneurial clients. Through the formation of such relationships, entrepreneurs benefitted by gaining privileged access to favorable administrative dispensations—including preferential allocation of business licenses, land use permits, and the relaxation of certain growth‐inhibiting regulations such as zoning rules and clean air and water requirements. In return, local officials benefitted by collecting rents off of favorable administrative decisions—rents that included gifts, kickbacks, and a variety of non‐monetized favors.26"
"16","With the commercialization of the economy in the 1980s, the economic stakes for the various parties involved in such clientelist networks were raised dramatically. Before 1979, all land and industrial and commercial property in China belonged to the state (or its rural surrogate, the people's commune), and real property could not be bought, sold, rented, or otherwise alienated. In such a situation, land, factories, and equipment had no market value whatever. With the onset of economic reform, however, the commodification of property was accompanied by a rapid—indeed staggering—inflation of land and asset values. Today in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Xiamen, tracts of marginal farmland that were neglected or planted in low‐value paddy rice just 25 years ago have been developed for industrial construction or high‐rise office and luxury housing complexes, fetching prices as high as ¥20,000–¥30,000 (US $3,000–$4,500) per square meter on local real estate markets. By constructing multi‐story, high‐density commercial and industrial projects on reclaimed farmland or rezoned residential property, developers can get rich, and local officials can prosper both directly, through the collection of taxes and rents, and indirectly, through higher local economic growth rates, which translate into enhanced career mobility prospects."
"17","Acting alone and on their own behalf, entrepreneurs cannot operate effectively in an incompletely marketized economy. Requiring a steady stream of official permits, licenses, and exemptions, along with a generous helping of bureaucratic “benign neglect,” local entrepreneurs need well‐placed governmental patrons to help them exploit market loopholes, reduce uncertainty, discourage dissent, and smoothly navigate the pathways to profitable investment. If kickbacks, gifts, and “cumshaw” (literally: thank‐you money) are exchanged along the way, these are simply essential costs of doing business, as Margaret Pearson agrees.27 In this and other respects, commercialized clientelist networks have become instruments of symbiotic mutual empowerment.28"
"18","This mutual empowerment has been analyzed from the distinct but closely related approach of “corporatism,” which was a key to China's developmental success, especially in the early reform period.29 Jean Oi's “local state corporatism” model, for example, argues that rural governments at the county and township levels played a major role in coordinating and directing the operations of economic enterprises within their jurisdictions, acting as diversified business corporations.30 This “local” characteristic is critical to distinguish Chinese corporatism from that of other East Asian NICs (newly industrialized countries) such as Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, where the central state played the principal coordinating and regulatory roles.31 In China, through local state corporatism, officials and entrepreneurs formed mutually dependent and interpenetrated patron–client networks whose potency derived from the nexus between political authority and economic resources.32 The very tightness of this nexus in the local clientelist version of corporatism tends to foster “the proliferation of quasi‐autonomous (and potentially corrupt) local economic empires.”33"
"19","This type of local clientelism, while arguably new to China,34 is not particularly unique in the modern world. As noted earlier, what makes Chinese‐style commercialized clientelism distinctive, and of particular interest to students of comparative political economy, is the lack of a meaningful electoral mechanism that serves to hold officials accountable to their constituents, thereby constraining local elites to be at least minimally responsive to the needs and concerns of the laobaixing. Without an electoral mechanism, there is little incentive for national elites to establish “thorough” vertical patronage networks linking them with local mass constituencies.35"
"20","Although China has had semi‐competitive elections at the village level since 1987, these do not promote long‐chain clientelist alliances linking national elites to local constituencies. This is true for several reasons. For one thing, these elections do not affect the choice of village Party branch secretary, who is appointed from above, and who is the most powerful figure in the village. Second, the village is not an official unit of government, but rather an informal subunit of the township, and its elected leaders do not hold governmental appointments. Real power resides with township officials, who are unelected and who control village finances. Finally, while there may be some limited competition in elections for village chief, no organized campaigning is permitted, and candidates are carefully screened by the local Communist Party branch. For all these reasons, village elections do not provide the type of “enhanced accountability” that one finds in other electoral authoritarian regimes."
"21","By contrast, in electoral authoritarian regimes such as contemporary Singapore, Vietnam since 2002, South Korea in the 1970s and '80s, and Taiwan in the 1980s and early '90s, the fortunes of national elites have been largely tied to the satisfaction of the needs of local mass constituencies through the device of vertical clientelist networks—or “political machines”—that operate to deliver votes in exchange for party patronage. The top‐down flow of such patronage, in turn, helps to insulate the dominant party against successful electoral challenges from rival parties."
"22","Prior to the late 1980s and early 2000s, respectively, authoritarian regimes in South Korea and Taiwan had, like China, experienced both impressive developmental success and political problems caused by local elites' exploitation of vulnerable masses. Unlike China, however, they had long held semi‐competitive elections at multiple levels of local and national government, which engendered more‐extensive “thorough” top‐down patron–client networks. The more competitive elections in these two regimes, the more bargaining power and state resource allocation for the mass constituencies. Both of these regimes, however, were ultimately fatally weakened by the rise of nationwide elite‐led mass opposition movements. The opposition was partly channeled by existing electoral institutions and top‐down clientelist networks (or political machines), which provided opportunities for extensive elite–mass interaction and created an institutional foundation for challenges to the ruling party and regime. In the case of China, the absence of semi‐competitive elections and the vertical clientelist networks they engender makes it all the more difficult for dissatisfied political elites to mobilize popular support to take advantage of popular discontent and challenge the ruling party's hegemony. And this, in turn, helps to explain why no significant democratic challenge to the dominance of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has arisen in China since the Tiananmen disturbances of 1989—despite the dramatic rise in local incidents of mass social protest since the early 1990s."
"23","A more intriguing comparison with the situation in China can be drawn from the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) regime. Even though the CCP regime and the VCP regime share many characteristics as post‐totalitarian developmental regimes, they diverge in terms of political participatory institution. To be sure, compared with previous South Korea, Taiwan, and current Singapore, both have been closer to “non‐electoral” authoritarian regimes than to typical electoral authoritarian regimes. Unlike the CCP, however, in 1992, the VCP introduced the semi‐competitive National Assembly election and has been enforcing it ever since. This election is severely controlled, which gives limited voting power to citizens, but its influence on national and local politics became meaningful and has grown quickly. With this voting power, the Vietnamese peasants and workers have more influence on local politics, where local officials and their entrepreneurial clients are more likely to be constrained than are their Chinese counterparts by including the masses into the local clientelist networks, as witnessed in other electoral authoritarian regimes."
"24","The gradual increase of this Vietnamese National Assembly's capabilities roughly parallels and has exceeded similar developments in China's National People's Congress. There is controlled but meaningful competition in this nationwide popular election. In total, there were 493 delegates, who were elected from a total pool of 876 candidates in 2007. An unprecedented 12 centrally nominated candidates lost bids for election, which shows some of the risks involved in opening up the National Assembly to direct election. Even the Party General Secretary, the President, the Prime Minister and almost all of the government ministers are also subject to the election, and their election totals are published publicly.36 This gives Vietnam a far more competitive system than China, which still does not allow direct election of National and Provincial People's Congresses, not to mention the almost meaningless competition in county and township counterparts. The VCP regime's participatory structure has become less “compartmentalized” than the CCP regime as we explain below. Some observers argue that the divergence of participatory structure has caused the divergence of “inequality” in China and Vietnam.37 One of the reasons for less inequality in Vietnam stems from its semi‐competitive elections, which provide the mass constituents with some “check and balance” capacity in local politics. In a similar vein, this semi‐competitive election tends to force local elites to include ordinary citizens in local clientelist networks.         "
"25","In the absence of nationally integrated vertical patronage networks with their grass‐roots electoral constituencies, local clientelist networks in China are free to pursue their own immediate agendas. If that involves evicting people from their homes to make way for a new real‐estate development, or ignoring egregious industrial pollution, or allowing unsafe, illegal mining ventures to operate, or enlisting police (or even private thugs) to intimidate refractory local residents who resist such behavior, then so be it. As long as tax revenues, investments, and growth rates continue to rise, and organized protest is kept under control, it matters little, in political terms, whether local clientelist coalitions behave as paternalistic benefactors or rapacious predators. This is not to say that all such coalitions are entirely self‐regarding and neglectful of the common weal. Some are not.38 It is only to say that existing incentive and oversight mechanisms are skewed in such a way as to permit—indeed encourage—local disregard for the central government's oft‐stated goals of justice, equity, benevolence and social harmony. It is not for nothing that government officials at the grass‐roots level are often referred to in China as “local emperors” (tuhuangdi) or “local snakes (ditushe).”39 who are beyond the reach of the Center.         "
"26","The Chinese government officially admits that substantial numbers of local emperors at the basic level of society—village party secretaries and village committee chiefs—have been criminally complicit in various acts of malfeasance. In 2008 alone, 1,739 village party secretaries and 1,111 village committee chiefs were arrested.40 According to the Supreme People's Procuratorate, such people were responsible for 42.4 percent of rural economic corruption.         "
"27","Understanding how this system evolved, and how it operates, will help us comprehend some of the more‐puzzling political outcomes of China's “reform and opening” (gaigekaifang) policies of the last three decades—including the dramatically rising incidence of civil unrest and “mass disturbances” since the early 1990s, which occurred despite China's “miraculous” double‐digit economic growth. It may also help us answer such persistent questions as: Why does China's authoritarian system display such great resilience?41 And why hasn't China's emergent bourgeoisie been an agent of democratic change, as Barrington Moore, Samuel Huntington, and others predicted?42"
"28","Given the absence of semi‐competitive elections, one key to the enduring potency of local clientelist coalitions in the reform era is their location in China's rigidly compartmentalized, two‐tier system of authoritarian political participation. In this system, the upper participatory tier is reserved exclusively for socioeconomic elites (successful entrepreneurs, developers, merchants, investors, higher intellectuals, and other “local notables”) who have been co‐opted by the local state with offers of sponsored membership in local people's congresses, political consultative conferences, and various other prestigious “united front” advisory and consultative bodies. Since 2001, members of the upper tier of local entrepreneurial elites have also benefitted from an open invitation to join the Chinese Communist Party.43 Such political connections—and the informal “old boy networks” they engender—serve to shield clientelist networks from unwanted political scrutiny.         "
"29","The second, lower tier of political participation is reserved exclusively for the laobaixing, and consists, inter alia, of the right to take part in narrowly circumscribed village committee elections, the right to petition higher authorities for the redress of grievances, and the right to sue malfeasant local officials in court, under the Administrative Litigation Law of 1990. But as Thomas Bernstein, Xiaobo Lü, and others have clearly shown, the existence of such legal rights has not been translated into an effective institutional check on local clientelist power or excess. For one thing, as mentioned above, village elections do not affect local power relations or resource allocations at the township level—which is the lowest level of formal government in China; for another, complaints and petitions submitted to higher‐level “letters and visits” offices only infrequently receive conscientious consideration. For the most part, they are either sloughed off or dealt with peremptorily.44 As for those petitioners who travel to provincial capitals, or even as far as Beijing, to register their grievances in person, the reward for being a whistle‐blower not infrequently involves being detained and roughed up in an extra‐legal “black jail.”45"
"30","By their very nature, these two distinct tiers of political participation are walled off and mutually insulated from one another. While community elites of the upper tier enjoy close relations with local officials, the atomized masses of the lower tier lack effective governmental access. Politically unrepresented and voiceless, they are unable to effectively articulate their collective interests; consequently, they are vulnerable to a variety of tactics—both instrumental and coercive—designed to dissuade them from appealing to higher political or legal authority. Time and again one reads press accounts of how local police and their unofficial plainclothes auxiliary, the famously thuggish chengguan (lit: “urban enforcement personnel”) are enlisted to protect the vital interests of corrupt clientelist networks against the threat of popular criticism or challenge.46 In the absence of integrative, top‐down patronage networks fostered by semi‐competitive national elections, the cellular compartmentalization of the local polity largely excludes the laobaixing from meaningful participation in politics. And in the absence of such participation, it is extremely difficult to hold local officials accountable for their behavior, even for not providing clientele spoils and pork barrel to the constituencies. To the extent that localized clientelist networks are able to achieve accelerated economic growth by harnessing the power of the state to the resources and know‐how of local entrepreneurs, the clientelist exchanges are arguably “not such a bad bargain,” at least in the early stages of development, since “clientelism can be one important mechanism for securing transactional benefits from the state.”47"
"31","While reliable data on politically sensitive issues are extremely difficult to come by in China, a good deal of anecdotal evidence supports the conclusion that a major reason for lack of trust in local government is the widespread perception of rampant collusion, corruption, and organized criminality among local officials and their commercial‐entrepreneurial clients. In recent years there has been a virtual epidemic of incidents involving angry crowds of township and village residents verbally confronting and even physically assaulting local officials and police in response to egregious acts of illegal land seizure, rampant industrial pollution, illegal (and often deadly) mining operations, naked acts of fiscal extortion and predation, wrongful detention, and police brutality. Within less than two decades, the frequency of such “mass disturbances” has risen eighteen‐fold in China, from 8,300 in 1993 to over 180,000 in 2010; by the same token, between 1994 and 2005, the number of “collective petitioners” protesting local governmental behavior rose from 1.6 million to almost 10 million annually.48"
"32","Such a striking rise of mass dissatisfaction, however, has not served to precipitate the formation of any organized national, or even regional, resistance movement. We hypothesize that the absence of organized, metastatic supra‐local resistance is due to a combination of factors, including the regime's strategy of holding local officials responsible for preventing disorder from percolating upward, its habit of severely punishing the leaders of organized protest, and the aforementioned rigid compartmentalization of China's two‐tiered, non‐electorally‐structured participatory system. With supra‐local opposition movements almost impossible to mobilize and organize under such circumstances, popular anger seldom focuses upward on the regime itself—the creator and enforcer of the entire system—but instead is directed downward toward unscrupulous local officials, an outcome that evidently suits the Center well, absolving it of ultimate responsibility for local injustice."
"33","Although the available data suggest that most Chinese people currently give the central government credit for the country's remarkable economic growth, as well as high marks on such traditional criteria of good governance as responsiveness, fairness, and “concern for people like me,”49 the high and rising levels of distrust displayed toward sub‐provincial and local governments, together with growing popular concern over China's steadily rising income gap between rich and poor, raises serious questions about the ultimate corrosive effect of local clientelist coalitions on regime legitimacy in China.50 Even though ordinary Chinese seem to trust the central leaders in Beijing more than their local counterparts, at least for now, there is reason to believe that the central authorities are losing valuable credibility. Thus, in the immediate aftermath of the disastrous Wenzhou bullet train crash on 23 July 2011, in which 39 people were killed and more than 200 people were injured, tens of thousands of Chinese netizens angrily dismissed the central government's explanation of what caused the crash (faulty signaling equipment, exacerbated by a lightning storm) as a “cover‐up” designed to shield corrupt railway officials.51 Such widespread readiness to accuse the central government of dishonesty and duplicity, not seen in China since the Tiananmen disturbances of 1989, represents something new and potentially destabilizing in Chinese politics.         "
"34","In certain respects, the contemporary Chinese clientelist network is redolent of the medieval European prebend, whereby the Church granted to its local clergy the right to share in the revenues derived from operating a particular cathedral. More generically, prebendalism refers to the practice of incumbents in public office receiving benefices—properties, privileges, or perquisites—tied to their office.52 In China, as recounted by Susan Shirk, a pseudo‐prebendal arrangement emerged in 1978–79 when the central government offered lucrative benefices—including enhanced regulatory autonomy, the right to retain local revenues, and local control over land‐use rights—to regional leaders in exchange for their support of Deng Xiaoping's reform proposals.53 With the consummation of this bargain, provincial and local officials had a powerful incentive to both strongly resist recentralization, which would lessen their newfound autonomy, and oppose electoral reforms, which would give the laobaixing new political leverage vis‐à‐vis powerful local clientelist networks.         "
"35","Given China's administrative and fiscal decentralization, given the commodification of state assets, and especially, given the absence of a meaningful electoral mechanism, local emperors—the Chinese equivalent of medieval European prebendaries—were able to accumulate resources and influence greatly exceeding those of earlier clientelist networks in China. Even central Communist Party leaders have found it difficult to rein in clientelist excesses. Thus, for example, in the fall of 1988, CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang struck fear into the hearts of many officials when he called for a stern crackdown on “guandao” (official racketeering) among the spouses and offspring of state and Party leaders, many of whom had used their official connections to bestow commercial favors on private companies with which they or their families were connected.54 By rewarding officials who are successful in accelerating economic growth, without due regard to the human or social costs of such growth, the regime has privileged wealth over welfare, profitability over propriety. Because of this, China's infamous local emperors have achieved a degree of power and autonomy commensurate with medieval feudal barons and tribal chieftains in some contemporary African states.55 The prebendal prerogatives of local Chinese officials have been additionally reinforced by the aforementioned system of compartmentalized participation, made possible by the absence of semi‐competitive elections, which precludes effective bottom‐up control over their behavior.         "
"36","In the lexicon of political economy, the relationship between central and local governments in a unitary state is that between “principals” and “agents.”56 In theory, principals at the center have the power to monitor and punish unruly or self‐aggrandizing local agents who violate or exceed their mandates. But many empirical studies have documented the difficulties involved in the exercise of tight vertical control—especially in very large, multi‐tiered organizations (and states) possessing several intermediate layers of bureaucracy. Among the better‐known impediments to effective top‐down control are “moral hazard” and “information asymmetry.”57 Moral hazard exists where local agents have their own personal and organizational agendas that are not entirely commensurate with the center's objectives; information asymmetry exists when local agents restrict the vertical flow of information to their principals, cherry picking good news (high growth rates, revenues, and investments, for example) and suppressing bad news (such as illegal appropriation of property, excessive local taxation, pollution‐related health hazards, police brutality, and protest demonstrations, inter alia).         "
"37","By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the problem of out‐of‐control local agents had worsened to the point where senior Communist Party officials openly fretted that the laobaixing in many areas were fast running out of patience with predatory, corrupt local emperors.58 By the end of the 1990s, many Sinologists had come to believe that basic‐level rural government was the weakest and most‐corrupt link in the entire Chinese Communist structure of power; indeed, one seasoned team of skilled Western observers warned that without democratic reforms, rural officials would sooner or later “drive peasants into rebellion.”59 Notwithstanding such dire warnings, however, the spirit of political rebellion has been largely atomized and attenuated by a combination of the trickle‐down effects of economic growth, tight social controls, and the absence of an effective electoral mechanism.         "
"38","In many (if not most) cases, Communist Party officials at the township and village levels have been the chief beneficiaries of devolved administrative and fiscal authority. More powerful than elected village chiefs, village Party secretaries are often among the most‐egregious and unscrupulous local emperors in rural China.60 Although some extraordinary examples of successful economic development can be found in rural areas dominated by powerful village secretaries, in many cases, their successes were achieved by engaging in gross abuses of power.61 In some cases, these most‐local of all local emperors were said to be more vicious than the worst landlords of old.62"
"39","A few random examples from the Chinese press will help to illustrate the arrogance and imperiousness displayed by powerful local officials in China. In Shanxi province, one village Party secretary (and local People's Congress deputy) was apprehended after he brazenly hired 40 thugs to strong‐arm several local merchants into “settling” unresolved business complaints.63 In Anhui province, a notorious “local snake” of a suburban village conspired with a local land developer to forcibly expropriate village land and cheat villagers out of their rightful compensation. Only after the desperate villagers repeatedly petitioned city, provincial, and even central authorities in Beijing was the village head convicted and sentenced to life in prison for various acts of malfeasance, including soliciting 9.6 million yuan in bribes—almost 500 times his annual salary of 20,000 yuan—from his land‐developer client.64 Such incidents have been painfully common in recent years.65"
"40","Above the village level, where the stakes of local commercialized clientelism are higher still, similar patterns of behavior have been widely evident. One rural county Party secretary in Anhui province outraged local residents by openly selling 110 official posts “as if they were cabbages or potatoes.”66 In this and other cases, out‐of‐control party secretaries simply substituted their personal authority for that of the government, in the process pocketing substantial sums of money.67 Making explicit the tacit assumption of personal prebendal rights, a county Party secretary in Henan, well known for his blatant displays of imperious behavior, instructed his subordinates to “Guard well the Party committee. What is the Party Committee? It is I—the Party secretary.”68"
"41","To counter the unchecked power of these local snakes and their clientelist networks, many observers—both inside and outside of China—have strongly urged the adoption of competitive township (and higher‐level) elections.69 From time to time, China's top leaders have appeared on the brink of embracing this idea; but thus far, they have always backed away. Lianjiang Li notes that as early as the 1980s, the rising fear of peasant rebelliousness led a number of senior Party leaders and policy researchers to seriously consider introducing the direct election of township heads. However, owing to the moratorium on all political reform that followed the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, township elections were indefinitely postponed. A handful of unauthorized township elections were held in Sichuan and Guangdong provinces in the late 1990s, but these were isolated cases and were never approved by the central government.70 They obviously understand that the potential negative externalities of higher‐level elections—such as the emergence of cross‐regional opposition coalitions and heightened demands for political freedom, which could be a major threat to regime stability—might well override the positive effects of imposing bottom‐up constraints upon local emperors.71 It looks a sugar‐coated poison to them.         "
"42","Nor are local emperors and snakes an exclusively rural phenomenon. One of the most notorious local powerholders in urban China was Wei Huagui, the former Dongfang city mayor in Hainan province. Wei's ambition and “can‐do” attitude enabled him to rapidly climb the ladder of official success, until he was appointed mayor. He was a very effective developmental leader, and for a considerable time his abusive treatment of local citizens and his corrupt dealings with local entrepreneurs and developers were overlooked by his superiors because of his outstanding track record of promoting economic growth. Eventually, however, the sheer volume of citizen complaints against him forced the regime to remove Wei from office and place him under arrest.72 A similar fate met the ambitious pro‐development mayor of Shenyang, Mu Suixin. Celebrated throughout China for his hard‐driving, take‐no‐prisoners style of municipal leadership, Mu presided over the early stages of Shenyang's economic revival in the late 1990s, making deals with developers and running roughshod over the interests of ordinary citizens. But his personal empire began to crumble when he was discovered to have hidden several million dollars in gold, cash, and jewelry–alleged gifts and kickbacks from his favor‐seeking cronies—inside the walls of his house. Arrested and convicted of corruption in 2001, Mayor Mu died in prison a year later.73"
"43","And in the most egregious case of all, in 2009, virtually the entire Chongqing municipal apparatus, including its police department, was implicated in the operation of a vast mafia‐like criminal operation involving gambling, drugs, prostitution, loan‐sharking, extortion, and murder. By the time the investigation was concluded, over 1,500 people had been arrested, including 14 high municipal officials, and more than a dozen triad gangs were broken up.74 The fact that corrupt, despotic officials like Wei Huagui and Mu Suixin and their counterparts in Chongqing and elsewhere could rapidly climb the promotional ladder and be celebrated as successful role models speaks volumes about both the pathology that has plagued central–local relations in post‐reform China and the prebendal roots of that pathology.         "
"44","To be sure, central principals continuously monitor their local agents. However, such monitoring involves collecting and evaluating data from 34 provincial‐level units and, below them, approximately 300 prefectures, 400 municipalities, 1,600 counties, 7,000 urban districts, 40,000 townships, and 600,000 villages.75 The sheer magnitude of the monitoring task is daunting enough under the best of circumstances, but in China, the circumstances are far from optimal. For one thing, since the advent of reforms, monitoring is seldom done via in‐person investigation, but through the upward electronic transmission of myriad statistical data. In the absence of reliable human checks on the accuracy of such information, statistical fudging—most commonly the reportage of inflated growth claims as well as outright fakery—is not uncommon.76 Given that the center's primary emphasis is on local and regional economic development, it is hardly surprising that most statistical reporting is geared to collecting data on things like infrastructure investment, capital construction, revenue collection, population stability, employment, and of course GDP growth. Although local statistics on such things as labor unrest, “letters and visits” petitions, “mass incidents,” and corruption indictments are routinely compiled and sent upwards, where they tend to show up in provincial statistical yearbooks, they are not, for reasons adduced earlier, normally weighted as heavily as economic indicators in the determination of local governmental success and failure.77"
"45","A second structural factor that tends to impede accurate upward reporting of negative information is China's “one‐level down” system of cadre appointments and dismissals.78 In post‐reform China, all leading regional and local officials, from provincial governors down to township heads, are appointed, promoted, and dismissed on the “one‐level down” principle. That is, they are vetted and selected by personnel offices at the next higher level of government. Under such a system, it would be quite understandable if county officials, for example, hesitated to transmit to their superiors evidence of despotic or predatory behavior on the part of growth‐ and revenue‐maximizing local emperors one step down, at the township level. Such hesitancy is “rational” for two related reasons: first, under the growth‐at‐any‐cost ethos of post‐Mao reforms, minor improprieties in leadership style, ethics, and integrity tend to be overlooked so long as economic results are positive; and second, it would look bad for higher‐level officials—to the point of jeopardizing their own career prospects—to report up the chain of command on the extent and severity of corrupt or inappropriate behavior on the part of their own lower‐level agents.79 In a classic illustration of the hazards of “information asymmetry” in principal–agent relations, we thus find a cascading shroud of silence enveloping each successive two‐tiered governmental diad—from village to township, from township to county, from municipality to prefecture, and so forth.         "
"46","In one important respect, the developmental bargain struck between China's central government and its regional and local state agents is different from the pre‐modern prebendalism encountered in medieval Europe or post‐independence Africa. In the latter cases, so long as benefice holders pledged their fealty to the center and regularly remitted assigned tax quotas, their prebendary rights remained intact. In contemporary China, however, local officials enjoy prebendary rights on a more strictly contingent basis. For as we have noted, they are expected, as a condition of their appointment, to deliver substantial increases in GDP, tax revenues, and investment. The logic of this system creates perverse incentives for local officials to enrich themselves by participating in the profits from “off the books” transactions with local entrepreneurial clients—the so‐called “red capitalists”—while at the same time blocking the laobaixing from equitably participating in the resulting benefits.         "
"47","We have argued in this article that the very structure of China's post‐reform political economy has been conducive to a loss of effective control by the central government over the behavior of many of its local agents. We have identified several factors that have contributed to this situation: radical decentralization; incomplete marketization and asset commodification; a “growth above all” development ethos; an unreliable statistical reporting system that privileges the upward transmission of good news over bad; a personnel system that encourages officials to overlook the shortcomings of their growth‐maximizing subordinates; and perhaps most telling of all, the absence of semi‐competitive elections that elsewhere serve to restrain local emperors. Taken separately, these factors have constituted significant obstacles to effective central control of local agent behavior. In combination, they have served to create and sustain severe structural pathologies within the Chinese political economy."
"48","Conventional modernization theory holds that as an urbanized, entrepreneurial bourgeoisie emerges in the course of economic development, the new middle class will be a force for liberalization and, ultimately, democratization. This comforting theory—encapsulated in Barrington Moore's famous dictum: “No bourgeoisie, no democracy”—has seemingly been turned inside out in contemporary China, where a new bourgeoisie is seemingly thriving without a hint of democratic transition in sight.80 Indeed, as recent research has clearly shown, the more economically successful China's bourgeoisie has become, the more closely it has tied itself, for instrumental reasons, to the existing authoritarian power structure.81"
"49","The key to this apparent anomaly lies, we have suggested, in the perverse institutional incentives that have operated first to create powerful local clientelist networks and then to effectively shield them from higher‐level scrutiny and lower‐level accountability. Notwithstanding periodic central crackdowns on runaway local corruption, despotism, and police brutality, the absence of effective institutional checks on local emperors and their clientelist networks has produced a visibly rising tide of citizen distrust of government, thereby raising troubling questions about the continued legitimacy of Communist Party rule in China."
"50","This situation is not without irony. For even as China's central government continues to enjoy remarkably high levels of apparent popular confidence as a result of unflagging overall economic growth, the situation just beneath the surface, and especially at the grassroots level, has become more perilous. Since 2003, China's top leaders—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—have openly acknowledged that China faces a serious “crisis in governing capacity” (zhizheng nengli de weiji).82 To resolve this crisis, they have pledged to pay greater attention to eliminating corruption, strengthening the rule of law, promoting democratic debate and discussion within the Communist Party, and listening more attentively to the common people. But nowhere have direct popular elections been incorporated into the government's formula for improving local governance.83 Instead, China's leaders have promoted the idea of creating kinder, gentler, more responsive local governments based on the paternalistic neo‐Confucian ideal of a “harmonious society” (hexue shehui).84"
"51","The thrust of this article has been to suggest that notwithstanding such lofty goals, the current crisis in governance is rooted in a pervasive—and fundamentally perverse—developmentalist incentive structure that discourages moderation and self‐restraint while rewarding collusive, socially destructive behavior by self‐aggrandizing local officials and their advantage‐seeking entrepreneurial clients. Such an incentive structure is poorly suited to the provision of good governance. Moreover, it cannot be repaired by repeating well‐meaning moral exhortations or by engaging in periodic displays of central largesse and episodic corruption‐busting campaigns. As long as bad behavior is routinely tolerated, or even rewarded, without being subject to rigorous institutional oversight and control—including, but not limited to, semi‐competitive elections—China's local emperors and their “red capitalist” clients are likely to continue pursuing their own narrow agendas, in the process running roughshod over the interests of the voiceless laobaixing.         "
"52","In the long run, absent meaningful structural reform, the increasing frustration and cynicism of tens of millions of informed, Internet‐linked, cellphone‐wielding citizens, manifested most recently in the remarkable wave of popular disbelief that greeted the Chinese government's initial explanation of the Wenzhou high‐speed train crash, is likely to continue eroding the credibility of the Chinese Communist party‐state. Although long‐term economic growth rates of 10 percent or more have effectively dampened the spread of socio‐political protest since the early 1990s, there is strong evidence that the days of double‐digit, inflation‐free growth are over, and that a more “normal” growth rate of 6 to 7 percent, or perhaps even lower, accompanied by rising inflationary pressures, is likely to prevail in the foreseeable future.85 If such a prolonged slowdown should occur, the regime's ability to continue kicking the can of meaningful political‐structural reform further down the road is likely to diminish sharply. The ensuing question would then be whether the country's leaders, faced with an ongoing erosion of authority, would have the courage to modify their increasingly dysfunctional one‐party power monopoly by introducing greater political accountability, responsibility, and transparency; that is, trading its political monopoly with its effective control over local clientelist coalition via the bottom‐up institutions. To date, there have been few if any indications that such a transformation is in the offing.**"
