"1","Race is a central organizing reality of the United States. Why exactly that is so remains controversial. Taking his cues from the classic texts written on race by Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois, Gunnar Myrdal, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and the Kerner Commission's Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (1968), O'Flaherty aims to answer key questions that emerge and to disentangle contradictory views of how race operates. For example, he asks, “Does race matter today or is it just a proxy for history?” (p. 21). Washington's view, O'Flaherty argues, was the former—race is “a residuum of past events”—whereas Du Bois and the other texts would stipulate that “the events unfolding today [are] amplifying those differences” (p. 21). Four other key questions arise relating to the separation or connection between the spheres of life and which sphere is most important for racial progress, the importance (or not) of interracial friendship and understanding, and the possibility/desirability of an interracial society with a history of racial exploitation. The classic texts differ on their positions with regard to these questions, but they lay a testable foundation for O'Flaherty to explore who got it right."
"2","O'Flaherty poses the question, “What is race?” He distances race from genetics and concludes that “[r]aces are labels that came from history . . . People base their actions on their race and on the races of the people they encounter” (p. 45). This definition of race in many ways discards the history that produced race and its influence on present conditions; perhaps because O'Flaherty takes the centrality of history on racial disparities as an empirical question, this separation was key. Yet sociologist Howard Winant argues that scholars must “recognize the importance of historical context and contingency in the framing of racial categories and the social construction of racially defined experiences” (“The Theoretical Status of the Concept of Race,” in Les Back and John Solomos, eds., Theories of Race and Racism: A Reader [New York: Routledge, 2000]).         "
"3","The Economics of Race in the United States is engagingly written and disarming in tone. O'Flaherty aims to make his reader “emotionally comfortable and intellectually uncomfortable” (p. 4)—and he succeeds. He takes the reader on a journey to discover the economics of race and does not limit his analysis to a discussion of the relationship of race to discrimination or poverty. Instead, he provides a thorough and careful analysis of how race touches on these topics and so much more. In 10 substantive chapters that chart racial disparities across a multitude of areas—health and health care; employment and earnings; immigration; education; social life, friends, partners, and children; housing and neighborhoods; homeownership, mortgages, bubbles, and foreclosures; crime, businesses and entrepreneurs, and wealth—he considers explanations for disparities and policy prescriptions before grappling with the case for reparations.         "
"4","O'Flaherty concludes where he begins, answering the questions generated from the classic texts. Washington and Du Bois were both right: “race and history matter” (p. 427). The manifold racial disparities documented in the book do not reflect the long arm of history alone but also practices and, in some realms, overt discrimination in the present. All of the spheres of life matter because inequality in one sphere trickles over into another. No sphere is key to progress because they all condition each other, positively or negatively. Interracial friendships seem to matter, and although a multiracial society, even in the context of exploitation, is possible, we will never know whether it is desirable."
