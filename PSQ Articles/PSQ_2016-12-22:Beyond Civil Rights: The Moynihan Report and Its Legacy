"1","First published 50 years ago, the Moynihan Report has once again found itself the subject of national conversation. In October 2015, Atlantic writer Ta‐Nehisi Coates penned a widely read (and commented on) tome on the state of the black family, drawing on the Moynihan Report and its subsequent (mis)interpretation. This caused many American readers to wonder about the Moynihan Report, a once‐obscure government memo that surged powerfully into American consciousness and into the national debate. Who was Daniel Patrick Moynihan? Why did he write a report on the black family? What did it actually say? How was it read, and reread? And what effect has it had on American life?         "
"2","Daniel Geary's Beyond Civil Rights offers answers to these pressing questions, providing a concentrated history of the Moynihan Report and an analysis of its complex legacy. The Moynihan Report, drafted by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1965 as a government memo, addressed the pivotal issues of the day—race, crime, family, and inequality. Moynihan, a seasoned social scientist who had two years earlier published a now‐classic work on immigration, Beyond the Melting Pot, relied heavily on statistics and the work of black scholars E. Franklin Frazier and Kenneth Clark in crafting his report. In the end, the 78‐page The Negro Family read like a blend between a “bureaucratic report, an academic article, and a muckraking magazine feature” (p. 63).         "
"3","Although Moynihan's intent was to tease out the intricate relationship between political equality, economic opportunity, and social stability, The Negro Family became known for its most inflammatory phrase, “tangle of pathology.” Conservatives seized on it, anxious to make inequality the result of personal responsibility or racial inherency, while liberals decried Moynihan, accusing him of blaming the victim. The Moynihan Report “sparked an explosive debate” and ignited a lasting controversy. This controversy, according to Geary, is more significant than the report itself and the emphasis of Beyond Civil Rights.         "
"4","Stating that the Moynihan Report “remains a contested reference point for debating the causes and cures of African American inequality” (p. 2), Geary analyzes the responses of various groups, uncovering “why and how the report became such a powerful symbol” and such a potent tool in the hands of groups as disparate as “liberal intellectuals, Southern segregationists, civil rights leaders, Black Power advocates, feminists, neoconservatives, and Reaganite conservatives” (p. 3)."
"5","Geary convincingly argues that the crisis over the Moynihan Report belies a deeper crisis in American liberalism in the 1960s. While elite experts such as Moynihan imagined themselves able to help the state solve social problems, in the tumultuous 1960s, they also maintained a conservative bent that, as Geary puts it, “social stability was equally important as social justice.” This has left a mixed legacy indeed. But the Moynihan Report reveals not only a crisis over liberalism but a longer American crisis over race. “The astonishingly wide‐ranging and long‐running controversy” over the Moynihan Report, Geary writes, provides insight into “how Americans have discussed the tangled aspects of persistent African American inequality from the civil rights era to the present day” (p. 11)."
"6","This meticulously researched, eloquent book stands as the definitive account of the Moynihan Report and its impact on American life. Contributing to the history of American liberalism, the state, the 1960s, and race, Beyond Civil Rights is an important text for political scientists, sociologists, historians, and anyone interested in the intersection between race, class, the state, and public discourse. As both Geary and Coates remind, those issues are as pressing today as they were in 1965.         "
