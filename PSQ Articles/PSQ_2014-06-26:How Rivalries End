"1","Studies of rivalry or the long‐standing competitions between the same pairs of states (for example, India and Pakistan), have been a central part of international conflict research for the past two decades. Because rivalries consume enormous national resources and policy attention, as well as being the context for most wars, research on them is more than of purely theoretical interest. In the early years, rivalries were primarily a case selection device, and most of the scholarly debates concerned operational criteria rather than theoretical differences. More recently, scholars have focused on the initiation, dynamics, and termination of these competitions. The book by Karen Rasler, William R. Thompson, and Sumit Ganguly concentrates on the latter, and joins a series of recent related works such as Eric Cox's Why Enduring Rivalries Do‐or Don't–End and Charles Kupchan's How Enemies Become Friends.         "
"2","The present book is a substantial contribution, perhaps the best work to date on rivalry termination. This is largely because, in the best social science tradition, it incorporates the best of previous and often‐narrow explanations, and synthesizes them with new elements. The net result is a compelling case for the conditions associated with the end of rivalries, and, just as interesting, why some rivalries have persisted."
"3","After an overview of rivalry termination and a listing of cases in chapter 1, the main theoretical argument is given in chapter 2. There, the authors offer a process model composed of four conditions associated with the end of rivalries. The first, major changes in the political environment, or shocks, have been well‐established in the literature as a necessary condition for rivalry termination. Yet, unlike those past works, the authors do not stop here, and indicate that the states must change expectations about their external threat environment as a result of a regime change. The process of de‐escalation then requires some reciprocity that comes from mutual concessions by both sides and, ultimately, reinforcement of the de‐escalation process. The last two components are consistent with some of the steps outlined in Kupchan's book. Thus, the four elements are each necessary conditions for rivalry termination; the difficulty of having such a confluence of factors accounts for why rivalries tend to last for decades. Third parties might influence the conflict management process, but they are not essential to the two states resolving their problems.         "
"4","Chapters 3–7 provide extensive case analyses that serve as tests of the theory. These are not historical narratives of oft‐told tales about individual rivalries, but are focused analyses on whether the conditions specified in the theory occurred at the time of termination or opportunities for termination. Ten rivalry cases, and 33 instances of attempts at termination embedded in those rivalries, are examined; such cases include famous competitions such as Egypt versus Israel, as well as lesser known ones, such as Thailand versus Vietnam. There is variation both within and across cases with respect to termination."
"5","The empirical results strongly support the theory laid out early in the book. A real bonus is the Appendix, which discusses a large number of other approaches to conflict de‐escalation and rivalry termination and does so in a serial fashion. Thus, instead of the perfunctory literature review at the beginning of the book, the authors give readers good summaries in light of the findings of this study. The book can easily be read for only the theoretical chapters or for individual cases as the needs and preferences of the readers dictate, but as a whole, it is very coherent and worth the effort."
