"1","The durability and peacefulness of the United States' “unipolar moment” have been the subjects of much scholarly attention since the end of the Cold War, with some warning of impending decline, while others predict a long period of stability. Nuno P. Monteiro contributes to this debate by building a theory that methodically engages these subjects. In doing so, he advances our theoretical understanding of the incentives unipolarity creates for the unipole and for other states, and he does great service to contemporary discussions about the future of American grand strategy."
"2","In evaluating unipolarity's durability, Monteiro places special emphasis on the importance of the nuclear revolution. He argues that the pacific effect of nuclear deterrence on international politics makes conventional military balancing among nuclear‐armed major powers less necessary for survival, thus allowing the unipole to retain its military edge. The effects of nuclear weapons are not an unmitigated good, however, as Monteiro also asserts that they are a source of conflict between minor powers, which may hedge against the possibility of unipole revisionism by pursuing nuclear weapons, and the unipole, which will oppose proliferation in order to preserve its dominance."
"3","Monteiro eschews conceptualizing the international distribution of power in terms of economic power and instead favors defining polarity in terms of military capabilities. He accordingly defines unipolarity as “the concentration of military power in one state, the sole great power” (p. 49). This distinction is not trivial; by endogenizing unipolarity, Monteiro places greater emphasis on the role of the unipole's choice of strategy than many previous studies. He conceptualizes two dimensions of grand strategy: in the economic realm, the unipole can accommodate or attempt to contain the economic growth of rising powers, and in the security realm, the unipole can disengage, preserve the status quo (“defensive dominance”), or change the status quo in its favor (“offensive dominance”)."
"4","Each combination of these strategies entails varying degrees of cost. The optimal grand strategy will typically be defensive accommodation, which discourages regional powers from conventionally balancing each other, as they might do under disengagement, and creates fewer incentives for them to balance the unipole than they would have under offensive dominance or economic containment. Nonetheless, although disengagement carries a “competition cost” insofar as it risks hastening the end of unipolarity by allowing regional rivalries and arms races to develop, it may become the unipole's preferred strategy if the “conflict costs” of being embroiled in periodic wars with recalcitrant minor regional powers become sufficiently great under defensive dominance."
"5","The theory has clear implications for Sino‐American relations. So long as the United States does not threaten China's economic ascent or attempt to shift the East Asian status quo further in its favor, Monteiro argues, for the foreseeable future, China is unlikely to challenge U.S. preeminence globally because its nuclear deterrent ensures its survival. Whether China will seek regional hegemony, however, is an open question—although Monteiro claims that China's military development has been defensive thus far, and he observes that, historically, “other states, such as the Soviet Union, were doing a lot more balancing” when they were just as far from economic parity with the United States as China is now (p. 141)."
"6","One area in which the book could profit from further discussion concerns the potential economic benefits that the unipole reaps from preponderance—which, it is argued, incentivizes it to preserve its dominant status. Monteiro cites numerous advantages, such as the dollar's status as the international reserve currency and the United States' attractiveness as a foreign investment destination, but because the causal linkages between military primacy and these economic benefits have been subjects of contention in recent literature, a lengthier examination would be invaluable.         "
"7","In sum, Theory of Unipolar Politics provides an outstanding contribution to our understanding of unipolarity and to current U.S. foreign policy discourse, as well as an impressive structural theory of international politics in its own right.         "
