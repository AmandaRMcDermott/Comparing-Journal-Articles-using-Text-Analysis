"1","This is an impressive political, social, and economic narrative, a sweeping history of the turbulent decade of the 1970s (specifically, the seven‐year period between 1973 and 1979). It is a domestic history of the United States, but not in a narrow sense; that is, the contextual events that shaped life in the United States are not viewed as “exceptional,” but rather as typical of the changing conditions, values, and norms in the global environment more generally."
"2","In focusing on the 1970s, Thomas Borstelmann self‐consciously rescues the decade from the prevailing wisdom that the bookend decades—the 1960s and the 1980s—are more worthy of attention inasmuch as they are the times during which more‐important and meaningful events took place. The 1970s, by contrast, are often thought of as a period of economic malaise, corruption, loss of faith in government, and geo‐political impotence. While true, according to Borstelmann, important changes were also taking place in the United States that would have profound consequences for the nation's political, social, and economic development in the succeeding decades."
"3","The heart of Borstelmann's thesis is that two major shifts were occurring concurrently in the 1970s: the nation was becoming both more egalitarian and more “free market.” The civil rights revolution of the 1960s expanded in the 1970s to include other groups (women, gays, citizens with disabilities) amid a growing consensus that “equality” was the new standard in civil society. At the same time, faith in the social engineering power of government declined, in response to (among other things) perceived Great Society excesses, and a turn to deregulation and laissez‐faire capitalism ensued. Over time, Borstelmann argues, this pairing of equality‐based egalitarianism and free‐market devotion led to the pervasive and growing economic inequality that we see today. In effect, the emphasis on equality and rejection of governmental redistribution has helped create an ethos that certain people deserve their economic fate—whether as “winners” or “losers”—in an increasingly unequal and polarized society."
"4","In making his case, Borstelmann introduces wide‐ranging and often eclectic information. His ability to integrate such diverse material as Supreme Court cases, counter‐culture references, academic treatises, film and literature synopses, New Yorker editorial cartoons, geo‐political happenings, and religious and social movements into a coherent and well‐written treatise is truly outstanding. Along the way, he acknowledges that the 1970s was a special time for him, inasmuch as he matured from a child into an adult across the decade. Borstelmann is a decade older than I, but the 1970s also were a special time for me, inasmuch as they spanned my childhood. I often read the book with a smile on my face, as I appreciated each and every popular culture reference.         "
"5","It was also interesting for me to read the book from a different disciplinary perspective—I am a political scientist, whereas Borstelmann is a historian. The book's research design highlights the different disciplinary standards. Whereas Borstelmann weaves a complex narrative in making his case for 1970s‐era conditions setting the stage for greater economic inequality in more‐recent years, I kept thinking about the various parts of his argument that he was bringing to bear—which were truly causal and which were merely correlates (or confounds)? Borstelmann's narrative format would not pass muster under a social‐scientific microscope. In addition, the evidence he provides for various claims comes from anecdotes rather than systematic data (which is the social‐scientific standard).         "
"6","But such a deconstruction is unfair. Borstelmann is a historian, and his work should be evaluated on its merits. As a historical narrative, it is provocative and impressive. I learned a great deal by reading the book and will recommend it without reservation."
