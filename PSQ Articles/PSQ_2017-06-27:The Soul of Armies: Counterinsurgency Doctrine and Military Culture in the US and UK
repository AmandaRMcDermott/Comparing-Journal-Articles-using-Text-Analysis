"1","New military field manuals rarely generate much interest. Such documents, chock full of acronyms and unfamiliar lingo, populate military libraries but not public ones. But in December 2006 the U.S. Army and Marine Corps released Field Manual 3‐24, Counterinsurgency, to great fanfare. The manual supposedly heralded a new approach to the war in Iraq, where U.S. forces were blamed for employing conventional tactics against an unconventional enemy. Instead of large‐unit and firepower‐intensive operations against insurgents in the field, the new guidance focused on protecting civilians in their communities. General David Petraeus was the lead author of the manual, and he was promoted to command coalition forces in Iraq almost immediately after its publication. The reduction in violence during his tenure seemed to validate the concepts in FM 3‐24, and suggested that the army had finally implemented the right doctrine for this kind of war.         "
"2","Austin Long demolishes those claims. He shows convincingly that the army largely continued to fight in Iraq as it had before the arrival of General Petraeus; that army commanders largely ignored doctrine as written in FM 3‐24; and that improvements in the security situation were attributable to other factors. In making these arguments, Long provides an important addition to the literature on military innovation, battlefield performance, and organizational culture."
"3","The Soul of Armies observes that different militaries continue to approach the problem of counterinsurgency in very different ways. This is unlike conventional warfare, in which militaries have increasingly come to adopt the same basic set of operational principles. Long argues that conventional warfare is less ambiguous, and militaries that fail to adapt risk defeat in detail. Insurgencies are inherently unclear, however, because insurgents blend in with civilian populations and rarely establish front lines. In the absence of obvious structural pressures to fight in certain ways, militaries fall back on their own organizational beliefs about what kind of fighting is appropriate and effective.         "
"4","The source of these beliefs—and the soul of Long's argument—is military organizational culture. Culture mediates ambiguous information by answering normative and positivist questions about the use of force and the military profession. Culture helps answer difficult questions about the logic of appropriateness (for example, is indiscriminate force permissible?) and the logic of consequences (what kind of violence is best for bringing an insurgency to heel?). It also speaks to questions about the organization itself, including debates over the size of the basic unit of military action and whether officers should see themselves as managers of large‐scale violence or leaders of highly trained professional soldiers. Differences in military culture explain observed differences in operational performance. The existence of deeply embedded cultural beliefs also explains why armies routinely ignore their own published doctrinal statements, which often provide political cover while they prosecute war in the way they see fit."
"5","Every army experiences a crucial “first war” that forms the basis of its cultural beliefs. The beliefs forged in the crucible of war are subsequently transmitted through professional military education (PME). Such schools are not simply vehicles for teaching tactics. They are conduits for sharing organizational norms. According to Long, professional schools are particularly important for the military because, unlike other professions such as law or medicine, officers rarely have the choice to go to private institutions. Thus, professional schools homogenize the officer corps, stamping their service ethos on leaders as they rise in command."
"6","Locating the first war is difficult in practice. Long argues that the American Civil War was crucial for the U.S. Army, but he notes that the British army had two formative experiences in the Crimean War and the Sepoy Mutiny, while the U.S. Marine Corps experienced a litany of interventions that shaped its dominant subcultures. Moreover, there is often a substantial gap between the experience of the first war and the institutionalization of culture, and during this time, other variables play an important and perhaps equally important role. The U.S. Civil War forged the beliefs of General William Tecumseh Sherman, who played a pivotal role in establishing and reforming military education in the aftermath of the war. But Sherman had many critics who drew different lessons about the war. Internecine battles among army officers and political fights in Congress followed, and the issue was not resolved until after World War I. This suggests that domestic politics and international factors were also at play."
"7","The causal relationship between PME and the conduct of counterinsurgency is also somewhat unclear. Long's descriptions of the early development of professional education institutions in the United States and Great Britain are thorough and persuasive. But they mostly disappear from the modern case studies on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would be fascinating, for instance, to know what U.S. Army officers were studying at the Command and General Staff College during the 1990s that reinforced their beliefs in large‐unit operations and large amounts of firepower. What did they learn about past U.S. efforts in Vietnam? What did they read? What did their professors say, if anything, about the well‐known criticisms of the army's performance in Vietnam? Similarly, it is not clear that aspiring British officers learned their organization's culture while at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. This is certainly plausible, but it also seems likely that process of acculturation speeds up after graduation, when newly minted officers join centuries‐old regiments with their own norms and traditions."
"8","While the origins of culture are somewhat murky, the effects are unambiguous. The book's judicious selection of case studies (Vietnam, Kenya, Iraq, and Afghanistan) allows Long to compare the attitudes and performance of different armies across time and space. The within‐case comparisons are particularly telling. Long describes a natural experiment in Vietnam's I Corps, where army and marine forces fought the same enemy in the same place from 1966 to 1968. Long dissects the campaign, showing that in an ambiguous environment, both services reverted to their cultural beliefs. The army embarked on large‐unit operations and used firepower liberally. The marines opted for small‐unit operations in concert with indigenous allies and limited the use of fire."
"9","The cultural argument is also compelling in the case studies on Iraq and Afghanistan, where the army continued to go big in spite of its own written doctrine. Long shows that the army publications had subscribed to a notion of protecting the population long before FM 3‐24. Indeed, while General Petraeus's document added more detail, it did not change the basic principles of counterinsurgency. Petraeus's mission was not to change doctrine but to force a recalcitrant army to implement it. He had a little success in Baghdad but not much elsewhere in the Iraq, where the deep cultural preference for large sweeps continued to guide army operations."
"10","While Long is often critical of the army, he does not fall into the trap of arguing that there is a time‐tested recipe for victory in counterinsurgency. Other authors have urged U.S. forces to mimic the British approach, which they believe holds the key to success. But Long shows that British forces only succeeded when British officers had the luxury of operating with enthusiastic indigenous partners, as in Kenya. The British model was inappropriate when they did not, as in Iraq. Long's sobering conclusion is that there is no school solution for counterinsurgency because so much depends on local factors outside the control of foreign military forces. This may disappoint military officers who have sought in vain for a set of best practices. The Soul of Armies has much to say about organizational culture and counterinsurgency, but not about how to win.         "
