"1","MANY OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENTS need a stable cabinet to consistently carry out their programs. Where cabinet dissolution is common, it is hard for the president to execute long‐term programs, such as economic development plans and social welfare programs, which usually weakens citizen support for the government. Particularly where a president builds a coalition with other parties to control the majority of parliamentary seats, a change in the party composition of the cabinet often discontinues some of the executive's programs. Thus, if presidents often change their coalition partners, they are less likely to accomplish policy goals, and this may even jeopardize the survival of the government. For instance, Salvador Allende experienced six different cabinets within three years between 1970, when he assumed power as Chilean president, and 1973, when he was overthrown in a military coup. Bolivia provides another example. After Hernán Siles Zuazo took office in 1982, he changed his coalition partners seven times before stepping down in 1985. How can we account for these seemingly suicidal choices by presidents? That is, why do some presidents dissolve their cabinets frequently, which most observers believe contributes to the instability of government?"
"2","Most theories about cabinet dissolution derive from the experience of Western European parliamentary democracies. There have been three approaches to the subject. First, the Parliament attributes theorists explain cabinet dissolution by looking at parliamentary institutional features, such as the number of parties (fragmentation) and the ideological distance between parties (polarization) in the legislature.1 They argue that a cabinet is more likely to be dissolved as fragmentation and polarization inside the Parliament increase. Second, the cabinet attributes theorists put more emphasis on those institutional features in the executive.2 Cabinets that consist of multiple coalition partners, the ideologies of which widely differ from one another, tend to be terminated more easily. Despite the difference in the government branch in focus, however, both camps agree that fragmentation and polarization have negative effects on cabinet stability. Finally, the stochastic events theorists concentrate on unpredictable events, such as economic crises, that destabilize the cabinet.3"
"3","In contrast to the deep accumulation of knowledge about cabinet stability in parliamentary regimes, we know little about it in presidential regimes. There are two reasons that cabinet dissolution in presidentialism has received less attention than it has in parliamentarism. First, whereas the parliamentary cabinet is dissolved whenever the Parliament passes a motion of no‐confidence or the prime minister calls a new election, the presidential cabinet is typically believed to be dissolved with the end of the legal term of the president. Second, a cabinet dissolution always terminates the government in the parliamentary system; it rarely ends the government in the presidential system."
"4","Nonetheless, we need to pay more attention to cabinet dissolution in the presidential system because, first of all, just as in the aforementioned cases of Allende and Siles, presidential cabinets are in fact sometimes dissolved before the end of the president's term. Table 1 summarizes the reasons behind cabinet dissolutions in the 10 Latin American presidential democracies between 1951 and 2000 in the Acir Almeida dataset (see Appendix). A cabinet is typically considered as surviving if the cabinet ends owing to a constitutionally scheduled election or cabinet reshuffle.4 Only 63.3 percent of the Latin American cabinets fall into this category. The rest should be considered dissolved before the end of the legal term of the president, because when a president changes coalition partners (parties) in his cabinet, or all cabinet members resign, or the president himself steps down, all or some of the key programs of the previous cabinet are likely to discontinue without the consent of the voter (in election).         "
"5","Second, even though cabinet dissolutions do not always terminate the government in the presidential system, the effects of cabinet dissolutions in presidentialism are sometimes as significant as those in parliamentarism. Presidents sometimes leave office before the next scheduled election, owing to an impeachment of the president by the Parliament, a people's uprising, or a military coup.5 When a cabinet is dissolved due to the resignation of the president, the dissolution ends the government just as it does in parliamentarism. Moreover, even though a full cabinet resignation does not lead to the end of the government in presidentialism, it largely undermines the president's capacity to implement key policies, inasmuch as it takes considerable time and effort to build a new—and equally capable—cabinet.         "
"6","Finally, most cabinet duration literature considers any change in the party composition of a cabinet to be its dissolution,6 and the effects of such a change may be smaller than those of the resignation of a president or cabinet members; however, the effects are far from negligible. Out of the 131 Latin American cabinets between 1951 and 2000, 66.4 percent were formed along with at least one coalition partner, and 37.9 percent of the coalition cabinets experienced a breakdown of the coalitions. Coalition partners change when the presidents decide to add new parties to their cabinet or to dismiss some of the existing parties from the cabinet, or when some of the coalition party leaders decide to leave the cabinet. Since the presidents choose cabinet members to maximize their political gains by considering the influences of other political actors, such as rivals within their party and opposition party leaders, an addition or reduction of coalition partners should affect the gains of all the major actors.7 For instance, when the presidents need to strengthen their support within their party, they often form a cabinet comprising chiefly of their loyalists; the appointment of loyalists, however, is likely to draw disapproval from rivals within the party, not to mention from opposition leaders. When this discontent increases to the point that rivals and opposition leaders decide to obstruct the passage of the president's bills in Parliament, the presidents might feel compelled to include the rivals and/or opposition leaders in their cabinet, which, in turn, reduces the benefits to their loyalists and weakens the presidents' intra‐party base of support.8"
"7","This series of events suggests why the dissolution of cabinets in presidential regimes should receive more scholarly attention. Hence, the goal of this paper is to explore why some presidential cabinets are dissolved before the next election while others survive. I limit the sample to 10 presidential democracies in Latin America for this study because I only have data for those countries. The study could thus be further developed by broadening the sample. I construct a causal model that incorporates the three existing theoretical approaches to cabinet duration in parliamentary democracies, and test the model against the presidential democracies to observe whether the theories from parliamentarism can explain cabinet survival in presidentialism as well. Since the president and the Parliament do not rely on mutual confidence in presidentialism, we can expect to see presidential cabinets less affected by the Parliament attributes, compared with parliamentary cabinets. In addition, the economic performance of cabinets, which has been neglected by most stochastic events theorists, is also included as an important covariate, since a capable cabinet that promptly overcomes an exogenous economic crisis is expected to prolong the cabinet's survival. The paper finds that the less fragmented a cabinet is, the more seats cabinet parties take in the Parliament, and the better the economic performance of a cabinet is, the more likely the cabinet is to survive. The results indicate that in presidentialism, cabinet attributes greatly affect cabinet duration, compared with Parliament attributes, and that cabinet performance has larger effects on cabinet stability than does exogenous shock per se."
"8","The paper proceeds as follows. First, a causal model of cabinet duration in presidentialism is presented following a brief review of the pre‐existing theories about cabinet dissolution in parliamentarism. Section 2 describes the data, statistical model, and measures used in this study. Hypotheses are empirically tested in section 3, and the findings are analyzed and discussed in section 4. Section 5 concludes."
"9","Since Michael Taylor and V.M. Herman tested the effects of a variety of institutional features on cabinet duration in Western European parliamentary countries,9 three theoretical approaches to the subject have evolved. The Parliament attributes theorists and the cabinet attributes theorists follow the approach of Taylor and Herman in the sense that they argue that they can predict cabinet dissolution based on certain institutional features that affect the stability of cabinets.10 The Parliament attributes theorists are interested in the complexity of the bargaining environment in which parties negotiate to reach agreements over policy.11 They argue that the more polarized and fragmented the Parliament is (that is, the more complicated the bargaining environment is), the more easily the cabinet is dissolved. This is because parties are likely to have greater difficulty in reaching an agreement over policy as the ideological diversity among them increases, and such impasses in negotiations over key policies of the prime minister often lead her to call a new election or to change her coalition partners in order to break the deadlock. Moreover, when there is a large number of parties in the Parliament, many new coalitions are possible; hence, the chance of cabinets to be dissolved by changing coalition partners is greater when the Parliament is more fragmented.12"
"10","The cabinet attributes theorists, on the other hand, are more concerned with the institutional features of the cabinet. Arend Lijphart shows that one‐party cabinets are more likely to survive than are multi‐party cabinets, and that minimal winning coalitions are more likely to be sustained than are oversized coalitions.13 In other words, the more fragmented a cabinet is, the less likely the cabinet is to survive. Paul Warwick adds the ideological distance among coalition partners (polarization) to the cabinet institutional features that affect the duration of cabinets.14 He finds that the more polarized a cabinet is, the less likely the cabinet is to be sustained. George Tsebelis articulates the findings of the cabinet attributes theorists with the veto players model.15 As the number of coalition partners in the cabinet or the ideological distance between them increases, the size of the winset of the status quo decreases, which makes it harder for the cabinet to change the status quo (and to respond to policy demands), which, in turn, could lead the cabinet coalition to collapse over public discontent with policy immobilism. In sum, the cabinet attributes theorists have found that fragmentation and polarization in a cabinet are negatively correlated with the duration of the cabinet.         "
"11","In contrast to those two attributes theorists,16 the stochastic events theorists contend that the dissolution of a cabinet is inherently unpredictable, since it is generally driven by stochastic events such as scandals and economic crises.17 Eric Browne, John Frendreis, and Dennia Gleiber expect that those events will “produce sufficient changes in attribute values (of a cabinet), and thus bring the cabinet to an end.”18 Moreover, since such demolishing events can occur at any time after a cabinet is formed, the probability that the cabinet will be dissolved is assumed to be constant throughout its term in office. John D. Robertson tests the effects of economic crises on the stability of cabinets and finds that a cabinet's attributes cannot explain its survival “in the face of inflation and unemployment.”19"
"12","Before testing those existing theories in the context of presidential democracies, I suggest a causal model of cabinet duration in presidentialism, which incorporates the theories from parliamentary democracies, for three reasons (see Figure 1). First, the preexisting theories about cabinet duration in parliamentarism seem to be conflicting; nonetheless, a more‐coherent causal mechanism could help bridge the gaps among the theories, especially between the Parliament and cabinet attributes theories. The institutional features of the Parliament do not affect cabinet duration directly; most of the time, the Parliament attributes affect the stability of cabinets through the attributes of those cabinets. Where Parliaments are fragmented, for instance, prime ministers (or presidents) tend to include more parties in their coalitions for legislative support, and those fragmented cabinets are more likely to fall due to the number of possible alternative coalitions. Likewise, cabinets tend to be polarized where Parliaments are polarized, and those polarized cabinets are more likely to fall due to a disagreement over policy. Moreover, with fragmented or polarized Parliaments, prime ministers tend to have greater difficulty in building a stable majority coalition; when they lack majority support, the legislative majority may dissolve the government by passing a motion of no‐confidence. In presidentialism, when a president lacks support from the legislative majority, important policy bills often run into a roadblock, and frequent policy immobilism may raise public discontent to the point that an unconstitutional measure, such as popular uprising and military coup, ends the government.20 In short, in both parliamentary and presidential systems, Parliament attributes normally serve as the environment from which cabinets are formed, and it is the cabinet attributes that have direct effects on the stability of the cabinet.21"
"13","                        Note: Dashed arrow indicates weaker effects of Parliament attributes in presidentialism. Those arrows should be solid in parliamentarism.                     "
"14","Second, the performance of cabinets in key policy areas should be taken into account. Stochastic events theorists have focused on the effects of unpredicted exogenous shocks on the survival of cabinets. For example, John D. Robertson tests the effects of inflation and unemployment on the stability of coalition cabinets. Although those economic phenomena can be the results of poor management of the economy by the cabinet, he considers those conditions to be exogenous to the cabinet performance; he treats them as “a symptom of chronic economic malady.”22 Nonetheless, even when an economic crisis hits a country, for instance, the cabinet leaders are likely to stay in the government if they can succeed in managing the crisis. That is, the effects of stochastic events on cabinet duration can be mediated by the performance of the cabinet.         "
"15","Finally, the reasons for the end of cabinets in presidentialism may be different from those in parliamentarism. Most of all, since in presidential systems the president and the Parliament do not rely on mutual confidence and the terms of the president and the legislators are constitutionally fixed, presidential cabinets are less susceptible to the institutional features of the Parliament than are parliamentary cabinets. In parliamentarism, when a prime minister lacks the majority support in the Parliament, her cabinet is highly likely to fall because the Parliament can pass a motion of no‐confidence for any reason. Hence when the Parliament is polarized, for instance, prime ministers often include ideologically distant parties in their cabinet to retain the majority support. Since polarized cabinets are more likely to be dissolved due to a disagreement over policy, polarization in Parliament leading to polarization in cabinet tends to end the cabinet in parliamentarism. Conversely, in presidentialism, presidents who lack the majority support are more likely to maintain their cabinet because an impeachment of the president typically requires stricter conditions, such as high crimes and misdemeanors of the president, and because the presidents can get their bills passed in the Parliament without building a majority coalition by buying the votes of individual legislators.23 Even when the Parliament is polarized, therefore, the president is less likely to include ideologically distant parties in his cabinet than is the prime minister in parliamentarism.24 Hence polarization in Parliament rarely leads to polarization in cabinet in presidentialism, and polarized Parliaments are thus less likely to end presidential cabinets. Accordingly, it is plausible to assume that Parliament attributes have less effect on cabinet duration in presidentialism than they do in parliamentarism.         "
"16","Figure 1 depicts the causal mechanism of cabinet duration in presidentialism: (path a) The institutional features of the Parliament provide the environment from which the cabinet is formed. That is, Parliament attributes affect cabinet duration through cabinet attributes. When the Parliament is fractionalized, for instance, it is likely that the cabinet is composed of multiple parties; when the Parliament is polarized, the cabinet is likely to contain ideologically distant parties. Since presidential cabinets can survive without majority support from the legislature, however, those Parliament attributes should have less impact on cabinet attributes in presidentialism than they do in parliamentarism. (path b) The characteristics of cabinets have direct effects on the stability of those cabinets. For example, multi‐party cabinets are more likely than are one‐party cabinets to fall, because many alternative coalitions are possible; polarized cabinets are more likely to be dissolved because of disagreement over key policies. Moreover, when a president lacks majority support in the Parliament, his cabinet tends to be unstable because he is likely to include more parties in his cabinet for legislative support, or because the legislative majority may impeach the president, or because frequent conflicts between the president and the Parliament may lead an unconstitutional measure to end the government. Due to the weaker effects of Parliament attributes on the institutional features of presidential cabinets, in presidentialism, those cabinet attributes should have particularly larger effects on the durability of the cabinets than do Parliament attributes. On the other hand, (path c) stochastic events may affect cabinet performance in key policy areas; however, those events rarely have direct effects on the duration of cabinets (path d) because the cabinets' performance in dealing with these events can mediate the effects.         "
"17","In the existing literature on cabinet duration in parliamentary regimes, a cabinet is considered to be dissolved whenever there is a change in the party composition of the cabinet, a formal cabinet resignation, a change of prime minister, or an election. Then, all of these reasons except for scheduled election are defined as the events that lead cabinets to fall.25 To be consistent with the existing literature, I classify cabinets in presidential democracies into two groups: those that were dissolved and those that survived. When there was a change in the party composition of the cabinet, a full cabinet resignation, or a change of the president before a scheduled election, I put the cabinet in the dissolved cabinet group; when a cabinet ended due to a scheduled election, I put it in the survived cabinet group; cabinet reshuffling that replaces ministers without changing the party composition of the cabinet is usually not considered dissolution of the cabinet; hence, cabinet reshuffles are included in the survived cabinet group; all the other cases, such as death of the president and caretaker cabinets, are removed from my dataset. The Almeida dataset used in this study contains 131 presidential cabinets in 10 Latin American democracies, which includes Argentina (1983−97), Bolivia (1982−97), Brazil (1951−64, 1987−99), Chile (1952−73, 1990−98), Colombia (1978−98), Costa Rica (1953−98), Ecuador (1979−96), Peru (1980−2000), Uruguay (1985−2000), and Venezuela (1959−69, 1974−77, 1984−89, 1994−96). Of these cabinets, 63.3 percent survived, whereas those remaining were dissolved (see Table 1).         "
"18","Since the aim of this study is to analyze the effects of multiple variables on times until the event (dissolution of cabinets) occurs, the study uses the Cox proportional hazard model. Unlike the Weibull hazard model, which assumes a particular parametric form for the hazard function, the Cox model assumes no specific parametric distribution; hence, it is highly flexible and can be adapted to many types of event history data (see Appendix).26 The survived cabinets that end because of elections or reshuffles are treated as truncated in the Cox model since they could have survived longer without such events.         "
"19","For the hazard analysis, the dependent variable is the days for which each cabinet is sustained, which incorporates the information about whether it is a survived or dissolved cabinet. In contrast to the existing studies that use months for which each cabinet is sustained as the dependent variable, I increase the accuracy of the measurement by substituting days for months. The independent variables are grouped into four types corresponding to the existing theories: Parliament attributes, cabinet attributes, stochastic variables, and controls."
"20","Fragmentation of the Parliament is measured by the effective number of parliamentary parties (ENPS), which is the Laakso–Taagepera index of the effective number of parties, based on legislative seats.28 Highly fragmented Parliaments should have large ENPS values. The index varies in the dataset from 1.96 to 9.01, with a mean of 4.06.            "
"21","Polarization measures the left–right polarization in the Parliament, which is a continuous indicator developed by Michael Coppedge.29 Its formula is30                              "
"22","The more polarized a Parliament is, that is, the more parties there are in right or left rather than in center right, center, or center left, the larger the value of polarization becomes. The indicator varies from 6.7 to 67.2, with a mean of 42.5."
"23","Electoral volatility is the Pedersen's index of electoral volatility.31 In addition to the fragmentation and polarization in the Parliament, electoral volatility is often used by the Parliament attributes theorists to estimate the effects of a complex and unstable bargaining environment on cabinet duration.32 A high electoral volatility indicates that a large number of voters shift their supporting parties. The index varies from 5.0 to 80.7, with a mean of 30.6.            "
"24","The Parliament attributes theorists argue that high fragmentation, polarization, and electoral volatility reflect a complicated bargaining environment, and that such an unstable environment, in turn, often causes the dissolution of cabinets.33 Nonetheless, the causality is not evident since it is the institutional features of cabinets that have direct effects on cabinet duration, and since Parliament attributes have less effect on cabinet attributes in presidentialism than they do in parliamentarism. For instance, polarized Parliaments do not necessarily generate polarized cabinets because the president can exclude ideologically distant parties from his cabinet. Moreover, high electoral volatility can bring about stable coalitions due to the uncertainty over the outcomes of the next election.34 Only parliamentary fragmentation seems to have large effects on cabinet survival, since fractionalized Parliaments are likely to lead to multi‐party cabinets, which may increase the instability of the cabinets.            "
"25","Number of parties in the cabinet. Among cabinet parties, only those that have seats in the Parliament are counted. Since the president needs the support of parliamentary parties to get his bills passed, non‐parliamentary parties are insignificant. According to Tsebelis, the more coalition partners the president has, the more difficult it is for him to respond to varying policy demands.36 When the people's dissatisfaction over policy immobilism increases, some coalition partners may find an incentive to leave the cabinet. The number varies from 1 to 6, with a mean of 2.2.            "
"26","Ideological distance between cabinet parties is a unidimensional five‐item scale (0−1 range, where 0 is the closest and 1 is the farthest, with intermediate values at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, and 0.22 as the mean) that measures the space between the most distant parties in the cabinet.37 We can disregard parties in the middle, since they would not affect the size of the winset of the status quo.38 As the distance between parties increases, the policy immobilism increases, and the increased immobilism, in turn, might lead to the dissolution of the cabinet.39"
"27","Parliamentary seats refers to the proportion of seats that cabinet parties take in the Parliament. Most of the existing literature use a dummy variable whether or not the cabinet parties are in a majority in the Parliament to measure the strength of cabinet parties in the Parliament.40 I replace the dummy variable with the proportion of parliamentary seats, since the latter contains more‐accurate information about the cabinet party strength in the Parliament. For instance, if cabinet parties take 49 percent of the parliamentary seats, they would have less difficulty buying votes from the opposition parties than when they take 10 percent of the seats. If they are in a supermajority in the Parliament, they should be more confident about getting their bills passed than in a bare majority. Therefore, we can expect that the more parliamentary seats cabinet parties take, all else being equal, the more stable the cabinet would be. This measure ranges from 0.09 to 0.95, with a mean of 0.49.            "
"28","Oversized winning coalition is a dummy variable, where 1 indicates oversized winning coalitions and 0 otherwise (0.30 is the mean). Oversized winning coalitions are more likely to be dissolved than are minimal winning coalitions, since even if one or two small parties leave the cabinet—which is regarded as the dissolution of the cabinet—the oversized coalitions can maintain the majority status in the Parliament.41"
"29","Economic crisis is an exogenous economic shock that is measured by the average of annual price level of consumption for each cabinet. The price level of consumption uses the purchasing power parity (PPP) in the numerator and the exchange rate in the denominator.43 Thus, the price level changes with inflation with no accompanying exchange rate adjustment, or with an exchange rate change with no accompanying price changes. For countries experiencing major inflationary periods or major exchange rate adjustments, price levels will often display big changes from year to year. These price levels of countries are hard to predict, since they depend on many unexpected political and economic factors. When rapid inflation or dramatic increase in the exchange rate hits a country, most domestic industries are severely hurt by the increased cost of purchasing goods. According to the events process theorists, such an unpredicted economic crisis is highly likely to dissolve the cabinet.44 The price level of consumption varies from 24.7 to 368.4, with a mean of 67.6.            "
"30","Economic performance of the cabinet is measured by averaging annual growth rates of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita during each cabinet. GDP per capita may increase for various reasons that have little to do with policies or management of the cabinet. For instance, a prolonged increase in international commodity prices can increase GDP per capita for the countries where commodities remain the main exports. Nonetheless, I use GDP growth rate during each cabinet to measure the economic performance of the cabinet, because presidents normally claim credit for economic growth (for any reasons) during their terms and because GDP growth rate is one of the best (if not perfect) indicators of how well a cabinet manages the country's economy. The performance of a cabinet in significant policy areas, such as the economy, has been neglected by the stochastic events theorists; nevertheless, it should be one of the most important factors that affect the stability of the cabinet. For instance, if a government significantly improves the country's economic situation, the popularity of the president will be high, which will provide the coalition partners with a good incentive to remain in the cabinet. Furthermore, even when a serious economic crisis strikes a country, if the cabinet promptly overcomes the crisis, the cabinet may be sustained. This measure varies from −13.49 to 10.68, with a mean of 0.67."
"31","GDP per capita needs to be controlled because it could affect the duration of cabinets. Relatively poor countries may have more incentives to change the cabinet to boost their economy, given that the GDP growth rate is the same across countries. Annual GDPs per capita are logged and averaged for each cabinet. They vary from 2.55 to 4.02, with a mean of 3.47."
"32","Days until next election/total days in term is included to control the effects of the timing of when the cabinet is formed. For instance, post‐election cabinets often enjoy “honeymoon” periods, and thus they are expected to survive for a fairly long period, whereas cabinets that are installed a few months before mandatory elections cannot be sustained for more than the intervening months.45 Moreover, the duration of cabinets is limited by the constitutional interelection period (CIEP).46 Since the CIEP differs across countries, the maximum days for which cabinets can be sustained are different from country to country. In presidentialism, the timing of the presidential election and legislative election also affects the CIEP. Some countries, such as Bolivia and Costa Rica, hold both elections at the same time (concurrent election), while others, such as Chile, hold the elections separately (nonconcurrent election). The CIEP of the countries with concurrent elections is generally larger than that with nonconcurrent elections. Therefore, the effects of the time until the next mandatory election as a percentage of CIEP (maximum days in office) need to be controlled. I use actual days to next election as a percentage of total days in term for control. Here, both presidential and legislative elections are included, because most of the time, cabinets are dissolved and reorganized by the president after legislative elections as well as presidential elections.            "
"33","Finally, country dummies are included in all the models to control unknown time‐invariant country‐specific factors that might affect the cabinet stability."
"34","Table 2 summarizes the hazard model estimates of the effects of the independent variables on the duration of cabinets. The null hypothesis is that the coefficient is 1; hence, a coefficient of 1.5 means that a one‐unit increase in the independent variable raises the hazard of cabinet dissolution by 50 percent, whereas a coefficient of 0.5 means that a one‐unit increase in the variable halves the hazard.         "
"35","First, model 1 tests the arguments of the Parliament attributes theorists. Only the degree of fragmentation in the Parliament seems to have the expected effects on cabinet duration. A one‐unit increase in the ENPS would increase the risk of cabinet dissolution by 39.0 percent. Parliamentary polarization and electoral volatility, however, show little effect on the stability of cabinets. Next, model 2 tests the cabinet attributes theory. The number of parties in the cabinet and the strength of the cabinet parties in the Parliament seem to have the expected effects on cabinet durability. If the president adds one more party to his cabinet, the risk of cabinet dissolution increases by 100.5 percent; when the cabinet parties increase the proportion of their parliamentary seats by 10 percent, the risk decreases by 31.7 percent.47 Nevertheless, the ideological distance between cabinet parties and whether it is an oversized winning coalition seem to have little effect on the duration of cabinets. The log‐likelihood of model 2 is higher than that of model 1, which indicates that in presidentialism, cabinet attributes may affect cabinet duration to a larger extent than Parliament attributes do.         "
"36","Model 3 tests the effects of economic crisis (price level of consumption), which stochastic events theorists consider a highly significant variable that harms the durability of cabinets. Nonetheless, the result informs us that the occurrence of an economic crisis has little impact on the survival of cabinets."
"37","Model 4 demonstrates that the economic performance of a cabinet has significant effects on cabinet duration. When a cabinet increases GDP per capita, on average, by 3 percent, the risk of the cabinet's dissolution is expected to decrease by 35.7 percent; in contrast, when the GDP per capita decreases by 3 percent on average, the risk would increase by 55.6 percent.48 The performance (GDP growth rate) is somewhat related to the price level of consumption,49 which implies that as a country's GDP per capita increases, its price level rises to some extent. Contrary to the large effects of changes in GDP, however, the price level of a country has little effect on its cabinet duration.         "
"38","Model 5 tests the effects of each variable while holding all the other variables constant. Parliamentary fragmentation is omitted because it is a prior cause of multiparty coalitions50 and because cabinet attributes should have larger effects on cabinet duration than do Parliament attributes in presidentialism.51 The other parliamentary attributes have little impact on cabinet duration: the hazard estimates for polarization and electoral volatility lack statistical significance. In contrast, cabinet attributes and economic performance—the number of cabinet parties, the proportion of parliamentary seats, and economic performance—have large effects on the duration of cabinets. When the president adds one more party to his coalition, the risk of cabinet dissolution increases by 89.9 percent, holding all the other variables fixed. If the cabinet parties take 10 percent more seats in the Parliament, the risk of cabinet dissolution will decrease, ceteris paribus, by 33.5 percent. Even though the variable of economic crisis (price level of consumption) is included, the economic performance of cabinets is still highly significant in that when a cabinet boosts the GDP per capita, on average, by 3 percent, the risk of the cabinet to fall decreases by 35.9 percent, all else being equal. Also, the log‐likelihood of model 5 is the highest among all the models, which means that the model fits well without the parliamentary fragmentation.52"
"39","The fragmentation in the cabinet, the strength of the cabinet parties in the Parliament, and the economic performance of cabinets are confirmed to have meaningful effects on the duration of cabinets. The first two factors have been emphasized by the cabinet attributes theorists,53 which substantiates the hypothesis that in presidential systems, where cabinets are less sensitive to the parliamentary environment, cabinet attributes have greatly larger effects on cabinet survival than do parliamentary attributes.         "
"40","It is worth reconsidering the reasons that the covariates of the Parliament attributes theories lack significant effects on the stability of presidential cabinets, while those variables have large effects in parliamentary democracies.54 Assemblies in presidential systems cannot threaten a no‐confidence vote when the cabinet strays from the legislature's collective policy preferences. Moreover, cabinet members in presidentialism are normally prohibited from having parliamentary posts, while parliamentary cabinet members are generally senior legislators and can hold both positions, which makes the former less susceptible to the environment in the Parliament. Hence, Parliament attributes should have less effect on cabinet attributes in presidentialism than they do in parliamentarism; as a result, the characteristics of the Parliament are less likely to affect the durability of presidential cabinets.         "
"41","Nevertheless, similarities between presidential systems and parliamentary systems are far from being negligible. The President is the permanent formateur. He chooses the members of the cabinet. He bargains with party leaders over their support in the legislature. The choice of cabinet members of the president is similar to that of the prime minister in parliamentary systems in that both consider structural conditions—such as the size of their parties and the influence of opposition parties in the Parliament—when they choose cabinet members. For instance, when the government party is small and the president (or prime minister) has to worry about obstructionism of the opposition parties, he will include other parties in his cabinet.55 Since the factors that affect the formation of cabinets are alike, the factors affecting the dissolution of cabinets are also comparable. When the president or prime minister greatly needs the cooperation of opposition parties and includes them in the cabinet, the multi‐party cabinet is likely to experience policy disagreements between the president/prime minister and the other cabinet parties, which may lead some of the parties to leave the cabinet; in contrast, when the government party is in a safe majority in the Parliament, parliamentary obstructionism may be avoided with little effort, which will fortify the cabinet. Therefore, cabinet attributes—especially the number of cabinet parties and the strength of government parties in the Parliament—that have significant effects on the stability of parliamentary cabinets in Western Europe are also capable of explaining the duration of presidential cabinets.         "
"42","Next, the stochastic events theorists need to focus more on cabinet performance in key policy areas. When a cabinet improves the country's economy, for instance, the popularity of the cabinet tends to rise, and cabinet leaders thus find little incentive to leave the government. Even when an unpredicted exogenous shock, such as inflation, hits a country, if a cabinet succeeds in overcoming the crisis, the cabinet leaders are likely to stay in the government. Hence, the economic performance of the cabinet, rather than the occurrence of an economic crisis, has more‐pronounced effects on cabinet duration, which should also apply to parliamentary democracies."
"43","Finally, we need to check whether the economic performance of cabinets is related to certain cabinet attributes. If there is a significant relationship, the cabinet performance cannot be a stochastic event, because it is predictable based on the attributes of the cabinet. Tsebelis assumes that the economic performance of less‐fragmented and less‐polarized cabinets is better than that of more‐fragmented and more‐polarized cabinets, since the former can more quickly respond to varying economic situations.56 Nonetheless, prompt responses do not always guarantee successful outcomes.         "
"44","The ordinary least squares results in Table 3 show that the economic performance of cabinets is not notably related to any cabinet attributes. That is, no institutional features of the cabinet substantially explain economic performance. When I include parliamentary attributes in the model, the result does not change, which informs us that it is almost impossible for cabinet performance to be predicted by structural variables and that the cabinet performance is thus a stochastic event.         "
"45","This paper explains why some presidential cabinets are dissolved (before the next scheduled election), while others survive. The findings of the paper can be summarized as follows. First, fragmentation in the cabinet and the strength of cabinet parties in Parliament have great effects on cabinet duration in presidential systems. The more parties a president includes in his cabinet, and the fewer seats cabinet‐represented parties occupy in the Parliament, the more likely it is for the cabinet to be dissolved. Second, the bargaining environment in the Parliament, which includes electoral volatility and polarization, has little effect on the stability of presidential cabinets. Third, fragmentation of the Parliament affects the number of parties in the cabinet. The more fragmented a Parliament is, the more likely is the cabinet to be formed with multiple parties, given the difficulty one party faces in obtaining a majority of parliamentary seats. Forth, exogenous economic crisis does not significantly affect cabinet survival. Finally, as a country's economy improves, the president's cabinet is more likely to survive."
"46","These findings indicate that in presidential systems, cabinet attributes are far more important than parliamentary attributes for the stability of cabinets, and that cabinet durability hinges on performance in key policy areas rather than on the effects of exogenous crises. Sometimes fragmented or polarized Parliaments dissolve presidential cabinets through fragmented or polarized cabinets. Nevertheless, since the president and Parliament do not rely on mutual confidence, cabinet characteristics (and stability) are less affected by the parliamentary environment in presidential systems than in parliamentary ones. Thus, by and large, the existing cabinet attributes theories on the duration of parliamentary cabinets in Western Europe also best explain the duration of presidential cabinets. In addition, even when an exogenous crisis hits a country, a capable cabinet can prolong its survival. During worldwide financial crises, for instance, cabinets tend to have greater difficulty growing the economy, yet a prompt and proper performance in response to the crisis can minimize the risk of dissolution of the cabinet. Unexpected shocks may thus play a more‐complex role than is typically articulated in stochastic event theories."
"47","The effects of Parliament attributes are, however, far from negligible in presidential systems. Some Parliament attributes affect cabinet attributes by virtue of the fact that the former constitutes the environment from which a cabinet is formed. For instance, while fragmented Parliaments rarely terminate cabinets in presidential systems, cabinets are highly likely to consist of multiple parties where the Parliaments are fragmented. Those fragmented cabinets, in turn, tend to be dissolved more easily. Hence, electoral reforms that are intended to decrease the number of parties in the Parliament, such as synchronizing presidential and legislative elections, and shifting from proportional to majoritarian electoral systems, can also contribute to the stability of presidential cabinets."
"48","To be sure, I should be careful not to overgeneralize my findings, since the data used in this study come from 10 Latin American presidential democracies in part of the twentieth century. Thus, what I find from those Latin American countries may not be identical to what others would find from countries in other parts of the world or in the first decade of the twenty‐first century. I encourage future work to test my findings against presidential systems in different regions and times."
"49","In the Cox model, the hazard rate for dissolution of a cabinet at time t is defined as            "
"50","Therefore, exp(βi) is the hazard rate of the ith independent variable (m≥ i ≥ 1). We can measure the effects of independent variables on the duration of cabinets by looking at the change in the hazard rate for each independent variable as we change the variable value.         "
