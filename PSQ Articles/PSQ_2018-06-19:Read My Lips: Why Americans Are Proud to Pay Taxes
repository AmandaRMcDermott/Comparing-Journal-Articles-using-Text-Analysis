"1","Researching a topic of popular interest, as tax policy most definitely is, raises some challenges. First, these issues are often understood differently by politicians and journalists than they are by scholars. In this case, political discourse mostly operates under the assumption that Americans strongly dislike taxes, whereas most researchers would say that Americans are ambivalent about them—dissatisfied with some aspects but supportive of others, as they are with many policies. This presents a challenge because new research should inform public and scholarly debates alike. This book has something to offer both, but it is an especially powerful antidote to the popular notion that Americans despise taxes."
"2","A second challenge has to do with the thorny question of how informed the public is about taxes, as it is often difficult to identify exactly how much information is necessary to form reasonable positions on issues. This comes into play here because the tax code is notoriously complex. I am not an expert on taxes and thus was eager to learn more about them from this book. I did, but I was also left searching for more."
"3","To take a key example, one of the main arguments of the book begins with the finding that Americans tend to associate the word “taxes” with income taxes rather than with payroll and sales taxes. This matters, Vanessa S. Williamson argues, because the latter are borne more by the poor than the former are, and so Americans tend to underestimate the number of taxpayers at the bottom end. This, in turn, results in a distorted view of this group as takers and not contributors. To be clear, Americans are also troubled by rich people who evade their taxpaying responsibilities. Indeed, highlighting the pervasiveness of this sentiment, and the widespread understanding of and support for a progressive tax system more generally, across the ideological spectrum, is a major contribution of this book.         "
"4","Still, returning to the bottom end, there is no discussion of whether the kinds of taxes that are paid equate with the kinds of benefits that are received. For instance, if state sales taxes do not contribute as much as federal and state income taxes to poverty assistance programs, then would it matter if sales taxpayers were recognized as “true” taxpayers? Or does it matter only that one is perceived as contributing something? In any event, if the principle of progressivity is so strongly endorsed, should it not be acceptable that some take more than they contribute? Or is it biases toward perceived groups of takers, such as immigrants and minorities, that matter more?         "
"5","These are empirical and normative questions that have engaged scholars for years but are not fully taken up in this book. Interestingly, it was in the superb summaries of the interviewees (in an appendix) that the salience of this question—of where the money comes from and where it goes—emerged. The interviewees seem to confirm prior research: when there is greater transparency, as in the case of property and payroll taxes, and at the local level, public views are often less polarized; but in the case of income and sales taxes, things are understandably murkier and thus more contested."
"6","Williamson's use of open‐ended interviews and an original representative survey have a payoff for pollsters, too, as she uncovers some interpretations of concepts at odds with how they were intended to be interpreted, such as government waste and foreign aid. Overall, her methodological approach is a productive one in both affirming the ambivalent stance toward taxes that many Americans strike and raising possible lines of new research and political discourse."
