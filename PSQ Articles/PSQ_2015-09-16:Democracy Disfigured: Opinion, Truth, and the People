"1","In 2014, a dry economic work about inequality became an international best seller. Our collective anxiety about inequality has, for the moment, elbowed aside others concerns about the fate of real‐world democracies. But there is little reason to believe that inequality is the only threat to self‐governing regimes. In Democracy Disfigured: Opinion, Truth, and the People, a leading political theorist, Nadia Urbinati, adroitly calls our attention to other significant challenges to democracy: the romanticization of technocratic procedures and management, the rise of populist leaders and movements dissatisfied with the back‐and‐forth of democratic life, and the pacification of political citizenship. It is not difficult to find concrete contemporary examples of each of these troubling trends. By revealing the internal structure of these challenges, Urbinati's work has set the direction for future debates in democratic theory.         "
"2","Calling the intellectual sweep of Democracy Disfigured capacious would be an understatement. It grapples with the character of democratic life by zooming from critical discussions of Plato and Rousseau to contemporary theorists such as David Estlund and Philip Pettit and back to Hannah Arendt, Norberto Bobbio, Ernesto Laclau, and Robert Michels. Enlightening exemplars of political conduct are drawn from ancient Athens and Rome, Napoleonic France, and contemporary Europe and the United States, to name just a few of the sites one visits while reading this work.         "
"3","Urbinati begins her analysis by arguing that democracy, rightly understood, has a set of institutions and practices—including formal democratic political procedures and popular activity and debate—that constitute the core of the practice, giving definition to its figure. A procedurally sound democracy is not, Urbinati argues, dependent on generating good outcomes to sustain its normative legitimacy—its legitimacy turns on the equal political liberty of its members."
"4","The subsequent sections of the book consider three trends with the potential to distort or disfigure our understanding of both democracy and how it functions. The first focuses on the quality of political outcomes and underweights, Urbinati argues, the intrinsic value of democratic opinion and procedures. The second, populism, reifies a unified people and its leaders above the political process. The final trend is the acceptance of political passivity as a normal or even admirable feature of political life. The chapter on populism, its character, and history is particularly valuable. The practice, which appears real and fixed enough when confronted in the world, seems to evade theoretical analysis or definition. Urbinati's handling of populism is deft and enlightening, illustrating how populists remix key democratic ideas such as representation and popular will at the expense of democracy's institutional life."
"5","An ambitious work such as Democracy Disfigured naturally opens some theoretical doors in the process of closing others. Urbinati, for example, considers each of the challenges to self‐government as the recurrent outgrowths of democratic politics. How, then, do we know that Urbinati's procedural conception of democracy is the core or true conception of democracy's figure rather than those rival conceptions of democracy and democratic life? Perhaps procedural democracy is the right conception of democracy by virtue of some criteria external to the democratic process itself. But if this is correct, what is particularly undemocratic about the epistemic or consequentialist theories that place the existence of those criteria at the core of their political theories?         "
"6","This is just one of the fascinating questions raised by this challenging book. In other words, Democracy Disfigured is a success, repaying careful attention to its original treatments of works and problems drawn from the full history of democratic practice and theory.         "
