"1","This is one book that does not suffer from a lack of ambition. Paul A. Djupe and Brian R. Calfano set out to change not only the way that scholars think about religion's influence on public opinion but also the methods that scholars use to investigate those relationships."
"2","Djupe and Calfano are critical of research based on what they term the “religious commitment” approach. Typically, this work begins by identifying an individual's religious tradition—mainline Protestant, evangelical Protestant, Jewish, and so on. The next step is to assess an individual's commitment to that tradition through measures of their beliefs and practices, for instance, their rate of church attendance. Finally, this information is used to document different types of political variation."
"3","For the authors, this strategy is indefensible because it assumes that message content is constant across a religious tradition. But the reality is that one Catholic priest may talk about social justice in every homily, while another scrupulously avoids political commentary. Hence, religion and politics research, Djupe and Calfano argue, must be seriously concerned with how people are exposed to religion."
"4","Therein lies the main contribution of the book. In a series of empirical chapters, the authors vary exposure to a religious message, seeking to examine how religious elites communicate both inside and outside of their congregations and how political elites use religion to communicate with the wider public. Many of the findings are intriguing. The authors explain how Republicans can use coded religious messages—a subtle reference to a hymn or parable—to increase their support among evangelicals who recognize the cue. They provide evidence that some evangelicals become more supportive of environmental protection when a clergy member explains that his or her own decision was arrived at after prayer and Bible study. In another chapter, they explore how clergy who prime inclusive or exclusive religious values might thereby indirectly affect opinion on foreign interventions."
"5","The second contribution that God Talk makes is its forceful argument that the religion and American politics subfield should embrace experimental methodology. The authors conducted a dizzying range of experiments involving students at places such as Texas A&M, North Texas, Missouri State, and Ohio State universities. Other experiments were completed through the mail or even in places of worship. The authors make a compelling case for the usefulness of these treatments. They were able to craft affordable research designs, and they present their results effectively by means of clear and simple figures. Some will continue to question the external validity of anything but field experiments. But given that this work is also increasingly popular, this book is a timely testament to the potential of survey‐embedded experimental tools.         "
"6","While ambition is always something to applaud, too much ambition can be a problem, and God Talk walks a fine line on that point. The empirical chapters all explore different questions, there are often multiple studies found within a single chapter, and many of the experiments also consider other factors such as race, gender, or the presence of competing messages. So it can be very difficult for the reader to keep track of the essential findings. Further, by trying to tackle so many questions at once, the authors wind up including an oppressive amount of literature review. It is not a good sign when, at multiple points, readers are told that it is alright if they just want to skip ahead (pp. 19, 111). A more focused book would have been a better book.         "
"7","Still, scholars with a broad interest in American religion and opinion will likely find some part of God Talk to be of use.         "
