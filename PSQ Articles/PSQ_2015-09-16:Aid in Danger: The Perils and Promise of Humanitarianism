"1","The double entendre of the title, Aid in Danger, neatly hints at the concerns that animate Larissa Fast's analysis of the causes and consequences of the upward trend in deliberate attacks on national and international humanitarian aid personnel. On the practical level, she identifies “external” and “internal” sources of danger faced by aid organizations. External sources—those beyond aid organizations' control—are familiar and often debated. Fast is not concerned with any particular external threat but instead with the humanitarian community's almost exclusive attention to the category “external” because it removes the agency of humanitarians and exempts them from personal responsibility for their security. She makes the case for giving equal attention to internal security considerations, such as the public behavior of off‐duty international personnel, and paying close attention to local community dynamics when hiring national staff. Emphasis on the security effects of daily decisions and activities is, in itself, a contribution to the literature on humanitarian aid.         "
"2","On a deeper level, Fast argues that the entire humanitarian enterprise is in danger of losing its essence because of “the gradual erosion of the principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence that safeguard the mercy‐oriented nature of humanitarian assistance” (p. 109). Fast's ambitious purpose is “to reclaim humanity as the central principle of humanitarianism” (p. 88) and thereby rescue humanitarian aid from the perils of overweening risk aversion, securitization, and professionalization. This is the more interesting but less convincing part of the book."
"3","Fast recounts a history of attacks on humanitarian aid, from the early 1900s onward, to make the point that safe humanitarian action belongs to a “mythical past.” While she acknowledges there is some merit to the predominant explanation for the increase in violence against aid organizations—namely, politicization of aid in conflict zones—she contends that the bigger problem is “an exclusionary analysis . . . [that] promotes humanitarians as exceptions, operating outside of the conflict dynamics that surround them” (p. 3). The attitude of “humanitarian exceptionalism” undermines compassion for the suffering of others upon which humanitarianism is built and replaces it with aid workers' physical, social, and cultural alienation from the people they want to help. According to Fast, the exceptionalist analysis of security risks has resulted in the adoption of “hard security” practices and attitudes—think of offices surrounded by razor wire and guards. She suggests that hardening potential targets is ineffective, as indicated by the increase in fatal attacks."
"4","Her solution is to urge humanitarian nongovernmental organizations and United Nations agencies to embrace a “relational approach . . . [that] sees humanitarians as embedded within, as opposed to separate from, the conflict system and questions the assumptions of exceptionalism even as it affirms the value of humanitarian principles” (p. 113). As part of the conflict system, humanitarians ought to minimize their reliance on alienating security strategies of protection and deterrence. Instead, they should rely on the relational “consent‐based approaches of acceptance and negotiated access” (p. 217). That approach requires acquiring and maintaining the agreement of all stakeholders to allow humanitarian access to those in need. The main attractions of acceptance are its inherently relational nature, its recognition of internal and external dangers, and its consistency with humanitarian principles."
"5","Unfortunately, Fast writes, “its effectiveness as a security management approach remains primarily anecdotal in many contexts and not empirically tested” (p. 218). One is left to wonder why an aid organization that is responsible for the safety of its personnel would adopt a security strategy that relies on the constant good will of belligerents and for which there is only anecdotal support. Examination of the feasibility of a soft approach to security, in the context of the bureaucratic and organizational incentives to control the operational environment, would have strengthened an otherwise interesting study. Despite this element of naiveté, Fast has written a thoughtful book that the leaders of humanitarian organizations ought to read."
