"1","In this brilliant new book, J. Arch Getty upends the idea that the Soviet Union was ever governed by a hierarchical or bureaucratic Communist Party. Instead, he argues, an informal, personal patronage system of networked politics endured from the rise of the Muscovite princes in the fifteenth century, straight through to President Vladimir Putin today. While the players changed, as did the social backgrounds and “clans” that defined them, the practices remained the same. The book pays special attention to the period from 1920 to 1937, the time when brutal Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was consolidating his rule. It is based on Getty's 20 years of archival research in Russia, and his thorough review of what recent Russian historians have written about their own past."
"2","History books are not often reviewed by political scientists, but this one has great relevance for understanding Russian politics today. Getty argues that the patterns of the past are followed unthinkingly (what philosopher Pierre Bourdieu called “habitus”). Putin is not merely imitating the tsars in his choice of cultural symbols; instead Russian elites believe that he serves the same function as the tsars of old, keeping diverse political clans and their leaders (the “boyars”) in balance, preventing the civil war or chaos that a country of Russia's vast size and relative emptiness would face if it were left open to competition by those who retain loyal militias."
"3","Getty cites profusely the debts he owes to other scholars of the Soviet era who made similar, more‐general observations about the continuity of Russian political culture. But Practicing Stalinism is filled with fascinating new details about how the Communist Party bureaucracy itself operated, including in outlying regions far away from Moscow, and describes how even Stalin's bloody Great Purge can be read as a series of personalized contests over informal clan dominance. In a story that resonates with recent headlines about how various factions of Putin's security forces have launched investigations against each other, Getty describes how personality‐driven clans also dominated Stalin's security forces, collecting dirt against each other that led to cycles of arrest. And, according to Getty's well‐documented research, the impetus for the spike of mass violence in the USSR in 1937 came from regional party bosses desperate to keep their patronage networks in place when Stalin changed the election rules, forcing local candidates to face secret popular balloting.         "
"4","Getty may overstate his case at points. He has a tendency to make generalized pronouncements about what the culture was and what clan leaders did, supporting these claims with only a few examples, and forcing the reader to trust that the examples he chose were typical. Getty also talks about continuity without presenting a clear chronological narrative. His examples for particular concepts jump from the early 1920s to the mid‐1930s, without using what qualitative political scientists know as the process‐tracing method of Alexander George. This is particularly disconcerting in Getty's final chapter, where he jumps from Stalin to Putin while waving his hand over the intervening decades."
"5","Practicing Stalinism is nonetheless an intellectual tour de force. While it will undoubtedly provoke controversy among historians, it cannot be ignored. Anyone who wishes to understand Russian politics today will find Getty's book useful, as will scholars interested in comparative state building. While the book is richly footnoted and aimed toward a scholarly audience, it is written in a sufficiently engaging style that even armchair aficionados of Russian politics are likely to enjoy it.
