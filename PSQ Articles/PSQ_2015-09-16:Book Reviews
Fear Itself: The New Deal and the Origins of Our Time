"1","With World War II raging, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved to guarantee suffrage for 10 million Americans soldiers. According to conventional wisdom, opposition would have been “political suicide.” Scholars later read the measure as a war‐inspired, all‐American expansion of the vote. Ira Katznelson digs deeper—as he does again and again in Fear Itself—and recovers the lost history. Soldier voting threatened a tiny crack into Southern white supremacy. In two congressional sessions, seething with controversy, the Northern Democrats abetted their Southern colleagues (in order to keep the party unified). When the Northerners finally wobbled, Republicans pitched in to aid the Southerners. In the end, Congress gutted the bill, humiliated the Roosevelt administration, and offered an early intimation of the antigovernment, race‐inflected coalition that is so familiar today. Less than a decade later, the United States was at war again. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency declared that the atom bomb should be deployed before Moscow could fully develop its arsenal. President Harry S. Truman dispatched atomic weapons to the Pacific while a handful of men secretly discussed unleashing Armageddon.         "
"2","Katznelson's extraordinary book—broad, deep, powerful, and moving—sweeps these two moments into the same historical narrative. Fear Itself rereads the New Deal as a triumph and a tragedy that made contemporary America and its state.         "
"3","The book's title refers to the three great fears that confronted Americans in the 1930s and 1940s. First, could chaotic democracies possibly compete against robust dictatorships bristling with power and energy? “If this country ever needed a Mussolini,” lamented one Pennsylvania congressman, “it needs one now.”"
"4","A second fear leapt out of an arms race that created a nightmare capacity and pressed both speed and secrecy onto government. Senator Harry Truman, rooting out government waste, stumbled onto the vast Manhattan Project and promptly faced a blank wall. Senator Truman's blank wall was the constitutional point of no return, concludes Katznelson, not President Truman's decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima."
"5","Third, white Southerners feared for segregation. The Southern Democrats made the entire New Deal possible. However, they extracted a terrible price: every New Deal program—no exceptions—had to be calibrated around white supremacy. Democrats could have their National Recovery Administrations if and only if they averted their eyes and said nothing when gangs seized a black man and—to recall one of the many news reports in Fear Itself—castrated him, made him eat his genitals, and dragged him to death before a cheering mob.         "
"6","Confronting these fears, the New Deal constructed a new, Janus‐like American state: on the one side, an interest group regime that dissolved the national interest into an open, pluralistic, and biased governing process and, on the other, a crusading state that celebrated military virtues, subverted foreign governments, constructed bases around the globe, and did its business in the shadows. Future Americans were left to find a balance between their raucous pluralistic democracy and their secretive military state."
"7","Katznelson has written a fresh and bold account about the origins of our time. His work offers three great clarion calls to fellow scholars. First, break free of your silos. Fear Itself is possible only because Katznelson moves fluidly across subfields and boundaries—Congress, international relations, American history, Southern politics, and more. Second, honor the narrative; Katznelson insists on telling the story and speaks fluently to both scholars and broader audiences. And, finally, connect careful historiography to the broad intellectual discourse of the past and present. The final result is an extraordinary contribution to our understanding of our history, of our politics, and of America itself.         "
