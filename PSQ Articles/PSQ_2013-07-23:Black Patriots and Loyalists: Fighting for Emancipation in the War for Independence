"1","According to Alan Gilbert, the American Revolution involved two “inextricably linked” wars: one external, for independence from Britain, and the other internal, for the emancipation of slaves (p. 5). Developments in each war shaped the outcome of the other."
"2","The war for independence sparked cries for liberty on both sides of the Atlantic and among people from all walks of life, including slaves and former slaves who volunteered to fight for freedom in larger numbers than previously has been supposed. British and American military and civil leaders wrestled with the question of what to do about arming the would‐be recruits. Both armies ended up providing opportunities for freedom for the aspirant men, but these were limited by the prejudice, fear, and greed of leaders on both sides of the conflict. Missed opportunities to fully embrace the equality of blacks in the military—as well as the end of slavery—hurt the cause of the Americans and the British alike, prolonging the war and ensuring the continuation of slavery into future generations."
"3","Many readers will be familiar with parts of this story as told by other scholars. For example, Henry Wiencek's Imperfect God covers General George Washington's gradual evolution in thinking about accepting blacks into the American forces. But while previous historians and political scientists have addressed the story of African Americans in the age of the American Revolution, no one has pulled the disparate threads of the story together in one place quite like Gilbert does here. The author refuses to let the story of the quest for emancipation languish when he moves the discussion to the war for independence and vice versa. His ability to explain developments on both the British and American home fronts is particularly insightful. The result is one unfolding history that shows how the Revolutionary War resulted in freedom for some but not for all, in part because white Americans and white Britons were united in their anxiety over the possibility of upending the social order.         "
"4","Because Gilbert pays much attention to the unfolding thought of military and political leaders, this book is more intellectual than military history. But unlike many books of intellectual history, this one does not focus entirely on the elite. Gilbert teases out the thinking of slaves and former slaves, North and South, from court documents, military records, and other primary sources. Men like Colonel Tye appear not only as guerilla warriors (in Tye's case on behalf of the British cause) but also as independent actors who inspired other blacks to fight for freedom and whose military actions were never entirely under the control of the regular military men who expected to take charge of them."
"5","Gilbert takes the story beyond the Revolutionary War years, as blacks who supported the British war effort fled the United States in search of freedom and self government, first in Nova Scotia and later in Sierra Leone; as blacks who remained in the United States struggled for freedom at home; and as the quest for freedom that began during the American Revolution spread to people in other nations."
"6","Black Patriots and Loyalists is clearly written, but numerous characters and copious excerpts from documents make it tedious reading for all but those who have a particular interest in the subject matter. Scholars and students will appreciate the encyclopedic nature of the documentation, as well as the extensive bibliography.         "
