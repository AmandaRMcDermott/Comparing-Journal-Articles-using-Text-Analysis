"1","The recent flurry of books on the religion clauses of the First Amendment suggests the durability of both free exercise and disestablishment, as well as the continuing contestations over their interpretation. Although religious diversity has characterized America since the colonial period, diversity has only increased in recent decades (especially since the Hart–Celler Act of 1965), prompting jurists, politicians, scholars, and Americans themselves to consider anew the ramifications of the First Amendment."
"2","Dennis J. Goldford's contribution to this conversation, The Constitution of Religious Freedom: God, Politics, and the First Amendment, argues that “government shall not take a position, nor do anything that amounts to taking a position, on the truth or worth of religion, religious beliefs and values, and religious practices” (p. 213). The U.S. government, Goldford says, is a secular institution and not a theological institution capable of rendering judgment on the merits of particular religions. When the government does so, the author contends, “it creates the structure of implicit coercion by forcing us to choose between what I call our civic identity and our religious identity” (p. 223).         "
"3","Goldford builds his argument on constitutional theory, not constitutional history, because the latter is too contradictory; and he argues that the First Amendment protects religious freedom, not religion itself. This, he says, is more than a sematic distinction because to assert that the First Amendment protects religion places the government back in the position of adjudicating the relative merits of particular religions. “Protecting religious freedom means protecting your right to believe in and belong to a religion or belief system different from my own,” he writes. “Protecting religion does not necessarily mean protecting your right to believe differently” (p. 240). Goldford also points out that free exercise is positive and properly belongs to the individual, whereas the disestablishment clause instructs the government on what it cannot do.         "
"4","The Framers of the Constitution, Goldford argues, recognized the need for two complementary religion clauses in the First Amendment: “The assumption is that government can threaten religious liberty not only when it requires you to reject or deny your religious beliefs or values, but also when it requires you to affirm the religious beliefs or practices that are not your own” (p. 236)."
"5","The author's argument that the nation is not essentially a religious community is certainly sound, but I wonder if at least a brief discussion of Robert Bellah's civil religion argument might not have been worth the detour to underscore his case. Unfortunately, Goldford also uses the deeply offensive term “Christian Right” to refer to the religious right; millions of American Christians do not recognize anything resembling their faith in the political agenda of the religious right."
"6","These cavils aside, Goldford has produced a lively and well‐considered book on a vitally important topic; his point that the First Amendment protects religious freedom and not religion is an important and helpful distinction. “An attempt to make politics about God,” he concludes, “is an attempt, witting or unwitting, to change radically the character of the American constitutional order” (p. 244). Because no religion in the United States can claim a majority—even Christians are notoriously divided by doctrine and denomination—we are, all of us as Americans, members of religious minorities, including nonbelievers. We all, therefore, have a stake in ensuring that the interpretation of the First Amendment is not hijacked by sectarians, be they religious or judicial."
