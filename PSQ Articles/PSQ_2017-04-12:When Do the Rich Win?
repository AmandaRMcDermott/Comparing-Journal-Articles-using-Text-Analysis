"1","A MAJOR THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION for representative democracy is that it puts power in the hands of the people. Political scientists have tested whether this actually is true by assessing the degree to which policy reflects citizens' preferences. Recent work finds that public policy is frequently responsive to the will of the people, but that there is significant variation across policy domains.1 There may be variation in responsiveness to different people as well. Indeed, recent work suggests that policy is responsive primarily, or even solely, to the richest Americans, at the expense of the middle class and poor.2"
"2","The finding of such pronounced inequality in political representation clearly contrasts with the normative basis for representative democracy. It is not entirely surprising, however. The rich have more time and money to give to campaigns, and to politics more generally.3 They also tend to vote more often, and evidence suggests that voters are better represented than nonvoters.4 That the rich are better represented than the poor is what we might therefore expect. For similar reasons, we might expect that the middle also are better represented than the poor.         "
"3","Perhaps more surprising would be that the rich are better represented than the middle. The median voter carries special importance in representative democracy.5 To the extent that governments react to voters, they should be especially responsive to the middle; tyranny of the majority is the major concern in classic empirical democratic theory, after all.6 Yet recent research by Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page argues that the preferences of average‐income Americans play only a marginal role in the formation of policy. Indeed, the authors claim that “[w]hen a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites or with organized interests, they generally lose.”7"
"4","Scholars who find differences in policy representation across groups focus on a model that looks like the following:            "
"5","We consider this issue here. Our analysis is heavily influenced by the possibility that  and  are often not very different. Indeed, previous research already has shown that preferences across economic groups, especially the middle and rich, do not differ much in many policy areas.9 In these instances, it does not matter whether public policy is more responsive to one group—policy will end up in the same place. This is not to say that it does not matter theoretically, of course—we ideally would want policy to respond to all citizens.10 We are acknowledging here only that it does not matter practically, as there will be no substantive difference in policy outputs.         "
"6","Strong agreement between income cohorts thus complicates an analysis of unequal representation, making it difficult to identify the target of responsiveness.11 The consequences of highly correlated independent variables for regression analysis are well known in the statistical literature, after all.12 We propose focusing on the subset of policies for which there is disagreement across majorities of middle‐ and high‐income citizens. We derive this subset from Gilens's data set, made available through the Russell Sage Foundation website, which is the same data set used by Gilens and Page13; it provides public preferences imputed across income percentiles for a wide range of specific policies.14"
"7","By adopting this approach, our analysis directly addresses Gilens and Page's central conclusion, namely, that “when a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites … they generally lose.”15 We would argue that the set of policies on which we focus are those of greatest theoretical interest as well, as they allow us to more directly assess policy congruence with opinion. Accordingly, we use these data to consider two crucial questions: How often do the preferences of the middle and rich disagree? When they disagree, who wins?         "
"8","The analysis proceeds as follows: We first compare the preferences of the middle and rich and find that they rarely disagree; in nearly 90 percent of cases, majorities of the middle and rich are in agreement. Next, we investigate what happens when the two groups disagree and find that the rich win more often than the middle, although not strikingly—or significantly—so. We then consider the kinds of policies on which the middle and rich win. Our suspicion is that readers of Gilens and Page (and related work) have been drawing the inference that the rich advocate and win on conservative policies that give them economic advantages, such as tax cuts, over the objections of the middle (and poor). We find very little evidence to support such an inference, however. Finally, we bring the preferences of the poor into the analysis. The results indicate that the poor do slightly worse than the other income groups, although even they occasionally win over the preferences of the middle or rich. What inequality we do observe appears to come mostly from negative power, where the middle and rich effectively block many of the policies favored by the poor.         "
"9","As already noted, the potential for observable unequal policy representation depends on differences in preferences between income groups. Let us consider differences using Gilens's data set. The data include responses to 1,863 survey questions about potential policies over the 1981–2002 period. Of those, 84 have mixed outcomes, such that the policy in question was partly adopted. Following Gilens, we drop these partially adopted policies. This means that our analysis rests on the same 1,779 policies that Gilens and Page analyze.16"
"10","Gilens estimates levels of support for each of these policies across various income percentiles using observed information about support among income groups.17 For our analysis, we focus on the support of those at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, the same percentiles used by Gilens.18 Relying on imputed data limits what we can infer, but the nature of the opinion data, in which income questions vary in both response categories and availability, makes the imputation necessary. Relying on Gilens's imputations also has the added advantage of allowing us to assess the structure of preferences that formed the basis for what is perhaps the most influential political science article on political inequality to date.         "
"11","Figure 1 plots middle‐ and high‐income support for each of the 1,779 policies. Middle‐income support is plotted on the x‐axis and high‐income support on the y‐axis; policies that passed are in black, while those that failed are in gray. The diagonal dashed line shows the point at which the two groups' preferences are identical, thus also distinguishes policies that receive more support from the rich (above the line) from policies that receive more support from the middle (below the line).         "

"14","As Gilens and Page note, preferences are very highly correlated. The Pearson's r between the two is a striking 0.94. Gilens and Page report that the correlation drops to 0.78 when adjusting for correlated measurement error, although it is unclear whether we are dealing with correlated measurement error or simply correlated preferences.19 This complicates regression analysis, as discussed earlier. We do not use regression in our main analysis, but we do present results paralleling Gilens and Page's methodology in the Appendix. Those results support the findings we present in the body of this article; though note that, in contrast with the methods we employ, regression analyses offer very limited information about how often groups actually win.         "
"15","It is clear from Figure 1 that there is a positive relationship between the preferences of both the middle and rich and government action. In the lower‐left corner, policies without much support from either the middle or rich are likely to fail, indicated by the predominance of gray dots, although some of these still pass. In the upper‐right corner, policies with support from both the middle and rich are more likely to succeed, although many of these fail as well. Consistent with previous research, the relationship between opinion and policy is far from perfect.         "
"16","The spread of points in Figure 1 also indicates that while the relationship between middle and rich preferences is strong, it is also not perfect. Table 1 provides an alternative analysis of the same data, focused on majority support or opposition among the middle‐ and high‐income groups using 50 percent as the cut point between support and opposition. Here we can see that the middle and rich agree on 1,594 policies: the 616 that both groups oppose and the 978 that both groups favor. This amounts to 89.6 percent of the 1,799 policies. To be clear: although the magnitude of support may differ across the middle and rich, on 89.6 percent of these policies, there is majority support or opposition in both income groups. On all of these policies, an analysis of “majoritarian congruence” would predict exactly the same outcome.20"
"17","A majority of the middle disagree with a majority of the rich on just 185 policies—78 that the middle favor and the rich do not and 107 that the rich favor but the middle do not. Although this is not evident in the table, when the middle and rich disagree, it is often not by much, 10.9 percentage points on average. While seemingly small, this is larger and significantly different from the preference gap when they agree, which is a mere 5.2 percentage points (p < .001). Overall, then, there is a tremendous amount of agreement in preferences, but there are also instances where majorities of the middle and rich clearly disagree. These are the policies that allow us to assess whose preferences win out in the policymaking process.         "
"18","This raises an important difference between our analyses and that of Gilens and Page: whereas their work examines the magnitude of support in both income groups, we focus here on dichotomous majority support (within each income group). This has implications for tests of influence. For instance, when the middle and rich agree, policies are about 10 percentage points more likely to be passed (or blocked) if support from the rich is greater (less) than support from the middle (see Table A1 in the Appendix). This may help explain why Gilens and Page find evidence in their regression analyses for the rich winning over the middle (see the additional analyses and discussion related to Table  A3 in the Appendix).21"
"19","Our interest is in addressing what happens when the middle and rich disagree, and we thus do not consider this dichotomous approach contentious—indeed, we regard it as a more appropriate way of linking preferences with the passage or failure of policies. The approach fits with a large body of previous work on policy congruence, which focuses on the passage of policies and their match with opinion majorities.22 Perhaps most importantly, it directly addresses what Gilens and Page conclude on the basis of their results, namely, that when a majority of citizens disagree with economic elites, they generally lose.23 We now turn to testing that proposition.         "
"20","Figure 2 illustrates the way in which we narrow the data set. The 1,594 policies on which the middle and rich agree cannot provide any leverage on questions about who wins—these polices are shown here as light gray circles. The remaining 185 policies—instances in which a majority of one group support the policy while a majority of the other do not—can offer more direct information. As we have seen, there are 78 cases in which the middle favor the policy but the rich oppose it. These are the cases below the dashed line, illustrated as black squares for policies that passed and gray squares for policies that failed. Above the dashed line there are the 107 cases, illustrated in the same way, in which a majority of the rich favor the bill while a majority of the middle oppose it. Based on these numbers, when preferences differ, it is more often the case that the rich favor passage and the middle prefer the status quo.         "
"21","Issues on Which People with Middle and High Incomes Disagree"
"22","Source: Authors’ analysis of Gilens's data.                     "
"23","What happens when preferences differ? Just how often do the rich win? We can see in Figure 2 that the rich do not always win: there is a mix of gray and black on both sides of the dashed line. A win for the rich over the middle can occur in two ways. The first is when a majority of the rich support the policy and the policy passes. These are the black squares above the line in Figure 2. The second is when a majority of the rich oppose the policy and the policy fails. These instances are indicated by the gray squares below the line in Figure 2. This sort of negative power can be quite powerful in the political arena. Our analysis must focus, then, on a combination of these positive and negative wins.         "
"24","Table 2 rearranges our cases in a way that clarifies how often—and how—each group wins. The first two columns show the number of policies favored by the middle (first column) and rich (second column). Rows split these policies according to whether the middle or rich won. There are 20 policies that received majority support from middle‐income respondents (and majority opposition from the rich) and passed. By contrast, there are 58 policies that were favored by the middle (and opposed by the rich) and did not pass. In the former cases, the middle won; in the latter, the rich won. Taking into account the first and second columns, the third column reports the total number of wins for each group. For the middle, there are 87 wins (47 percent of all cases); for the rich, there are 98 wins (53 percent of all cases). This small gap in win rates is not significantly different from 50 percent (p = .41).         "
"25","Results differ only a little when we further restrict our analysis to cases in which there is a clear gap between preferences of the middle and rich. For instance, for the 101 cases for which preferences differ by at least 10 percentage points—the same cutoff Gilens uses in some of his analyses24—the number of middle wins is 45 of 101; for the rich it is 56 of 101. Again, this difference is not statistically significant (p = .86).         "
"26","It is well known that it is harder to pass legislation in the United States than to block it, and it is important to consider how this matters. When doing so, the rich do slightly better. If a majority of the rich favor a policy and a majority of the middle oppose it, the policy is adopted 37 percent of the time; by contrast, when the middle favor a policy and the rich are opposed, the policy is adopted 26 percent of the time. The difference also is statistically significant (p = .05). Although the rich do slightly better here, they clearly do not dominate the middle.         "
"27","Over the 22‐year period of the study, the rich won just 11 times more than the middle; this is equivalent to the rich netting one bill every other year.25 Admittedly, this does not include all policy decisions taken, but it should include those salient, seemingly important ones—these are the policies about which survey organizations ask, after all.26 These results thus do not provide evidence of high‐income dominance of American politics. The rich are systematically overrepresented, it seems, but not by much. Of course, small differences in the number of policies can make a difference, particularly as they accumulate over time.27 This is more difficult to measure. We can, however, gain some sense of the accumulating policy impact by assessing the ideological orientation of the policies on which the middle and rich win.         "
"28","To what extent do rich wins push policy in a conservative direction? The answer to this question is significant. If rich wins always result in conservative policy, then they can make a rather large difference over time. We suspect that this is the inference many readers of recent scholarship have drawn. To our knowledge, however, this has not been systematically analyzed; it is not necessarily the case that all rich wins result in conservative policy. After all, we know that income is positively related to education, and while the former can push individuals toward the right, the latter can sometimes push toward the left.28 This has been well established in work on public opinion, and it may help explain why several of the rich wins in these data actually lead to leftward policy shifts. For example, a majority of the rich supported expanding access to abortion through the French abortion pill RU‐486; even though the middle were opposed, the policy changed.         "
"29","We thus explore the ideology of policies directly by coding the 185 on which the middle and rich disagree. Incomplete data forced us to drop 19 cases, leaving 166 observations in the analysis (see the Appendix for details). These 166 policies are coded for ideological direction by the authors. Policies that expand the size or scope of government, including raising revenue, are coded as ideologically liberal. Social issues also are coded according to their ideological location at that time. So, for example, conservative policies include enacting the North American Free Trade Agreement or restricting access to abortion or birth control; liberal policies include tax increases and affirmative action policies. Our coding allows for ideologically neutral policies as well; these tend to be concerned with foreign affairs and defense."
"30","The breakdown of these policies is shown in Figure 3. The left panel shows the 75 policies the middle won; the right panel shows the 91 policies the rich won. Black bars show policies that passed, while gray bars show blocked policies. Across the board, the prevalence of the latter in Figure 3 indicates that it is easier to block policies than pass policies, which is understandable given the bias of American political institutions toward the status quo.         "
"31","Ideological Orientation of Middle‐Income and Rich Policy Wins"
"32","Source: Authors’ coding of subset of Gilens's data. Black bars represent policies that passed, and gray bars represent policies that were blocked. See the Appendix for coding details.                     "
"33","Let us consider first the ideological complexion of blocked policies. The middle appear to block policies without regard to ideology—the gray bars on the left, middle, and right are roughly the same height. The rich, on the other hand, block nonideological and left‐leaning policies a little more frequently than conservative policies. The middle blocked 21 conservative policies and 20 liberal ones, whereas the rich blocked 20 liberal and 11 conservative policies."
"34","What about policies that passed? The middle passed ones that either lack a clear ideological bent or are on the left. Notably, there are no cases of the middle passing an ideologically conservative bill over the objections of the rich in the entire 22‐year data set, although there are 11 instances of the middle wanting a conservative bill that the rich block. Similarly, policies that the rich successfully pass tend to be slightly more conservative, although not strikingly so: the rich passed 8 liberal policies over the objections of the middle alongside 15 conservative polices, only slightly greater than the number of nonideological policies. One concern not addressed here is that the wealthy are especially successful with economic policies, but there is no evidence for this in the data (see the Appendix for a brief analysis)."
"35","In sum, because the rich win more than the middle (see Table 2), and because they prefer policies to the right (see Figure 3), policy change appears to be more conservative than it would be otherwise. The difference in any given year is small: of the 91 ideologically coded policies for which the rich won, only 15 of those pushed the status quo in a conservative direction. This represents a minority (41 percent) of policies that the rich passed over the objections of the middle—less than one conservative policy per year in the sample. Even so, as we have noted, such seemingly small annual differences may accumulate and have big effects over time.         "
"36","The mathematics of representative democracy suggest that policy should follow middle‐income preferences (the median voter). This makes a comparison of the rich versus the middle important—it is a test of whether high‐income citizens are prioritized over what representative democratic elections should (mathematically speaking) produce. At the same time, normative concerns about inequality are not just about the underrepresentation of the middle; they are also, if not more often, concerned with the underrepresentation of the poor. Political science does not have a predominant theory as to why the poor would be better represented than the middle or rich. The point is not that the poor should not matter, of course, just that we have stronger expectations about the representation of the middle and rich. So far, we have seen that the rich do a little better than the middle. What about the poor?"
"37","Analysis incorporating the poor reveals broad policy agreement among all three groups. Indeed, majorities of all three groups agree on 80.2 percent of the policies. That said, the variation between the poor and rich is much greater than that between the poor and middle. The Pearson's r correlation for the preferences of the poor and rich is 0.84, whereas the correlation between the poor and middle is 0.93. Recall from earlier that the correlation between the middle and rich is 0.94. So the poor and middle are roughly correlated to the same degree as the middle and rich. But what happens when they disagree?         "
"38","Table 3 shows the passage rate of policies for different combinations of support among the poor, middle, and rich. Note that this table includes the entire Gilens data set, not just the subset previously analyzed. The top half of the table shows policies for which either all three income groups are opposed (the first row) or only one of the three groups supports the policy. As we can see, even if majorities of all three groups oppose a policy, it still passes roughly 24 percent of the time. If the middle or rich want the policy, it passes more often, although still not most of the time. Even so, support from just the middle or rich seems to lead to bill passage more reliably (37.5 percent and 38.5 percent, respectively) than if just the poor support the bill (18.6 percent). Indeed, the passage rate for policies supported by just the poor is lower than the rate for bills unsupported by all groups (though this difference is not statistically significant). These results suggest that the middle and rich may be effective at blocking policies that the poor want.         "
"39","The bottom half of Table 3 shows what happens when various combinations of income groups support passage. Even if majorities of all three groups favor a policy (in the final row), that bill passes only 40 percent of the time. The rich seem most effective at blocking policies they do not want—if a majority of the middle and poor want a policy and the rich do not, the passage rate (20.4 percent) is comparable to the rate when all three groups are opposed. The rich do fare the best, but the middle do only slightly worse. Perhaps most notably, adding the support of the poor does not increase passage rates very much.         "
"40","It is not the case that the preferences of one income group totally dominate policymaking. The rich do slightly better than the middle, and the poor are least successful. But it is important not to lose sight of the fact that all three income groups agree on the vast majority of cases—more than 80 percent—and the differences in success rates when there is disagreement are not great. There are inequalities to be sure, but they are limited."
"41","Recent research suggests that U.S. policy is only responsive to the preferences of high‐income citizens. Does this mean that the rich always get the policies they want? That the middle (and poor) always lose? We know that disagreement in policy preferences is a necessary condition for differential representation. If majorities in different income cohorts prefer the same policy, we cannot distinguish whose preferences are being represented. The government might follow the rich, the middle, or even the poor, but policy will end at the same place. To assess the extent of differential representation, then, we have examined policies on which there is disagreement between majorities in different income groups."
"42","Results suggest that across a wide range of policies, disagreement on policy across income groups is rare. The preferences of poor, middle‐income, and rich Americans are correlated at surprisingly high rates. That said, income groups do not agree on all policies, and we find that when the middle and rich disagree, it is nearly a coin flip as to which group wins. Although this may be more encouraging (normatively speaking) than recent scholarship, a 50–50 split between the 50th and 90th income percentiles is not an especially equal result, given what the median voter theorem would expect. If middle‐income wins tend to move policy closer to the median voter, then these high‐income wins will tend to move policy further away. The poor seem to do less well than both of the other groups at getting policies they want passed, although the poor are often successful at blocking policies they dislike."
"43","The potential impact of high‐income wins may be greatest if the rich pass policies in one ideological direction. This is not what we observe, however. There is only a slight right‐leaning bias in adopted policies that were supported by the rich and opposed by the middle. Our analyses thus suggest that policy in America is only a little to the right of where it would be on balance if the preferences of those with average incomes determined policy."
"44","It is also important to keep in mind that not all policy decisions are about the preferences of the poor, middle, and rich. Party control of government is a key variable in the policymaking process. For instance, the rich seemed to do less well during the Lyndon B. Johnson and Barack Obama presidencies, with the Great Society programs, the Affordable Care Act, and other various tax increases. They appeared to do better under Ronald Reagan. It may be of some significance, then, that the time period analyzed (1981–2002) is one during which Republicans controlled the presidency the majority of the time, 14 years out of 22. Adding the post‐2002 period may well change results. This is, of course, a testable prediction, and one that we leave for future work."
"45","While explaining differences in the representation of income groups is important, what may be more pressing is understanding why there is such broad policy agreement across income groups. Why would the poorest and the richest Americans, who ostensibly have very different interests, agree to such an extent? This seemingly puzzling empirical finding emerges not only in our current analysis but in many, if not most, investigations of inequalities in representation by income groups. It may be that the striking similarity in preferences, not marginal differences in the representation of those preferences, is the real story. This perspective is in line with Larry M. Bartels's influential “Homer Gets a Tax Cut” article, in which the emphasis is on the troubling structure of public preferences for social welfare policy.29 Alternatively, it may be that income is not the most salient cleavage where policy preferences are concerned, or at least that there are many other competing cleavages. This, too, is another subject for future work—and an important one for those interested in inequalities in policy representation in the United States.*"
"46","Details on Coding Ideology"
"47","The full text of some survey questions is not readily available in the Gilens and Page data, but we were able to recover enough of the question text in 166 of the 185 cases to code by ideology. Questions for which the full text was not available were found using the Roper Center iPoll database. Partial question text from the Gilens data was matched to full question text in the Roper Center by searching for the partial question text and the year that the question was asked (indicated in the Gilens data). We could not find the full question text of 19 questions, and so we were forced to drop those from the analysis. The remaining 166 policies were then coded as liberal, conservative, or neutral. The authors coded these themselves, as the ideological direction of policies was clear when the full text was available. The data are available online at Harvard Dataverse, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UZSQTV.         "
"48","The Strength of Policy Support and Policy Adoption"
"49","Table A1 shows policy passage for policies that are jointly supported or opposed by the middle and rich across varying strengths of policy support or opposition by income group. For issues in the two leftmost columns, both the middle and rich supported the policy. For issues on the right, both groups opposed it. Note that when majorities of both groups agree (are either both opposed or both supportive), the rich are 10 percent more likely to be in greater support or opposition. This may help account for why scholars find differences in policy representation using regression‐based methods. See also the analysis in Table  A3 and the associated discussion.         "
"50","Policy Support and Adoption for Economic and Social Issues"
"51","Issues coded in Gilens's original data set as pertaining to the budget, economy and labor, and taxation were recoded as economic issues. Defense and terrorism were omitted, and all other issue areas were coded as social issues. Table A2 reproduces the analysis in Table 2, separating out just these recoded policies. Note that the win rates for the two issue types are not statistically different from one another.         "
"52","Analysis Using Regression"
"53","As noted earlier, regression is not the best way to analyze these data, as it does not provide adequate answers for the questions at hand.30 One article posits that Gilens and Page's analyses are questionable based on concerns about collinearity among the independent variables.31 That said, some readers may be interested in whether our results are the product of a change in the method of analysis rather than a focus on the subset of cases in which preferences of the middle and rich diverge. We examine this possibility here.         "
"54","We begin by reproducing the main result from Gilens and Page's article (Table 3 in that article), using structural equation modeling (SEM) to correct for measurement error. It is not clear that this is the correct approach with these data, as it may be that we are dealing with correlated preferences and not correlated errors,32 and the choice makes a difference, as we can see from Gilens and Page's analysis. To allow for both possibilities, we report results using the structural equation modeling approach as well as non‐SEM. The substantive message is the same in each case: when we subset the data to only those observations for which the middle and rich disagree, it is unclear whose preferences matter.         "
"55","Results are presented in Table A3. Model 1 is the structural equation model for the full set of cases used by Gilens and Page. Here we see that we can get very close to reproducing their results, although there are minor differences, perhaps because of our use of an SEM estimation in R rather than in AMOS. Model 2 shows results based on the same approach, but including only the instances on which a majority of the two groups agree. Note the similarities between Models 1 and 2—similarities that we take to indicate that Gilens and Page's results reflect in large part on the policies on which majorities of these two groups agree with each other.         "
"56","This suspicion is confirmed in Model 3, which replicates the analysis using the observations we are most interested in—the 185 cases on which a majority of the rich disagree with a majority of the middle. Model 4 explicitly models the binary nature of the dependent variable. Models 5 and 6 are ordinary least squares and probit models, respectively, corresponding to Models 3 and 4, but without a SEM component."
"57","Results from these regression‐based models, SEM and non‐SEM alike, are similar: all indicate that when we subset the data to only the cases on which the middle and rich disagree, we cannot tell whether middle‐income or rich preferences make any difference whatsoever to policy outputs. This is as true when we treat the dependent variable as interval‐level (Models 3 and 5) or binary (Models 4 and 6); it is also as true in SEMs (Models 1 through 4) as in non‐SEMs (Models 5 and 6)."
"58","In sum, results suggest that Gilens and Page's results are driven primarily by differences in opinion on policies for which majorities of the middle and rich agree. In other words, it is not whether (and how much) the middle and rich disagree, but how much the middle and rich differ when they agree, that mostly matters for the Gilens and Page findings."
"59","An Additional Regression‐Based Approach"
"60","An alternative way to explore the relative impact of the middle and rich is to create a new variable that represents the difference between support of the middle and support of the rich. Table A4 presents the results of such an analysis. We can see that the approach produces the same basic findings as preceding analyses. The opinion of the rich does seem to matter more for policy passage, as indicated by the positive and statistically significant coefficient associated with “difference.” However, it only matters when the middle and rich happen to agree: when the two groups disagree, the marginal effect of “difference” on policy change drops to 0.80 (1.06–0.26) and is not statistically significant (p = .13).         "
"61","There are some problems associated with this approach, however. For example, it cannot distinguish between majority support or opposition—it treats 60 percent of the rich favoring something and 40 percent of the middle the same as 40 percent of the rich and 20 percent of the middle, even though these are clearly very different situations. It also cannot account for the kind of status quo bias that we address in our main analysis. One way of addressing these shortcomings is to include middle‐income (or rich) opinion in the model. Then, the “difference” variable will capture the effect of the difference in support controlling for the actual level of support. Doing this makes little difference, the results of which are reported in the second column of Table A4. There it is clear that when middle‐income opinion is included and both it and the interest group variable are interacted with disagreement, the estimated effect of the preference difference when the two groups disagree is larger (1.38) but more unreliable (p = .23).         "
