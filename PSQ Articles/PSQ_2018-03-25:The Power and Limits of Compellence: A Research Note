"1","WITH THE IMPLOSION OF THE SOVIET UNION in December 1991 and with a Russia considerably weakened for two decades thereafter, the United States found itself the lone superpower and faced fewer constraints than before in projecting its military power abroad. During this period of unipolarity, the United States began issuing a series of coercive threats against smaller, less powerful states, as well as militarily intervening in them. Over more than 25 years, these threats and interventions were directed against Iraq (1990–1991), Somalia (1992–1993), Haiti (1994), North Korea (1994), Bosnia (1995), Iraq again (1998), Kosovo and Serbia (1998–1999), Afghanistan (2001–), Iraq yet again (2003–2011), Libya (2011), Syria (2014–), Iraq still yet again (2015–), and North Korea (2017–). Despite the overwhelming power disparities between the United States and its myriad small targets, compellent successes did not come easily. Even when successful, the outcomes of these gambits were too often not as decisive and enduring as U.S. policymakers had hoped, as the repeated appearance of Iraq as a target of U.S. coercion efforts illustrates. Moreover, the United States’ underwhelming post‐Cold War compellent track record is not unique or even unusual, for compellence by the powerful against the weak has historically proven difficult."
"2","Given the benefits that conventional wisdom suggests accrue to those in possession of superior power, the underwhelming track record of compellence, especially when manifested as coercive diplomacy, can seem puzzling. Indeed, Thucydides's Melian Dialogue—penned more than 2,400 years ago—contains what is quite possibly the most cited and enduring tagline in international relations: “The strong do what they can, and the weak endure what they must.” Yet a fuller reading of The History of the Peloponnesian War makes clear that Thucydides recognized not only the limits of compellent power alone to dictate outcomes but also the dangerous tendency of the powerful to fall victim to an exaggerated faith in, and overreliance on, the “power of power” to bend others to one's will. This was as true for the Athenian Empire in ancient Greece as it is for the United States today.         "
"3","This research note explores this enduring puzzle and in the process lays out the power and limits of compellence. Space constraints preclude a comprehensive review of all the relevant literature on this phenomenon; instead, we concentrate on the major findings about, and major gaps in, our understanding of compellence. In the following section, we briefly define coercion and highlight the difficulties often encountered in distinguishing between coercion's two fundamental forms—deterrence and compellence. Then, we outline the key contributions to, and remaining unknowns about, our understanding of compellence that the past three decades of scholarship have revealed. Finally, we conclude with lessons that contemporary policymakers should learn from this scholarship."
"4","Coercion is the ability to get an actor—be it a state, the leader of a state, a violent nonstate actor, or a transnational or international organization—to do something it does not want to do. Coercion is exercised through implicit or explicit threats or through deliberate actions, or both, and it usually, but not always, involves military threats or active military measures. Coercive action may also employ positive inducements.2 Offering such inducements may increase the chances of success, but coercion is not coercion if it consists solely of inducements. Coercion always involves some cost or pain to the target, or explicit threats thereof, with the implied threat of increasing the cost or pain if the target does not concede.         "
"5","Coercion comes in two basic forms: deterrence and compellence. Deterrence is a coercive strategy based on the threat of retaliation that is designed to prevent a target from changing its behavior. Compellence, on the other hand, is a coercive strategy based on hurting a target (or threatening to do so) that is designed to get a target to change its behavior. In both cases, the target is being pressured to do something it does not want to do.3 Deterrence says to a target, “Don't change your behavior because if you do, terrible stuff will happen to you.” Compellence says, “Better change your behavior because if you don't, terrible stuff will happen to you.” Deterrence succeeds if the target does not change its behavior. Compellence succeeds if the target does change its behavior.         "
"6","Here, we deal only with situations in which both the target and the compeller care about the outcome of the dispute. If neither cared much, there would likely be no compellent crisis in the first place. If one cared little about the stakes and the other a great deal, then the former would likely concede short of a crisis."
"7","Defining the analytical distinction between deterrence and compellence is easy. Applying the distinction in practice can be more difficult for two reasons. The first is what is known as the “eye‐of‐the‐beholder” problem, which means that two actors can look at the same action and see two different things. Just as one person's terrorist can be another person's freedom fighter, so too can one actor's deterrent posture look to the deterrent target as a form of compellence. The periodic crises over North Korea's nuclear weapons program offer a dramatic illustration of this ambiguity in action. The United States has tried, unsuccessfully, to compel the North Korean regime to give up its nuclear weapons program because the United States fears the regime will become more aggressive toward its neighbors once it possesses a robust nuclear force. The regime has refused to abolish its nuclear program because it sees the program as a deterrent to U.S. efforts to overthrow it. What the United States sees as a potent compellent tool, the North Koreans see as their ace‐in‐the‐hole guarantee of regime survival."
"8","The second reason that distinguishing between deterrence and compellence can be difficult is that compellent actions are often undertaken in the midst of a crisis by a coercer in order to restore the credibility of its deterrent posture. The Donald Trump administration's attack on a Syrian government airfield after its Khan Shaykhun chemical weapons attack in April 2017 is just one recent example of a compellent action (U.S. bombing of Syrian forces) designed to restore U.S. deterrence so as to prevent the Bashar al‐Assad regime from using chemical weapons yet again.4 However, although the distinction between deterrence and compellence can blur in specific situations, there remains a fundamental difference between trying to prevent changes to the status quo, on the one hand, and trying to stop or reverse changes to the status quo, on the other.         "
"9","Like deterrence, compellence can be undertaken for one's own state (direct compellence) or for one's allies (extended compellence). A good, if failed, example of the former is U.S. coercive demands that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and shut down terrorist training camps in Afghanistan following the attacks on 11 September 2001,5 while a good, and successful, example of the latter is U.S. actions against the People's Republic of China (PRC) during the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis.6 In this instance, the PRC was pressuring Taiwan through missile launches over the island to stop its moves toward de jure independence. The United States undertook compellent action in the form of sending two carrier battle groups into the Taiwan Strait to coerce China not to undertake this type of compellent threat in the future. Compellence can also be employed directly, on a target, such as NATO airstrikes against Libya in 2011 during Operation Odyssey Dawn, or indirectly, on a target's state and nonstate allies, such as when Turkey militarily pressured Syria to crack down on the insurgent Kurdish Worker's Party.7 When used in war, compellence is referred to as “wartime compellence” and, in situations short of war, “coercive diplomacy”—a term coined by Alexander George.8 Wartime compellence usually includes economic measures—sanctions and embargoes—along with the use of force, such as were imposed in April 2011 to heighten pressure on Assad's regime after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war.9 Coercive diplomacy can involve only the use of force (threats or actual use), only economic means, or a combination of force and other nonkinetic measures.10"
"10","Coercive diplomacy can comprise the use of force at three distinct levels: only threats to use force, the demonstrative use of force, and the limited use of force. Threats are mostly talk: “This is what I will do to you if you do not do what I say.” No military action is taken by the coercer, beyond moving its military forces and positioning them to strike with lethal force, should a decision to do so be taken. A clear example is the U.S. bomber overflights of the Korean Peninsula and naval maneuvers in the Sea of Japan in the midst of the 2017 dispute over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.11 The purpose of such movement is to signal intention and resolve. Signaling involves actions that are akin to flexing one's muscles but not actually punching the other fellow. Second, coercive diplomacy can employ demonstrative military action; “Okay, you did not take my threat seriously; here, let me show you what I can do to you if you do not do what I want.” Force is used physically, but in a minimal way, to increase the strength of the threat made by showing what one's forces can do. This is equivalent to punching the adversary once, for example, but not with a knockout blow. Militarily, it could involve destroying one of the adversary's bridges so as to demonstrate to the target state that you have the capability to destroy all its bridges if it does not give way. The 1993 cruise missile strikes on Baghdad in June 1993 are an example of this kind of demonstrative action; on the night of 26–27 June 1993, the United States launched 23 Tomahawk cruise missiles into downtown Baghdad. The missiles hit a structure believed to be the headquarters of the Iraqi Intelligence Service.12 Finally, coercive diplomacy can employ limited force: “Since my demonstration did not impress you, let me hurt you a little more.” The four‐day bombing campaign of Iraq in 1998, known as Operation Desert Fox, is such a case. The official rationale for the operation was that it was punishment for Iraq's failure to comply with United Nations (UN) Security Council resolutions and its intransigence toward and interference with UN Special Commission inspectors. Desert Fox was designed to further degrade Iraqi weapons capabilities, among other objectives.13 If the limited use of force fails to sway the target, the coercer can then move to war. Once that line is crossed, however, one has moved from the realm of coercive diplomacy into the realms of wartime compellence and victory.            "
"11","The few studies that exist indicate there is little difference between the success rates of interstate coercive diplomacy and interstate wartime compellence, and the success rates for both are relatively low. More research is necessary, however, to confirm this finding. The most extensive scholarship on wartime compellence consists of studies of airpower. Less has been done on assessing the efficacy of seapower blockades during war. One notable exception is John Mearsheimer's The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. Mearsheimer found one successful case out of nine instances in which one great power successfully blockaded another since 1789, for a success rate of 11 percent.14 Most existing studies of coercive diplomacy suggest success rates range between 33 percent and 41 percent.15 The two extant data sets on wartime interstate compellence through airpower find success rates of 40 percent and 36 percent. Robert Pape found a success rate of 40 percent: 16 successes out of a universe of 40 cases between 1917 and 1991. Michael Horowitz and Dan Reiter expanded Pape's data set to 53 cases through 1999 and found 19 successes, or 36 percent.16 For both coercive diplomacy and wartime compellence, then, failure is more frequent than success.            "
"12","What accounts for the relatively low success rate of coercive diplomacy? Why does it fail more often than it succeeds, especially for the usually far more powerful United States? Six distinct explanations have been offered."
"13","First, coercive diplomacy is hard because compellence is hard. Successful compellence requires that the target publicly give way to a coercer's demands, whereas in a successful deterrent situation, the target can claim that it never intended to do what the deterrer was trying to prevent. Giving way to a compeller involves public humiliation and damage to the target's reputation, things that do not happen in a deterrent situation when a target merely continues doing what it has been doing.17"
"14","Second, for a variety of psychological and material reasons, defenders of the status quo (targets) tend to be more highly resolved than challengers to the status quo (compellers). One psychological theory, known as “prospect theory,” that purports to explain this tendency posits that actors are risk acceptant to prevent losses but risk adverse to achieve gains.18 If defenders of the status quo are willing to take greater risks to keep what they have, and if challengers to the status quo are less willing to take risks to overturn it and gain more, then defenders should generally prevail over compellers.            "
"15","Third, when the target gives way to the compeller, that act has not only reputational costs but also power costs. Giving way once can weaken the target enough militarily such that it is harder to stand up to the compeller if it comes back for more concessions. As a consequence, the target is more likely to dig in at the outset, resist giving way to the compeller's demands, and hope the compeller does not care as much as it does about the issues under contestation.19"
"16","Fourth, and relatedly, when the compeller is considerably more powerful than the target, the compeller cannot credibly commit that it will not demand further concessions in the future. The inability of a powerful compeller to make believable commitments about its future behavior derives from the capability‐intention dilemma: state intentions can change swiftly; capabilities, however, change much more slowly. The compeller's vast superiority makes its commitment not to come back and ask for more seem hollow, because it has the power to come back and take more if it so decides. Moreover, this problem becomes greater as the asymmetry in power between compeller and target increases.20"
"17","Fifth, in those cases in which the United States is the compeller, the credibility of its threats is weakened by the way it executes them. The “American way of war,” argues Dianne Chamberlain, relies on technology, especially airpower and intelligence collection, to keep U.S. casualties to a minimum. This may save lives, but the focus on force protection sends a clear signal that the United States does not care enough about the issue under contestation to expend its blood as well as its treasure to get its way. Chamberlain calls this American way of war a “cheap threat” and hence a weak signal of U.S. resolve, so U.S. compellent threats generally fail.21"
"18","Sixth, compellent threats more often than not fail because the United States has too great an appetite; it asks more of states than they are willing to give.22 As Phil Haun argues, the United States often makes insatiable demands. It wants everything, including literally the head of the head of the current regime, and as Alexander Downes shows, U.S. demands threaten the very sovereignty and survival of the regime, leaving incumbents little choice but to resist.23"
"19","In sum, whichever and however many of these six mechanisms are at work in any given case, they help explain why the more powerful do not invariably prevail against the weaker. These are key lessons to keep in mind in an era when coercive uses of force are very common—the United States has, for instance, been involved in a military operation on average every 17 months since the end of the Cold War."
"20","Whether used during war or in coercive diplomatic gambits, a compeller can employ its military forces against the target for three different strategic purposes: military denial, civilian punishment, and risk.24"
"21","Compellence by denial means that the compeller has sought out the target's military forces and has attacked them, with the purpose of degrading, crippling, or destroying them. For a denial strategy to be successful, the coercer must demonstrate to the target that its military strategy can be, or is being, undermined by the compeller's military countermeasures. The coercer may be able to do this with only threats or limited uses of force, but wartime denial is easier to achieve because significantly greater amounts of force are employed than with coercive diplomacy. Denial strategies, in both war and peace, work by convincing the target that it will be unable to attain its political goals through force."
"22","Compellence by punishment is achieved by attacking a target's population and cities and inflicting unacceptable pain, although killing large numbers of military forces is sometimes also done for punishment purposes. The goal is to convince the target that the costs and risks it has to bear by persevering with its chosen course of action far outweigh the achievable potential gains. The purpose of the pain, in short, is not to undermine the target's military strategy but to weaken its resolve to carry on."
"23","Compellence by risk is achieved by threatening to inflict punishment, or more punishment, on the target. Risk is essentially the promise to inflict pain if no pain has yet been inflicted, or to inflict more (and more) pain if some has already been administered, in order to convince the target to concede. In the latter case, more punishment can be delivered all at once with maximum force or at a gradually increasing rate. Whether threatened once or serially, risk is a cheap form of punishment.25"
"24","Because risk is a form of punishment, there are really only two basic compellent strategies: military denial and civilian punishment. Does one work better than the other? The answer is, “It depends on the circumstances.” For instance, Pape demonstrated that when the compeller's airpower is applied in wartime directly against the target, it is more effective when used for military denial than for civilian punishment. He found that in 14 of 17 cases, when military denial was high or very high, compellence worked, yielding an 82 percent success rate, whereas in the 16 cases in which civilian punishment was high or very high, compellence worked in just 8 cases, yielding a 50 percent success rate.26 However, and in contrast, Kelly M. Greenhill has found that when displaced people are used as coercive weapons against well‐chosen target states, coercion by punishment is at least partially successful about 75 percent of the time.27 This kind of coercion by punishment can take two forms: one, straightforward threats to overwhelm a target state or states’ physical absorption or carrying capacity to manage the consequences of an influx or outflow, if a coercer's military, political, and/or economic demands are not met (capacity swamping); and two, threats to undermine a target state or states’ political willingness to manage the selfsame consequences, if a coercer's demands are not met (political agitation.) A recent example of the latter strategy in action is Turkey's serial threats in 2015 and 2016 to flood the European Union with (mostly) Syrian refugees if a wide array of political and economic demands were not satisfied.28"
"25","These disparate findings suggest that the relative efficacy of denial versus punishment strategies may be contingent on the context (for example, war versus peacetime); the natures of the actors (for example, state versus nonstate actors); their capabilities; the levels of resolve of the challenger and target; and the choice of coercive instrument(s) used."
"26","Also important to assess are the effects on the target's resolve of the type of demands the coercer issues and the assurances and inducements it offers to the target. If much is demanded of the target, is compliance less likely? Is the reverse true—if less is demanded, is compliance more likely? In addition, what are the effects of offering assurances and inducements to the target on the latter's decision to resist or give way? Do assurances and inducements increase the chances of compellent success and, if so, when should they be offered—before or along with the coercive threat, or only after it is made? These are important questions, but unfortunately, few studies exist to help us answer them. Therefore, our conclusions must be viewed as tentative, pending further study."
"27","The available evidence on demand type and coercive success is mixed. This is not surprising because, while demand type is commonly used as a proxy for the size or significance of what the target is being asked to do, it does not necessarily capture how much the target itself thinks it is being asked to give up. Stakes that may seem modest to compellers can seem exorbitant to the target. That being said, Alexander George and William E. Simons found that, indeed, there was an inverse relation between demand type and compellent outcome: the greater the compeller's demands, the lower the success rate. This conclusion, however, is based on a very small number of cases and cannot be considered definitive.29 Chungshik Moon and Mark Souva found that democracies were better at making threats over some issues, such as policy, leadership, and reparations, but not over issues of territory. This would seem to suggest that regime change (leadership) is less important than state territory, a questionable result.30"
"28","At the same time, Robert Art and Patrick Cronin found no correlation between demand type and compellent success. Success and failure seemed randomly distributed and unrelated to what was being demanded of the target.31 Horowitz and Reiter found that demands for regime change (using airpower) were less likely to succeed than other demands.32 In contrast, Alexander Downes finds that regime change, a highly “demanding” demand because of its equivalence to regime suicide, had a success rate of 80 percent. Downes qualifies his conclusion, however, by attributing the high rate to selection effects: compellers demanded regime change only when they thought the target was unable to resist. This is consistent with Horowitz and Reiter's finding that “the greater the military vulnerability of the target, the more likely that air power will allow the attacker to accomplish its foreign policy objectives.33 Finally, Todd Sechser argues that the more the compeller asks of the target, the less likely is the target to comply, and the less it asks of the target, the more likely is the target to comply.34 However, Sechser bases his conclusion on deductive logic rather than empirical demonstration. In sum, the weight of the available evidence favors the counterintuitive conclusion that there is no firm relationship between demand type and the likelihood of compellent success.            "
"29","Evidence also suggests that assurances and inducements can be helpful in producing target compliance, although the evidence here, too, is limited.35 Assurance, or what some refer to as “reassurance,” refers to the coercer's promise not to change the terms of the implicit contract between coercer and target once the target complies with the coercer's demand.36 If assurances are akin to contracts, inducements are akin to side payments, and the two should not be confused. Assurance signifies that the compeller will stick by its agreement once the target complies; inducement is a reward offered by the compeller, something other than the promise not to continue hurting the target, once it complies. Assurance is a promise not to hurt the target more; inducement, the promise of some “goodies” for compliance.            "
"30","Thomas Schelling's assertion that assurances must accompany coercive threats has generally been taken as axiomatically true, but relatively little empirical work has been done to support it. Two exceptions stand out. Sechser's argument about power asymmetries and Haun's argument about U.S. demands for regime change both represent confirmation, albeit indirect, about the importance of assurances for target compliance. If a powerful actor is either unable (Sechser) or unwilling (Haun) to commit not to come back at the target once it gives way, then the target is unlikely to comply with the compeller's initial demand."
"31","By extension, one can draw the inference that offers of assurances will help produce target compliance. In their detailed study of why Libyan leader Muammar el‐Qaddafi decided to relinquish his nuclear weapons program, Bruce Jentleson and Christopher Whytock found just that. U.S. assurances not to seek regime change were an important factor in securing Qaddafi's compliance.37 (The fact that the United States later reneged on this promise and helped engineer Qaddafi's ouster in 2011 has been cited as a key reason why Kim Jong‐Un will resist coercive demands to surrender North Korea's nuclear capabilities.38)            "
"32","Finally, Tristan Volpe, in an innovative adaptation of the role that reassurances can play in coercive diplomacy, demonstrates how a state that is threatening to acquire nuclear weapons can use reassurances that it will not do so in order to wrest (compel) concessions from those states trying to halt its nuclear weapons program. (Volpe presents evidence that between 1975 and 2015, Pakistan, North Korea, Egypt, Libya, Iran, and Saudi Arabia all threatened to proliferate if the United States failed to comply with a wide range of coercive demands.39)            "
"33","With respect to inducements, one can make two opposing arguments. The first is that inducements should make the target more willing to give way because it is receiving compensation for its compliance.40 The second is the reverse argument: inducements should make the target less willing to give way because they signal that the compeller wants the target's compliance badly and, therefore, that resisting longer will produce additional gains for the target. The little available evidence favors the first argument. Art and Cronin found that in 4 of their 16 coercive diplomacy cases, positive inducements were offered and three achieved success (75 percent), in comparison to the success rate of 33 percent for the 16 cases taken as a whole. In comparison, George and Simons found that both cases in which positive inducements were offered were successes, whereas all five cases in which no inducements were offered were all failures or were ambiguous in their outcomes.41"
"34","Similarly, it should be the case that the timing of inducements matters. Logic dictates that inducements should be offered only after the compellence gambit has begun. To lead with inducements is likely to signal that the compeller is weak or lacks resolve and is likely to give way if pressed. Compellence situations are crises akin to the game of chicken, and such situations demand firm resolve at the outset, both in the conventional and nuclear realms. Of the four cases in which Art and Cronin found positive inducements were offered, three were offered after threats were made or force used and two of those three were successes—Haiti in 1994, when offers of secure and comfortable exile and promise of military modernization were made to the departing junta, and Bosnia in 1995, when, among other things, promises to lift sanctions against Serbia were proffered.42 Thus, while the logic of offering inducements after threats are issued or force is used is powerful, the evidence to support it is thin.            "
"35","Writing on nuclear compellence has come in two waves. The first flowering of studies began in the early 1980s and lasted about a decade.43 A second, ongoing wave began in the early 2000s.44 As with studies on the relationship between demand type and compellent success, the efficacy of nuclear compellence is hotly contested.            "
"36","In their book on nuclear threats, for instance, Todd Sechser and Matthew Fuhrmann conclude that nuclear compellent threats did not work in any of the 19 cases they identified.45 Sechser and Fuhrmann argue that nuclear compellent threats fail for two reasons: signaling problems and low threat credibility. In terms of signaling, too often, the threats were vague and not explicit; some were not received; those that were, were misinterpreted. The threats were also ineffective because they were not credible. The stakes in nuclear compellent situations are rarely as high for the compeller as for the target, which means that the compeller is not likely to escalate to nuclear use to get its way. Coercive success was achieved, they argued, not because of nuclear threats but because of the non‐nuclear threats and actions that the compeller issued. For example, during the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, the United States possessed local conventional naval and air superiority, which Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and other officials believed was crucial in getting the Soviets to remove their missiles from Cuba. Equally important was the U.S. pledge to remove its own tactical nuclear weapons from Turkey if the Soviets removed theirs from Cuba.46"
"37","Sechser and Fuhrmann's skepticism about the efficacy of nuclear compellence may be justified, but in our judgment, there are at least three cases in which nuclear compellence appears to have played some role in producing a successful outcome. The first involves wartime nuclear compellence: the actual use of two atomic bombs by the United States against Japan in World War II.47 The other two—nuclear threats issued by the United States against China during the Taiwan Strait crises of 1954–1955 and 1958—are instances of coercive nuclear diplomacy. Assessing the role that nuclear use or nuclear threat played, respectively, in these three cases is not easy, but we believe these are the instances where the strongest cases for the efficacy of nuclear compellence can be made, which is consistent with the argument made by Kyle Beardsley and Victor Asal that nuclear‐armed states are more likely to prevail with nuclear coercion against non‐nuclear‐armed states.48"
"38","In early August 1945, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in order to compel it to surrender unconditionally. The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki appear to have had little effect on the Japanese Army, but they did have an effect on Japanese emperor Hirohito, who pushed the army for immediate surrender following the attack on Hiroshima. When told of the first reports of the bomb's effect on the city, the emperor was reported to have said, “Under these circumstances, we must bow to the inevitable. No matter what happens to my safety, we must put an end to this as speedily as possible so that this tragedy will not be repeated.”49 The emperor was influenced both by the threat of a U.S. invasion of the home islands and by the fact that Japan had no defense against atomic bombs. He interceded at a late‐night imperial conference on 9–10 August and insisted on surrender on Allied terms. The atomic bomb did not produce Japan's surrender on its own, but it caused the emperor to intervene in cabinet deliberations in a highly unusual way and tip the balance toward surrender.            "
"39","The two coercive diplomatic crises over the Taiwan Strait in 1954–1955 and 1958 are examples of the use of compellent threats (extended compellence) issued by a deterrer (the United States) to shore up deterrence against a challenger (the PRC) in a deterrence failure situation. These two examples illustrate the point made earlier: compellent actions are sometimes taken during a crisis when deterrence seems to be weakening, with the goal of strengthening the deterrer's guarantee—in this instance, the U.S. guarantee to the Kuomintang regime ruling Taiwan against a mainland regime's attack."
"40","During both crises, the ultimate goal of the Communist regime was to end Kuomintang rule on Taiwan and bring Taiwan under mainland rule, although Mao Tse‐tung also had more immediate objectives in each crisis. The islands of Quemoy and Matsu, just off the Chinese mainland, were held by the Kuomintang government and were viewed at the time to be of great political and military value by Chairman Mao because he viewed them as stepping stones to ending Kuomintang rule over Taiwan. In both 1954–1955 and 1958, Mao shelled the islands with long‐range artillery, lobbing 40,000 shells against Quemoy on the first day of the 1958 crisis, for example. To counter these attacks, the United States took a series of actions and bolstered its commitment to the Taiwan regime. Part and parcel of these actions were nuclear threats issued by the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, which until recently was arguably the one U.S. administration since the advent of the nuclear age most inclined to actually use nuclear weapons.50"
"41","It now appears, however, that following these two crises Mao may have reevaluated his position and concluded that the PRC should leave the islands under Nationalist control. If it were to seize the islands or the Nationalists to abandon them, “the distance between the mainland and Taiwan would lengthen from a few miles to over a hundred, and ‘perhaps in thought as well.’” Moreover, the acquisition of Quemoy and Matsu would help validate the “Two Chinas” policy that both Mao and Chiang Kai‐shek vehemently opposed.51"
"42","Were these U.S. compellent threats effective in these two cases? The circumstantial evidence is strong. In both crises, the nuclear threats were explicit, and they were received and understood by Mao's regime. In both crises, after the threats were issued, China called for negotiations. In both crises, Sechser and Fuhrmann appear to give some credit to the nuclear threats in shoring up deterrence, and they are more willing to credit nuclear coercion with some coercive effect in the first than in the second crisis. But they glide over the fact that the threats were compellent in nature, issued in a deterrence crisis, and that the coercer demanded the target stop the shelling and ease tensions. This is compellence pure and simple: the United States issued threats to get the PRC to change its behavior, and it complied.52 Nuclear coercive diplomacy played a role—how much is as yet unclear—in defusing each crisis.            "
"43","Finally, Sechser and Fuhrmann argue that the nuclear coercive threats did not work because the PRC did not relinquish its ultimate goal of taking Taiwan and the two islands.53 While true, there is another way to view the ultimate outcome of these two crises: U.S. nuclear threats may not have altered China's ultimate goals regarding Taiwan. Nevertheless, the PRC did not provoke another such serious crisis until 1995, when it fired missiles over Taiwan in order to halt what it viewed as a movement from de facto to de jure independence by the sitting Taiwanese government. Nearly 40 years of no severe Sino‐American crises in the Taiwan Strait like those in the 1950s could just as easily be coded as a win for compellence.            "
"44","In sum, successful nuclear compellence is not impossible, but it is difficult and dangerous to execute. If such gambits occur in the future, one should expect successful outcomes to be the exceptions, not the rule.54"
"45","While scholars such as Martha Crenshaw and Thomas Schelling laid the foundations for our understanding of nonstate coercion decades ago, scholarship in this arena exploded after September 11.55 Consensus on what conclusions to draw about nonstate actors and coercion has thus far been elusive, however.            "
"46","One noteworthy debate has arisen over the theoretical and policy implications of broadening and stretching preexisting concepts to more usefully apply them to exercises of coercion involving violent nonstate actors (VNSAs). For instance, the concept of “cumulative deterrence”—a long‐term, iterative strategy of persuasion that marries together elements of both punishment and denial—has been proposed and embraced in some circles.56 Advocates argue that this concept offers new and valuable analytical leverage on long‐standing problems, such as the Israeli‐Palestinian conflict. The goal in this case, according to Uri Ben‐Joseph, is to aggregate Israel's successful military history with its conventional and nuclear capabilities and to use that “accumulated wealth of strategic might” to persuade adversaries that further violence is futile.57 Critics charge, however, that the kind of conceptual stretching this new concept necessitates goes too far. They argue that cumulative deterrence, particularly as applied to the realm of terrorism, would be more accurately described as war.58"
"47","There is likewise widespread disagreement with regard to assessing the success rate of non‐state compellence. One camp has argued that compellence by VNSAs in the form of terrorism frequently works, pointing to governmental overreaction and terrorists’ imposition of unacceptable costs as reasons for its effectiveness.59 Others have demurred, arguing that, consistent with Crenshaw and Schelling's earlier claims, coercive terrorism tends to be ineffective because of its indiscriminate nature and the ability of states to eliminate or ignore nonstate coercers without conceding.60"
"48","It is worth noting, however, that the fundamental disagreement between the two camps appears at heart to be largely an artifact of divergent choices with regard to case selection and metrics for measuring success and failure. For instance, while Robert Pape and Max Abrahms agree on the facts of what terrorism did and did not accomplish in specific cases, they disagree as to whether these achievements should be coded as successes or failures, with Pape generally setting the bar for what constitutes a success significantly lower than Abrahms. For instance, in the case of Hamas's terrorist campaign, the release of a prisoner would be coded as a success by Pape because said release represented a new concession by the government, but it would not be coded thus by Abrahms because the campaign did not yield a new state, a stated objective of Hamas. Such disagreements reveal that the magnitude of a compeller's demand may be a factor in determining whether or not VNSA compellence succeeds or fails. This provisional finding reveals the need for further research on the role that magnitude of demands may play in state‐to‐nonstate compellence."
"49","Other strands of new research on VNSAs reinforce our assessment that received wisdom about success and failure of nonstate compellence may require reevaluation. Keren Fraiman argues, for instance, that “transitive compellence”—whereby states that seek to affect the behavior of VNSAs do so by targeting the states that host them—is both more common and far more effective than is generally understood. This misapprehension exists, Fraiman argues, because the conventional wisdom regarding host capabilities and motivations—that is, they are as a rule both too weak and too reluctant to take effective action against VNSAs—is itself misguided.61 Boaz Atzili and Wendy Pearlman make an analogous argument but focus on the host state as the linchpin of successful coercion. Whereas Fraiman's key unit of analysis is the external state seeking to exert pressure on the host state, which, in turn, is expected to exert pressure on VNSAs operating on its soil, other scholars, such as Brian Jenkins, have focused on the significance of outside pressure points in indirectly influencing and deterring VSNAs.62 In his study of the U.S. campaign in Pakistan, for instance, James Igoe Walsh finds that while drones offer noteworthy operational and technological advantages, they also frequently instigate retaliatory and signaling counterattacks by insurgents and other VSNAs, which can, in turn, exercise deleterious effects on counterinsurgency campaigns and undermine efforts at coercion.63"
"50","More broadly, the potential for blowback and other unintended consequences of VNSA coercion has likewise garnered increased attention in recent years. Here again, however, shared conclusions have thus far proven elusive, and widespread disagreement exists over the prevalence and significance of counterproductive consequences of coercion. This is the case, we would suggest, because the units of analysis, methodologies, and metrics of success and failure employed across studies differ. For example, several strategic level studies found no support for either the idea that targeted killings and other counterterrorism operations create martyrs who can be used to boost recruiting numbers (the “martyrdom effect”) or that coercive attacks generate backlash effects (the “backlash” hypotheses.) Such hypothesized effects include anger, hostility, and heightened distrust within target populations, as well as increases in retaliatory attacks and greater resistance to conflict resolution efforts. At the same time, however, two studies of operational level effects of VNSA coercion found that targeted killings may indeed be counterproductive, especially when religiously motivated groups are the targets.64"
"51","Coercion, especially when it involves the threat or physical use of force, is a nasty business. This is important to keep in mind when deciding when and how to use forceful coercion of either the deterrent or compellent variety. Adding to our theoretical and practical knowledge about the “power to hurt” is essential whether we aim to assess, deploy, respond to, or stop coercion in the most effective and humane manner possible."
"52","In that vein, we offer the following set of sobering propositions and correctives about compellence that should be recognized and taken into account when contemplating its use and efficacy as a means of achieving foreign policy objectives:            "
