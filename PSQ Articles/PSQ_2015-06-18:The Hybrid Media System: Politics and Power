"1","The best books are those that provide new ways of mapping complex terrain, enabling new analytical approaches and pointing to pathways out of intellectual dead‐ends. Andrew Chadwick's The Hybrid Media System promises to be such a book.         "
"2","Chadwick's simple starting place is that the standard terminology of “old” and “new” media no longer serves to make sense of today's complex media ecology. In fact, it never did, because “[w]hat counts as new media at any given time are . . . best seen as hybrids of newer and older media” (p. 25). The study of political communication is stunted by an inadequate conceptual map, Chadwick contends, in which scholars of “old” media discount the impact of newer media forms, while scholars immersed in those newer forms discount the continuing influence of older media technologies and organizations."
"3","In place of the old/new media dichotomy, Chadwick argues for a “hybridity” approach that draws from developments in other fields of inquiry, including comparative politics, cultural studies, and organizational theory. Media systems, like other political, cultural, social, and organizational systems, are always “in the process of becoming, as actors simultaneously create and adapt” (p. 18). New forms, norms, practices, and possibilities emerge within and outside of what has gone before, not only as new technologies arise but also as those “new” technologies become incorporated and themselves re‐mediated by older technologies. Thus, “any medium is best understood in terms of its position in a system of interdependent relationships with other media” (p. 24). For example, today's media system (at least in Great Britain and the United States, Chadwick's chief focus) features both the dynamic and disruptive rise of online technologies and the continuing, even increasing, centrality of broadcast television; Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign was designed to capture and manage television coverage and dominate the airwaves with ads while also exploiting the interactive capabilities of online media.         "
"4","The Hybrid Media System offers three conceptual chapters that explain the intellectual roots of hybridity and show how media systems, both historical and contemporary, can be looked at through this lens. The remainder of the book features qualitative case studies and interview research to illustrate the complex dynamics of the “political information cycle”—Chadwick's reformulation of the standard notion of a tightly managed “news cycle”—that simultaneously involve everything from television and books to YouTube and Twitter. His chapter on WikiLeaks, for example, shows how nonjournalists and news organizations “innovated together” with networked publics to create “a new type of technology‐enabled, not‐quite‐journalism” characteristic of today's hybrid media system.         "
"5","As compelling as the book's conceptual framework is, critics may ultimately disagree with its characterization of the central concept in political science: power. What becomes of institutions in the hybridity approach—those enduring constellations of power and practice that (according to institutionalist scholars) authoritatively preside over public life? Is power in today's political communication system truly as decentered and fluid as Chadwick suggests? And critics may question the description of nonelite actors as key players in political information cycles. While that may be true of the defining moments in the recent political communication history that Chadwick reviews (Britain's first televised prime ministerial debate in 2010 or the series of high‐profile television ads and debate moments from the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign), is this greater role for nonelites equally true of daily, routinized politics?         "
"6","Overall, The Hybrid Media System is thoroughly worth the read: illuminating, reorienting, even analytically liberating.         "
