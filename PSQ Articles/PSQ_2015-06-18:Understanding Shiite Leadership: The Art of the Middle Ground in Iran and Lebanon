"1","The art of “middle ground” politics—strategic, institutional, philosophical—offers an alternative language for understanding the politics of Iran."
"2","Strategically, middle ground politics is “friction‐based, dynamic equilibrium” (p. 58) management. Opposed to absolute ideas or clear‐cut power relations, it rejects victory/defeat claims in favor of engaging and managing all goals, factions, and players. It is pragmatic but involves brinkmanship and active cultivation of “friction” to keep multiple goals and options in play. “The focus [of Iran's nuclear policy] does not seem to be on acquisition or detonation. Rather, Iranian policy seems to leverage the friction caused by nuclear negotiations into diverse global influence” (p. 7). This can be useful for minorities, as in Hezbollah's growth to a majority in the Lebanese parliament while continuing to jockey between loyalties to Lebanon and Syria, attacks on and understandings with Israel, and always seeking positions from which it can undermine the party it is also supporting. Shiism has always seen itself as a minority. The true Muslims (egoless lovers of God) are always a minority and feel oppressed by the corruptions of the world."
"3","Institutionally (and historically), middle ground politics has a habitus in the split between shah (rule) and clerics (legitimacy) and among multiple clerical sources of imitation (maraje' taqlid) with their separate sources of revenue. Since 1979, a constitution grounded in both republican and Islamic values has generated gridlock as well as flexibility and much debate within Iran (as well as outside).         "
"4","Philosophically and theologically, middle ground politics is rooted in the view that because the Koran and hadith require interpretation, and because the guidance of the imams is no longer available, we depend on human interpretations. Ayatollah Khomeini himself admitted that he could not justify his interpretation of rule by the religious experts (vilayat‐i faqih) based on these texts, only on his inferences. While theologically correct, this is contested by antidemocratic ayatollahs and populist‐fundamentalists, who need to be managed and are themselves assets in the friction‐based dynamic equilibrium of middle ground politics. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad found middle ground politics devoid of inherent value, using it as a tool for exclusivist ends and using faith to fill the void rather than creating meaning from the void.         "
"5","The first four chapters of the book provide an overview of Shiite history based on English‐language secondary sources, beginning with three Iranian American professors, one a romantic culturalist, one a steadfast analyst of class relations (a Marxist), and one a historical sociologist (a Weberian). For those unversed in the literature, the survey is serviceable, and the bibliographic footnotes are a useful guide."
"6","The middle chapters (5–8) provide a typology and six cases to which the typologies are (not too intrusively) applied. “Traditional” middle ground politics regulated the simultaneous encouraging and repressing of all three “dynamics” (communal, institutional, revolutionary) in the 2006 Bahrain parliamentary elections (claiming a traditional communal Shiite solidarity but no national interest). “Conformist” (or state) ‐regulated middle ground politics is typified by the reversal in family planning policy from natalist during the Iran‐Iraq War, peaking at 3.9 annual growth, to antinatalist after the war, dropping to 1.2 percent. The other cases are relations with Venezuela, nuclear policy, the elections of 2009 and 2013, and Hezbollah. Chapter 9 uses a fictional biography of a religiously and secularly educated businessman to reprise the generational experiences of a 55‐year‐old and to suggest that Iran's middle ground politics is a pattern observable in other rising middle powers (India, Brazil, and Turkey), Hamas, and Barack Obama's foreign policy."
