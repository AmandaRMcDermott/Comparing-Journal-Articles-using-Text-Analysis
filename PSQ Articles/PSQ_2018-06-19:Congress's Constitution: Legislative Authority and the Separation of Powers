"1","In this book, Josh Chafetz, professor of law at Cornell Law School, provides the most extensive, thoughtful analysis of the constitutional scope and significance of congressional authority since the late David Currie's The Constitution in Congress. Currie tracked nearly day by day the constitutional debates in Congress from 1789 through the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, with the fourth and final volume appearing shortly before Currie's death in 2007. Chafetz assumes an equally, if not more ambitious, focus “on the ways that Congress and its constituent parts—individual houses and individual members—can and do make use of constitutional powers other than the power to pass laws” (p. 2). “If one truly hopes to understand Congress’ ability to have an impact on our national life,” he explains, it is “essential” to recognize that a book about congressional power is necessarily a book about the separation of powers” (p. 2). His largely positive account of congressional power is “multiplicity based, because it highlights the ways in which claims of authority multiply and overlap in a nonhierarchical order” (p. 2). The conflicts within the Congress have, in other words, connections to and ramifications for the conflicts between Congress and the other branches.         "
"2","After describing the book's basic aims, Chafetz carefully surveys from 1789 to the present the origins, exercise, and impact of several of Congress's “hard” and “soft” powers, terms made famous by Joseph S. Nye Jr. (p. 3). The hard powers are Congress's authorities “to coerce,” and its “soft” powers are its ability to get what it wants through “attraction” or persuasion rather than “coercion or payments” (p. 3). The hard powers of concern to Chafetz are its authorities over appropriations and personnel (encompassing impeachment and confirmation), while the soft powers he closely examines are freedom of speech or debate, internal discipline, and “cameral rules” or each chamber's “authority to create its own constitution: the rules constitute it as a certain type of body with certain powers and procedures for exercising those powers, as well as certain constraints on its powers” (p. 267). Chafetz thus covers a number of issues of contemporary interest, such as the rise and fall of the filibuster and the U.S. Supreme Court confirmation process, including the contest to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia."
"3","Historians should be interested in Chafetz's careful historiography of the origins and patterns in Congress's deployment of several powers that keep it on an even keel with the other branches. Legal scholars and social scientists should be impressed with his mastery of the intricacies of separation of powers. Congressional scholars will appreciate his mastery of Congress's internal rules and procedures and how Congress uses them (and its other powers) to maintain its place within the constitutional order."
"4","Near the end of the book, Chafetz ventures into normative analysis. He celebrates “separation of powers multiplicity” for three “virtues”: “it is more fully representative, more deliberation promoting, and more resistant to assertions of tyrannical or autocratic power than constitutional structures with less built‐in capacity for conflict” (p. 303). Some scholars will undoubtedly disagree, particularly with his view of the Senate as “institutionally structured to focus on longer‐term and geographically larger and more general interests” (p. 306). For many scholars, Congress's inefficiency is not a virtue. While they may further argue that Congress's best days are behind it, Chafetz's impressive accomplishment is demonstrating the ways in which Congress can still be relevant."
