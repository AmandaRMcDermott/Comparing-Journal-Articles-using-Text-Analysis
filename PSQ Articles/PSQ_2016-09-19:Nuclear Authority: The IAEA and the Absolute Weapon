"1","The recent resurgence of research on nuclear proliferation has focused on several new factors in understanding why states pursue or forsake nuclear weapons. These include energy assistance, U.S. nonproliferation policy, and the Non‐Proliferation Treaty regime, among others. Robert L. Brown's focus on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)—the organization tasked with both overseeing peaceful uses of nuclear technology and monitoring its diversion for weapons—is a welcome addition to the nuclear nonproliferation literature and to broader work on institutions and organizations in international relations. While the IAEA has played a prominent and public role in all of the contemporary nuclear proliferation cases—Iraq, Iran, North Korea—it has not been widely studied. Brown makes an important claim by arguing that the IAEA is an organization with rising international political authority, defined as the power to change the behavior of states without coercive tools."
"2","Brown argues that international political authority is “the product of persistent demand and successful agent supply” (p. 181). The demand side has two components: demand for nuclear “policy partiality” (investment in expertise for achieving specific policy goals; p. 32) and demand for organizational “impersonality” (rule‐governed administration to separate decisions from the interests of individual states; p. 33). Demand increases when nuclear problems become more severe and/or when states have conflicts of interest along several issue dimensions that encompass the scope of nuclear cooperation. The organization's authority grows when it meets demand with successful responses to cases that require its expertise or decision making. Surprisingly, the theory does not rely much on the organizational literature or principal–agent concepts. However, the supply and demand frame provides a way to incorporate both state interest and organizational performance as explanatory variables."
"3","The core of the book evaluates the theory by looking across four periods of IAEA history and within each of four issues in nuclear policy: nonproliferation, disarmament, safety and security, and promotion of peaceful uses. While the account gives a rich picture of the evolution of the IAEA's form, activities, and reception by states, it is less compelling in demonstrating the IAEA's ability to convince states to change their behavior or demand and supply factors as the drivers of that authority. Rather, the picture that emerges is mixed; for example, the IAEA had effective capabilities in some of the issue areas (such as disarmament in South Africa and Iraq) but not others (safety and security standards in the late 1980s) during the same time frame. The evaluation of “success” remains elusive; it seems to rely on state views of the IAEA after the fact and is occasionally blurred with the outcome of increased IAEA authority. The claims that the IAEA does have limited authority in some areas, or growing authority in later periods, suffer from a limited ability to demonstrate that states may have adopted policies even in the absence of the agency and lack of clarity in how degrees of authority can be compared."
"4","The empirical analysis would also be improved with a clearer justification of the divisions between time periods and policy areas, as well as on the focus of alternative explanations. Why has authority emerged in some areas but not in others? If there is considerable variation in the IAEA's role across issues, as the chapters suggest, how should we evaluate the agency's authority overall? Why is greater emphasis placed on disproving a normative explanation rather contrasting or perhaps incorporating a hegemonic one, when the latter is a more compelling fit?"
"5","Nuclear Authority provides a uniquely detailed account of the IAEA's role in nuclear policy. It also reveals an important path dependence in the development of this international organization, whereby activities and successes in one period affect the nuclear capabilities states have, the protections they need, and the organizational assistance they expect from the agency in the next period. Today, the IAEA is asked to to take on more extensive nonproliferation tasks, most recently with inspections in Iran. If Brown's argument is right, the IAEA's performance on these new challenges will be a key factor in whether its influence over states continues to grow in the future.         "
