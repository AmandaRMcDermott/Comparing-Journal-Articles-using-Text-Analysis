"1","Before the 1980s, when American psychiatry was dominated by psychoanalysis, major child psychiatrists saw autism as a psychiatric disorder, a result of the cold, unattached manner in which mothers reared their children. But the 1980s saw a major shift in thinking about autism. Beginning with the 1980 publication of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, psychiatry dismissed “refrigerator mother” theories of the etiology of autism and instead began to define autism as a communication and behavioral issue. In 1987, scientific claims were made that behavioral therapy could effectively modify autistic children's behaviors; a year later, the film Rain Man was released, depicting the experiences of an autistic savant. However, while these events helped raise both diagnoses and awareness of autism, they did little to answer the many questions individuals had regarding this condition. In fact, today, autism remains as ambiguous as ever.         "
"2","In his book The Politics of Autism: Navigating the Contested Spectrum, John J. Pitney, Jr., suggests that the ambiguity surrounding autism (now called autism spectrum disorder) has allowed particular factions to debate the definitions, etiologies, and treatment of autism. Ultimately, though, as Pitney argues in this book, these political debates (and others) have produced very little in the way of developing coherent policy to address the issues that confront autistic individuals and their families.         "
"3","One of the central topics of the book is that the uncertainty of autism has opened the door to debates between those who state that autism is a medical disorder and autism self‐advocates who maintain that autism is not an illness but a condition that is characterized by difference. As the book notes, this has led to a debate regarding federal funding for autism. For example, Pitney points toward the contested area of federal funding for autism research. He notes that there is a current discussion between those who are of the opinion that autism is an illness, and therefore maintain that federal dollars ought to be earmarked for medical research into the etiology and genetics of autism, and those who are of the opinion that autism is not an illness that needs to be cured. This group believes that federal dollars should go toward research on accommodating autistic individuals and supporting their needs, both in schools and in workplaces."
"4","In terms of education and public policy, Pitney provides a fairly detailed history of the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) and the Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1997. But, as the author notes, parents often face “procedural burdens” (p. 84) in getting their school boards, teachers, and special education departments to comply with these federal regulations. Pitney documents some of the roadblocks that parents face in confronting financially strapped (or even well‐off) school districts as they advocate for their children."
"5","Pitney's research presents a picture of a bureaucratic and political disaster, a potential “tsunami” (p. 108) for families living with autism as these children get older and struggle to secure appropriate employment and housing services. He suggests that while the politics of autism is defined by the uncertainty of the condition, and while autism is also defined by various discourses surrounding the condition, what is missing is the “voice of the rank and file” (p. 122)—autistic individuals themselves. For those who are concerned about the life chances of autistic individuals and want to understand the difficulties of attaining equal life chances for autistic individuals, this book is of great benefit."
