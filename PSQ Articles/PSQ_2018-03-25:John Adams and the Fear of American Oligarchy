"1","The American Founders were not political philosophers but thoughtful statesmen. Such an assessment is uncontroversial if we, their descendants, look upon our estimable ancestors soberly, an assessment that is tacitly illustrated in Luke Mayville's book on the political thought of John Adams. Mayville's book successfully recovers Adams's political thought from that of a reactionary conservative with oligarchic sympathies to a prescient statesman who feared the propensity of the new American republic to drift toward oligarchy. Moreover, he successfully demonstrates that Adams's fear was warranted insofar as he saw that the power of wealth lies not in what it purchases but in what it invokes in modern commercial republics: admiration. And yet as Adams's political thought is that of a thoughtful statesman, so Mayville's book offers an incomplete diagnosis of a systemic ill in the American republic."
"2","The book is divided into an introduction, four chapters, and a conclusion. The introduction advances Mayville's thesis that Adams feared the latent power of oligarchy in the new American republic; the first chapter, Adams's qualified embrace of mixed regimes such as the American and the perennial threat of oligarchy to them as outlined in his Defense of the Constitutions; the second, Adams's reasons for fearing a perpetual oligarchic threat as discussed in his correspondence with Jefferson; the third, Adams's analysis of why wealth is politically potent in modern commercial republics as examined in his Discourses on Davila; the fourth, Adams's prescription for diverting admiration of wealth toward that of virtue and merit; and lastly, Mayville's concluding assessment. The final fourth of the book consists of notes, a bibliography, and an index.         "
"3","The strength of the political thought of Mayville's Adams is also its weakness. Adams rightly recognized that modern commercial republics equate wealth with happiness (pp. 16, 115). Their citizens esteem the wealthy and associate their excellence at moneymaking with excellence simply (p. 106ff.). Why should the successful businessman not also be the successful statesman? Moreover, Adams correctly feared that his (ill‐conceived) remedy of titles for diverting admiration of wealth toward merit would be ignored by citizens whose egalitarianism cannot tolerate honorifics, even as a means to harness concern with private good to serve the public good (p. 131ff.). Such citizens level meritorious offices to bring them closer to the people (pp. 21–22, 144ff.). Why should every instrument of the Constitution not be democratic? Adams's political thought, then, is characterized both by a fear of oligarchy and by a fear of genuine democracy. But herein lie the problems."
"4","Modern commonwealths are not built upon virtue but upon comfortable self‐preservation, that is, security and wealth; the American republic is not a true mixed regime founded upon the equal claims of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, but one founded upon “the Consent of the Governed,” that is, popular sovereignty. Are we truly surprised by American citizens who elect a questionable businessman as president (p. 15), or who protest a Constitution that stipulates undemocratic vetting mechanisms for its more important offices? Preoccupations with wealth and equality are systemic to our regime. Both Adams and Mayville acknowledge without critique the nature of the American mixed regime (pp. 31–33, 82), while neither mentions that of modern commonwealths. As such points are never examined, so a more substantive analysis of the validity of Adams's fears is never developed."
"5","Mayville's commendable book on John Adams's political thought is recommended to students of American political philosophy and American history, as well as to a general audience of intelligent readers. But it is also recommended that Mayville's book be supplemented by those political philosophers who underlie Adams's political thought, such as Montesquieu, Locke, and Hobbes."
