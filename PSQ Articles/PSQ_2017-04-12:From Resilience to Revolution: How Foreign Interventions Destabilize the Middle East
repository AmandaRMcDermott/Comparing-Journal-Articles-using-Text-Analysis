"1","Sean L. Yom has written a brilliant yet easily digestible monograph that explains the essential problem facing regimes in the Middle East today. The key idea is that external patronage, although perhaps stabilizing in the short run, is ultimately destructive by allowing leaders to forgo inclusive bargains with their domestic social groups and by encouraging reliance on repression and exclusionary institutions. External diplomatic, fiscal, and military support, in other words, is akin to the “resource curse” or foreign aid in obviating the need for regimes to develop strong social coalitions that legitimate their rule. In Yom's view—correct, I think—state weakness follows not from “bad” institutions, as in much of the current literature, but from the failure to invest in social support. External patronage, even if only an implicit guarantee of the regime, reduces incentives for leaders to make the kinds of political and policy compromises necessary to build regime legitimacy."
"2","This argument is illustrated in three well‐researched case studies. In Kuwait, the ruling Sabah family lacked an external patron from the 1930s on. Britain, which had previously backed the regime, made clear in June 1938 that it had no intention of sustaining the family in the midst of a constitutional crisis. The monarchy was then forced to negotiate power with the local clans, the Bedouins, and the Shia. Crucially, this deal and the coalitions that resulted were established before 1946, when large oil revenues started to roll into the country. Instead of destroying the merchant opposition, oil wealth was subsequently converted into additional patronage to support the regime. This strategy paid dividends in 1991, when Kuwaitis rejected rule by Iraq and demanded the return of Sabah rulers."
"3","Iran demonstrates the problems of external support. The traditional foundations of Iranian politics have been the landowning elite, the bazaar (shopkeepers, artisans, and merchants), and the Shia clerics. World War II stimulated urban mobilization, especially the communist Tudeh Party and the National Front led by Mohammad Mossadegh. After nationalizing the Arab‐Iranian Oil Company, Mossadegh was overthrown in 1953 by a royalist coup planned in conjunction with U.S. and British intelligence. Massive U.S. assistance then followed, swamping oil revenue late into the decade. His survival now guaranteed, the shah felt no pressure to compromise with society and became increasingly personalist and repressive. As oil revenues expanded in the 1970s, the shah actually sought to transform Iranian society in the White Revolution, which aimed to destroy traditional elites through land reform and sideline the clerics. In a form of moral hazard, this program of social transformation could not have been contemplated absent U.S. backing for the regime. With the shah lacking social support, however, a series of small demonstrations in early 1979 quickly escalated into revolution."
"4","Finally, Jordan is an intermediate case in which support from the United States has allowed the Hashemite monarchy to build a narrow constituency of Transjordanian social forces while excluding the larger Palestinian community, but this narrow coalition has been sufficient to sustain the regime in a tenuous grip on power. Faced with broad‐based social instability in 1957, the Jordanian monarchy was, as in the other cases, rescued by massive U.S. aid. By doubling down on its Transjordanian base and the United States, the monarchy survived a civil war in September 1970. The end result has been regime survival but constant political ferment."
"5","The primary implication of this analysis, in Yom's words, is that “If Washington wants to keep even its most unsavory allies in weak states in power, it should get out of the way and support them less. Helping hurts” (p. 218; italics in original). This sounds right. Yet, written as a work of comparative politics rather than international relations, it is precisely at this point that Yom's work stops short. Other than in a few brief asides, missing from this otherwise fine study is any attempt to explain why external powers choose to support weak regimes and permit—if not encourage—them to engage in repressive and destabilizing practices. The effects of such support are not unknown or unexpected. The United States pursued essentially the same strategy with the same consequences in Central American in the early twentieth century. When external powers have interests in foreign countries, they often prefer to support leaders who will do their bidding even though this may undermine regime stability in the long run. Indeed, they sometimes prefer a leader who is weak and dependent on their support precisely because such leaders are easier to control. In such cases, state weakness is not a “bug” but a “feature.” Yom succeeds admirably in demonstrating the consequences of external patronage. If he had examined the incentives of the external patrons with as much insight, he would have seen more clearly that the problems created by foreign support will not go away anytime soon.         "
