"1","For good reason, Harry Truman's Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, entitled his Pulitzer Prize‐winning memoir, Present at the Creation. An architect of the national security state, Acheson understood that when it comes to the war power, the Cold War presidency is as different from its predecessor as modern man is from prehistoric Lucy.         "
"2","The basics are familiar. During the early Cold War, Truman concluded that inter‐branch deliberations over war and peace were luxuries the country could not afford. The constant threat of Soviet aggression meant that the nation was already at war, and to protect the country, the president had to have the unilateral power to act, with force if necessary, anywhere in the world. Every post‐war president has advanced some version of this claim to justify military action unauthorized by Congress."
"3","In Long Wars and the Constitution, Tulane legal scholar Stephen Griffin has taken a new look at this transformation. His treatment is refreshingly balanced. He argues that the national security state cannot be reconciled with the language of the Constitution, but that the pre‐war state of play, in which presidents accepted that war required prior congressional approval, was entirely unsuited to the demands of the Cold War. Though Truman launched a new constitutional order, moralizing condemnation overlooks the extent to which his actions were justified by the perceived demands of the day.         "
"4","Griffin is at his best explaining the change from old to new constitutional regimes. His research is prodigious, and his prose is clear. But he stumbles when he tries to describe the consequences of the transformation. Building on his earlier work, Griffin sees a contrast between the “legalized” and “non‐legalized” constitutions (p. 16); the former is subject to judicial control, while the latter is subject to control only by the political process. The war power is part of the non‐legalized constitution, because the courts refrain from adjudicating disputes between Congress and the president over the power to wage war."
"5","But why does this matter? Griffin bemoans the national security state for breaking the “cycle of accountability” between Congress and the president (p. 5). Because the pre‐war rules obligated the president to secure congressional approval before going to war, Congress participated in the process of setting the war's limits and shared in the political responsibility for its success or failure. Now, by contrast, presidents launch campaigns with inadequate planning, and Congress feels no obligation to back them when things go awry. And because this takes place under the auspices of the non‐legal constitution, the judiciary cannot decide cases that set rules for the future, which allows the disasters to recur."
"6","Griffin's argument is provocative, but not without flaws. The claim that congressional engagement will bring sense to military planning is not self‐evident, and history is not kind to the premise. Likewise, the suggestion that congressional involvement will lead to political partnership is hard to credit. Few scholars believe that Congress has the authority to tell the president how to run a military campaign. Once the war is authorized, therefore, Congress will almost always be off the hook if it goes awry. Partisans in Congress can always maintain that the president is screwing things up, regardless of whether they voted for war in the first instance."
"7","The Truman administration changed the constitutional order in ways that continue to bedevil us. But the problem was foreseen by the Founders: it is easier to begin a war than to end one, which is why the decision to start a conflict should not be entrusted to the person who wages it. Post‐war presidents have abandoned this wisdom. References to “cycles of accountability,” and to “legalized” and “non‐legalized” constitutions, do nothing to elucidate the problem."
