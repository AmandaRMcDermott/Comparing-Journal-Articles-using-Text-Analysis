"1","This dense, powerful volume offers profound insights into the U.S. innovation system and its driving forces. The driving forces are Americans' twin desires for technology‐based military supremacy (which demands government action) and small government (which militates against it). These twin forces have produced a highly successful, ever‐evolving, and unique set of federal institutions and policies, which Linda Weiss calls the “national security state” (NSS). The NSS is the secret to American innovation. Since World War II, it has dominated high‐risk innovation, revolutionary technological change, and the formation of new S&T‐based industries. Weiss's book also reveals that the NSS is not static, but changes in response to changes in perceived geopolitical threats and to shifts in popular anti‐statist sentiments. The book explains why the NSS came about, how it works, and glimpses its future."
"2","In doing so, Weiss seeks to discredit four popular myths. First, she eviscerates the free‐market purist explanation of American innovation. Weiss provides exhaustive evidence of how extensively the Federal government has been involved in U.S. science and technology since World War II. Individual entrepreneurs and markets play important roles, but the government has been an essential actor behind the creation of every modern S&T‐based industry, including crucial assistance to the likes of Apple and Google. The chapter on government venture capital is especially revealing."
"3","Second, Weiss discredits the stereotype of the American state as being small and weak. The NSS is quite large and powerful. But it goes unrecognized because it blends public with private, especially after the 1970s. Nor does the NSS command or dictate. Instead, it frames, empowers, and rewards. Specifically, American anti‐statism forces the NSS to create unique, hybrid, private–public institutions and policies, which obscure the role of the state, while fostering innovation with strong benefits for private business and consumers, not just the military."
"4","Third, the book dispels the “serendipity” part of the American spin‐off story, which holds that innovative private firms are generated naturally and regularly by state‐subsidized R&D, especially in the defense sector. Weiss presents considerable evidence that the government is heavily involved in planning and assisting those spin‐offs."
"5","Finally, Weiss attempts to dispel the notion that the United States has a hidden industrial policy, often wrapped in defense policy garb. She instead argues that the commercial benefits of the NSS are happy effects, but not a primary motivation. In my opinion, this is perhaps the least convincing of her arguments, though still a legitimate one."
"6","Weiss singles out for political scientists two implications of her research. To “varieties of capitalism” scholars, she explains that the United States is not a liberal market economy. The NSS performs the same functions that governments of coordinated market economies do, just less overtly. Comparative institutionalists often miss this, and therefore need to be more rigorous in their investigations. To scholars of American political development, she urges that more attention be paid to international events and the importance of the military for state building.         "
"7","American Inc? concludes with predictions about the future of the NSS and American innovation. Weiss's predictions are far from dire. Her main concern is that financialization combined with outsourcing has created a disconnect between innovation and production. Americans innovate at home, but produce abroad. But the former cannot flourish long without the latter. This also sends jobs, tax dollars, and industrial infrastructure to places like China, leaving us as shareholders acting out of short‐term financial interests.         "
"8","If there is a weakness in this book, it is in the framing and perhaps the style. This is a very important and well‐researched book on an important topic. It should be required reading for undergraduate and graduate students of economics, business, and public policy. It is especially important for scholars of the developmental state and of innovation debates. Policymakers, politicians, and voters would also do well to absorb this book's findings. However, it is targeted at political scientists, mostly comparative political economists and security studies scholars, where the audience is small and less able to create real social and policy change. It is also a fairly scholarly book addressed to readers who already have a basic knowledge of the innovation debate. Nonetheless, it deserves close attention from anyone with an interest in innovation or America's place at the technological frontier."
