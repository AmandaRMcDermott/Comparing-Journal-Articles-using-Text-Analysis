"1","The last 20 years have seen tremendous changes in the importance of state supreme courts. These courts are increasingly at the forefront of legal and policy change, which has led to increased attention to the methods by which justices on these courts are chosen. Many policymakers and scholars have argued that the method by which state supreme court justices are elected has profound implications for the qualifications and judgment of the individuals on these courts and the decisions they hand down."
"2","In Voters’ Verdicts: Citizens, Campaigns, and Institutions in State Supreme Court Elections, Chris W. Bonneau and Damon M. Cann explore the effects that cues related to judicial candidates have on voters in states with different judicial selection methods. The authors argue that in addition to differences in selection methods, recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court involving judicial campaign speech, judicial recusal, campaign finance, and public financing of elections have fundamentally altered the conditions in which state judicial elections are taking place, necessitating a closer look at these institutions. In addition to these changes, campaign spending in state supreme court elections has increased dramatically in the last 20 years. Bonneau and Cann explore the impact of these changes in the landscape of state supreme court elections using data collected at the individual level to address voter behavior in these elections across states. The authors’ primary goal is to investigate how partisan cues affect individual vote choice in state supreme court elections.         "
"3","The results of their analysis of voter behavior in state supreme court elections are quite informative. In addressing the frequency of roll‐off—the tendency of voters to simply not complete the portion of the ballot containing judicial candidates—they theorize that partisan cues about the candidates provide useful information to voters. They find that roll‐off is greater in states that select judges using nonpartisan systems than in states with partisan elections in which the party identification of judges appears on the ballot, suggesting the importance of those cues in participating in judicial elections."
"4","The authors further find that partisan cues have a similar influence on vote choice. Grounding their work on judicial elections in the long history of research on the role of partisanship in voter participation in American politics more generally, Bonneau and Cann question the conventional wisdom that nonpartisan elections are an improvement over partisan elections in that they allow voters to focus on the qualifications and performance of judges rather than simply partisan cues to help make their vote choice. Relying on data from 17 elections during the 2010 and 2012 campaign cycles, they find that partisanship has nearly as strong an influence in nonpartisan states as in partisan states, thus calling into serious question one of the primary arguments that proponents of nonpartisan elections make regarding the removal of political partisanship from vote choice."
"5","Bonneau and Cann add to our understanding of the role of partisan cues on individual voter choice in state supreme court elections. Their work demonstrates that the hopes of reformers who sought to remove, or at least reduce, the political pressures on these judges have not been successful, with little difference between partisan and nonpartisan elections. Even merit selection systems are influenced by partisan cues, although at lower levels than in the other systems. The implications of their work are quite profound, suggesting that efforts over the last 70‐plus years to reform state supreme court selection systems may need to be rethought."
