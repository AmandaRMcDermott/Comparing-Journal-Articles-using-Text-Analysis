"1","Ken Hughes, a researcher in the University of Virginia's Miller Center Presidential Recordings Program, has provided a great service to Vietnam War scholars and those interested in understanding the history of the Vietnam War. With hundreds of books having been written using conventional archival sources and oral histories, we have read about the “decent interval,” “madman theory,” sidebar discussions with Le Duc Tho, and Henry Kissinger's meetings with Chinese leader Zhou Enlai. And, with reasonable citations, we know that the president was preoccupied with ending the war with “peace and honor.” Some historians have also understood and written of Richard Nixon's cynical use of those terms and accepted the idea that the president's paranoia would have driven him to be overly concerned about his 1972 reelection."
"2","Now we have the spoken word through the Nixon tapes, and the “back‐and‐forth” exchange between the president and his national security adviser, that verifies most everything that historians have been saying for years. To read the president's words even without hearing the emotions expressed is to realize how reelection drove decision making in the later years of the war."
"3","Hughes's thesis of Nixon's preoccupation with the timing of the announcement of a “deal” with the communists reveals the extent to which he was using his national security adviser and chief negotiator at the Paris Peace Talks as a political adviser. It was Kissinger who was sent to Saigon to convince President Nguyen Van Thieu that he should accept the proposal that the United States was presenting to North Vietnam, which included the continued presence of North Vietnam's troops south of the 17th parallel. And, knowing that Thieu would reject the proposal, it was Kissinger who was given the responsibility of telling Thieu that it was absolutely imperative that he not publicly reject the idea prior to the 7 November 1972 election. “Got to win big,” said Nixon, not content just to win the election but to “finish the destruction of McGovern and the doves, which is just as important,” as expressed by his national security adviser (p. 84). The president then summed up his feelings about the war: “I look at the tide of history out there, South Vietnam probably can never even survive anyway. I'm just being perfectly candid. We also have to realize, Henry, that winning an election is terribly important” (p. 85)."
"4","Reading these words and imagining the casual conversation while American and Vietnamese were killing each other is painful, but it is important to understanding the extent to which Nixon's desire for reelection drove defense policy."
"5","Fatal Politics pulls no punches regarding how a sophisticated, technologically enhanced listening of the Nixon tapes changes our interpretation of the final months of the war. Hughes provides a very critical analysis of recent works such as The Nixon Tapes: 1971–1972 by Douglas Brinkley and Luke Nichter and the documentary Last Days in Vietnam by Rory Kennedy. Thus, he is using the most primary source available to change the way historians interpret the way the Vietnam War ended. Hughes has taken us into areas of Nixon's administration that we only previously imagined and provided insights into a tragic period of American history. This is an important book that adds a lot to the historiography of the Vietnam War.         "
