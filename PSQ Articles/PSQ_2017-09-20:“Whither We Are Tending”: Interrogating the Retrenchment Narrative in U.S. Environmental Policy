"1","IN PREVIOUS WORK, WE ARGUED that much of modern environmental policymaking has been characterized by “green drift,” a “slow and even halting general movement in policy directions favored by environmentalists.”1 The logic of the argument is that the legislative gridlock that has held on most environmental issues since the late 1980s has locked into place the raft of pro‐environment, “golden‐era” laws passed in the 1960s and 1970s. On many issues, despite growing opposition from business interests and repeated conservative assaults over the past 35 years, environmentalists have held the high ground defined by the most recent layer of statutes outlining the contours of the modern green state. We did not fully develop the green drift argument, leaving it as an important implication of our work and a counterpoint to the then‐prominent “death of environmentalism” thesis advanced by Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus.2"
"2","Judith Layzer's Open for Business offers a critical perspective on the green drift hypothesis, developing the strongest version of what we call the “retrenchment narrative” in environmental policy.3 This narrative is quite common among environmental groups and in the media. For instance, the Natural Resources Defense Council stated that “[o]ver the course of the first term, [the George W. Bush] administration led the most thorough and destructive campaign against America's environmental safeguards in the past 40 years.” As Bush prepared to leave office, Sierra Club spokesperson Josh Dorner commented that Bush “has undone decades if not a century of progress on the environment.”4"
"3","Layzer sees a general right turn and rollback in environmental policy since the golden era, a central tendency defined by the right's assault on the green state. She suggests that we (and others) made the same error that Jacob Hacker illuminated in his widely cited work on welfare state retrenchment. As Hacker has it, early welfare state retrenchment studies looked for major statutory changes and big budget cuts, found none, and concluded that, despite rising political pressures, retrenchment had not occurred.5 Hacker argues that this conclusion was wrong because the real story of retrenchment was not in statutory changes or budgets but in subtler, “everyday forms of retrenchment” below the level of legislated changes that had led to rollbacks in the welfare state, with substantial increases in citizens’ exposures to economic risks.         "
"4","Following Hacker's argument, Layzer contends that focusing on the remarkable staying power of the golden‐era environmental laws overlooks the myriad ways that conservatives have remade environmental policy and possibility in the era of legislative gridlock that has held, more or less, since 1980. Despite their repeated failures to break the basic statutory commitments of the 1960s and 1970s,            "
"5","[Conservatives have] adopted a more subtle strategy aimed at ensuring that laws are implemented and enforced in ways that reduce the stringency of federal environmental protection. Couching their challenges in the language of reason and moderation, they have used procedural requirements—such as cost‐benefit analysis, risk assessment, risk “balancing,” and regulatory review—to discourage new regulations. They have also modified the wording and interpretation of rules in ways that have limited their stringency.6"
"6","Layzer contends that policy made on what we called “alternative pathways” around gridlock has generally favored conservative interests, in a halting but steady movement to the right. In developing her case for retrenchment‐beyond‐gridlock, and her story that this is the central tendency in modern environmental policymaking, she adopts Hacker's concepts of “drift,” “layering,” and “conversion” as core retrenchment strategies.7"
"7","We think that the retrenchment narrative is wrong. This article will interrogate it in two ways, first with a brief discussion of the substance of modern environmental policymaking and then with some analysis of the ways that ideas about environmental policy retrenchment connect to the broader retrenchment literature in policy studies that has been organized around the work of Hacker and his collaborators."
"8","Our substantive story is straightforward. The right's failure to undo any of the major golden‐era statutes matters a great deal. Informed by administrative theories that came to prominence in the 1960s, those laws typically include clear agency‐forcing mandates and provisions for citizen lawsuits, sharply limiting the discretion available to those seeking to undo their protections.8 These provisions narrow the possibilities of “everyday forms of retrenchment.” Environmentalists have seen defeats, and the political barriers to updating the environmental laws have created real problems. But greens have also made many profoundly important gains on the pathways around legislative gridlock. Like their opponents, environmentalists have pursued “subtle strategies” aimed at advancing their goals, and they have done so from strategically powerful positions defined by the requirements of the golden‐era laws.         "
"9","At the theoretical level, Layzer's application of the “drift/layering/conversion” concepts raises many questions, but she does not explore the concepts deeply or see the complexities that arise when applying the Hacker framework to the study of environmental policy. If she had, she would have seen that the “subtle strategies” that she thinks lead to retrenchment have often advanced rather than rolled back the cause of environmental protection. This part of the article attempts to connect thinking about patterns in environmental policy to Hacker's important framework for understanding larger patterns of policy change, a move that we think promises to enrich both the environmental policy field and conversations in the larger field of public policy studies."
"10","This move also has important normative implications. Hacker and his colleagues have been deeply concerned with the undemocratic character of the politics of retrenchment in social policy. They write,            "
"11","In a world marked by stark information and power asymmetries and vast differences in resources and organizational capacities, who actually governs? Political contestation often pits the organized and information‐rich—the political actors most able to block the updating of policies, the actors most capable of changing institutions from within—against the disorganized and information‐poor. By opening our eyes to drift and conversion, we can better understand not just the sources of institutional change but also the structure of power in advanced societies.9"
"12","This is all undoubtedly true, but in environmental policymaking, the realities of power are more complex: environmental interests are well organized and informed. They, too, have shown themselves capable of transforming institutions from within, not against the disorganized and information poor but against interests that cannot match their advantages: the clear language of protective statutes, the strength of protective frames in policy discourse, and, at times, friendly presidential administrations. Environmentalists, too, have pressed their advantages in venues—the appropriation process, executive politics, the courts—in which public attention is often quite limited and accountability proves elusive. In the era of legislative gridlock, both environmental policy retrenchment and advancement often take place in what is, for the average inattentive citizen, the dark.10"
"13","In developing these substantive and theoretical points, we want to unpack the “green drift” concept and highlight its importance. Green drift is not the only tendency in modern environmental policymaking, but we think that students of environmental policy need a more nuanced analysis of “where we are, and whither we are tending” than the claim about “30 years of gutting” made by Shellenberger and Nordhaus or Layzer's retrenchment narrative.11 That analysis should account for what Karen Orren and Stephen Skowronek would call the “intercurrent” character of modern environmental policymaking, the coexistence and juxtaposition of conflicting tendencies, and the “crashing and grinding of multiple political orders” in this field.12 And it should take seriously the capacities of environmentalism to mobilize both law and public opinion.         "
"14","The election of Donald Trump and a Republican‐controlled Senate and House present opportunities for real retrenchment in environmental policy, testing the resiliency of the green state. It is still too early to determine the extent of the rollbacks that will occur, but efforts at change through budget politics and executive politics have begun, and some congressional leaders see an opportunity for dramatic changes. But it is important to acknowledge that there have been repeated efforts at retrenchment since the early 1980s, and that these efforts have had at best limited success. It will take many years and court battles before it is clear what, if any, changes to existing rules and national monuments will survive. What statutory changes Republicans will seriously pursue also remains unclear. What is clear is that any major retrenchments in the environmental field will come through statutory change, due to the electoral triumph of extremists seizing power despite rather than because of their environmental policy agenda, not the triumph of conservative ideas about the perils of the green state.         "
"15","Hacker credits Paul Pierson's Dismantling the Welfare State? for its careful specification of the dependent variable of interest in retrenchment studies. Pierson defines retrenchment as “policy changes that either cut social expenditure, restructure welfare state programs to conform more closely to the residual welfare state model, or alter the political environment in ways that enhance the probability of such outcomes in the future.”13 Pierson distinguishes “programmatic retrenchment,” immediate changes in programs, from “systemic retrenchment,” long‐term changes in the political environment that set the table for future rollbacks. As noted earlier, Pierson concludes that by these lights, “the fundamental structure of social policy [in Great Britain and the United States] remain(ed) comparatively stable.”14"
"16","What would programmatic retrenchment look like in environmental policy? First, it would involve the repeal of or significant amendments to statutes. As we showed in Beyond Gridlock, the major environmental laws have been targeted repeatedly over the past 30 years, but this form of retrenchment has not occurred. The basic statutory framework established in the 1960s and 1970s remains in place.         "
"17","Retrenchment might take the form of sustained budget cuts at agencies charged with environmental protection. This has not occurred, either. As Peter Balint and James Conan show, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) budgets have fluctuated over the past 45 years, but they have done so within a general, very modest, upward trend. The sharpest short‐term reductions were seen in the late Jimmy Carter years and then, unsurprisingly, in brief periods during the Ronald Reagan presidency and both the George H.W. and George W. Bush presidencies. There is no evidence in the aggregate budgetary data of a sustained retrenchment at the EPA.15 Contenders for the Republican presidential nomination have mused about “shuttering” the “job‐killing organization of America,” but Republican presidents have presided over growth in EPA budgets over the course of their whole terms of office.16"
"18","By the simplest retrenchment measures, then, no serious rollbacks or programmatic retrenchments have occurred. This leads to Layzer's focus on “everyday forms of retrenchment,” backdoor efforts to roll back the green state."
"19","Layzer notes that this “subtle strategy” has been reinforced by an ideological offensive, a long game aimed at discrediting government generally and highlighting the costs and inefficiencies of pollution control and protective conservation policy. This long game—systemic retrenchment—aims to open space for “everyday forms of retrenchment” now and to cultivate a political environment in which more fundamental rollbacks might be achieved in the future.17 Following Kathleen Thelen and Wolfgang Streeck, Layzer argues that “directly or in combination, direct and low‐profile challenges can produce incremental policy changes, which result in ‘gradual institutional transformations that add up to major historical discontinuities.’” Layzer sees an emergent “major historical discontinuity” arising from the slow accumulations of drift, conversion, and layering in environmental policy.18"
"20","We will turn to these concepts soon, but we must start with four substantive responses to the retrenchment narrative. First, the right's failure to repeal or significantly amend the statutes passed in the 1960s and 1970s leaves those laws as defining features of the modern policyscape. As we noted earlier, the golden‐era environmental laws contain fairly specific directives to implementing agencies, tied to provisions for citizen petitions to force agency action and citizen lawsuits to challenge agency inaction. Alert environmental groups regularly and successfully sue agencies that ignore clear legal requirements. Layzer's suggestion that the courts are an increasingly inhospitable venue for environmentalists is problematic. At the end of Barack Obama's second term, Democrats will have controlled the presidency for 16 of the past 24 years, with important consequences for the composition of the federal judiciary. As of October 2014, Obama had filled 288 federal judgeships, one‐third of the federal judiciary, including 233 district court slots and 53 on the courts of appeal. When Obama took office, Republican appointees were in the majority on 10 of the 13 appeals courts. As of 2014, 9 of the 13 had Democratic majorities. Layzer's claim that the U.S. Supreme Court has rolled back standing to sue for environmentalists, backed by references to the 1990 and 1992 Lujan cases, ignores the 2000 decision in Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw, which pointed the other way and created significant dissonance in this area of law.19"
"21","Consider Layzer's own treatment of the George W. Bush administration's efforts to weaken Clean Air Act (CAA) protections. Bush made relaxing CAA protections a priority. Its legislative proposals failed, and the administration focused heavily on rulemaking and subtler forms of retrenchment. Crucially, none of Bush's major gambits—New Source Review, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, Clear Skies, and the cap‐and‐trade mercury rule—succeeded. Moreover, the Bush EPA was compelled to finalize a raft of Bill Clinton–era air quality rules because of overwhelming evidence supporting those rules. Later, driven by CAA mandates and the politics of air quality, the Bush EPA adopted new rules covering pollution from diesel fuels that were hailed by environmentalists as great victories. The failure to win rollback amendments to the CAA meant that the Bush administration had to fight on terrain defined by the 1970 law. The law's plain language profoundly limited Bush's leeway for remaking air pollution policy administratively, or by rule."
"22","Layzer states that her argument holds better for natural resources and land management policies than for pollution control, but this raises more questions than it answers about central tendencies in environmental policymaking in the Bush years and across the decades she covers. For instance, although Bush spent eight years passively and then actively attacking Clinton's “roadless rule” protecting nearly 60 million acres of national forest land, the rule remained in place in 2016."
"23","Second, while the right has engaged in a long‐term ideological project aimed at creating a political context in which retrenchments of the green state might become possible, this campaign has not been successful. There is evidence that the electorate as a whole has become more rather than less liberal in recent years, and certainly younger cohorts have trended more liberal and Democratic.20 On environmental issues, generic public attitudes remain fairly supportive of environmental protection, and again this is especially the case among younger people, whose attitudes promise to be critical years into the future. A 2014 Gallup poll showed that 60 percent of respondents ages 18 to 29 favored prioritizing environmental protection over economic growth, with 52 percent of those ages 30 to 49, 49 percent of those ages 50 to 64, and 39 percent of those over age 65 sharing that view.21 The struggle to define the role of the state in environmental protection remains just that, a struggle. The right has gained ground, as evidenced by extremely high levels of generic distrust in government. But substantial support for environmentalism remains, and that support is available to be mobilized by defenders of the green state.         "
"24","And, of course, there are skilled and well‐resourced defenders of environmentalism in the field, with significant resources and experience in framing environmental policy problems in ways that complicate realization of the rollback agenda.22 To put it bluntly, who wants to be on the wrong side of the arsenic‐in‐drinking‐water question? The right has hammered at the premises of activist government for decades, but environmental advocates have powerful “policy narratives” of their own that carry considerable legitimacy and power.23 This is not to say that environmentalists dominate political discourse—far from it. But there is little evidence that the right's narrative controls discourse on environmental policy.24"
"25","Third, the right's ideological project faces major institutional challenges—the ideas that generated the protective environmental statutes in the 1960s and 1970s are deeply embedded institutionally. In his treatment of resources policy in the West, Charles Wilkinson observes that, despite dramatic political, economic, and cultural changes, policy is still dominated by the “lords of yesterday,” laws and institutions reflecting nineteenth‐century values and interests.25 The golden‐era statutes are “the lords of a little while ago,” also holding considerable power to shape policy realities despite changes in the broader political‐economic and ideological contexts. The “old” ideas of the 1960s and 1970s are firmly entrenched in laws, bureaucratic routines, and public expectations. Alert, well‐resourced environmental groups are well positioned to invoke the requirements of existing laws in ways that blunt conservative assaults.         "
"26","Finally, the political right's most effective strategies for rolling back environmental protections have come below the level of legislative politics. Yet nonlegislative “policymaking pathways” are also productive avenues for environmentalists. Conservatives certainly have worked all of the paths around gridlock: appropriation riders, executive politics (appointments, administrative centralization through the Office of Management and Budget, executive orders, rulemaking, the use of discretion over enforcement and prioritization), collaborative alternatives to traditional regulation, and by strategically advocating for some authorities (for example, choices about access to federal lands) to be pushed out to states. But the politics of alternative pathways has been far less one‐dimensional than Layzer suggests. Conservative gambits have often failed, or they have had only temporary effects before reversal by courts or executive actions taken by environmentally friendly administrations. Environmentalists, too, have used these pathways around gridlock, often to successful ends—witness Obama's aggressive Clean Power Plan. It is simply wrong to impose a simple retrenchment narrative on the chaotic, contentious politics of the modern green state."
"27","Hacker's framework for studying “everyday forms of retrenchment” centers on the concepts of “drift,” “conversion,” and “layering.”26 This section summarizes these concepts and considers how each of them can help us understand patterns of retrenchment in environmental policymaking. (Hacker's framework is reproduced in Figure 1.) We will then show that drift, conversion, and layering are not solely forms of policy retrenchment but instead have also advanced the cause of environmentalism. In the following section, we will summarize our vision of green drift and identify conditions under which we expect it to occur. Furthermore, we will argue that “green drift” has been a critical part of the story of the past 35 years of environmental policymaking.         "
"28","Hacker framework"
"29","Source: Hacker, “Privatizing Risk,” 248.                     "
"30","According to Hacker, drift‐as‐retrenchment occurs when “authoritative policy change” is blocked by the availability of veto points for supporters of the existing laws and the prospects for “internal policy conversion” are limited by strong interest group or public support for the status quo and/or clear legal mandates that limit administrative discretion.27 He defines drift as “changes in the operation or effect of policies that occur without significant changes in those policies’ structure,” typically because of changes in “the social context of policies, such as the rise of new or newly intensified social risks with which existing programs are poorly equipped to grapple.”28 Opponents of social protection achieve rollbacks not only by changing laws but also by ensuring that existing laws are not adapted to new demands and changing circumstances. Opponents of minimum wages may not be able to repeal the law (high barriers to statutory change), and they may not be able to change the policy administratively (there is little room for amendment by rule). But if they can simply block increases in the minimum wage, they will have achieved retrenchment as policy drift. Scholars looking for statutory changes as indicators of retrenchment will not find them and might conclude that no significant retrenchment has occurred. But in a dynamic political‐economic environment, the failure to update the law to meet new circumstances yields important policy changes.29"
"31","This maps nicely onto challenges in modern environmental policymaking. The old environmental laws operate in a dynamic context. Economic and technological changes create new risks and pressures. Population growth, urbanization, and globalization continue apace, intensifying old problems and generating new challenges. Science uncovers new risks, even as the success of old programs at controlling some sources of environmental degradation illuminates threats from other, poorly regulated sources. In the era of congressional gridlock, authoritative policy change has proved difficult. Environmentalists seeking to deepen old commitments and confront emerging challenges have failed to win new laws or major amendments to old statutes. We should add here, too, that developing knowledge about how to deliver policy results more efficiently is part of the dynamic political context. In the environmental field, the “next generation school” advocates of more efficient, collaborative policy have also failed to achieve anything like “authoritative policy change.”30"
"32","Internal policy conversion has also proven to be challenging in some areas. The environmental laws of the 1960s and 1970s were shaped by the administrative theories of that era, aimed at avoiding the problems of agency capture that had proliferated across the midcentury regulatory state. The laws typically include timetables, specific directives to implementing agencies, and provisions for citizen petitions and citizen lawsuits to force agency action. It is difficult to convert the old laws to new, contradictory purposes. This is especially true because attentive environmental groups, their position buttressed by reasonably strong, if diffuse, support for their positions, are quick to challenge agency recalcitrance with petitions and lawsuits."
"33","Thus, the situation seems ripe for drift‐as‐retrenchment. This would be most likely when the protective laws passed in the 1960s and 1970s overlooked or underplayed some important or emergent environmental risk, specific environmental challenges intensify and overwhelm existing laws, and new technologies or societal changes generate problems not anticipated by established laws. When the reach of the existing laws is unclear and a matter for contestation in the policy process, drift will involve administrative strategies aimed at blocking the development of new rules or limiting their scope and effects."
"34","One example of an issue not adequately addressed in the golden‐era laws is the regulation of nonpoint sources of water pollution under the Clean Water Act (CWA).31 Daniel Press accurately observes that the politicians who adopted the 1972 CWA focused on “what they could see,”32 municipal sewage and industrial point sources of pollution. The act's handling of nonpoint sources was limited.33 The very success of point source regulations magnified the importance of nonpoint sources as degraders of water quality; in a different world, the law would have been updated to account for its weaknesses. But serious updates to the CWA have not been achievable, and regulations that would extend its reach to new problems have been blocked or hotly contested. For example, many states are developing total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) to address rivers and lakes not meeting water quality standards. Such TMDLs are required under the CWA for “threatened and impaired waters,” and are becoming the de facto approach to dealing with nonpoint water pollution. Many of the TMDLs under development, often because of a court order, have generated controversy (for example, the plan to control nitrogen, phosphorous, and sediment entering Chesapeake Bay). Although TMDLs are part of the law, each one is developed independently, leading to administrative and legal conflict that has slowed their development. Press, citing the failures of the CWA, calls for a “new commitment, equal in ambition and resolve to the one that reformed the dangerous wastewater practices of yesteryear.”34 For now, though, there are huge barriers to authoritative policy change and only limited possibilities for internal policy conversion. So we see Hacker's drift‐as‐retrenchment: by blocking action to update the law, those opposed to more stringent water quality regulations win major victories.            "
"35","Another example of drift enforced by administrative action‐as‐inaction, one that was slowed by the Obama administration, involves the Clean Air Act and climate change. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) were not addressed in the original CAA. The CAA requires the EPA to issue new standards for emissions found to “cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,” and of course, that provision has been at issue in the struggle over regulating greenhouse gases.35 The George W. Bush administration's record in blocking waivers and avoiding conducting an “endangerment” analysis of GHGs is well known—this policy of avoidance generated drift. If the CAA could not be updated to address GHGs, opponents of action on climate would call the nondecision a major victory. With the 2009 endangerment finding and the rules that are now flowing from that finding, the Obama administration moved to stop drift, culminating in the Clean Power Plan rule issued in August 2015. Although the Clean Power Plan is on hold in the courts, and the Trump administration has begun the process of replacing the rule, the legal drivers of federal climate policy action—the Clean Air Act and the endangerment finding—remain in place—and unless these are changed—a major task—the Trump administration will be required to take some actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the Clean Power Plan and the process leading up to it signaled states and utilities that the federal government would move to reduce GHGs and many investments have already been made with this in mind. So whatever eventually becomes of the Clean Power Plan, the U.S. electric grid is moving in the direction favored by environmentalists.36"
"36","While hostile presidential administrations can block or weaken new rules that would extend environmental protection, policy drift can also lead to expansions of environmental protection. Drift‐as‐advancement takes two forms: “policy drift” and “organizational drift.”"
"37","Policy drift occurs in two circumstances. First, without statutory change, new rules and executive actions push environmental laws into new areas, giving them new power and meaning and enhancing environmental protections. Outcomes sought by environmentalists may not be mandated by statutory language, but the language opens the way, and the processes required by those laws enable environmentalists and presidential administrations to extend their reach. Citizen petitions, citizen lawsuits, routine agency processes, and presidential administrations’ preferences all drive this along. We are departing from Hacker's drift concept here, as the adoption of new rules might be viewed as internal policy conversion in his terms. If that is the case, then the elaboration of environmental protections under the gridlocked statutes is a form of conversion. But given the stakes here, the specific terms matter little, although we think that the drift metaphor captures something important in these instances of modern environmental policymaking. The realities of green drift—as drift or conversion—belie the retrenchment story."
"38","Second, policy drift occurs when statutes, such as the Clean Air Act, require regular updating based on scientific findings, as in the case of identification and standard setting for the most widely occurring air pollutants (legally referred to as criteria pollutants). The CAA requires the EPA to revisit the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for these criteria pollutants every five years, and the agency must revise the standards to protect public health “based on science without regard to costs of implementing pollution controls to achieve the standards.” Since 2008, despite sometimes vehement opposition within Congress, the EPA has made the NAAQS stricter for five of the six criteria pollutants.37"
"39","There are many examples of drift‐as‐advancement, perhaps best documented in the growing number of pages in the Federal Register decried by conservatives. As we have detailed elsewhere, the case of regulating mercury emissions from coal‐fired power plants clearly demonstrates a kind of drift. Although upon entering office the George W. Bush administration had some flexibility in determining how it would regulate, it had no choice but to regulate mercury emissions because of the CAA and court decisions. The debate over regulation centered on how to regulate and how much to regulate—the choice of not regulating mercury was not an option (and in the end, the cap‐and‐trade approach was not an option either).38"
"40","Another illustration of policy drift is in the impact of a provision of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976 requiring the U.S. Department of the Interior to take actions to prevent the “unnecessary or undue degradation” (UUD) of lands under its control that would be affected by extractive uses, particularly mining. The first regulations implementing this provision, adopted in 1980, were weak. The rule essentially ignored the “undue degradation” language of the FLPMA and conceptualized “necessary” damages to lands as those that would be caused by a “prudent operator” engaged in “proficient” and “customary” operations. In 2000, the Clinton administration, as part of an effort to remake the Mining Law of 1872 administratively, revised the rule, dropping the “prudent operator” standard and asserting the interior secretary's authority to block mines that threatened “substantial and irreparable harm” to “scientific, cultural, or environmental resource values, harms that could not be effectively mitigated.”39 The Clinton administration claimed that the FLPMA empowered it to prevent “degradation that is necessary to mining, but undue or excessive. This includes authority to disapprove plans of operations that would cause undue or excessive harm to the public lands” (emphasis added).40 This was the first time the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) claimed the power to reject a mining permit on environmental grounds, cracking the so‐called right to mine on federal lands institutionalized in the 1872 Mining Law.41 The administration immediately blocked a California gold mine based on concerns about Native American cultural sites and environmental risks. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said,               "
"41","This is the first large gold mine we have rejected. The reason is that for a quarter century the mining industry has prevailed in arguing that the Mining Law of 1872 gives them an absolute right to do whatever is necessary to further their mining plans on public land. That's simply not the case. In 1976 … Congress forbade undue degradation. No previous administration has taken that position. We do.42"
"42","Policymaking on the executive politics pathway is unstable, changing with partisan control of the White House. The George W. Bush administration pushed back with new rules, accepting several limits imposed by the Clinton administration but returning to the “prudent operator” standard and rejecting the Clinton prohibition against “substantial and irreparable harm.” Environmental groups sued, arguing that the Interior Department was abdicating its responsibility to prevent “undue degradation” of federal lands.43 In Mineral Policy Center v. Norton (2003), federal district judge Henry Kennedy agreed that the Bush administration misread the FLPMA, which “by its plain terms, vests the Secretary of the Interior with the authority—and indeed the obligation—to disapprove of an otherwise permissible mining operation because the operation, although necessary to mining, would unduly harm or degrade the public land.”44 That is, Kennedy declared that the Department of the Interior has the authority to say no to mines on environmental grounds. Having made this explosive interpretation, Kennedy backed away, arguing that Chevron deference required him to let the Bush rule stand.45 Still, the Bush administration made a host of new commitments: it would prevent UUD by exercising case‐by‐case discretion to approve or reject plans of operations; require financial guarantees; link mine performance standards to the panoply of laws that apply to mining operations, including the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the CWA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (commonly known as Superfund), the CAA, and the Archeological Resources and Protection Act; and use the secretary's FLPMA withdrawal powers to block mining in areas of critical environmental concern.46"
"43","The most aggressive part of Clinton's campaign to restrict mining on federal lands was blocked, but Mineral Policy Center v. Norton was a Pyrrhic victory for mining interests. There is a power to say no where it did not exist before. The environmental group leading the litigation described Kennedy's decision as the “most significant ruling on mining law in decades” for this reason.47"
"44","This is one of the ways drift‐as‐advancement works. The Clinton administration, supported by allies in the environmental community, pushed at the vague language of the law. The Bush administration pushed back, but in so doing, it accepted some new limitations on mining practices. This led to a legal challenge, which in this case was a victory for the mining industry wrapped inside a measurable gain for environmental interests. The Bush administration promised new assessments of the environmental impact of mines and their consistency with environmental statutes, and Mineral Policy Center v. Norton also established a judicially recognized FLPMA power to reject mining projects based on environmental concerns.            "
"45","The second form of drift‐as‐advancement comes in the form of slow organizational change, “organizational drift,” as the constant pounding of agencies such as the Forest Service and the BLM by statutory requirements, citizen petitions, litigation, negative publicity, and pressures from presidential administrations challenge established agency premises, opening them to new values and new interests. This is a tortuous process, but as it takes hold it deepens the green state and blunts some of the pressures that Layzer documented. While conservatives have tried to alter the macropolitical environment in ways that would open up opportunities for retrenchment, the Forest Service and the BLM have been operating under the ESA and FLPMA and the National Environmental Policy Act for nearly half a century. The unending pressures and “process predicaments” that have bound these and other agencies have fostered more balanced approaches to stewardship. Scholarship on the Forest Service shows that it is increasingly open to environmental concerns and that younger agency employees carry different value sets than their predecessors.48 Edward Weber and Sara Miller Chonaiew find this pattern at the BLM, suggesting that the traditional vision of a “captured” agency should be revised. They find that               "
"46","[T]he BLM of contemporary times is not captured to the same degree…as during the classic capture period (1950–1976). Instead, the contemporary BLM's story reflects the slow accumulation and solidification of environmental protection, and even sustainability, into its multi‐faceted approach to developing and managing the many natural and mineral resources under its control. In short, the growing power of environmental policy constraints and competition from the ‘new’ uses (recreation) reflecting changing societal values appear to be limiting the potential for capture by development interests.49"
"47","The retrenchment narrative ignores these developments. These agencies have been forced into engagement with actors carrying new values into the policymaking process and with courts empowered to compel them to accommodate environmental interests."
"48","For Hacker, conversion, the “internal adaptation of existing policy,” is most likely when there are high barriers to authoritative policy change but constraints on internal policy conversion are low—decision makers have considerable discretion and the policy is highly mutable.50 Hacker, Pierson, and Thelen assert that conversion‐as‐retrenchment occurs when “political actors are able to redirect institutions or policies toward purposes beyond their original intent.”51 They point to the Sherman Antitrust Act, aimed at monopolistic corporations but quickly turned into an anti‐union weapon. Hacker pointed to the ways that employers have used their discretion to restructure the publicly subsidized benefits they voluntarily provide, shifting more health and retirement risks and costs to individuals.52"
"49","Carrying this concept into regulatory policy yields interesting connections and some real problems for the retrenchment narrative. The regulatory capture literature developed a powerful conversion story. In the least cynical version, politicians seeking to protect public interests created agencies to regulate railroads, trucking, airlines, food and drug safety, and the like. But flaws in institutional design; the incentives of bureaucrats, politicians, and regulated interests; and the public's inattentiveness turned those agencies into servants of regulated interests.53 This surely looks like Hacker, Pierson, and Thelen's “conversion.”            "
"50","But there are difficulties carrying this capture narrative into environmental policy. Again, the laws of the 1960s and 1970s were shaped by concerns about agency capture, and they were written precisely to avoid conversion. The EPA may behave timidly, and its enforcement division may be deeply politicized. But it would be hard to describe the agency as captured or to point to examples of pollution control policies that have been twisted in the way that the Sherman Act was twisted. Hindering this sort of conversion was the very point of the agency‐forcing mechanisms built into the laws. It may be easier to carry the conversion concept into land and resource management. The BLM's close ties to grazing and extractive interests and the Forest Service's commitments to the timber industry are well documented. Yet even here, the capture/conversion narrative is problematic because, as Weber and Chonaiew show in their study of the BLM, the “superstructure” of environmental laws passed in the 1960s and 1970s has challenged those old relationships and created ongoing pressures for changes in the operating premises of the agency.54 The BLM may attempt to evade laws that constrain its behavior, but that is not conversion, it is illegality. In conservation and natural resources policy, the trend has been from closed policy subsystems to more open ones, leading to increased conflict over forest management, grazing, mining, and water development and management.55"
"51","In fact, if conversion occurs when “political actors are able to redirect institutions or policies toward purposes beyond their original intent,”56 there has been a considerable amount of conversion‐as‐advancement over the years.            "
"52","One example is the expanding impact of the ESA, far beyond the expectations of those who enacted the law. The ESA was aimed at protecting a few “charismatic megafauna,” but it was converted into a powerful tool for institutional disruption.57 The ESA's record in recovering species has been uneven, but in critical instances—the spotted owl/timber and salmon recovery/river management in the Northwest, for example—the law has been an effective tool for disrupting established policy subsystems, forcing agencies to adapt to new demands. Environmental groups sought to leverage climate policy through the listing of polar bears and to rein in oil and gas development in the West by pressing for listings of various grouse populations. These efforts were likely a bridge too far, but who in 1973 would have imagined that anyone would attempt to use—convert—the law in this way? Moreover, on lesser issues, groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity have used the law successfully to block or rechannel development (for example, reducing grazing in riparian areas in the Southwest).            "
"53","A similar example is the conversion of the Antiquities Act of 1906 into a major tool for land protection. Theodore Roosevelt took this law, aimed at protecting small archeological sites in the West, and used it to protect the Grand Canyon. Some of his successors carried on this legacy of conversion, and Bill Clinton, “chasing Teddy Roosevelt's ghost,” built much of his environmental record on the use of the Antiquities Act to protect millions of acres of land.58 The threat of monument designations under the act gave Clinton and then Obama leverage in fights over formal designations under the Wilderness Act. Recently, Idahoans led by Representative Mike Simpson (R) supported the creation of the new Boulder‐White Clouds Wilderness as an alternative to what might have been a much larger monument created unilaterally by President Obama.59"
"54","Consider, again, the climate issue. Those who wrote the Clean Air Act did not see climate change as a critical issue, and they did not explicitly provide for regulation of GHGs. But the law created a process for identifying and setting standards for pollutants not considered in the original law. The Obama EPA's endangerment finding promised to slow drift on climate, bringing GHGs and the climate issue into the ambit of the CAA. The full implications of this move are not yet clear, and there is considerable political and legal contestation over the rules and orders that flow from the endangerment finding. But Obama and his allies converted the CAA into a tool for limiting carbon emissions, drawing the green state more deeply into core processes of the U.S. economy."
"55","In Hacker's terms, “layering” occurs when the barriers to authoritative policy change are low but constraints on internal policy conversion are high. New policies are layered over the old, leaving the original statutory framework intact. Hacker's leading example is the creation of tax breaks for private retirement accounts as part of a conservative effort to establish the infrastructure for an alternative to Social Security.60"
"56","In environmental policymaking, layering‐as‐retrenchment takes two related forms. Administrative layering imposes new requirements on agencies, mainly through executive orders. Republican and Democratic presidents alike have issued executive orders requiring and expanding the reach of cost–benefit analysis of proposed rules and mandating regulatory clearance by the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), in part to create greater efficiencies and in part to bring agencies into line with presidential priorities. Administrative layering takes other forms. For example, OIRA directors have made less formal efforts at administrative centralization, laying new processes atop established administrative procedures, offering backdoor access to industries to complain about proposed rules creating what one critic called a “one‐way ratchet that only weakens agency rules.”61"
"57","So administrative layering occurs as presidents slather new process requirements over those specified in the Administrative Procedure Act and the core environmental statutes. The resulting rollbacks will be subtle, involving blocked rules, delays during which the political landscape might change in ways that favor polluting interests, or substantive changes favoring polluters—changes whose environmental and economic effects may be fully understood only by affected industries and a few “repeat players” in administrative politics. Hacker, Pierson, and Thelen are correct that understanding this kind of retrenchment requires getting very close to the ground, and the retrenchments that occur may be visible only to specialists with deep knowledge of administrative processes and standard setting."
"58","But there are sharp limits to administrative layering‐as‐retrenchment. First, the impact of this sort of layering will depend on the priorities of presidential administrations."
"59","Second, there is evidence that the institutionalization of cost–benefit analysis and the maturation and acceptance of specific methodologies for estimating regulatory costs and benefits have increased rather than impinged upon the autonomy of agencies and actually strengthened the case for environmental protections. Law professor Michael Livermore shows that the EPA has taken the lead in developing cost–benefit methodology. The EPA's in‐house resources for developing cost–benefit assessments dwarf those of the OIRA, and assumptions built into the method (for example, the value of human life) generate estimates of regulatory benefits that far exceed economic costs. The EPA estimates that its air pollution regulations generate $1.3 trillion per year in benefits, a figure that dwarfs the costs of regulatory controls. The recent mercury and air toxics standards turned back by the U.S. Supreme Court because the majority found that the EPA did not adequately factor in costs was based on a cost–benefit assessment that showed $9.7 billion in costs and health benefits estimated at between $37 and $90 billion. When it was instituted in the Carter and Reagan years, cost–benefit analysis was designed to constrain regulatory agencies, but since that time, “Cost–benefit analysis has matured as a methodology. The costs are lower than many people would think and the benefits are quite high.”62 Modern cost–benefit analysis often offers environmentalists political leverage.            "
"60","Third, the administrative layer rests atop the preexisting environmental laws, which carry clear legal mandates. Whatever its dark powers, the OIRA's actions are subject to legal and political challenges from alert environmentalists. Industry groups may have superior financial resources, but typically greens know what is going on and have sufficient resources to carry their resistance to the courts and out to the media and the larger public. This complicates the “inside game” of administrative layering. For example, the clearest example that Layzer offers of OIRA action during the Obama years was OIRA head Cass Sunstein's blocking of new ozone regulations due for issuance in 2011. This action was widely publicized. Environmental and public health advocates sued successfully, and the administration issued aggressive new rules in 2014.63"
"61","While administrative layering is an occasionally powerful tool, it creates a thin stratum of policies set atop the environmental laws that define the basic policy terrain. Administrative layering may sometimes block or trim the logics of the golden‐era statutes, but it is reactive, dealing with realities and policy possibilities defined by laws carrying powerful, enduring mandates.64 Unlike the laws, administrative layering is easily reversible, as future administrations can easily undo the actions with new orders. Like their Republican counterparts, Democratic administrations have offered side‐door access to the regulatory process to industry groups, moves anathema to environmentalists. But Clinton and Obama (more so than their Republican counterparts) also advanced many important protective rules on air and water pollution and land protection.            "
"62","Statutory layering occurs through the adoption of new laws or policy riders on appropriation bills that carry purposes contrary to the core environmental statutes. These statutes and riders can be narrowly procedural, such as the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and the so‐called Data Quality Act, a 2001 policy rider aimed at making it easier to challenge the “quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity” of scientific information used by federal agencies. They can have broader procedural effects, such as the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA), which exempted some logging projects from searching National Environmental Policy Act reviews and limited administrative appeals of Forest Service decisions to proceed with timber cuts reframed as anti‐wildfire “fuels reduction” projects.65 The HFRA and the infamous 1995 salvage rider had similar layering effects, imposing new, expedited procedures designed to break the “process predicament” confronting the Forest Service as it faced a host of mandates from the core environmental laws. Statutory layering can also be deep and substantive, with long‐term implications for the reach and power of the green state. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, with its vast subsidies to domestic oil and gas producers and provisions insulating fracking from regulation, can be read as reinforcing an already thick commitment to fossil fuels and resource extraction on public as well as private lands, layering that policy over the broad commitments to pollution control and balanced land management built into the golden‐era environmental laws. Hacker saw the tax subsidies to private retirement plans as part of a long‐term effort to foster alternatives to Social Security. The Energy Policy Act deepened the American addiction to relatively inexpensive oil and gas and—as the drilling economy grew up in new areas of the country—further embedded oil and gas extraction at the core of the U.S. economy.            "
"63","Layering, then, can drive policy retrenchment. But we think that forcing the layering concept into the retrenchment narrative misses critical aspects of phenomenon. Administrative and statutory layering are not only tools for retrenchment. Both at times have enhanced environmental protection. Obama's efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions through executive actions is an important example on the administrative side; the $90 billion “green stimulus” built into the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the so‐called stimulus bill), which offered substantial subsidies for alternative energy among other projects, is an example of statutory layering.66"
"64","But the problem with focusing on layering‐as‐retrenchment and using this to inform a retrenchment narrative runs deeper. Students of American political development have shown that layering is the process by which almost all political change takes place. In building the modern green state with the laws of the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers layered new commitments to environmental protection over an industrial economy that had grown up by shifting the costs of environmental degradation onto the larger community. They added commitments to more responsible management of land and resources over venerable, industry‐friendly policy regimes governing mining, timber, and grazing. The result is a classic case of what Orren and Skowronek call “intercurrence,” the grinding together of incongruous, even contradictory policy commitments rooted in different values, interests, and historical periods. The tensions between these layers energize environmental policy conflicts, and are really the very stuff of environmental politics. Cramming the resulting “fuguelike motion of stops and starts, with backtracking and leapfrogging” into a simple retrenchment narrative requires ignoring the deep complexity of modern environmental politics and policymaking and the nature of the modern green state itself.67 Indeed, it is this intercurrence between policies from different layers of the green state, such as irrigation or public lands grazing and endangered species, that often makes environmental issues so conflictual. The basic contours of modern policy, the ground on which policy struggles take place, was set by layering that occurred at the demand of environmental interests in the 1960s and 1970s.            "
"65","We have shown that each of the three dimensions of the “hidden politics of retrenchment” in the Hacker framework also point another way, toward the advancement of environmentalists’ policy objectives. Our concept of “green drift” is thus more capacious than the “drift” concept in Hacker's framework, encompassing all of the “subtle strategies” and describing a broader current, with all of its pools and eddies, running in the direction of enhanced environmental protection. Our use of the drift concept creates some terminological confusion as we, through Layzer, draw Hacker's framework into the analysis of “where we are and whither we are tending” in environmental policy. We think that the costs of this terminological confusion are more than balanced by the value of the green drift metaphor for describing a core pattern in environmental policymaking."
"66","Under what conditions would we expect green drift? This phenomenon has emerged in the era of legislative gridlock, so we assume that barriers to authoritative policy change are high. There are two critical conditions that increase the likelihood of green drift:"
"67","First, green drift is more likely when statutes establish clear mandates (including time constraints to set and reexamine standards) that are attached to provisions for citizen petitions and lawsuits."
"68","Second, green drift is more likely when presidential administrations support environmental protection goals. Executive politics is a critical pathway of innovation and instability in environmental policymaking. Executive orders, rulemaking, the use of statutory discretion, and discretion in enforcement are used by all administrations, in service of and opposition to environmentalists’ goals. Obama's Clean Power Plan is a clear example of the importance of this pathway, as is the Clinton administration's use of the FLPMA to derail mining projects on federal lands."
"69","Other significant conditions favor green drift as well:"
"70","Third, supportive public opinion matters, and some issues can more easily be framed by greens to mobilize support and advance their agendas. Green drift will be more likely on issues involving clear public health concerns (for example, arsenic in drinking water). This may also be at work when icons are in play, be they “cathedral forests” or northwest salmon. (Obscure fish, such as the delta smelt or the Rio Grande silvery minnow, may have a harder go of it.)"
"71","Fourth, on the other side of things, groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity may have success when mobilizing laws to deal with narrower problems, such as the challenges posed to a particular, localized species by specific development projects. These less visible issues are insulated from the macropolitics of left and right, leaving the issue to be decided by the plain statutory language and administrators implementing those laws."
"72","Fifth, because of the role that scientific knowledge plays in shaping the implementation of environmental laws, we are more likely (but obviously not certain) to see green drift in areas when there is scientific consensus. The desperate struggles by opponents of environmental protection to “manufacture doubt” highlight the importance of scientific consensus in powering drift.68"
"73","Sixth, green drift is more likely when it is driven by regulatory requirements and does not rely on government spending (for example, the CAA requiring a reduction in mercury emissions by coal‐fired utilities). Green drift is less likely to lead to ecological restoration that relies on substantial funding."
"74","This list is not exhaustive, but it points to conditions under which various forms of internal policy conversion will occur in directions favored by environmental interests, energizing green drift. And in this context, in which the gridlocked laws represent victories for environmental interests and offer the high policy ground, we should expect ample opportunities for activists and their political allies to drive green drift."
"75","This article has developed two lines of argument. First, even when we look past statutes and budgets to the “subtle strategies” by which policy is made, the retrenchment narrative offers only a partial assessment of modern environmental policymaking. Alternative policymaking pathways have been and will be used in efforts to roll back protections, but they have frequently worked to the advantage of environmental interests capable of exploiting attractive policy frames and the requirements of settled statutes to push the logics of environmental protection forward. Second, the political science literature on retrenchment, spearheaded by Hacker in his work on drift, conversion, and layering, can help us understand some of the ways that environmental policy rollbacks occur. But, at least in the environmental arena, in the era of legislative gridlock, patterns that look like drift, layering, and conversion have often advanced rather than retrenched environmental protection. As Congress has proved itself unable to act on environmental issues, the old terrain established by the golden‐era statutes constitutes the political battlefield, and politics on the alternative pathways across this terrain offers considerable, although of course hardly complete, advantages to greens. Even when it can act, as with the passage of modernizing amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act supported by both industry and many environmental groups, the politics of the issue was shaped by the recognition that the core statute would not be repealed or seriously rolled back.69 President Trump and a Republican Congress will tilt environmental policy in the direction favored by conservatives. Nevertheless, the underlying green state, and the mobilized defenders of it, will both limit how far conservatives can shift things and, in certain cases, require actions they would not take. As scholars work to connect the environmental policy field to the broader field of policy studies, it appears that there is an opportunity here for theoretical development in both areas.         "
"76","Green drift, we hope, will resonate with students and others interested in understanding some broad patterns in the environmental policy field. The green drift metaphor captures something important and easily overlooked in a world of increasing pessimism and alarm, and highlights the challenges confronting those, like Trump and his allies, who would roll back environmental protections. So our larger argument is that the green drift phenomenon is an important tendency in modern environmental policymaking. Minimally, the realities of green drift complicate the retrenchment narrative and need to be accounted for as we write our books, teach our students, and communicate with the larger community about the policy legacies of the 1960s and 1970s and what has come after.*"
