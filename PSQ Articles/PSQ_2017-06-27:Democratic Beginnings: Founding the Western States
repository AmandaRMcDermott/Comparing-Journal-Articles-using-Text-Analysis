"1","When people think of the founding of the American West, images of rugged pioneers, wide‐open spaces, and clashes with native peoples tend to come to mind. Few immediately imagine well‐dressed men gathered indoors to write governing documents. However, as Amy Bridges shows in Democratic Beginnings, the story of how westerners came together to create the region's state governments is just as distinctively western—and, at the same time, just as fundamentally American—as is the story of its settlement. Bridges's book simultaneously provides a way of understanding the founding of the western states and an unusual vantage point from which to consider key controversies in American politics during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.         "
"2","The body of Bridges's book is composed of three chapters exploring periods in which western state constitutions were written. Chapter 2 concerns the constitutional conventions of the far western states during the 1850s and 1860s. Here, Bridges emphasizes western similarity rather than distinctiveness, arguing that the writing of these Civil War–era constitutions reflected national antebellum values like “the importance of citizen character and wariness of corporations” (p. 29). Chapter 3 centers on the Gilded Age, the period featuring the largest number of western constitutional conventions, and focuses on the dilemmas western leaders faced in deciding how to regulate extractive economies largely dependent on capital from elsewhere (in Bridges's terminology, how to “manage the periphery”). Chapter 4 is a comparison of the Progressive Era constitutional conventions of neighboring Arizona and New Mexico, the last two western territories to gain statehood. In it, Bridges shows how differences in the degree of openness in the two territories’ political systems resulted in two vastly different state constitutions."
"3","Each chapter carefully considers how national conditions affected the political questions addressed in the conventions and how the process of constitution writing was influenced by the unique socioeconomic context of each territory. The chapters are also replete with fascinating vignettes that reveal much about how political actors understood many of the central questions of nineteenth‐century American politics. Chapter 2, for example, discusses how views on race influenced debates at the California Convention of 1850 over whether former citizens of Mexico should have voting rights. Chapters 2 and 3 tell of how, in their deliberations on corporate regulation, constitution writers recognized the tension between restricting corporate activity and encouraging economic investment in their states. Chapter 4 contains important insights concerning the preeminent progressive‐era institutional innovation of the West—the citizen initiative. In Arizona, Progressive delegates succeeded in adding the initiative to the state constitution despite concerns about its compatibility with republican government, while in New Mexico, conservative delegates viewed the initiative as a path toward anarchy and quickly shut down efforts for its inclusion."
"4","Democratic Beginnings is a remarkable synthesis of 12 state conventions and a much larger number of political controversies into a highly revealing account of how the western states came to be. If there is one fault in the book, it is that little effort is made to show how the outcomes of the conventions about which Bridges writes shaped the twentieth‐century development of the western states. For example, Arizona's decision to allow for direct democracy and New Mexico's nearly simultaneous decision not to do so have had major consequences for each state's politics. A consideration of the path‐dependent outcomes of each state convention would have placed the book in more direct conversation with much scholarly work in American political development and state politics.         "
"5","On the whole, however, Bridges's book is an important work that opens up many new lines of inquiry in the historical study of American state politics and constitutionalism. It is well worth a read."
