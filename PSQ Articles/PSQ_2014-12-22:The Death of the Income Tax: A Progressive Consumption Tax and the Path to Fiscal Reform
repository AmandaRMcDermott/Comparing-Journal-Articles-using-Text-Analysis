"1","In this ambitious book, Daniel S. Goldberg begins with the claim that the income tax is “broken beyond repair” (p. 3). Some of these problems, like the proliferation of tax provisions that benefit special interests, are a matter of design. Others, like the inconsistent taxation of economic gains, are endemic to any tax on income. In the first half of The Death of the Income Tax, the author painstakingly details these and many other problems with our current tax system.         "
"2","What, then, should be done? Goldberg's answer is to replace the income tax with what he terms an “e‐Tax”—a type of progressive tax on consumption. His proposal echoes a familiar refrain in the tax literature. Taxing consumption rather than income has been suggested by some of the most influential thinkers in the field. For example, Bill Andrews's article A Consumption‐Type or Cash‐Flow Personal Income Tax remains a must‐read 40 years after it was published in the Harvard Law Review.         "
"3","Goldberg's proposal has several important parallels with David Bradford's X‐Tax andthe so‐called flat tax advanced by Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka (and championed by various politicians). Each proposal combines a modified value‐added tax (VAT) with an individual‐level wage tax. The differentiating feature of the e‐Tax is that it employs the more‐common, European‐style credit invoice VAT rather than a subtraction method VAT. In support of his proposal, the author identifies several possible benefits of consumption taxation (and a credit invoice VAT in particular)—such as encouraging investment and reducing noncompliance. The author bolsters these traditional arguments by highlighting several advantages of the e‐Tax in our increasingly electronic marketplace."
"4","The author does not shy away from dealing with many of the complex issues raised by his proposal. As with any ambitious reform proposal, however, one is left wondering about political complications. Goldberg offers a brief discussion of implementation issues, but it is hard to resist the conclusion that the politics of such a significant reform would probably be more‐nettlesome than his analysis reveals. The quick demise of Representative Dave Camp's less‐ambitious reform proposal is not encouraging for the e‐Tax. It is also notable that similar proposals (including the X‐Tax and the Flat‐Tax) have failed to gain significant political traction."
"5","Assuming that Congress adopts an e‐Tax, several political questions would remain. Since many of the problems with the current income tax are problems of design, arising from the inescapable influence of politics, it seems likely that an e‐Tax would face similar manipulation by Congress. In the conclusion, the author sounds a note of warning: “Congress should avoid polluting and thereby ultimately destroying the system with tax expenditures” (p, 254). Goldberg is right to identify this concern, and our history with the income tax underscores the wisdom of his admonitions. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that Congress would suspend politics as usual in this one special instance. An interesting question for future research might be what might a predictably polluted e‐Tax look like. Is the political economy of tax tinkering systematically different for consumption taxes than for income taxes? Or will the same pressures and incentives that have created complexity in the income tax likewise derail ambitious consumption tax proposals like Goldberg's e‐Tax?"
