"1","In his study of the leadership style exhibited by six presidents, James Polk, Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, and Abraham Lincoln, Fred Greenstein applies the analytic scheme he first unveiled in The Presidential Difference to explain how the decisions that these men made in the critical period 1846–1861 led to the Civil War. Greenstein argues that their actions, beginning with Polk's ill‐fated decision to provoke a war with Mexico, formed a funnel of causality that increasingly limited the options of their successors when dealing with the slavery issue, so that when Lincoln took office, it was impossible to keep the Union together short of military conflict. In addition to addressing a significant period in American history, Greenstein's choice of topic has the added virtue of shining a spotlight on a group of presidents who, with the exception of Lincoln, tend to be overlooked in the history books. To be sure, this is not a revisionist study; Greenstein's analysis is unlikely to change anyone's assessment of these six presidents in terms of their historical rankings (although I admit to coming away with a slightly greater appreciation for Millard Fillmore's presidency). Greenstein's contribution instead is to show how the six elements of leadership style he pioneered in his previous work—public communication, organizational capacity, political skill, policy vision, cognitive style, and emotional intelligence—collectively help to explain why these presidents acted as they did and why civil war was not averted.         "
"2","Greenstein's approach to his topic will be familiar to those who have read his two previous studies in this genre, which covered the post‐Hoover “modern” presidents and the first seven presidents, respectively. He proceeds chronologically, providing short historical summaries of each president and his time in office, followed by an analysis of their leadership qualities. (An appendix provides additional contextual information for each presidency). Greenstein writes sparingly but incisively, covering the momentous events of these two decades in just over 100 pages. As with his previous studies, readers are likely to come away from this book persuaded that emotional intelligence is perhaps the most underappreciated element of presidential style. Thus, Greenstein argues that James Buchanan, despite his extensive political experience on the national stage, proved emotionally unable to cope with the pressures of the secession crisis. In one of his characteristically intriguing asides, Greenstein notes that it is an open question as to how many, if any, of the bachelor Buchanan's temperamental shortcomings result “from his lack of the emotional support of a spouse …” (p. 91). Lincoln, in contrast, despite his “complex and elusive personality” (p. 96), exhibited a high degree of emotional maturity, due, in part, Greenstein suggests, to coping with his severe bouts of depression, and to the stress of his marriage to the emotionally demanding Mary Todd Lincoln."
"3","Greenstein covers an enormous amount of historical and biographical material here, and, by necessity, his inferences cannot be documented with the same level of detail that characterizes his classic study of Dwight Eisenhower's “hidden hand” presidency. (He does provide an annotated list of his source material). Moreover, he is keenly aware that “political (and other) behavior is a function of individual actors and the environments in which they act” (p. 126). But if he does not settle the enduring issue of which matters more—the president or the environment—readers will be persuaded by Greenstein that presidents do make a difference—sometimes, as with Lincoln, for better, but often for worse."
