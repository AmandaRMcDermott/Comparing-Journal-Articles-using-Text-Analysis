"1","Carol Hardy‐Fanta and colleagues provide the most comprehensive examination to date of elected leaders of color in this veritable encyclopedia of data. The book presents the results of their Gender and Multicultural Leadership project, which includes a national database of minority elected officials and a telephone survey of more than 1,350 state and local officials. They present a comparative perspective on leaders of color, examining similarities and differences by race, gender, and “race*gender”—a phrase they coin to emphasize the multiplicative effects of identities, building on the research paradigm of intersectionality."
"2","The authors begin by mapping the leadership terrain of elected officials of color, demonstrating striking differences as to where African American, Latino, and Asian American officeholders serve. They also explore the diversity within local politics, including the type of office held and the varying size and geography of local areas. They emphasize that the rapid growth of minority officeholders at the local level has not occurred naturally but rather represents an ongoing struggle for political inclusion. As the second chapter explains, reliably assessing this change is difficult because of a range of logistical and measurement challenges. Indeed, their discussion of the methodological difficulties associated with studying urban politics will undoubtedly ring true to scholars conducting their own research at the state or local level."
"3","Throughout the book, Hardy‐Fanta and colleagues address some of the most important topics in the study of electoral politics, including descriptive versus substantive representation, the choice to run for office, candidate strategies, and how elected officials behave as officeholders. Their findings enhance our knowledge of these topics, and their work should be essential reading for all scholars interested in better understanding these critical debates."
"4","Contested Transformations challenges conventional wisdom in some areas while affirming it in others. For instance, the authors argue that our current understanding of paths to elective office—with emphasis on a “pipeline” of potential candidates in “feeder occupations,” party recruitment, being asked to run (particularly for women), and the role of personal ambition—does little to explain the road to candidacy for elected officials of color. Rather, particularly among African American women, this decision is more communal in nature and more community based, with candidacies rooted in prior civic involvement. They argue that even variables such as level of education or marital status, typically thought of as individual‐level factors, must be understood in the context of broader institutional and social constraints. Indeed, throughout the book, the authors emphasize institutional opportunities, such as the Civil Rights Act and majority‐minority districts, and limitations in shaping openings for candidates of color.         "
"5","One of the book's more fascinating and overarching findings is that, consistent with existing scholarship on white elected officials, gender matters in policymaking across racial and ethnic lines. Regardless of gender, elected officials of color believe that female officeholders behave differently than their male counterparts, and the women in their sample hold more liberal views on a majority of policy areas. The findings highlight the need for more research to better understand gendered differences in political behavior.         "
"6","Replete with maps, graphs, and tables, Contested Transformation covers uncharted terrain with its exhaustive discussion of the diversity underlying elected officials of color. The book's aims are largely descriptive, and at times the reader may long for more theoretical development. However, this book and the insights it offers are clearly situated to spark additional theorizing on an understudied and fast‐growing population. I expect it will be a seminal text in the field and will soon become required reading for scholars of gender and politics, racial and ethnic politics, and urban politics alike.         "
