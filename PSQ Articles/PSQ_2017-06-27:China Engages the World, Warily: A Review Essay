"1","What drives the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China (PRC)? This is a pressing question in the second decade of the twenty‐first century, when many perceive China to be increasingly assertive, if not belligerent, on a wide range of issues. Indeed, some frame China's greater muscle flexing in alarmist or sensationalist terms. One scholar contends that China has developed and is currently in the process of implementing a long‐term plan—a “one hundred year marathon”—to outrun the United States and supplant it as the global hegemon.1 Another writer imagines a future in which “China rules the world.”2 Other analyses assess China's emergence with less hype. According to one scholar, although China is “going global,” it will remain a “partial power” for the foreseeable future.3 According to two others, China is likely to continue as a regional power, albeit one with significant global presence.4"
"2","Which interpretation is most accurate? Before proceeding, a point of clarification is important: whatever one's analysis, recent trends in Chinese activity beyond its borders are sobering and merit careful attention and analysis. Assessing the drivers and intentions behind China's actions is crucial to understanding the precise nature of the challenge or threat that Beijing's assertiveness presents."
"3","To explore questions regarding Chinese goals and strategy, we have the benefit of a magisterial tome that surveys seven decades of PRC foreign relations.5 What does senior scholar John W. Garver believe is driving Chinese foreign policy? He emphasizes the “link between internal politics and its foreign relations” (p. xii), arguing that political insecurity, especially anxiety over regime legitimacy (pp. 4–5), is the primary force propelling China's foreign policy forward. Garver also underscores the nature of China's Leninist political system and its fundamental impact on domestic and foreign policies (pp. 1–3).         "
"4","While this insecurity is ever present, Garver contends that it is a variable that has fluctuated over time. Indeed, the author divides the sweep of PRC foreign relations into three periods that are separated by significant shifts in the degree of insecurity felt by Chinese leaders. Between 1949 and 1977, during the rule of Mao Zedong and its immediate aftermath, according to Garver, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its institutional partner, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), were focused on “forging a revolutionary state [the PRC].” The extended enterprise of this party‐army‐state has fueled a persistently high level of regime insecurity and produced a strongly xenophobic and distrustful foreign policy.6 Following the emergence of pragmatic paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978, the CCP launched a concerted effort to reform China's economy and open up the country to foreign trade and investment. This was made possible because Deng and other leaders displayed a higher level of confidence in China's ability to engage constructively with the rest of the world.         "
"5","However, the domestic upheaval of 1989 prompted a reassessment of the security environment: Chinese leaders concluded that they faced heightened threat levels, and a decade that Garver dubs the “happy interregnum” ended. Consequently, since the 1990s, Chinese leaders have become much more insecure and, according to Garver, perceive that the PRC is a “Leninist state besieged.” Nevertheless, Deng's successors have not seen fit to walk back the thoroughgoing economic policies this reformer initiated. Moreover, despite heightened insecurity following the Tiananmen Massacre, Chinese leaders have conducted vigorous foreign relations with the rest of the world including extensive foreign travel by Chinese leaders, more summitry, and global activism.7"
"6","What impact did these changes have on China's foreign relations? Despite the ups and downs, one trend has been enduring: expanded engagement with the outside world. In 1957, the PRC had full diplomatic relations with 32 countries; by 2017, China had ambassador‐level relations with at least 165 countries. In 1957, the PRC was not even a member state of the United Nations (UN), whereas in 2017, the PRC was one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and had membership in numerous others, including multilateral organizations that PRC was instrumental in founding such as BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In 1957, the PRC conducted a very limited volume of trade and mostly with other communist countries; by 2017, China had become the world's largest trading state measured in terms of the total value of its merchandise exports and imports."
"7","Does China's unprecedented rate of global engagement suggest that Garver's “conceptual theme” (p. xii) of internal politics and regime insecurity as a key motivator of Beijing's foreign policy is misplaced? On the contrary, the author's attention to domestic drivers and emphasis on insecurity seems to be most appropriate.8 At a time when we routinely read about burgeoning Chinese economic and military power—vast foreign exchange reserves, a larger and more capable navy—China appears to be an unstoppable force with unlimited ambitions. Lost in the alarmism, however, is that the PRC remains a Leninist party‐army‐state fearful of threats from without and within. Moreover, the latter dangers are almost always perceived as more serious than the former.         "
"8","However, just because China's party, military, and state leaders are insecure, especially at home, that does not mean they are in perpetual panic mode. It is often written matter‐of‐factly that “regime survival” is their top priority. But this terminology can be very misleading: the word “survival”—also employed by Garver (p. 2ff)—implies that Chinese leaders believe they are in dire straits and living in daily fear that they are in imminent danger of regime collapse or overthrow. On the contrary, Chinese leaders are confident enough to believe their hold on power is secure for the near term and likely to endure through the medium term. Because there are no absolute guarantees in politics and statecraft, constant vigilance is required. This is why the regime employs a highly sophisticated, robust, and costly coercive apparatus to protect its hold on political power. Thus, Chinese leaders are not living from day to day, from week to week, or even from month to month. Rather, party, military, and state elites plan well ahead in five‐year and 10‐year increments, and they anticipate the regime will be around to celebrate the centenaries of the founding of the CCP in 2021, the PLA in 2027, and the PRC in 2049. Consequently, far from being desperate or limited in their goals, these leaders exude supreme confidence and articulate highly ambitious agendas. Because the regime is far from monolithic—as the tripartite depiction already noted suggests—multiple bureaucracies exist, and each possesses its own institutional interests and political preferences. Even on issues on which there is widespread consensus, policy coordination can be a major challenge.9"
"9","This pervasive regime insecurity has a subtle but discernible impact on Chinese statecraft: it is a wariness and suspicion that pervades its interactions with other states and a reluctance to commit major resources to projects beyond China's borders. By way of conclusion, three points merit mention."
"10","First, the good news: for China's Asia‐Pacific neighbors and the United States, this hesitance manifests itself in constraining the scope of Beijing's ambition and reach of Chinese assertiveness. This mostly occurs close to home. A notable exception in terms of broad reach, geographic extension, and sheer boldness is the One Belt, One Road initiative launched with considerable fanfare by Xi Jinping in 2013. This remarkable effort, to construct an extensive infrastructure network of roads, railways, pipelines, and ports across Asia and beyond, promises to have a positive impact on a range of countries, but follow‐through remains a question mark, as do the precise contours of the initiative. It is unclear precisely which new projects are elements of One Belt, One Road; moreover, it appears that a good number of previously announced or ongoing projects are being incorporated under its umbrella."
"11","Second, the not‐so‐good news: the PRC's abiding insecurity places real limitations on the extent to which China is willing and capable of cooperating with other countries. This is not to say that Beijing cannot or will not cooperate; rather, the opportunities are limited by China's wariness about working closely with other states. The examples of security cooperation to date, although noteworthy, are few and/or mostly quite modest. Since the early 1990s, for example, thousands of Chinese soldiers have engaged in dozens of UN peacekeeping operations, and since 2008, three‐vessel squadrons from China's navy have participated in Gulf of Aden antipiracy patrols. Both commitments have involved real and extended Chinese commitments, yet each entailed quite modest cooperation with other militaries."
"12","Third, the bad news: Chinese leaders seem to have concluded in some instances that they have no choice but to act muscularly and take calculated risks, especially in situations in which they believe that China's “core” or vital interests are at stake. In recent years, China has exhibited strong arm tactics in the South China Sea and in the East China Sea. In the latter, China declared the establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in November 2013 without any prior consultation or warning. The zone overlapped with those ADIZs previously declared by Japan and South Korea and included air space over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. In the former, Chinese naval and coast guard vessels have harassed fishing boats, and maritime traffic from other countries and China has embarked on a massive program of island building, including the construction of fortifications, piers, and landing strips on disputed reefs and atolls."
"13","In sum, China's Quest is an invaluable reference volume and important interpretive guide for practitioners of international affairs and essential reading for anyone teaching about or researching Chinese foreign policy.         "
