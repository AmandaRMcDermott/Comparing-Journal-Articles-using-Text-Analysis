"1","The pernicious consequences of the war on drugs for minority communities have been well documented in several studies. Beyond this research, less has been done to investigate the origins of punitive drug policies, and even fewer studies have explored the role of minorities in shaping this legislation. Michael Javen Fortner fills this gap in the literature in Black Silent Majority: The Rockefeller Drug Laws and the Politics of Punishment. Using a wide variety of data sources, Fortner convincingly shows that black middle‐ and working‐class Harlemites played an important role in propelling the war on drugs.         "
"2","To illustrate his argument, Fortner begins by examining the historical antecedents to the rise of the drug epidemic in postwar Harlem and the response among its black citizens. In particular, Fortner describes how middle‐ and working‐class blacks enjoyed some economic success during the postwar period. This success, however, was met with the dual threats of growing crime, which was partly precipitated by the growth in drug use, and the fear of heightened scrutiny from whites given the deteriorating conditions in Harlem. Fortner then explores how early attempts to deal with the drug problem with rehabilitative policies largely failed because these programs were severely underfunded. The combination of threats, failed rehabilitative programs, and worsening drug problem in Harlem led to growth in support for harsher penalties for drug dealers among middle‐ and working‐class blacks."
"3","Policies that would disproportionately punish African Americans created conflict for blacks in Harlem. Fortner demonstrates that many coped with this struggle by constructing a narrative that largely excluded drug users and dealers from being part of the black community by describing them as an “other” whose poor choices dampened opportunities for hardworking African Americans. Using this frame constructed by black Harlemites, Nelson Rockefeller was able to persuade some to support tougher drug penalties and enact antidrug legislation. Black Silent Majority concludes by discussing the conflict that blacks in Harlem faced by supporting harsher penalties that ultimately devastated the black community while at the same time yearning for a safer environment.         "
"4","Fortner's study makes several important contributions to the study of American politics. First, Black Silent Majority details how and why cleavages in the black community arise. While blacks tend to vote as a monolith, Fortner demonstrates that black public opinion is diverse; his analysis of drug policy in New York provides a road map of how these differences occur. Second, Fortner's analysis provides insights into how local and national contexts, in conjunction with strategic politicians, interact to create new public policies. Finally, Fortner's study provides one of the most complete analyses of how social problems spur political action and, ultimately, legislation that I have ever read.         "
"5","One of the main strengths of this book is that Fortner uses a wide variety of data sources, including interviews, public opinion polls, newspaper data, and depictions of drug use in popular culture to demonstrate how blacks' attitudes about drug policies and drug users shifted over time. The analysis in this book is so complete that I would use it as a model to teach about research methods. Moreover, the book is extremely engaging and very accessible to the average reader. The book would be a great addition to classes on racial and ethnic politics, public policy, and criminal justice."
