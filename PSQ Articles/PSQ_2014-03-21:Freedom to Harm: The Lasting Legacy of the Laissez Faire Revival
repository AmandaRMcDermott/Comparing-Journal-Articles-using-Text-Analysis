"1","The central claim of this book is that between 1975 and 2005 three broad assaults on the nation's regulatory infrastructure substantially weakened the reforms of the Progressive Era, the New Deal, and the Public Interest Era. A secondary claim is that these assaults were driven by laissez‐faire ideologues working from within various think tanks, the media, and, eventually, the halls of government."
"2","The first claim is impossible to dispute, and Thomas O. McGarity provides ample evidence for it. The second is quite plausible, although, because McGarity is not interested in measuring the effect that ideologues had on the assaults, the extent to which they “drove” them is not clear. Ideologues pushed for change, and change happened; the tone is more mono‐causal than conspiratorial, but it may frustrate social scientists seeking a testable social theory. As it is, readers can only wonder about the odds—in a world where ideologues are the shapers of policy—of his quite sensible suggestions for reform ever seeing the light of day. McGarity might have done better simply to treat the past 50 years as a familiar chapter in the ongoing historical struggle to establish the proper role of government. Whether ideologues were uniquely important to this chapter is certainly of less importance than the effects that deregulation has had on the nation."
"3","Such quibbling may be unfair. McGarity's purpose is to tell a story; in fact, it is to tell the same one repeatedly, changing only the policy area. Whether it is with respect to civil justice, environmental protection, or transportation safety, he walks us through the same three stages of assault: rules are rewritten, protection is foregone, and accountability is limited. The sheer repetitiveness of the events, while at times a bit tedious to digest, makes a compelling case that past efforts to safeguard society from unbridled market activity have indeed been significantly undermined. This analysis may not be social science as it is currently practiced, but given the vivid picture of the deregulatory movement it offers, that fact should, rather than frustrate political scientists, push them to consider the virtues inherent in earlier modes of academic inquiry. Readers will come away not only with a firm understanding of the politics involved (we learn, for example, that among presidents, the good guys—Nixon, Ford, Carter, Bush I—and bad guys—Reagan, Clinton, Bush II—do not necessarily divide along party lines), they will also receive a wonderful primer in the myriad legal and political means by which regulatory policies affect all realms of social life."
"4","My chief concern about the book is less with its empirical case than with its underlying normative stance. McGarity makes quite clear (at times in somewhat shrill tones) his view that we are much the worse for deregulatory efforts. My problem is not with that view—I am in wholesale agreement with it—but with the fact that he spends more time asserting it than defending it. As a result, I had trouble seeing how anyone who disagreed with him would be convinced. Chapter after chapter left unchallenged two standard laissez‐faire responses: regulatory policy goals (for example, safer workplaces, cleaner air) may be admirable but they are not worth the required sacrifice to economic freedom, and, in any case, they are more efficiently brought about via market mechanisms. Attention to those canards, as well as perhaps a tad more even‐handedness (nowhere does he display an ounce of cynicism about the value of any regulations, all of which are presented as well thought out by people with only good intentions) would have transformed this book from a valuable resource for progressives to a troublesome read for laissez‐faire ideologues.
