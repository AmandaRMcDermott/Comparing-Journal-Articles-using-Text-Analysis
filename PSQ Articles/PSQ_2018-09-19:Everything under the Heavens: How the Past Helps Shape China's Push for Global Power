"1","Abandoning a low‐profile approach in international affairs, China has implemented a more assertive foreign policy during the era of Xi Jinping. Does Beijing have the intention and capabilities to rebuild a Sino‐centered world order? Will China become a hegemonic power in Asia as well as in the world? How does the historical past shape China's foreign policy? Howard W. French, a journalism professor at Columbia University and a former New York Times journalist, provides a cultural and historical analysis of China.         "
"2","French writes elegantly and accessibly, combining excellent scholarship of Asian history with vivid and penetrating analysis of contemporary Asian affairs."
"3","The book focuses on the concept of tianxia, which can be translated as “everything under the heavens” (p. 4). It was a Sino‐centered order in which China was the dominant power in ancient East Asia. French suggests that this historical legacy has shaped the Chinese worldview as well as its foreign policy. There has been a critical connect between domestic politics and international relations. From ancient Chinese emperors to contemporary Communist Party leaders, Chinese rulers constantly worry about “inside disorder and outside calamity” (nei‐luan wai‐huan) (p. 7). Chinese elites have tried to demonstrate China's power and prestige internationally so that they can secure their legitimacy domestically.         "
"4","French challenges the official Chinese narrative of benevolent international leadership. According to French, tianxia was not necessarily a benign order, especially viewed from the perspectives of China's neighbors. Admiral Zheng He was not an ambassador of Chinese goodwill and friendship. Zheng's massive ships were actually troop carriers whose arrival signaled China's dominance and superiority."
"5","The tianxia worldview has shaped China's relationship with neighboring countries as well as with great powers. During China's Qing Dynasty, Japan damaged the China‐centered tributary system. As China struggles to return to preeminence in Asia, it is competing vigorously with Japan. Chinese domination of Vietnam in ancient history has shaped Vietnamese grievance and resentment. The two countries have had an asymmetrical and sensitive relationship. Regarding the South China Sea, Chinese officials often emphasize their “historic rights” while selectively deemphasizing or ignoring some international legal norms. China is rapidly upgrading its weapons, and the United States can no longer take its military primacy for granted in the western Pacific. As Sino‐American competition becomes more intense, can the United States and China accommodate each other in the region peacefully?"
"6","While raising concerns about China's historical past, French emphasizes that we should not believe in “what is sometimes referred to as cultural DNA” (p. 12). This nuanced argument could be pushed even further. While tianxia has become more important in contemporary China, China's historical legacies are complicated and diverse. Tianxia is just one of several legacies that have shaped contemporary China. China's Communist Revolution as well as its opening and reform have also fundamentally shaped the Chinese worldview and its foreign policy. Tianxia as China's past might shape China's future, but it does not necessarily represent China's future."
"7","Regarding Sino‐American relations, French is cautious but not pessimistic. While China's rise is real, China also faces many challenges. If China seeks to become a respected co‐leader in Asia instead of seeking a new hegemonic status, China's goal might be compatible with regional peace and stability. A China with both potential and restraints will be “a China that we can live with” (p. 284)."
