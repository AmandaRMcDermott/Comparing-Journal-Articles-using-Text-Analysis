"1","“THIS WAR IS ONE THAT CANNOT BE WON BY marines and soldiers,”1 a young military officer wrote to Senator Richard Lugar in 2004, pleading for civilian assistance in Iraq. As Iraq slid into chaos that year, where were the civilians so desperately needed to rebuild the country? Responding to the need, as well as to legislative pressure, the State Department created an office to lead and coordinate stabilization and reconstruction in 2004. The new office's executing arm—a deployable civilian corps—was not directly funded until five years later.2 In 2010, as military operations drew down and preparations began for transition to a State‐led mission, the department's Civilian Response Corps sent just one person to Iraq.3"
"2","Stabilization and reconstruction missions require a breadth of skills that reside in the U.S. lead agencies for diplomacy and development—skills that are distinct from the requirements of conventional warfare.4 The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review acknowledges stabilization and reconstruction as a core mission of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).5 In this mission, the State Department, supported by USAID, coordinates and leads the U.S. interagency in a whole‐of‐government approach to post‐conflict environments, providing a flexible response capability that can operate in the field, often (but not necessarily) in partnership with the U.S. military. Despite the need and the declared mission, the status quo today is a pick‐up approach, marked by unclear decision‐making processes and an inability to quickly and consistently respond. Why do State and USAID persistently struggle to generate capacity to lead these efforts?         "
"3","Within the State Department, current challenges are often ascribed to the sheer scale of efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are dismissed as outliers. This conflates resources—dollars and personnel—with capacity—an organization's ability to execute a course of action. If capacity were present and merely overwhelmed by scale, the problem would simply be one of resources. Rather, the scale of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan has served as a magnifier to reveal existing gaps across the U.S. government. Systemic resourcing issues do constrain State and USAID's ability to build and institutionalize a post‐conflict stabilization capability; however, these deficiencies are not sufficient to explain the deficit that exists in the transitions from conflict to peace. Put simply, if State and USAID received a tenfold budget increase, performance might improve by virtue of sheer numbers, but the same struggle to lead would persist."
"4","State Department and USAID officials point to perennial under‐resourcing from an unsympathetic Congress as a source of the problems, along with an interagency approach that is more a “messy amalgam” of dominant parochial interests than a coherent process.6 Meanwhile, the Department of Defense (DoD) is likened to a gas that expands to fill empty spaces, stifling State's efforts. On the other hand, critics of State and USAID point to recalcitrant bureaucratic cultures that resist change, and contend that internal indecision over the mission prevents organizing any meaningful effort.         "
"5","This paper examines five factors that broadly frame the current debate. Two of the factors are internal and look at bureaucratic conflict and organizational culture. Two are external and consider interagency processes and military expansion into the stabilization and reconstruction space. Congress's approach towards State and USAID, and their approach towards Congress, comprise the final factor. This study probes the factors, using evidence from ongoing missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. While these missions are exceptional cases, they have had significant impacts on State and USAID and directly affect the status quo today. Much of the perspective in this study is drawn from interviews conducted in early 2011 with subject matter experts and personnel with experience and influence within their organizations. These included members of the State Department, USAID, DoD, congressional staffers, and academic and research organizations. To encourage candor, interviews were done on a non‐attribution basis unless the interviewee gave permission to be identified. This perspective was invaluable to understanding organizational and cultural considerations."
"6","The first section of this article briefly examines politics and resources as antecedent conditions that influence government organization for the mission. The second section examines internal factors and concludes that these are the dominant obstacles to capacity development. It appears that the determinative factors reside internally, and would continue to hinder progress even under optimal external conditions. The third section examines external factors, finding that these exacerbate rather than cause State and USAID challenges. The fourth section analyzes Congress as both an internal and external factor and demonstrates that these elements are mutually reinforcing. The conclusion provides recommendations based on the analysis and discusses the implications of addressing each internal factor."
"7","Despite much experience in stabilization and reconstruction over the years, the United States has remarkably little to show for its efforts. Time after time, the U.S. government's response to conflicts in weak or failed states has been ad hoc or post hoc, and recent experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrate that significant deficiencies persist in both U.S. institutional memory and capacity for the mission. Examining the failures in planning and executing post‐conflict reconstruction, “A casual observer might conclude that the United States lacked experience in the field.”7 James Dobbins notes the irony, given that “by the time U.S. troops entered Iraq, no country in the world had more modern experience in nation‐building than the United States.”8"
"8","Global instability in the decades since the end of the Cold War has led to increased U.S. involvement in complex contingencies—not necessarily wars, but conflicts that require stabilization and reconstruction. These contingencies do not appear to be going away; current assessments hold that in the near term, conflicts emanating from failed states are as likely as from aggressing nations.9 The United States currently overmatches any conventional military opponent it could potentially face; in contrast, it lacks the capacity needed to build the peace in the aftermath of conflict. Peace building is inherently complex, with many outside variables influencing the ultimate outcome. Not least of these is the multilateral dimension to such missions—U.S. activities are often conducted alongside UN operations and each influences the other. Thus, the focus of this study is not on the ultimate outcome of such operations, but rather on U.S. institutional failure to learn, adapt, and demonstrate an enhanced conflict response capability.         "
"9","According to Colin Gray, “[Stabilization and reconstruction] operations, the demand for them and the provision of new capabilities to perform them well, are the downstream product of larger decisions on foreign policy and strategy.”10 Political constraints are key shapers of capacity questions, albeit ones that affect all U.S. government actors. This section provides an overview of politics and resources as shaping considerations. Understanding these antecedent conditions serves to sharpen the focus on those variables specific to State and USAID capacity.         "
"10","As the Cold War rolled back, a wave of complex contingencies emerged. These conflicts that Leslie Gelb dubs “teacup wars” led to a series of U.S. interventions that revealed the limitations of interagency capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction.11 In a decade of trial and error, tragedy in Somalia led to caution in Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, accompanied by slow efforts to formalize processes and institutionalize roles and responsibilities. These lessons were codified in Presidential Decision Directive/PDD‐56, a significant step that promptly expired with a change of administrations.12 Despite nascent efforts in the 1990s to capture and formalize lessons learned, Michèle Flournoy observes that these same lessons were “unlearned” by the U.S. government in its subsequent endeavors.13"
"11","Political ambivalence was a primary reason that PDD‐56 lapsed. In the wake of the Cold War, the rationale for state‐building missions was unclear. As Robert Jervis notes, “Democracies, and especially the United States, do not find it easy to sustain a clear line of policy when the external environment is not compelling.”14 Absent a persuasive rationale, the wisdom of such missions became political fodder during the Bill Clinton years. George W. Bush's statement on the campaign trail in 2000 encapsulated the resistance: “I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation‐building. I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.”15 However, the attacks of 11 September 2001 led to a pendulum swing in both political opinion and policy. By 2003, the United States had launched the largest stabilization and reconstruction operations since the Marshall Plan, but without existing institutional capacity to effectively execute the mission.16"
"12","Without political support or internal incentives to prepare for stabilization and reconstruction, both the State and Defense Departments were caught short in Iraq and Afghanistan. Efforts in Afghanistan were notable for the lack of resourcing, while planning fared worst in Iraq.17 As conditions deteriorated in Iraq, the absence of civilian capabilities on the ground became increasingly apparent. Ironically, it was Pentagon resistance to the interagency framework laid out in PDD‐56 and a determined effort to control reconstruction in Iraq (after what it deemed civilian mismanagement in Afghanistan) that laid bare the military's limits.18 After the initial neglect of post‐conflict planning, both State and Defense realized that, as Francis Fukuyama says, “We'd better get used to it, and learn how to do it—because there will almost certainly be a next time.”19 Once this paradigm shift began in 2004, DoD moved out much faster in creating capabilities, in part due to its superior resources.20"
"13","Despite this shift in practice, political will for stabilization and reconstruction remains uncertain. In the aftermath of Iraq and Afghanistan, Gray predicts: “It is more likely than not that the United States will behave in the near future as if it had been snake‐bitten on the Tigris.”21 Policymakers remain indecisive on what the U.S. approach should be. On the one hand are those who see such operations as expensive but the alternative as far more costly. On the other hand are those who dispute the degree to which failing states should drive national security calculations.22 This political uncertainty jeopardizes resourcing, the other antecedent variable to capacity.            "
"14","Observers point to resource starvation as the primary reason that State and USAID have struggled to lead stabilization and reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade. They are perennially under‐resourced, starkly so when compared to the military. As Joseph Collins says, “State cannot be equipped only with good ideas while Defense has all the money and most of the deployable assets.”23 For many, the expectation that the civilian party controlling 10 percent of the resources will effectively manage military‐related contingencies is unrealistic.24"
"15","The Pentagon is aware of Foggy Bottom's skimpy coffers. The military has been repeatedly tasked with reconstruction missions it does not view as its job and which do not play to its strengths due to the lack of resources elsewhere.25 This view is partially rooted in politics. Frank Jones observes that American politicians are historically wary of the military assuming civil authority and make a point of squashing initiatives such as the “school for military government” that was established for post‐World War II (Table 1) reconstruction.26 Nonetheless, as the only actor adequately resourced to effectively engage in large stabilization operations, the military has been forced to shoulder missions long after conventional combat operations have ceased and reconstruction should be turned over to civilian lead. This disparity helps trap DoD in a cycle wherein the military becomes the de facto lead and directs its own resources against the problem, while civilian capacity remains enervated, further widening the gap. The Quadrennial Defense Review reflects this concern:               "
"16","America's civilian instruments of statecraft were allowed to atrophy in the post–Cold War era, and the lack of adequate civilian capacity has made prevailing in current conflicts significantly more challenging. Unfortunately … adequate civilian capacity will take time and resources to develop and is unlikely to materialize in the near term.27"
"17","A quick glance at funding levels, both historically and in the current contingencies, reveals that resource constraints bind most State or USAID efforts. After its zenith in the early days of the Cold War, the State Department budget faced decades of intermittent decline in the face of defense spending increases, widening the gap. Personnel and funding cuts in the aftermath of Vietnam hurt the department and crippled USAID.28 The end of the Cold War also hurt spending from the mid‐1980s to the mid‐1990s; the international affairs budget plummeted 50 percent to roughly 1 percent of the federal budget.29 Funding for the contingencies in Afghanistan and Iraq was low from the onset. From the beginning of the war through FY 11, 94 percent of all funding went to DoD. In contrast, only 5 percent went to State and USAID. Total enacted foreign aid and diplomatic operation funding for the two conflicts through FY 11 was just over $66 billion, a sum dwarfed by the $1.2 trillion in supplemental funding to the military for the same years.30"
"18","It is unfair to compare these numbers directly, given the different missions and the costs of military operations; however, a comparison of funds spent on similar activities reveals the disparity. The military's Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) allows field commanders rapid access to funds on the ground for a variety of stabilization and reconstruction purposes—essentially a reconstruction petty cash fund. In 2010, over $1 billion was allocated for CERP activities—roughly a sixth of the amount allocated for all State and USAID operations in both countries the same year.31 There has been a systemic under‐resourcing of stabilization and reconstruction; while the military compensates through large pools of general funds such as Operations and Maintenance (out of which CERP is funded), State has no such reservoir to draw on.            "
"19","These figures are troubling in light of the significant responsibilities State has absorbed as the missions transition, including oversight of some 400 “essential activities” inherited from DoD. Although the FY 2012 budget request marked a substantial increase in State and USAID funding for Afghanistan and Iraq, funding subsequently dropped sharply. From an FY 12 enacted level of just over $11 billion, supplemental and other war‐related funding for State and USAID shrank by more than $4 billion just two years later.32"
"20","Nonetheless, the necessary relationship of resources to capacity does not make it determinative, as analysts and policymakers frequently assume. Resources help buy capacity, but plans determine what types of capacity resources buy. The relationship is not a ratio of one dollar to one unit of capacity; rather, institutions build capacity based on internal and external considerations."
"21","The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review calls stabilization and reconstruction a “core State mission that must be closely supported by USAID.”33 This mandate rests on the assumption that State and USAID are able to work together and that USAID will embrace its support role. Instead, organizational asymmetries, overlapping capabilities, and infighting fuel conflict. The State Department lacks an operational culture, while USAID devalues the mission, further stymying capacity development.         "
"22","Tensions and ambiguities between State and USAID lead to conflict over roles, responsibilities, and authorities, undermining the mission before State ever turns to the rest of the interagency. Blocking efforts between the agencies inhibits effectiveness, as do hazy demarcation points in responsibilities. Rather than “one team, one fight,” members of each organization describe their relationship to each other as “hate, hate” or “non‐existent.” This is particularly exacerbated with the stabilization and reconstruction mission, as its operational focus creates overlapping responsibilities."
"23","The brief history of the State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) epitomizes the intra‐ and inter‐departmental tensions that accompany overlapping missions and responsibilities. Subsumed into State's new Bureau for Conflict and Stabilization Operations late in 2011, the S/CRS mission was to lead, coordinate, and institutionalize U.S. government capacity for conflict prevention and response.34 The office was stood up in 2004, formalized in National Security Presidential Directive/NSPD‐44 a year later, and written into law by Congress in 2008. Shortcomings in Iraq formed a proximate cause for S/CRS as gaps in planning and operational capabilities were apparent by 2004; though the need was clear, who should meet it was not. S/CRS was quickly contentious within both State and USAID.            "
"24","USAID saw S/CRS, with its operational focus, as encroaching onto the agency's territory. While skeptical of reconstruction and stabilization as a mission, USAID believed that if such a mission existed, it should fall under its purview.35 Moreover, USAID already had rapid response capabilities existing in its Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) and Office of Conflict Mitigation and Management (CMM).36 Creation of S/CRS was perceived as another cut from the agency's portfolio, a rebuke for political dissatisfaction with USAID's performance on the ground in Iraq.37 In 2009, acting USAID administrator Alonzo Fulgham described the resulting animosity as “creative tension” that was part of an evolving relationship between USAID and S/CRS.38"
"25","Despite the release of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review and the validation of the S/CRS mandate, the relationship did not mature into the cooperation Fulgham anticipated. USAID personnel still viewed the office as evidence of State attempting to steal what USAID did best. Just because State did not wish for USAID to own S/CRS did not mean that State was prepared to accommodate it either. The operational role was an uneasy fit, and S/CRS's crosscutting functions met strong internal resistance from regional bureaus, who viewed the new coordinator as infringing on their turf.39"
"26","Ambiguous roles and responsibilities create dissatisfaction and conflict, as illustrated by the relationship between S/CRS and the administrator of USAID. The administrator is dual‐hatted as the undersecretary of foreign Assistance (“F”), a position created to organize the foreign operations budgets and consolidate State and USAID accounts. With USAID and S/CRS competing for resources, this arrangement initially created a leadership bias against the office. USAID administrator Randall Tobias was the first named to the new position; he initially blocked S/CRS's budget requests. The conflict was resolved with a deal that created a dual‐reporting chain from S/CRS to F and to the Secretary of State, but these efforts to block S/CRS in its early days were a primary reason NSPD‐44 was never fully implemented.40"
"27","Interdepartmental squabbles are not unique to the State Department or USAID. Resistance to change and bureaucratic battles are common in the executive branch. What is troublesome about the systemic conflicts between State and USAID is the effect it has on the civilian ability to coordinate with and take the lead from the military in post‐conflict operations. As Samuel Berger and Brent Scowcroft note, “Unity of command among civilian agencies is desperately needed.”41 The difficulty is creating unity of command (and effort) for a mission that is a subset of the two agencies' larger mandates.            "
"28","These difficulties redouble in light of USAID resistance to its loss of autonomy from State. In 2008, three former USAID administrators declared, “The semimerger of USAID and the State Department has not worked.”42 They attributed the persistent conflict and lack of resolution to “clashing organizational cultures, management systems, and time horizons.”43 This resistance to integration illustrates the problem of asymmetry, in which USAID feels a power imbalance with State and has less incentive to cooperate.44 In turn, the State tendency is to discredit this perception, chalking it up to a USAID culture characterized as insecure and paranoid.            "
"29","State's organizational culture does not promote operational capacity and is not conducive to executing stabilization and reconstruction missions. USAID emphasizes operational capacity, but its culture mirrors the development community and devalues the mission itself. A key subsequent problem is one of definition: State remains unable to articulate how and where its stabilization and reconstruction capabilities will be applied or to actually demonstrate its nascent abilities."
"30","Organizational culture is oft cited in discussions of State and USAID capacity—it is less frequently defined. Edgar Schein's seminal work on organizational culture provides an enduring and relevant definition: “A pattern of shared basic assumptions learned by a group as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration.”45 Organizational culture comprises a group's norms, values, and assumptions across three levels: a visible level of publicly stated norms and objectives; the members' values and goals (which may or may not align to the publicly stated organizational values); and a third level of underlying assumptions.46 These levels are useful in explaining disconnects between declaratory policy and personnel behavior.            "
"31","A close examination reveals significant cultural disconnects between what each agency is tasked to do and what it is actually oriented towards. The norms, values, and assumptions that comprise culture in turn drive management styles, procedures, routines, and rewards.47 Factors that make successful Foreign Service officers, diplomats, and aid workers do not necessarily translate into effective leaders of stabilization and reconstruction missions. Becoming a great Foreign Service officer means mastering conduct of diplomacy and reporting, not action and management.48 Words form the building blocks of diplomacy, and analytical reporting is much more useful than planning, which is seen as a constraint. Management is the purview of civil servants; Foreign Service officers are not incentivized to develop planning or management skills.49"
"32","In 2002, the State Department launched the Future of Iraq Project, its contribution to pre‐invasion planning. The project drew together working groups that evaluated post‐invasion needs in Iraq and whose reports formed, in the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction's opinion, “The single most rigorous assessment conducted by the U.S. government before the war.”50 The outcome demonstrated the clash between a culture that puts a premium on words and the demands of interagency war planners. The project's findings were a comprehensive review of likely problems facing Iraq post‐invasion—the findings also totaled over 1,000 pages and were discarded as unsuitable for operational purposes.51"
"33","Conversely, USAID culture values action and trains its officers to be effective field operators. However, the aid culture that values this operational capacity tends to devalue the stabilization and reconstruction mission. From a practical standpoint, USAID focuses on development goals that, while furthering U.S. interests in the long run, often do not align to short‐term politically driven priorities. Put simply, USAID has the necessary capabilities but values a different agenda. If building schools represent typical reconstruction projects for the military in Afghanistan, then development efforts would prioritize the teachers and education system rendering schools useful in the long term.52 This focus, while valuable, fails to provide a bridge from the immediate aftermath of a conflict—when local capacity may be devastated—to a point where long‐term development can begin. Reconstruction is erroneously viewed as “the enemy of development,” 53 rather than a precursor to it; even when its role is acknowledged, there is a dismissal of its activities as extraneous to USAID's focus.            "
"34","USAID culture has a tendency to mirror development culture writ large.54 The development community's culture is at odds with the short‐term political agendas that drive stabilization and reconstruction. It views these missions not as a springboard to long‐term growth but rather as a ploy to militarize development, saying that it “posits military action as a crucial way to achieve political and economic development.”55 This community views with suspicion the truism that, as Condoleezza Rice said, “It is impossible to draw neat, clear lines between our security interests, our development efforts and our democratic ideals.”56 This development weltanschauung, despite being at odds with the official culture of USAID, persists and is evident at the lower levels of organizational culture within the agency. Ironically, it was the attention to threats from failed states in the wake of 11 September that elevated development as a pillar of national security. There are important exceptions, such as OTI—yet that office is held at arm's length internally and its members viewed as rogue operators. It appears that USAID's primary interest in OTI is that State not take it over.            "
"35","Schein's differentiation of levels of culture helps explicate disconnects between official culture within State and USAID and beliefs, values, and rewarded behavior. While official statements embrace stabilization and reconstruction as a core mission of both State and USAID, it is not uncommon to hear blunt rejections of the mission at a lower level. At an overt level, efforts have been made to rectify this disconnect; however, these efforts have yet to be adopted and institutionalized. USAID's Fragile States Strategy exemplifies this pattern. With Andrew Natsios at the helm of USAID between 2001 and 2006, a new strategic direction focused squarely on conflict management. The strategy, produced in 2005, was shelved just over a year later due to leadership changes and disputes over the foreign assistance budget process.57"
"36","Culture drives incentives, and historically, operational roles have not been incentivized through career progression for State personnel. Chronic difficulties filling billets in Iraq and Afghanistan attest to this problem. When the State‐led provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq could not field personnel quickly enough during the civilian surge that accompanied the military surge in 2007, the military was forced to recruit internally to fill the teams. The recent transition in Iraq prompted a renewed State focus on deploying personnel. However, this is a notable change for State, whose diplomats reacted angrily to the threat of forced deployments in 2007, likening service in Iraq to a “potential death sentence.”58"
"37","Planning is frequently singled out as a cultural difference between the foreign affairs and defense communities to the detriment of interagency coordination. State's priority is to avoid crises with activities that shape outcomes gradually, while the DoD focus is to prepare for crises far in advance.59 In light of their missions and small budgets, State and USAID planning boils down to what the military considers programming, conducted on a year‐to‐year basis.60 The organizations' different mandates have a significant impact on interagency planning for contingencies. The evolution of S/CRS's approach to planning illustrates this: originally, the office adopted State's culture, which focuses on “programmatic planning for the next fiscal year … and not on planning for unforeseen contingencies.”61 Fairly quickly, S/CRS moved towards longer‐term contingency planning, making it an outlier within the department.            "
"38","The discussion of organizational culture leads to a secondary point—definition of the mission itself. State identifies its mandate for post‐conflict response, but two things are left undetermined. First, there is a lack of clarity as to where State's capabilities will be applied. It is not explicit what they are planning for with their new and enhanced capabilities, only what they are not planning for: anything resembling the current contingencies. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review says, “Afghanistan and Iraq are not the primary models for building our civilian capacity to respond to crises and conflicts.”62 Even accepting the premise that Afghanistan and Iraq are outliers and not good templates for future efforts, the problem of planning without an articulated strategy remains. Second, State's current efforts to build capacity for stabilization and reconstruction have not yet been demonstrated or tested, in part due to indetermination over where it ought to be applied.            "
"39","Illustrating the failure to link State's endeavors to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, S/CRS was broadly criticized for an early decision not to focus on either contingency. The rationale at the time was that S/CRS was too small to tackle crises the size of either Iraq or Afghanistan. State would build the tool first, and then be ready for the next crisis. A major assumption was that given the significance of the mandate, resources would follow.63 Though S/CRS leadership had a change of heart in 2007 and sought opportunities to contribute in Afghanistan, the underlying issue persisted. Too small for Afghanistan and Iraq, shut out of Haiti, and given only supporting roles in other crises, S/CRS suffered definitional ambiguity. In one critical view, S/CRS was “relegated to offering conflict management consultancy services to often skeptical State Department bureaus.”64"
"40","The decision to create a new Bureau for Conflict and Stabilization Operations subsuming S/CRS seeks to mitigate the organizational problems specific to that office, but larger questions remain. According to John Herbst, former Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization, the current logic is, “As this [stabilization and reconstruction] capacity is used, it will be appreciated and additional resources will come.”65 But without resources and authorities, how can the capacity be used? Aligning resources and authorities around a mission requires a clear understanding of the mandate and implementation. As Laura Hall comments on various criticisms of S/CRS, “We didn't try and fail; we failed to try. Lack of resources and lack of leadership prevented the initial concept from being appropriately tested, ensuring its limited success.”66"
"41","Organizational culture is, perhaps, the most difficult factor to analyze. Beyond the visible level of stated policy, values and incentives are less tangible and difficult to measure. Nonetheless, they are significant because these biases often determine which practices are adopted. Moreover, there are signs that personnel policies and incentives are changing, in particular the State Department's perspective on the value of operational roles.67 While changes are promising, they are tenuous, and it is far from certain whether they will be institutionalized.            "
"42","Stabilization and reconstruction operations are whole‐of‐government endeavors, drawing on civilian and military expertise and cooperation. Poor interagency processes undermine coordination and further challenge State's ability to lead. Meanwhile, no one feels the “crippling gap”68 in civilian capacity more keenly than the U.S. military, which has been left time and time again with responsibility for these operations in the absence of civilian leadership.         "
"43","Poor interagency planning and coordination processes result in failure to assign appropriate authorities for stabilization and reconstruction. This complicates coordination, obscures roles and responsibilities, and results in capability gaps. There is clear evidence of dysfunction in the interagency process that serves to reinforce and, in some cases, exacerbate State's challenges. Nonetheless, interagency breakdowns do not appear determinative of how or whether State develops capacity. Analysts and policymakers widely recognize the need for interagency reform, but these reforms must follow, not precede, internal reforms. Although the evidence reveals shortcomings in the interagency framework—most notably a failure to grant State the authority to match its responsibilities—a revised framework is unlikely to resolve capacity so long as State remains unable to harness its own capabilities."
"44","At the strategic level, National Security Council (NSC) directives dictate Washington‐based interagency processes. After the George W. Bush administration passed over the Clinton‐era PDD‐56, it issued a controversial directive that gave DoD the lead for Iraq reconstruction. This was quickly discarded in favor of NSPD‐44, which gave State the lead for stabilization and reconstruction and designated a coordinator (S/CRS). Publishing this directive was galvanized by impending legislation that would have dictated stabilization and reconstruction functions to the executive branch.69 This helps explain the threadbare language of the directive, which grants State lead agency status without enforcing statutory authority, and explains why subsequent efforts to create a more‐comprehensive directive were abandoned due to interagency disagreement.70 The results had lasting implications for operations in Iraq. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction noted in 2009 that authority below the president is requisite to unifying efforts, saying: “The role of executive authority—and the lack thereof—over interagency coordination lies at the heart of the failures in the Iraq reconstruction program.”71"
"45","The need for authority is clear—without unity of command, unity of effort is often elusive. Coordinating across the entire U.S. government and uniting the activities of disparate civilian agencies is a “Herculean task” at best.72 However, neither firmer language nor statutory authority would suffice without first addressing State's internal affairs. From the onset, S/CRS lacked the bureaucratic standing and resources to manage bigger players with disparate agendas. It is unclear how State's focal point for interagency coordination could be effective “when the office has not been empowered to exert authority even within its own building.”73"
"46","The Interagency Management System (IMS) demonstrates the challenge of trying to improve process without internal consensus. The IMS was a primary component to an S/CRS planning framework intended to standardize policies and procedures for the interagency to respond to complex crises and operations.74 The system worked well in the S/CRS‐led world, but did not fare as well in the broader interagency.75 Despite being approved by the NSC in 2007, IMS was never fully adopted by the interagency, and the triggers to launch its capabilities were never agreed on. The indecision over when and how to use the system, as well as the primary resistance to using it, was internal; the year IMS was introduced, USAID staff went on the record in a Government Accountability Office report, calling the framework “unrealistic, ineffective, and redundant.”76 In the same report, State staff claimed that senior leadership had not communicated a requirement to use the framework. Following suit, other offices and agencies “expressed reluctance to work with S/CRS.”77"
"47","The failure to grant State authority to enforce its role as lead is the first significant interagency shortcoming; the second manifests at the bureaucratic level. In the absence of authority to mandate cross‐functional execution, activities are usually carried out by agencies that form—and then operate within—stovepipes. Nonetheless, there is no evidence of other agencies using this post hoc approach to planning to seize control from State. Rather, departments protect their own prerogatives, maintaining unity of command within their organization at the expense of unity of effort.78 This problem impacts field operations as well: General Stanley McChrystal's initial assessment as Commander in Afghanistan identified unity of effort as one of the key challenges undermining the campaign.79 In this “Hobbesian state of conflict,” planning is stovepiped and activities are opaque, increasing the chance of duplicative efforts.80"
"48","Thus it becomes clear that problems within the interagency process contribute to and are perpetuated by a lack of State capacity for the mission within its own organization. Under the current interagency approach, the greatest external liability to State leadership is that it has not been given adequate authority or operational control over other agencies as needed to execute courses of action. Sufficient authority is a critical component to capacity, and any argument that dismisses this would be shortsighted. Nonetheless, there is no a priori reason to assume that additional authority would result in enhanced State capacity without first resolving internal barriers."
"49","The military has functioned as the de facto lead in post‐conflict stabilization operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, despite its historical lack of the skills or mandate for stabilization and reconstruction. Today, the Pentagon is trying to build capacity for the same mission as State, and it remains unclear to what extent efforts are complementary or competitive. Does DoD's expansion further undermine State's quest to develop capacity?"
"50","Whether the military is the long‐suffering victim of State incapacity or the 800‐pound gorilla compounding State problems is highly contested among analyses of this issue. State feels overwhelmed by the Pentagon—an amoral machine that does not think, but just does. However, the analysis supports a conclusion similar to that of the interagency's role: Defense expansion exacerbates but does not cause State's capacity problems. By building its own capabilities, DoD risks mission creep and compounds some of State's challenges. But the military considers the alternative of a leadership vacuum that jeopardizes current missions to be a greater risk, and thus DoD's growth into this space is primarily a function rather than a cause of the deficit.            "
"51","The military has historically played a dominant role in stabilization and reconstruction, increasingly so with the current conflicts. It was the lack of standing capacity at State and USAID that encouraged the initial transfer of responsibility for post‐conflict operations in Iraq to DoD.81 However, the ensuing shortcomings and inability to compensate for lack of expertise forced the recognition that stabilization and reconstruction should be a civilian‐led mission. The debacle also prompted DoD to develop its own stabilization capabilities to augment civilian agencies and to lead when necessary. Acknowledging that this field belongs both statutorily and logically to the State Department, the military pursued a two‐pronged strategy of promoting State and USAID capacity‐building efforts while developing its own capacity to function both as a support and as a stop‐gap measure.82"
"52","Promoting State and USAID leadership is a priority reflected in public statements, reports, and policy. Reports to Congress call for more resources to State, citing the lack of integrated civilian capacity and capabilities as “the greatest challenge to the U.S. government's ability to conduct [stability, security, transition and reconstruction] operations.”83 Tellingly, DoD championed S/CRS from its inception, offering to help “kick‐start” the new organization with use of DoD assets.84 Concerning USAID, OTI is considered more popular with DoD than it is at home—the military fought unsuccessfully to keep OTI in Iraq in 2006, finding other advisers unwilling to support projects not linked to long‐term development.85"
"53","Glaring deficiencies in the ability of the U.S. government to stabilize Iraq post‐conflict spurred DoD to action during the same timeframe as the creation of S/CRS. Despite its vocal support of civilian capacity building, the Pentagon feared it would take “years, if not decades, and require revolutionary congressional action with respect to budgets and authorities.”86 A Defense Science Board study convened in 2004 and called for DoD to develop a “modest stabilization capability.”87 The following year, DoD issued guidance that elevated stability operations on a par with combat operations and instructed the military to prepare to support or lead stabilization activities if civilian agencies could not.            "
"54","Although former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called that capability “no replacement for the real thing—civilian involvement and expertise,”88 the second prong of the strategy is controversial. While DoD is the secondary effort, there is a real concern that it will outpace the primary one and that mission creep will militarize foreign policy. One school of thought suggests that since the military alone has the resources to conduct stabilization, it should embrace this mission. Critics argue that this type of expertise takes years to develop and risks undermining DoD's effectiveness at its core mission of fighting wars. Moreover, by taking its own measures, DoD impinges on and weakens State capacity by absorbing resources and authorities. As one military scholar observes, “In a resource‐constrained environment, Congress is unlikely to provide support for building capacity for stability operations in both Defense and State.”89"
"55","This highlights the fear that given DoD's ability to develop capacity faster than State and USAID, the civilian capacity will never materialize. So long as the military fills the void in the field, there is reduced urgency within the State Department. The understanding that the military will step in if civilian capacity is overwhelmed, as demonstrated in Iraq, creates the perception of a “fall‐back plan” that delays the need for civilian agencies to take charge of operations.90 This corollary to Defense expansion into the stabilization and reconstruction space is perhaps the most troubling implication. The longer it takes State to develop capacity, the longer a military presence is required. Additionally, it obscures the need for State's ability to respond to crises where the military may not be present. When political events dictate a withdrawal of forces, this lack of urgency proves to be a false complacency. As Laura Hall says, writing on the then‐imminent transition of mission in Iraq: “What if the cavalry isn't coming?”91"
"56","Concerns over DoD's absorption of resources and authorities are legitimate, though not a zero‐sum equation. With wartime supplemental funding, DoD allocates funds to stabilization and reconstruction that easily vie with State levels of funding. However, these funds are not consciously appropriated to Defense at State's expense. Costs are not reviewed by Congress as mission areas, but rather isolated by agency and funding streams. The issue of authority is similar—DoD may not attempt to gain authority at the expense of State, but in the absence of civilian capacity, there is a drift towards the military. Senator Richard Lugar articulates this concern, saying that if outstanding issues are not resolved, “We will begin to see a realignment of authorities between the Departments of Defense and State.”92"
"57","The two‐way relationship between State and USAID and Congress is complex. On one hand, Congress's lack of support for the department is frequently noted.93 The legislative branch's willingness to cool diplomatic heels contrasts sharply with its warmth towards the military. On the other hand, State and USAID have a much poorer relationship with Congress than do their military counterparts, and internal management weaknesses undermine their processes for securing funding.         "
"58","Congressional appropriations committees generally cut more from the international affairs portion of the president's budget request than any other portion.94 Far from a quirk in executive–legislative relations, congressional failure to adequately support State and USAID has significant, detrimental effects on their capacity for the stabilization and reconstruction mission. Lack of a domestic constituency for foreign affairs; the less‐apparent link between State activities and national security interests; and disparate congressional budget treatments of State and DoD all contribute to the problem. Nonetheless, this is a systemic problem that affects all State and USAID activities and does not sufficiently explain the capacity deficit examined here.            "
"59","Congress's apparent aversion to funding State and USAID is rooted partially in a historic skepticism of foreign affairs and partially in the lack of domestic interest or support. Without the strong domestic constituency the military enjoys, State and USAID funding is a soft target on the chopping block when Congress eyes cuts. Actions in the wake of the 2010 elections demonstrate the tenuous relationship: within two months, the incoming chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee had vowed to cut the State and USAID budget, while the House Republican Study Committee put forward a proposal to defund USAID.95 In contrast, as Joseph Collins points out, “Can you imagine Congress zero‐funding the Air Force?”96"
"60","This lack of support has two main causes: one is the less‐visible connection between State activities and national security interests; the other is what Gordon Adams terms the “micro‐politics” of national security. Micro‐politics comprises the impact of national security spending in communities throughout America, the dispersed military bases and armed forces personnel, and the diverse representation of America in the military ranks.97 In contrast, State funding disappears into overseas countries, with no impact on U.S. towns or factories. Diplomacy, to quote former Secretary of Defense Gates, “simply does not have the built‐in, domestic constituency of defense programs.”98"
"61","Within Congress, committee organization and budget treatment also stacks against the State Department. In contrast to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees's annual authorization bills for defense spending, the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committees have not issued equivalent authorization bills for foreign assistance in more than 25 years.99 With State and USAID budgets going directly to the appropriations committees, there is a reduced sense of ownership or sponsorship of programs as a result.100 Coherence is reduced as well: when the budgets reach the appropriations committees, they encounter a proliferation of stovepiped committees. Specific to stabilization and reconstruction, at least eight different committees and subcommittees handle funding.101 Thus the issue is a lack of visibility on overall costs of operation and a subsequent inability to make trade‐offs and fund the mission as a whole.            "
"62","As an external influence, Congress's approach towards State has the most serious near‐term implications. In light of the handover of the Iraq mission to the State Department and current U.S. troop drawdown in Afghanistan, efforts in Congress to slash funding are alarming. If funds were severely cut, this would be the single external influence with the greatest impact on State capacity to lead the ongoing stabilization and reconstruction missions."
"63","State and USAID struggle with internal structures and processes that negatively impact the budget process. They fail to provide robust justification for programs and have yet to build the strong relationships with Congress that Defense enjoys. Several factors affect this, including cultural influences on the planning and program justification processes, structural considerations, and a relationship deficit with the legislative branch in comparison to DoD. State's and USAID's approaches to planning on a year‐to‐year basis hurt the budget request process. Without a multiyear framework, it is challenging to link programs to strategic goals and difficult to render costs predictable over time.102 Specific to USAID, the reduced budget control that came with loss of its autonomy in the 1990s further complicates the effort. In addition to planning and budget requests, State has faced significant difficulty demonstrating to Congress the costs of its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Larger budget requests were rebuffed—State's response was to adopt DoD's criticized but effective tactic of supplementals.103"
"64","State and USAID face structural challenges when it comes to justifying programs. Foreign assistance programs are splintered, with more than two dozen agencies administering foreign assistance. The resulting “tower of Babel”104 of jumbled programs creates inherent structural weaknesses that undermine State's ability to present a coherent budget request. Specific to State, many of its programs are difficult to quantify. For instance, conflict prevention is an important mission, but difficult to secure funds for, and it is even harder to measure its effectiveness in order to justify future budget cycles. USAID faces the dilemma of reconciling its organizational culture and linkage to the development world with the need to appeal to the national security agenda that Congress consistently funds.105"
"65","Finally, State has fewer relationships on the Hill than Defense and expends little effort to change the status quo, largely due to necessity. State's staff numbers are so low in comparison to the Pentagon that it simply does not have the personnel to dedicate to the task. When it comes to relationships, many members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees are former service members; this connection alone provides the military with valuable rapport. Military fellows flood the Hill, dwarfing the number—and subsequent influence—of Foreign Service officers serving as liaisons to the legislative branch. Moreover, State and USAID's organizations are by mandate externally and internationally oriented. Neglect of domestic politics can be a dangerous oversight; understanding the domestic considerations influencing Congress is critical to securing funds. State overlooks these relationships at its own peril. No matter how cold its reception, the State Department must continually show Congress that dollars spent on foreign aid, and on stabilization and reconstruction more specifically, further U.S. interests."
"66","Many recommendations for reforming stabilization and reconstruction operations focus on interagency processes and State's resource gap. Solve problems of unity of command and effort across the interagency and correct resourcing disparities, the argument goes, and capacity issues will be resolved. Contrary to the common wisdom that more dollars equals more capacity, resourcing is only part of the equation. An infusion of resources into the existing patchwork of State and USAID culture, bureaucratic struggles, and confusion over the stabilization and reconstruction mission would only partially minimize gaps. Internal factors must be the first targets of reform. The State Department and USAID need to address bureaucratic conflict and organizational culture, clarify the mission, and justify program costs to Congress. Then, State will be in a position to manage operations within the interagency; DoD can relinquish its de facto lead without impact to the mission; and Congress will have justification to maintain a consistent funding stream. The following section makes recommendations to shape reforms and addresses some of the costs inherent to change."
"67","Any durable solution to State and USAID infighting must include several basic elements, the first of which is to delineate roles and responsibilities. Regardless of how organizational charts are shuffled, an effective solution will minimize the ambiguities that fuel conflict and will assign clear ownership for the mission. A second solution will change the status quo where multiple offices vie for internal and interagency lead. Even with the lead agency approach designated in the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, these issues remain unresolved.106 Eliminating duplicative capabilities logically requires more integration, suggesting that all pieces of the mission should stay together for unity of effort. Given that State is the confirmed lead for stabilization and reconstruction, one solution is to integrate USAID capabilities more fully into the State Department.107 This could entail subsuming certain USAID offices into the new State Bureau for Conflict and Stabilization Operations.            "
"68","One thing is unavoidable—a clear winner means a clear loser. It is likely that one agency's unique capabilities will diminish to truly integrate and build standing capacity. Moreover, “coherence and agility are natural enemies”108—consolidating the mission will involve trade‐offs. Moving USAID capabilities to State does not ensure that the new bureau will become operationally competent. How offices adapt and capabilities fare are contingent on whether State's organizational culture changes.            "
"69","We will recognize culture change when there is a clear alignment between behavioral levels of organizational culture and the overt policy level. This alignment requires changes to training, incentive structures, and planning. Instances of success should be awarded and institutionalized. Participation in interagency operations should be requisite (or at a minimum enhancing) for professional advancement in the Foreign and Civil Services.109 One example is Dane Smith's recommendation that political officers be required to complete at least one assignment in a conflict zone as an eligibility requirement for the senior Foreign Service.110 Training is more difficult—the State Department does not have sufficient resources to maintain the same training float as the military.111 However, there are underutilized training options on conflict management within State's Foreign Service Institute that could become mandatory for advancement.112"
"70","Changing organizational culture is driven by key determinations about the mission. Defining the mission must first answer questions on function and on scale. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review calls Iraq and Afghanistan outliers, and not the model for stabilization and reconstruction capacity. If so, State leadership must find opportunities on an appropriate scale to test nascent civilian expeditionary capabilities. Capacity must be demonstrated now to be trusted later.            "
"71","There is a question that begs asking: should culture change? State and USAID are adept at their diplomacy and development missions. Changing organizational culture is a protracted and difficult process. Changing without clear direction or consensus to adopt a new mission could dilute existing strengths without achieving a new, expeditionary diplomacy. The answer is predicated on the future of the mission. Failure to make clear decisions will jeopardize external support and subsequent capacity‐building measures."
"72","Organizational and cultural changes take time and resources. Unless State and USAID can demonstrate and justify the costs of the stabilization and reconstruction mission, it is doubtful that needs will be met. Moreover, if Congress truly is “the root of all evil,” as some observers at State believe, ignoring it will not improve the outcome and overlooks potentially positive roles for Congress to play. One consideration is whether to enlist Congress's help in codifying functions and implementing organizational changes. This would leverage Congress's ability to grant authority and funding, but would entail trade‐offs in independence over functions and responsibilities. For example, State's move to establish S/CRS preemptively ahead of the Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 inadvertently undermined S/CRS from the onset. Although the office was eventually codified in 2008, it lacked the funding and statutory authorities that could have been secured, albeit at the cost of Congress dictating the function."
"73","Dealing with Congress effectively will require management changes and prioritizing relationships—no bridge is too far if it reaches Congress. State and USAID are experimenting with positive steps, including process enhancements such as multiyear budgets. Less positive are recent decisions to shift towards reliance on supplemental funding and calls for pooled funding with DoD. These are workarounds that meet immediate needs but will go away as the current contingencies wind down—cutting the legs from under a standing capacity."
"74","The greatest challenge may be selling Congress on the modest costs of prevention and preparedness as opposed to being caught off guard in crises that can quickly escalate. The price of responding ad hoc and post hoc is dear: inadequate responses force the military into its default lead role, resulting in mission creep and perpetuating the skewed civilian–military balance. The aversion to footing small bills to sustain standing capacity leads to large problems that draw in the military at high costs. If this situation is left unresolved, State and USAID will continue to scramble to find the skills and personnel they need in crises. State and USAID need to be equipped to execute the mission they are tasked with, or the mission must be moved elsewhere or abandoned."
"75","Moving forward, State and USAID must determine whether stabilization and reconstruction is a capacity they want and implement internal reforms accordingly. Any reform effort will founder without first addressing bureaucratic conflict, organizational culture, and outreach to Congress. If these are addressed, State and USAID have an opportunity to demonstrate civilian leadership in response to the next stabilization and reconstruction mission. The imperative beckons to close the gap between the ability of the Unites States to wage war and its capacity to build peace."
