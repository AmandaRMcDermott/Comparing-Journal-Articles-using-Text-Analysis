"1","To use one of Crawford Young's favorite words, his latest book, is “masterful.” The Postcolonial State in Africa: Fifty Years of Independence, 1960–2010 provides a rare retrospective on the first 50 years of African independence from one whose own distinguished career in teaching and learning African politics coincided completely with those years. The book's stated aim is to capture the unfolding dynamic of African politics across five decades. Young suggests striking similarities in the trajectories of many African states between independence and the early 1990s, followed by “itineraries [that have] diverged sharply” since, resulting in a range of outcomes (p. 8). Overall, Young identifies three cycles in the first 50 years of independence, fluctuating between “high optimism, even euphoria, followed by disappointment, even a despairing ‘Afropessimism,’ in the first two and a mingling of hope, even audacious, and skeptical uncertainty in the current stage, reflecting sharply divergent itineraries” (p. 9). The cycles of hope and disappointment are elaborated in Part Two of the book in chapters on decolonization, independence, and the colonial legacy; the road to autocracy; state crisis; and democratization and its limits. Young is in his prime in his thematic chapter in Part Three on Africanism, nationalism, and ethnicity and the critical roles they have played in defining the political itineraries of African states. The book is refreshing in its steadfast treatment of the entire African continent, not just sub‐Saharan Africa, as is usually the case in our discussions of “African” politics.         "
"2","In my view, the book may be somewhat too pessimistic about the third cycle. This may be due to too great an emphasis on the conflicts of the 1990s, most of which had been resolved by the late 2000s. It is also important that we convey the findings of Young's colleague, Scott Straus, that Africa is not a place of “forever” wars, that “wars do end,” and that, even taking into consideration the flare‐up in conflicts after the democratic openings of the 1990s, conflicts have been of greater duration and frequency in places other than Africa. Young acknowledges this at the end of his chapter on the morphology of violent civil conflict, but still, an overemphasis on conflict seeps through. The book also fails to capture the many contributions that African women have made to ending conflicts, building peace, and participating in formal politics, especially over the last two decades. Young does bring in some of the seminal work of another colleague, Aili Mari Tripp, in acknowledging the roles of African women, but only toward the end of the book."
"3","In his final chapter, Young treats in fleeting fashion some of the most‐ encouraging trends in Africa today. He mentions the role of African diasporas, but only in terms of remittances when what they are providing in today's globalized world is training and skills, capital and entrepreneurship, among other things. He mentions advances in technology, though mostly in terms of cell phones, when the Internet and social media are having huge impacts on things as diverse as agricultural production and election outcomes. And, of course, there is China, whose presence is clearly ambiguous, but momentous at the same time. There is also the passing of generations, as Young notes when he writes of the first generation of African leaders. Today, as in Ghana in 2012, presidents are being elected who were born after independence; similarly, students in universities across Africa today not only did not experience colonialism, but also did not experience the first 30 years of single‐party and military rule in Africa."
"4","These are compelling and mostly hopeful developments, though challenges abound. The Postcolonial State in Africa brings us to this moment in Young's engaging style and erudite prose. The book shares Young's encyclopedic knowledge of African politics, providing in a single volume a comprehensive rendering of the first 50 years of independence. The book is sprinkled with anecdotes from his vast experience in Africa and that of his many students, and quotations from all of the relevant literature published over the past five decades. Students and scholars of African politics alike will benefit immensely from and enjoy reading The Postcolonial State in Africa.         "
