"1","Todd R. Clear and Natasha A. Frost present an impressively comprehensive summary of the politics and policies that caused the massive expansion of the American correctional system. They conclude that this buildup failed to achieve most of its goals and provide a road map for how it could be dismantled. In doing so, they pull off the difficult task of writing a book that an advanced undergraduate would find sufficiently accessible while putting forth theory and policy proposals that will interest scholars of criminal justice, political science, and public policy."
"2","Clear and Frost trace the expansion of the correctional system back to the dramatic increase in the crime rate in the 1960s. They contend that candidates from both parties began adopting more punitive positions after Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan successfully used crime as an issue in their presidential campaigns. When making this argument, Clear and Frost's implicit assumption is that crime policy responds to public opinion. In a piece published in the October 2014 issue of the American Journal of Political Science titled “The Public's Increasing Punitiveness and Its Influence on Mass Incarceration in the United States,” Peter K. Enns finds relatively strong evidence supporting this conjecture. Yet we still do not have a particularly good understanding of what affects the punitiveness of the American public. Clear and Frost cite perceptions of the crime rate and the positions of political elites as two potential drivers of public opinion on criminal justice policy. More work is needed to better understand the extent to which public opinion is affected by these and other factors.         "
"3","Clear and Frost note that Louisiana incarcerates almost six times as many of its residents as Maine (p. 25). While some of this gap certainly reflects differences in the two states' populations, including their racial makeup, it also highlights the importance of state politics in shaping criminal justice policy. This begs the question, why is Louisiana so much more punitive than Maine? While Clear and Frost acknowledge the importance of state politics in generating criminal justice policy and highlight many influential state policies, the determinants of state policy remain largely unexplored in this book. Moreover, many of the forces that they focus on as the primary causes of the expansion of the criminal justice system—the increased crime rate, the war on drugs, and more punitive presidents—affected all states. More work is needed to identify what state‐level forces caused some states and regions to be more punitive than others."
"4","Clear and Frost make much of the small decline in the size of the correctional population over the last few years, and they believe that this marks the start of a new era in criminal justice policy. I am more skeptical that this trend will continue as state coffers return to their pre–financial crisis levels. Whatever the case may be, the authors' blueprint for reform is likely to influence academic and policy debates for years to come. One weakness I see in their proposed reforms is that none addresses the fact that a majority of Americans both believe that the crime rate is rising and want to spend more money to halt the “rising” crime rate, even though the crime rate is at the lowest point in 35 years (p. 140). To the extent that punitive public opinion was responsible for the growth of the correctional system, it seems as if a less punitive public is also going to be necessary for it to contract."
