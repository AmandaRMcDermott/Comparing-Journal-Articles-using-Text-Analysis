"1","Isabel Hull's analysis of international law during World War I is a welcome and valuable contribution to an emerging body of scholarship on the laws of war. This is not to undercut its place in the historiography of World War I. Hull rightly points out that most histories of the war have tended to gloss over or even dismiss the role of international law in the war. Hull corrects this bias by delving into British, French, and particularly German archives to show that international law was very much on the minds of all parties to the conflict. Indeed, she argues that preserving the existing structure of international law was a major reason for the outbreak of war."
"2","Hull's main argument is that views of international law varied across belligerents. The primary fault line lay between Germany and everyone else. The British, French, and Americans argued constantly about the rights of neutrals, obligations of occupying parties, and legal limits on how prisoners of war could be treated. The Germans, argues Hull, interpreted international law in view of military necessity; law was meant to serve belligerents, and could certainly be trumped in the face of the demands of war. And contrary to the logic that it is weak states that favor international law, Hull suggests that the source of this attitude lay in part in Germany's own military and economic weakness (p. 319). Thus, German treatment of Allied prisoners of war was intentionally worsened over time, far exceeding the bounds of reciprocity, retaliation, and reprisal as they were embodied in the laws of war of the day and advocated by the Allies."
"3","The multidisciplinarity of Hull's book is one of many reasons it should be welcomed by political scientists. There are few such histories of the operation of the laws of war. This particular account speaks to the obvious issue of compliance, but also to more‐subtle questions such as the relationship between public opinion and the laws of war, as well as their orientation in favor of the “civilized” world."
"4","One of the few weaknesses of this book lies in Hull's sometimes contradictory view of the history of the laws of war. She argues that the Great War destroyed the international laws of the day. By her own account, though, Britain and France—the victors—cared deeply about international law through the end of the conflict and beyond. Moreover, it is important not to overstate the height of the edifice of the laws of war of the time. Notwithstanding a large body of custom, the laws of war had begun to be codified only in the mid‐nineteenth century, and they shifted their focus away from belligerent rights and toward protected persons (including occupied populations, a particular issue in Belgium) only with the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907—just a few years before war broke out in 1914."
"5","A Scrap of Paper should be required reading for scholars of World War I and of the laws of war. It raises outstanding questions, such as why World War I is the exception to the rule that major wars tend to be followed by new laws of war. It also should have a wide readership among international relations scholars. Hull bookends her analysis with the provocative suggestion that the realist school of international relations is overly based on the German outlier (pp. 13, 329). Hull's perspective casts an important light on the history of World War I, the workings of international law, and the intellectual history of international relations.         "
