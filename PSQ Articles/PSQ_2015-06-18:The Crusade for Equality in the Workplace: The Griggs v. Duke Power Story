"1","This book examines the long history of Griggs v. Duke Power Company, the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court decision that expanded minority rights at work by affirming the disparate impact theory of discrimination. Griggs remade essential knowledge about the nature of workplace discrimination and its remedies by subjecting to scrutiny the outcomes produced by even facially race‐neutral policies, thus displacing the previous sole focus on identifying bias in employers' motives. Beginning in the years when Title VII of the Civil Rights Act “had more bones than flesh” (p. 45), Robert Belton analyzes the Griggs decision to provide a window into the campaigns and conflicts that cemented legal conceptions of equality and discrimination. A biography of the disparate impact theory, The Crusade for Equality in the Workplace traces the origins, establishment, and long‐term prospects of an opinion that reset the course of the workplace rights revolution.

"2","With care and precision, Belton unfolds the story of Griggs v. Duke Power Company: its origins, development, and legacy. Exhaustively researched, The Crusade for Equality in the Workplace captures the perspectives of the many actors who had a hand in the Griggs decision's passage and interpretation: interest groups, attorneys, employers, plaintiffs, and government officials. Early chapters detail the key legal precedents that led up to Griggs and the dedicated efforts of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) to build such a test case to expand Title VII's reach. Subsequent chapters trace discrete steps in the evolution of the case as it advanced through the legal system. Griggs's hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court comes at the midpoint of the book, and Belton's thorough research in the archives of several Supreme Court justices allows him to illuminate the deliberations and drafting processes that contributed to the opinion. The second half of the book traces the “overlapping generations” of procedural, theoretical, and practical questions Griggs generated, as well as the Ronald Reagan administration's “sustained political and legal campaign” to neuter it—an assault that was countered by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (pp. 58, 268).

"3","As one of the LDF's key litigators in the Griggs case, Belton was uniquely qualified to write The Crusade for Equality in the Workplace. The book's greatest strength is his ability to provide an “insider's, first‐person, behind‐the‐scenes history of the litigation campaign” (p. 6). Belton recovers the LDF's internal operations, recounting the tactics its attorneys debated but did not pursue. He buttresses his personal memories with archival evidence and clear and thorough explanations of legal developments, capturing Griggs's drama and contingency. This approach reflects Belton's complementary but distinct careers as a pioneering litigator and law professor; it has also yielded a highly readable and informative book.         "
"4","Belton could have developed his explanation of Griggs's significance by further emphasizing the impact of disparate impact. He might have included more biographical information about the plaintiffs and described in greater detail the theory's implications for other groups. He might also have reframed his description of Griggs's resonance in light of the considerable historical literature on postwar social movements. The decision did not “usher . . . in” (p. 3) the civil rights movement, as Belton claims, so much as sharpen one of its most critical weapons. This book should find an enthusiastic readership among students seeking to understand the basics of workplace discrimination law as well as seasoned professionals who want to deepen their knowledge of its nuances.
