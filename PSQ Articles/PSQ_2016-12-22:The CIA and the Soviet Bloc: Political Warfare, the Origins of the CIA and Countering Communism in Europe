"1","Of the making of books on U.S. Cold War policies there is no end, especially on the dawn of that long struggle. A vast and complicated topic, it features momentous events, high stakes, colorful personalities, and—with certain exceptions—rich source material."
"2","Not a few historians have ventured where those sources taper out by studying American intelligence operations during the early Cold War. Sarah Jane Corke and Gregory Mitrovich, for example, separately mined National Security Council records for reflections of covert action planning and found that bureaucratic and strategic ambitions outstripped America's embryonic secret capabilities. Peter Grose and Evan Thomas even gained narrow access to internal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) histories and presented critical but nuanced overviews of the CIA's operations. Stephen Long, a lecturer at Canterbury Christ Church University, recently added his own title to this literature."
"3","Long's The CIA and the Soviet Bloc was admirably well produced by its publisher; it is an attractive, thoughtfully designed, and durable tome that readers will find easy to use. Unfortunately, its substantive contribution is only modest.         "
"4","The CIA and the Soviet Bloc recounts in detail the bureaucratic wrangling over the conferring of covert action authority on the CIA and the young agency's enthusiastic but clumsy efforts to wield its new powers. This account, although benefiting from memoirs and secondary sources, relies on and does not much alter the findings of a pair of official CIA histories that were declassified in the early 1990s.         "
"5","Despite its title, however, the book is more about America's anti‐Soviet strategy writ large than about the CIA's efforts. In this, it joins a distinct strain in the literature on American diplomatic history, a sort of collective sigh over the emergence of a “national security state” in postwar America and regret that Washington somehow missed a chance, however unlikely, to reverse the “militarization” of the Cold War after Joseph Stalin's death."
"6","The later portions of the book thus will not disappoint readers seeking a refutation of “triumphalist notions of an American ‘victory’” in the Cold War (p. 12). Long offers grudging admiration for NATO and the Marshall Plan, but with regard to Eastern Europe, the record he relates is dismal. Three words appear throughout: disorder, incoherence, and impotence. The CIA and the Soviet Bloc portrays each failure of U.S. policy behind the Iron Curtain as culpable, while each success was accidental and yet another indicator of the incoherence and impotence of Washington's disordered strategy.         "
"7","One example must suffice. In 1953, protests against the communist regime convulsed East Germany. Soviet tanks soon helped the forces of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) suppress the outbreaks, while the surprised Dwight D. Eisenhower administration agonized over helping the protesters. American propaganda was counterproductive, of course, although Washington did score “a public‐relations success” by deploying “food kitchens in West Berlin for the GDR's hungry.” These kitchens helped West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer's reelection, yet even this silver lining had its black cloud: “In reality, the food aid programme was little more than a face‐saving exercise for Eisenhower, which papered over America's impotence to exploit and harness popular dissent” (p. 246). Possibly, but to paraphrase Sigmund Freud, perhaps sometimes a kitchen is just a kitchen."
