"1","In his book, Steve A. Yetiv establishes that recurrent cognitive biases have consistently undermined the quality of U.S. foreign policy decisions. He examines a diverse set of contemporary cases, focused in and around the Middle East, to demonstrate the influence of one or more of a full set of deleterious psychological tendencies. Yetiv is forthright about the purposes of this small volume. He concedes that he is not breaking new intellectual ground, testing propositions against competing arguments, or selecting cases for their representativeness. Instead, he seeks to introduce the essential vocabulary and arguments of an important theory of foreign policy to a broad audience."
"2","Each chapter has a different thematic focus and historical case. The Afghanistan chapter focuses on the bias by which parties see their own behavior as transparently virtuous, in contrast to an opponent's behavior; the Iran‐Contra chapter centers on the tunnel vision behind the Ronald Reagan administration's efforts to trade guns to Iran to secure release of U.S. hostages and obtain cash to fund the Contras in Nicaragua; the Iraq chapter centers on overconfidence in the George W. Bush administration's 2003 rush to war; and the chapter on U.S. energy policy critiques the short‐term thinking behind the U.S. failure to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies. Sometimes, the material strays in its focus, which limits the potential impact of Yetiv's argument. The U.S. energy chapter reads more like policy advocacy than a revelatory application of cognitive principles. The radical terrorism chapter centers on the confirmatory bias of “seeing what you want to see,” with evidence drawn oddly from al Qaeda's distorted world view. Few would contest Yetiv's claims that al Qaeda's leadership is biased, given its violent commitment to an extreme ideology. But the chapter misses an opportunity to remain true to the book's substantive focus and establish that U.S.policymakers ignore facts, falsely attribute malign intent to behavior, and detect the unpatterned as patterned as a matter of course."
"3","The sophisticated reader will certainly demand more than is found in this volume, for various reasons. First, the explanations are indeterminate. Although each chapter is written around a type of bias, some chapters present multiple biases that fit the same evidence or present evidence that can be explained by biases discussed in other chapters. Although the Iraq chapter focuses on overconfidence, tunnel vision is a potential culprit in U.S. preparations for a war that would presumably end once Baghdad fell. Second, the explanations have only limited predictive value. Relative to other theories, cognitive theories suffer in prediction because of the (temporal) proximity of presumed causes and effects, the specificity of these effects, and the challenges of acquiring useful data on high‐level decision making. Third, the identified causes of cognitive bias potentially explain outcomes that are attributed to bias. In the case of the Iraq war, these causes would certainly include “President George W. Bush's disposition and decision‐making style” (p. 50). Fourth, outcomes attributed to bias also have rational explanations. Yetiv is right that U.S. officials are hapless victims of short‐sighted thinking in devising energy strategy, but they are rational enough to know that raising the public's short‐term costs will hurt their own long‐term prospects for remaining in office."
"4","Notwithstanding its deficiencies, perhaps because of them, the book could work well in the classroom. For that explicit purpose, Yetiv pitches his arguments at an introductory level. He draws lightly from experimental research, discusses recognizable human tendencies, relies on contemporary cases, and writes simply and clearly. With appropriate direction, his arguments could inspire productive discussion to address unanswered questions in his analysis. But the principles in this book deserve wide recognition. Yetiv places necessary focus on lapses in decision making that are important to acknowledge, for their effects and insidiousness. Yetiv closes the volume appropriately, then, with useful recommendations for offsetting the pernicious effects of bias in policymaking. His advice is certainly welcome, given the high costs of failure, or success, as demonstrated unfortunately over the last decade in the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."
