"1","Andrew Mumford's volume explores a long‐prevalent yet under‐theorized element of modern military conflict, proxy warfare. By including state employment of state or non‐state proxies against non‐state actors, as well as non‐state reliance on other non‐state actors, the definitional scope of proxy warfare is broadened well beyond its traditional bounds of paramilitary violence guided from afar by states against rival states. Rich with micro case studies spanning from the Cold War to the present, Mumford's book suggests not only why this violent phenomenon has persisted, but why it is likely to become the prevailing form of warfare in the twenty‐first century.         "
"2","Proxy Warfare is a firmly realist work, arguing that although state and non‐state “benefactors” may use violence to pursue ideological objectives, the selection of proxy war owes to the dual influences of risk aversion and the “obsolescence of major war.” Regarding the former, Mumford demonstrates that proxy wars both perpetuate and circumvent the security dilemma by allowing benefactors to demonstrate military resolve toward rivals via proxies while maintaining plausible deniability regarding their sponsorship. This observation implies that major wars have become archaic owing to their moral turpitude and catastrophic destructiveness. Actors now generally employ more‐covert means to advance military objectives.         "
"3","Yet, both foundations lack substantive theoretical elucidation. Benefactors may indeed prefer proxy war as less costly than mobilizing and maintaining standing armies. So too, wars that do not produce flag‐draped coffins are less likely to exhaust popular enthusiasm. Yet does plausible deniability really render such conflicts less risky? Even if tracing the precise means by which benefactors fund, arm, and train proxies is difficult, such support is frequently public knowledge. Just as there was little question that Uganda and Sudan were engaged in a cross‐border proxy war through their respective sponsorship of the SPLA and LRA, India was fully aware of Pakistani support for Lashkae‐i‐Taiba in Kashmir, while Israel has long decried Iranian support for Hezbollah."
"4","Neither does Mumford explain why targeted actors, in particular strong states with high capacity to project military power, like India and Israel, rarely retaliate directly against proxy benefactors. The answer to this puzzle may well be found in the “obsolescence of major war,” a phenomenon that seemingly incentivizes proxy strategies yet discourages direct response. Drawing from Robert Jackson's Quasi‐States: Sovereignty, International Relations, and the Third World, one may suggest that even states with limited capacity to control their territory may still enjoy international recognition of the inviolability of their borders. As in Uganda–Sudan, this allowed each to engage in proxy war without fear of direct threat to their territorial integrity. Alternatively, Pakistan was able to conduct proxy warfare in Kashmir despite India's obvious military strength precisely because of the region's disputed status. Regrettably, theorization to this effect is lacking.         "
"5","The bulk of the volume, rather, is committed to describing proxy war: how it is fought and by whom. In this respect, Mumford has produced a valuable introductory textbook. Yet in his enthusiasm to bring scholarly attention to proxy conflict, he has cast perhaps too wide a net. Even as his definition excludes military confrontation and covert action wherein “benefactors” are directly involved, he misinterprets a range of other indirect actions such as including foreign military aid (p. 40), diaspora support for ethnic rebellion (p. 66), cyber warfare (p. 87), and the recruitment of “unwilling tactical proxies” like the mentally handicapped (p. 104). Such conceptual stretching risks offering little more than a new label for the multifaceted nature of modern warfare. If proxy warfare is deserving of critical scholarly attention in its own right, a more definitionally constrained and theoretically rigorous approach is needed."
