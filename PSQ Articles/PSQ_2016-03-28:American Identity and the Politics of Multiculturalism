"1","Continuing immigration flows as well as institutional shifts incorporating notions of multiculturalism to accommodate ethnic and cultural diversity have spurred academic debates about whether American national identity is waning. Samuel P. Huntington's Who Are We? is one of the most pessimist voices in this debate, as he claims that these transitions threaten the American creed. In American Identity and the Politics of Multiculturalism, Jack Citrin and David O. Sears—two éminences grises of the study of national and political identities—once again join forces to successfully attenuate the claim that American identity conflicts with the idea of multiculturalism.         "
"2","Their analysis of representative social surveys first and foremost refutes the idea that expressions of American identity are in decline. Americans of all major ethnic groups have over the years grown stronger in their patriotic sentiments in spite of a persisting color line. First, compelling evidence confirms the black exceptionalism paradigm of blacks holding stronger ethnic attachments and weaker patriotic sentiments than whites and Latinos. Their somewhat lower patriotism is combined with more critical opinions toward the historical elements that set blacks back in the past. Second, this book further disqualifies the Hispanization thesis. Unique longitudinal data for Los Angeles confirm assimilation theory among Latinos: attachment to America grows and ethnic sentiments weaken with length of residence. Third, particularly among blacks and Latinos, there is no association whatsoever between the strength of their ethnic and national identities; among whites, weak positive correlations exist. Put differently, people might have a particularly strong ethnic identity, yet this does not oppose American patriotism."
"3","In response to the primary question of whether embracing multiculturalist policies makes attachment to America more difficult, this book documents overwhelming support among all major ethnic groups for soft multiculturalism, that is, policies aimed at the recognition and preservation of cultural differences (such as the “salad bowl” metaphor). In addition, soft multiculturalism is not opposed to patriotism, a finding that puts forward some thought experiments: if multiculturalism becomes increasingly part of the American imprint, then is it not plausible to assume that at some point, love for the country should go hand in hand with love for soft multiculturalism?"
"4","The book provides additional room for thought for future research. First of all, Los Angeles as a case is enlightening and theoretically justified, but it might also entail limitations. The convincing acculturation argument could benefit from additional sampling in the so‐called new immigrant destinations, as such communities provide more leverage to monitor dynamics in identity formation within and between ethnic groups in unprecedented detail. Although ethnographic studies in such new destination communities (for instance, Helen B. Marrow's 2011 book New Destination Dreaming) hint at these acculturation strategies, quantitative evidence of the same kind would have given even more credits to this book. A second point on which readers might be left unsatisfied is the underdeveloped attention to contextual influence on American identity, contrasting the well‐described psychological roots of national and ethnic identification and policy preferences. The study invokes major events, such as the Rodney King riots and the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; yet with recent upsurges in troubled race relations (such as the demonstrations in Ferguson and Baltimore), one might wonder how these events might further consolidate black exceptionalism. Future studies using updated surveys will undoubtedly blink to this book.         "
"5","In any case, as the United States continues to diversify, the salience of ethnicity will only grow. Therefore, discussions about what it means for natives as well as for immigrants to be American will not disappear. Yet the persistent nativist fear of black exceptionalism traveling across new immigrant groups is unjustified based on this book. For this reason, American Identity and the Politics of Multiculturalism is a must‐read.         "
