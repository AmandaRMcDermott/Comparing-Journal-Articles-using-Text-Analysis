"1","Grand theories of the First Amendment suffer from problems of exclusion and inclusion. The broad principles that justify excluding some human activity from constitutional protection inevitably bleed in ways that support excluding activity that virtually all people think is covered by the First Amendment. The broad principles that justify granting First Amendment protection to activities inevitably bleed in ways that support granting protection to human activities that hardly anyone thinks merit special constitutional protection. The Adversary First Amendment: Free Expression and the Foundations of American Democracy effectively highlights how many standard justifications for excluding commercial advertising from constitutional protection threaten to undermine constitutional protection for consensual core speech rights. Martin Redish less successfully demonstrates that his adversarial theory of democracy would not entail constitutional protection for a wide variety of activity that government may consensually regulate.         "
"2","Redish maintains that constitutional protection for free speech should be yoked to an adversarial theory of democracy. Adversarialists perceive no common good that human societies may strive for. Democracy is valuable “for the autonomy it provides the individual in this setting of conflict” (p. 6). Rather than treat speech as a means for achieving truth, The Adversary First Amendment maintains that the constitution should be “construed to reach all speech that allows individuals to discover their personal needs, interests, and goals—in government and in society at large—and to advocate and vote accordingly” (p. 4). Why people speak has no bearing on First Amendment analysis. Self‐interested speech is a legitimate means of persuading others and contains information that other persons may find useful in forming their life plans.         "
"3","Much of the book, probably too much of the book, attacks what Redish describes as cooperative or collectivist theories of democracies. Such theories insist that we understand free speech in light of the common good. The problem with such approaches, The Adversary First Amendment points out, is that they both violate “the principle of epistemology humility” (p. 2) that is at the core of the democracy and draw unprincipled or illogical lines between speech that is constitutionally protected and speech that is not constitutionally protected. Those who would deny constitutional protection to commercial speech assume that they know in advance what is good for human beings, denying the value neutrality underlying the First Amendment. Moreover, no clear distinctions exist between commercial and core political speech. Politicians and entrepreneurs both have self‐interested reasons for speaking. If Consumer Reports has a constitutional right to declare that McDonald's hamburgers have a high fat content, why doesn't McDonald's have a right to say that their product tastes good?         "
"4","Offense is easier to play than defense in constitutional theory, which may explain why more pages of The Adversary First Amendment are devoted to critique than to constructively developing Redish's conception of democracy. While demonstrating that other theories violate value neutrality and assume consensus, Redish does not adequately take into account that his theory, indeed all theories of the First Amendment, may suffer the same fate. The central plank of adversary democracy, that “individuals possess a fundamental right to advance their own interests as they assess them” (p. 15), is as much a “truth or good” (p. 2) as claims that society ought to advance the one true religion or prefer the political to the commercial life. Moreover, if as Redish argues, we cannot trust administrative agencies to regulate commercial speech because they are subject to capture by regulated interests, why would we trust administrative agencies to regulate those interests in any way?         "
"5","The persons responsible for the Constitution of the United States believed that politics was a higher form of activity than hawking wares. Over the past 200 years, Americans have increasingly questioned whether sharp distinctions between politics and commerce are either intelligible or justified. Redish's work effectively highlights all the problems with distinctions that eighteenth‐century republicans and their contemporary champions once thought obvious. The attempt to obliterate those distinctions may remove far more issues from democratic control than merely the regulation of commercial advertizing."
