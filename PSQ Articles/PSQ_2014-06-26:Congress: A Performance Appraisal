"1","To say that Congress is unpopular in recent years would be an understatement. The public associates Congress with scandal and partisanship, and members do little to buttress institutional approval. Andrew Taylor uses these patterns of low institutional approval as the motivation to examine whether public dissatisfaction with Congress is justified. By providing “foundational aspirations” (p. 23) of what we ought to want from Congress, Taylor creates a number of concrete benchmarks that are then evaluated. Of the 37 benchmarks, he finds that Congress meets (or largely meets) 25 and only fails to meet 12. Thus, Congress is largely doing what it should do as a representative lawmaking institution."
"2","Although thought‐provoking and accessible to a wide range of audiences, this book has two limitations. The first is on the “so what?” question. If the public evaluates Congress on the basis of perceptions—either ignorant of the functions that it successfully meets or ambivalent about these benchmarks—of what consequence is it that Taylor's assessment shows optimism about congressional representation and legislative processes? Here, a growing body of research (for example, David Jones and Monika McDermott's Americans, Congress, and Democratic Responsiveness: Public Evaluations of Congress and Electoral Consequences) emphasizes the importance of institutional evaluations for members' own electoral fortunes and for the majority party as a whole. Although Taylor suggests that Congress does not deserve its low approval, it is not clear whether or how this should affect elected officials and their decision making.         "
"3","Second, although Taylor makes a concerted effort to provide each benchmark with a justification, some of these justifications are incomplete, relying on somewhat‐arbitrary thresholds (for example, 12 significant laws per Congress [p. 144]) or on state legislatures. For instance, Taylor suggests that since 51 percent of the population is female, as are 24 percent of state legislators, “a benchmark of 25 percent is certainly not unduly demanding” (p. 57) for female representation. But is this demanding enough? Likewise, the benchmarks for race are 9 percent African American and 3 percent Hispanic—numbers that align with state legislatures—rather than the percentages in the general population. Although even these low benchmarks are unmet for gender and race, in other cases, low benchmarks may mean that Congress meets a criterion that it would not otherwise meet.         "
"4","The reliance on state legislatures to develop federal benchmarks is problematic for three reasons. First, state legislatures may themselves be flawed. In the example above, there is no assessment of whether state legislatures are subject to the same biases that discourage women and minorities from running for office. Second, if state legislatures follow the federal government in their institutional organization, then it may not be surprising that Congress meets the benchmarks determined by patterns in state legislatures. For instance, if states are following Congress in the division of labor and issues, then it is no surprise that benchmarks for the appropriate number of committees (p. 115) are met. Third, for some metrics, the appropriate scope of activity for state and federal governments is different, something that is not sufficiently addressed. If states average 400 laws per term (p. 144), it is not clear why Congress should be held to a similar benchmark, given differences in the scope of policies under federal control."
"5","Despite these limitations, this is a thought‐provoking book for both political scientists and the general public. It challenges the reader to think critically about what it is that we want from our government and how to know when Congress does or does not meet those goals. Moreover, it could be used easily in a number of different courses on American politics, Congress, and representation."
