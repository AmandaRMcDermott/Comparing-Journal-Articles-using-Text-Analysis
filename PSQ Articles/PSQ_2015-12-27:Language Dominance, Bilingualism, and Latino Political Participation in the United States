"1","ALTHOUGH APPROXIMATELY TWO‐THIRDS OF the Latino electorate in the United States is Spanish speaking (bilingual or Spanish dominant),1 the independent impact of this demographic characteristic on voting and on participation in nonvoting campaign‐related activities has been ignored by analysts and political activists alike. The objective of this article is to contribute to filling this void. Specifically, the article theorizes that non‐English‐dominant Latinos (bilingual and Spanish dominant) have access to Spanish‐language media and social environments that make them more and differently informed about the U.S. political world than English‐dominant Latinos. We use multivariate analytic techniques to measure the independent impact of language competence and find that the results of our analysis largely support our initial predictions. That is, we show that bilinguals and Spanish‐dominant Latinos register and vote at rates equal to or higher than English‐dominant Latinos or monolinguals who have access to resources that the major models of electoral behavior find predict high levels of political involvement.2 We also find that bilinguals participate in nonelectoral campaign activities at rates comparable to English‐dominant Latinos.         "
"2","This article begins by situating the role of language abilities in the struggle for Latino political access historically and briefly discussing existing scholarship on the effect of language proficiency on political participation. Next, we characterize the Latino electorate in terms of language proficiency (that is, English dominant, bilingual, and Spanish dominant) and propose hypotheses about the independent impact of language proficiency on political participation outcomes (registration, voting, and nonelectoral campaign‐related activities). We then introduce the data and propose an operational measure of language proficiency that encompasses not only English and Spanish dominants but also functional bilinguals. Next, we present a statistical portrait of the three language proficiency groups and analyze how political participation outcomes vary by language proficiency grouping. Finally, we present the results of several multivariate models that analyze the independent impact of language proficiency on political participation outcomes (as well as the differential impact of encouragement to register to vote and get out to vote on political participation outcomes conditional on language proficiency) before reaching our conclusion."
"3","An analysis of the impact of language on Latino political behavior is central to understanding Latino political involvement because the Latino struggle for political access has evolved around language. The intense and widespread discrimination that Mexican Americans experienced historically was justified on the basis of their English illiteracy rather than any racial distinction. To the contrary, the fact that any Mexican who remained in the United States for one year after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848 became an American citizen, a status available only to whites, suggests that the distinction did not matter for citizenship. The Mexican‐origin population was, however unintentionally, legally classified as white. Therefore, although Latinos also suffered racially motivated discrimination, denying them access to the vote was legitimated based on their inability to read, write, and speak English."
"4","Puerto Ricans, who became U.S. citizens in 1917, were similarly rebuffed when they sought electoral access in New York State because they were Spanish monolinguals or dominants. This changed in 1966, when a Puerto Rican successfully sued to eliminate New York's English‐language literacy requirement, arguing that the New York law was unconstitutional. Although that decision (Cardona v. Power, 384 U.S. 672 [1966]) directly affected only New York State, it set the stage for the creation of protections for “language minorities” when the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 was renewed.         "
"5","Eliminating language barriers became a major goal of Latino civil rights groups when the VRA was amended and extended in 1975. Conceptually, it was unclear how to classify Latinos so that the law could apply to them. The U.S. Census did not classify Latinos as a single “race” because they are a racially and ethnically heterogeneous group linked primarily by their Spanish language. The discrimination they historically experienced combined biases against their color, as many are dark skinned and look Native American or black; against their language, which mainstream society denigrated rather than respected, as it did French or German; and against their lack of human capital and their low educational attainment, which relegated them to low‐status jobs and segregated ethnic neighborhoods lacking in municipal services and serviced by inadequate schools. The combined effects of these factors explain why white America considered Latinos inferior and undeserving of all the rights and privileges of citizenship."
"6","By 1975, Latino civil rights organizations were strong enough to insist that Latinos, too, were victims of electoral discrimination and therefore should be included under the amended VRA. This required the creation of a category that would legitimize conceptualizing Latinos as a discriminated group. This conceptualization was rooted in the one factor that defined their commonality and that had been used to deny them full access to American institutions: their alleged reliance on Spanish."
"7","The inclusion of the language assistance provisions of Section 203 to protect language minorities in the 1975 VRA renewal created the opportunity to eliminate the historical language barriers3 that had denied electoral access to Latinos, Asian Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Americans. As of 2002, 84 percent of 206 jurisdictions in 30 states, including all of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, were required to offer voters Spanish‐language assistance, including ballots and access to translators. Thus, even though the polity had used Spanish as a barrier to limit Latino electoral involvement for more than a century, after 1975, Spanish became the principal tool available to government to incorporate Latinos into the electoral system, which had long been the goal of Latino leaders.4 The great majority of the covered jurisdictions not only fully complied with the requirements of Section 203 but did so very well.5          "
"8","These requirements have had significant indirect and direct impacts. The indirect effects can be seen in Latino post‐VRA electoral gains. From 1973 to 2003, the number of Latino elected officials increased 223 percent (from 1,280 to 4,130) in Arizona, California, Florida, New Mexico, New York, and Texas, the states with the largest Latino populations. Nationally, their numbers increased 47.8 percent between 1984 and 2003.6 The 2011 Directory of Latino Elected Officials reported that there were 5,850 Latino elected officials in all levels of jurisdictions. This indicates that the number of Latino elected officials increased 357 percent between 1973 and 2011.7 Jason Casellas reports that the great majority of these officials were elected from VRA‐mandated majority‐minority districts.8          "
"9","The VRA requirements have also had a direct impact on Latino electoral involvement. Nationally, turnout among citizens who speak only Spanish increases by 6.8 percentage points when this segment of the population increases from 4.99 percent to 5.01 percent. Turnout among Spanish‐dominant citizens living in VRA‐covered jurisdictions is 11 percentage points higher than in noncovered jurisdictions.9 Increased turnout is even more evident in the results of California's ballot measure calling for restricting bilingual education in public schools.10 In combination, although the national and state‐level results show that the bilingual provisions do not affect Latinos as a whole, they have substantially affected turnout among their principal target group, that is, Spanish‐dominant Latinos.         "
"10","Although it is clear that the VRA's requirements regarding language assistance positively affected turnout among Spanish‐dominant Latinos, we know little about the effects that language abilities have on registration, turnout, and nonvoting campaign‐related activity. That is, what effect does language ability have on electoral and nonvoting campaign‐related behavior?"
"11","The focus of this article is the effect of language proficiency among Latinos on three political participation outcomes: being registered to vote, voting in a presidential election, and participating in nonvoting campaign‐related activities. We limit our analysis to U.S. citizens in analyzing turnout and registration. Previous studies seeking to explain Latino electoral participation have focused on the conventional predictors of political participation (socioeconomic status, age, encouragement to participate, partisanship), as well as factors such as generational status,11 religion,12 nationality,13 ethnicity,14 the effects of coethnic candidates on mobilizing Latinos,15 and the effect of mobilizing strategies targeting Latinos.16 Taken as a whole, this literature has been about explaining low Latino turnout and finding ways to change that pattern.17 Thus, it is puzzling that linguistic competence, perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of the Latino population, has received so little attention.         "
"12","With notable exceptions, most studies use language measures as an indicator of the extent to which immigrants have incorporated the values, beliefs, and behaviors of the host society.18 A recent study by Marissa Abrajano used as its measure of incorporation a dummy variable denoting whether the interview was conducted in Spanish or English and found significant differences between the turnout rates of English‐ and Spanish‐dominant Latinos.19 Wayne Santoro and Gary Segura also used this measure of language proficiency in their study of turnout in the 1996 election and found a significant “language” effect, even accounting for generational status (their key measure of assimilation).20 We note, however, that for both Abrajano and Santoro and Segura, their chosen language proficiency measure does not allow a separate category of “bilingual” by virtue of the dichotomous categorization of “English‐dominant” and “Spanish‐dominant.” Using 2006 Latino National Survey data, Daniel Hopkins included a one‐ to four‐point scale that asked respondents “How good is your spoken English?” in his turnout model for the 2004 election.21 In all three cases, the authors found that English‐language dominance (as measured by choosing to be interviewed in English or self‐reported proficiency in English speaking) predicted a higher likelihood of voting, holding all else constant.         "
"13","Louis DeSipio's work is the principal exception to this pattern. He reports that home language has no effect on voting among registered Latinos.22 We suggest, however, that new developments challenge DeSipio's argument. For example, the combined effect of increases in the number of Latinos, from 22.4 million in 199023 to 50.5 million by 2010;24 the great increase in Spanish‐language radio stations; and the institutionalization of Spanish‐language television networks across the nation, including in states that historically had only small Latino communities, provides Latino leaders with instruments for Spanish‐language get out the vote campaigns among Latino nonvoters.25 The role that Latino disc jockeys played in the immigrant marches of 2006 and that Jorge Ramos of Univision is currently playing has become so influential regarding immigration reform that Ramos has been described as “the voice of the Latino constituency.” “Republicans have to worry—you don't want to lose Jorge Ramos.”26 Thus, in today's political environment, the home language of Latinos is central to mobilizing many Latinos who never used to vote.         "
"14","The Latino electorate is composed of three groups that live in three distinct linguistic environments. These contexts vary in terms of the language proficiency of the groups within each environment. Additionally, other factors, such as the socioeconomic status (SES) of the groups that live within the environments, vary as well. The combined impact of these factors has a direct bearing on registration, voting, and participation in nonvoting political activities."
"15","The world of Spanish‐dominant Latinos suggests that they are the least engaged in electoral politics. This is because, as working‐class immigrants and low‐SES native‐born citizens, they “cluster” in homogeneous ethnic neighborhoods that help preserve mother‐tongue Spanish domination among adults. Their children are likely to be limited bilinguals because they are insufficiently exposed to English.27 Over time, most Spanish monolinguals become bilinguals. However, continued immigration replenishes monolinguals, so that, depending on immigration rates, the number of monolinguals may even increase faster than the movement of monolinguals into the bilingual category.            "
"16","Because Spanish‐dominant Latinos are concentrated in barrios where Spanish is likely the dominant social and commercial language, their social interactions with mainstream society are the exception rather than the rule, and thus they are relatively unsocialized into the electoral and political mainstream. As Spanish monolingual immigrants continue to flow into these barrios, they replace those who move out, leaving the overall composition of these barrios, and the social interactions and media experiences of barrio residents, largely unchanged. As immigrants learn English, become more socialized into mainstream norms, and improve their human capital, they enter the middle class."
"17","Spanish‐dominant Latinos learn about the political world through conversations with immigrants and Spanish‐speaking natives (bilinguals) and through Spanish‐language media, such as CNN en Español and other media platforms, as was evident in Spanish‐language radio broadcasts of disc jockeys on Mexican radio in Los Angeles who were the key to mobilizing turnout for the immigrant demonstrations of 2006.28 Thanks to technological advances, Spanish television news and commentary are now available across the nation through Univision (the fifth‐largest television network behind NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox), Telemundo, UniMás (which targets younger Latinos), and Azteca América, the American version of Mexico's Azteca. According to Joshua Kun, a communications professor at the University of Southern California, “Spanish‐language TV news shows, such as that of KMEX in Los Angeles, outscore their English‐language rivals, not just in ratings but in scope and depth. There's no comparison in the coverage…for people here [Los Angeles], there are two places to look for better news: BBC News and Spanish language news.”29             "
"18","When Spanish‐dominant Latinos engage with the electoral system, their involvement differs from that of bilinguals and English‐dominants; the difference with respect to the latter is especially noteworthy. The great majority of Spanish‐dominant Latinos live in ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods for reasons that include economics, a preference for living among coethnics, and concerns about discrimination.30 To the extent that they exist, studies of electoral life in cities across the nation have shown that barrio politics is dominated by Democrats, with Republicans seldom present.31 Local officials as well as state and federal legislators who represent these districts are virtually all Democrats. With the noteworthy exception of Cuban‐origin communities in Florida,32 the experience of Spanish‐dominant Latinos has been shaped by a long history of Democratic dominance and Republican hostilities such as the anti‐farmworker policies of Governor Jack Williams of Arizona (1967–1974), California's Proposition 187 in 1994, and the current anti‐immigrant policies and rhetoric of Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Governor Jan Brewer of Arizona, former congressman Tom Tancredo of Colorado, and Republican state officials across the South.            "
"19","In contrast to Spanish‐dominant Latinos, bilinguals, who tend to be of the second or third generation, live and work in more heterogeneous environments. Although they continue to experience segregation, they are much less segregated from whites than the foreign born.33 They live in integrated neighborhoods and use Spanish and English to manage their daily lives. Edward Telles and Vilma Ortiz report that nearly all Mexican Americans are English proficient by the second generation but maintain Spanish into the fourth generation.34 According to a recent Pew Research Center study, the gain in English proficiency reflects the rising share of U.S.‐born Latinos who say that they speak English “very well” even though they live in households where Spanish (or another non‐English language) is spoken. In 2013, almost half (49 percent) of U.S.‐born Latinos, compared with 40 percent in 1980, indicated that they lived in bilingual households. Thus, although the proportion of English‐proficient Latinos is growing, the proportion of Latinos who speak Spanish at home has remained at 73 percent to 78 percent since 1980.35 In 2013, a record 35.8 million Hispanics spoke Spanish at home, a number that has increased as the nation's Hispanic population has grown. Together, these figures indicate that Spanish speakers, including both a small Spanish‐dominant segment and the numerically overwhelming bilinguals, will dominate the Latino electorate.            "
"20","Although they probably use both languages at home, bilinguals are much more likely to live their lives using English. Because they are more involved with mainstream society, work and political conversations will likely be conducted in English. Indeed, bilinguals, who are more fluent in English than in Spanish, are much more likely to use English when they engage in elections and with institutions such as school boards and law enforcement agencies. For example, Rodolfo de la Garza interviewed Latino elected and appointed political elites and organizational leaders regarding their political careers and policy perspectives.36 Regardless of the setting and topic being discussed, congressmen and women, state‐level representatives, and senators, as well as high‐level members of local, state, and national bureaucracies and organizations across the nation followed the same pattern: the interviews began in English, but the respondents quickly switched to Spanish to identify themselves and describe their positions. When de la Garza responded in Spanish, they switched back to English to describe the core issues involving their work and careers, candidates, campaigns, and governmental performance. Spanish, in short, was used to establish a relationship, but English was the language most used to explain their work. It is noteworthy that this is the same pattern that Telles and Ortiz describe three decades after the interviews conducted by de la Garza.37             "
"21","However, bilinguals also exchange information with Spanish monolinguals, especially when the latter have questions about government services and specific problems such as immigration. Additionally, in cities such as New York, San Antonio, and Los Angeles and in small towns, many of which have a history of Spanish newspapers as well as radio and television networks (which are available in virtually every city across the nation), non‐English‐dominant Spanish speakers have access to more and different information38 that is not always available to English‐dominant Latinos but may be especially relevant to them, such as Latin American affairs and issues such as immigration, anti‐Latino discrimination, and labor rights.39 According to a recent Pew Research Center study on news media use among Latinos, 70 percent of Latinos agree that Spanish‐language news media does an excellent or good job of covering news specifically relevant to Hispanics, while just 59 percent say the same about the English‐language news media.40 Thus, bilinguals and the Spanish dominant have access to a broader range of information than English‐dominant Latinos.41 This especially benefits bilinguals, but it also benefits Spanish dominants by providing information they would not have otherwise received while living in the United States. Moreover, because it is presented to them within a different frame than that which characterizes the major English news outlets, bilinguals (and the Spanish dominant) may develop different views and preferences than comparably situated English‐dominant Latino citizens.            "
"22","Latino citizens who are English monolinguals or English dominant live in a social world that is more similar to that of comparably situated non‐Hispanic whites than that of bilinguals and Spanish‐dominant Latinos. Their neighborhoods include a mix of non‐Hispanic whites and Latinos, and Spanish is seldom heard or used in daily venues.42 The content and framing of the issues that engage them are unlikely to differ significantly from those that inform Anglo‐Americans. Their political environment is more likely to be open to either political party, which is why both Democrats and Republicans reach out to recruit and mobilize the Latino residents of these neighborhoods.            "
"23","Lionel Sosa, the Republican Party's longtime director of Hispanic polling, designed Republican Latino outreach based on these images of Latinos. He targeted Latinos who tend to be of higher income and/or better educated because they are the most likely to be Republicans. He described them as English dominant or as preferring English even if they are bilinguals because they have been educated in the United States and may speak Spanish but do not read it. He designed campaigns to deliver culturally relevant messages in English. He estimated that Latinos who use Spanish make up 80 percent of the Latino population. However, this group also consists of the undocumented, legal noncitizen residents, and citizens who do not vote. Given this, Sosa concluded that using his budget on Spanish‐language ads would be unlikely to generate votes. Moreover, his campaigns focused on specific markets. He saw no reason to run Spanish or English ads targeting Latinos in California or New York because Republicans could not win those states. They could win Florida, however, but only if they ran Spanish ads. Florida, in his estimation, could not be won without Spanish ads.43             "
"24","English‐dominant Latino citizens, almost all of whom are second or third generation, are less likely to be involved with ethnic issues such as immigration than first‐generation immigrants.44 Therefore, they are more likely to view such issues from a mainstream perspective, (that is, to support immigration reform while opposing undocumented migration because of its perceived economic and social costs).            "
"25","Given the variation in the sociopolitical and linguistic contexts in which Latinos lead their daily lives, we begin our analysis by considering the relationship between language ability and political participation. We take it as a given that bilinguals are more likely to receive more and different information than those who primarily or exclusively use Spanish or English because they get information from both English‐ and Spanish‐language social networks and media, which provide different emphases on potentially salient issues of the day.45 We recognize that although bilinguals have more information available to them, they may not fully avail themselves of it. Given this assumption, we hypothesize, the following:            "
"26","Conventional accounts of the key role of voter resources in driving political participation46 predict that English‐dominant Latino citizens are the most politically incorporated and would be expected to vote and participate more than bilinguals and Spanish‐dominant Latinos. Contrary to these conventional expectations, we hypothesize that bilinguals have higher levels of political participation because of the social and linguistic environment in which they live their daily lives.         "
"27","Our theory is that Latinos who retain key traditional cultural characteristics even as they incorporate into the American mainstream are more politically engaged than those who do not incorporate into the mainstream and those who incorporate but do not retain their country of origin cultural characteristics, such as the Spanish language. This differs significantly from segmented assimilation theory,47 which argues that the retention of traditional cultural characteristics impedes immigrant incorporation.48 Our theory holds that although bilinguals have lower social capital than English‐dominant Latinos, who are more incorporated into mainstream society, their exposure to information in Spanish, which comes from Spanish‐language media as well as their social environment, has the potential to create and mobilize a distinct electorate.49          "
"28","We emphasize that it is language proficiency, not the consumption of English‐ and/or Spanish‐language media, that is at the core of the theory motivating this research. Simply put, if one does not have proficiency in Spanish, interactions with Spanish‐language media do not matter. The existence of a Spanish‐speaking audience precedes the existence of a Spanish‐language media. The social environment (neighborhoods, friends, jobs, churches, civic associations) in which Spanish speakers (both Spanish‐dominant Latinos and bilinguals) live their daily lives provides information continuously in both English and Spanish. These daily interactions and discussions are the channels through which Spanish speakers exchange information and voice their opinions on issues that are particularly relevant to them but receive less and distinct coverage than what the major English‐language media transmit. Continuous access to information from both English‐ and Spanish‐language media indirectly influences Spanish‐speaking Latinos through its impact on the social interactions that make up their daily lives. Although measuring this impact is extremely difficult and beyond our ability in this article, we acknowledge that this effect could be substantial."
"29","We use the 2008 Post‐Election National Survey of Latinos conducted by the Pew Research Center, which interviewed 1,540 Latino adult citizens residing in the United States during November 11–30, 2008.50 This landline telephone survey was conducted in both English and Spanish.51 The data set reports Latino registration and voting in the 2008 election and nonvoting campaign‐related activity, a rich set of control variables, and questions that allow us to construct an operational measure of language proficiency that includes English and Spanish dominants as well as bilinguals.52          "
"30","We use logistic regression to model both registration (currently registered to vote in their precinct at the time of survey) and turnout (voted in the 2008 presidential election) among citizen respondents given the dichotomous nature of both dependent variables. In our model of nonvoting campaign‐related activity, which is a scale ranging from 0 (performed none of the following activities: making contributions to a candidate running for office, working for a political candidate, attending a campaign event, using the Internet to find information about a political candidate, trying to persuade someone else to vote for or against a particular candidate, and showing public support for a political campaign) to 6 (performed all of the activities; see Appendix A for full question wording and details on this scale), we estimate both ordered logit and ordinary least squares (OLS) models for the full sample, as citizenship is not a prerequisite for these nonvoting activities. We present the results from the OLS model, as the substantive results are quite similar and more straightforward to interpret."
"31","In addition to language proficiency, we control for four sets of variables in our models of Latino political participation in the 2008 election cycle: ethnic‐specific questions, attitudes toward and experiences with economic conditions, social and demographic questions, and political questions. In terms of ethnic‐specific questions, we include national origin and percentage of life lived in the United States (both linear and quadratic terms).53 In terms of social and demographic questions, we include employment status, home ownership, marital status, age, education, income, religious affiliation, frequency of religious attendance, and gender. In terms of political questions, we include partisanship and whether the respondent had been encouraged to register to vote or get out to vote. Additionally, in our nonvoting campaign‐related activity model, we include a measure of perceptions of personal financial situation. Basic summary statistics and question wording for these variables are located in Appendix A.         "
"32","Our principal independent variable—language proficiency—is based on a battery of four questions asking respondents to rate how well they speak and read in both Spanish and English54 on two four‐point scales, one for Spanish and one for English.55 Assigning equal weight to speaking and reading proficiency in Spanish, we then combined the two questions into a Spanish‐language proficiency scale, which ranges from 0 (speak Spanish “not at all” and read Spanish “not at all”) to 6 (speak Spanish “very well” and read Spanish “very well”.56 The same was done to create an English‐language proficiency scale.)57          "
"33","With each respondent self‐rated in terms of both Spanish‐ and English‐language proficiency, we partitioned the sample into “English dominants,” “Spanish dominants,” and “bilinguals.” To do so, it is necessary to examine language competence in Spanish and English jointly.58 Appendix A1 describes the theory and procedures we used to examine the joint distribution of Spanish‐ and English‐language proficiency to obtain our final three‐category operational measure of language proficiency.         "
"34","Ultimately, we used the weighted sample to create a three‐category language proficiency measure that consists of functional bilinguals, that is, those who have more than a minimum competency in both languages (40.4 percent); English dominants (23.3 percent); and Spanish dominants (36.3 percent). We feel confident that this measure of language proficiency is an improvement over previous operationalizations that were unable to account for the joint proficiency in both English and Spanish (and thus were unable to identify a separate category of “functional bilinguals”).         "
"35","Because we theorize that bilinguals receive both more and different types of information compared with monolinguals by way of their daily social interactions and access to information in both English and Spanish, we next assess whether bilinguals are indeed receiving information from both English‐ and Spanish‐language media. In particular, we are interested in whether bilinguals are receiving messages in different languages compared with English dominants. Toward this end, we constructed a measure of “language of news media usage” from two sets of questions contained in the Pew data."
"36","Respondents were asked where they received “most of their news about the presidential campaign” from a list of five media sources that included television, newspapers, radio, magazines, and the Internet.59 They were probed for two choices from the five presented. After indicating their favored media sources, respondents were then asked whether they received election news in English, Spanish, or both.60 Respondents had between one and three election news sources and the language of sources coded (although most chose two sources, as directed). For each respondent, then, the language of news media usage was categorized as follows: all English (received election news only in English),61 both English and Spanish (received election news in both English and Spanish),62 or all Spanish (received election news only in Spanish).63 The measure of language of news media usage results in a distribution in which 34.8 percent of respondents in the weighted sample received their election news only in English, 47.9 percent received their election news in both languages, and 17.3 percent used Spanish‐language news media exclusively.         "
"37","We must emphasize that this variable does not measure how much or how frequently respondents reported reading or watching election news in English‐ and/or Spanish‐language media. This would allow us, for example, to distinguish between Spanish dominants who use “both English and Spanish” news media at relatively low levels and bilinguals who use “both English and Spanish” at relatively higher levels. What we are measuring is whether respondents, when asked about the two media sources from which they received most of their news about the presidential campaign, reported receiving their news in English, Spanish, or both languages.64 Because our data set does not include a variable that measures the amount or frequency with which respondents accessed election news, we are unable to measure the degree or level of news media exposure, the most commonly used measure to test for media exposure effects on political outcomes such as vote choice and candidate support,65 current news reception and recall,66 perceptions and opinions on politics,67 voting,68 and nonvoting campaign activities.69 As Markus Prior has pointed out, however, surveys that rely on self‐reported media exposure cannot be depended on to accurately measure the amount or frequency with which respondents actually access news media.70 Our data set also does not include a measure of political knowledge, which goes beyond exposure to news media and measures reception of the news.71 Therefore, we are unable to test directly for a conventional news media exposure effect on political participation outcomes. However, we do consider whether the impact of language proficiency on political participation outcomes can be attributed to differences in language of news media usage.         "
"38","We next compare the distribution of language of news media usage across language proficiency categories (see Table 1). The vast majority of English dominants (72 percent) received their election news in English only, while 26 percent received their news in both English and Spanish.72 Among Spanish dominants, 41 percent received their election news only in Spanish, while a majority (57 percent) received their news in both Spanish and English, which is not surprising given that our measure of language of news media sources asked respondents only where they received their “news about the (U.S.) presidential campaign.” Of particular interest is the proportion of Latinos who have and use their access to more and distinct information. A majority (52 percent) of bilinguals received their election news in both English and Spanish,73 while only 43 percent received their news exclusively in English. However, 26 percent of English dominants received their election news in both English and Spanish. Combined with the 57 percent of Spanish dominants who received election news in a bilingual format, it is clear that the great majority of Latinos have and make use of access to more and distinct information than English dominants and monolingual Latinos, who have been presumed to be the most informed about American politics.74          "
"39","The first question we ask is whether the bilingual and Spanish‐dominant citizenry is sufficiently large to be politically significant. Together, they totaled approximately 77 percent of the Latino electorate in 2008 according to our data. Not only are the bilingual and Spanish‐dominant sectors numerous enough to influence the overall Latino vote, which has become a key factor in national and state‐level elections,75 but also these sectors continue to grow and now dominate the Latino electorate.76          "
"40","We now briefly describe key differences among the three language proficiency groups in terms of the control variables used in our multivariate models and their effects on political behavior (see Appendix B). While citizenship levels are very high among both English dominants (98 percent) and bilinguals (83 percent), just 30 percent of Spanish dominants are citizens. Not surprisingly, while the mean percentage of life lived in the United States among English dominants and bilinguals is 99 percent and 75 percent, respectively, Spanish dominants have, on average, lived in the United States for far less time (38 percent). In terms of SES, it is noteworthy that while English dominants score higher in terms of average income and home ownership compared to bilinguals, bilinguals are more likely to be employed full time, and they are similar to English dominants in terms of education and perceptions of personal finances. By comparison, Spanish dominants score substantially lower compared to both groups in terms of income and home ownership; they are more likely to be unemployed, have dramatically lower levels of education, and are somewhat more likely to perceive their finances as worse than one year earlier. We also find that Spanish dominants are doubly politically disadvantaged because they possess fewer of the resources that are key predictors of political participation and because they have dramatically lower rates of being encouraged to “register to vote or get out to vote.” Less than one‐quarter reported being encouraged to participate compared with 55 percent of English dominants and 43 percent of bilinguals."
"41","We also find important differences in terms of partisanship and religion. Interestingly, Democratic partisanship is highest among bilinguals (53 percent), while the rate of Republican partisanship is highest among English dominants (18 percent). Among the least incorporated group, Spanish dominants are twice as likely (30 percent) to identify as “other” than both English dominants and bilinguals."
"42","Whereas clear majorities of both Spanish dominants (73 percent) and bilinguals (61 percent) are Catholic, just 39 percent of English dominants are Catholic. Similarly, frequency of religious attendance is higher among Spanish dominants and bilinguals compared with English dominants. In short, on our two measures of religion, bilinguals resemble Spanish dominants more than they do English dominants. This is particularly noteworthy given how closely bilinguals resemble English dominants on our SES measures.77          "
"43","Our analytical focus, however, is the relationship between language abilities and electoral involvement.78 We begin by examining the bivariate association between our language proficiency measure and our chosen outcomes of interest: registration, voting, and nonvoting campaign‐related activity. It is important to note, however, that the data describing respondents' political behavior is self‐reported and may overstate the socially desirable response.79 Also, these bivariate results are only a preliminary step in investigating the relationship between language proficiency and political participation among Latinos.         "
"44","Turning to registration for the 2008 election (see Table 2), as predicted, self‐reported registration among bilinguals (85 percent) is higher than for English dominants (80 percent) and Spanish dominants (70 percent) in the citizen‐only sample. Voting in the 2008 election follows the same pattern (see Table 3). Self‐reported turnout among bilinguals (83 percent) is higher than for English dominants (74 percent) and Spanish dominants (67 percent) in the citizen‐only sample.         "
"45","These results are striking in that they are contrary to conventional expectations, which predict that the most incorporated citizens—that is, English dominants—are most likely to be electorally involved. While we recognize that bilinguals are quite similar to English dominants in terms of several key SES measures (see Appendix B), the dual linguistic world of bilinguals is quite different from that of English dominants because bilinguals are likely to receive more and different political information through their exposure to both English‐ and Spanish‐language media and the social environments in which they live their daily lives. We theorize that exposure to Spanish‐language media (in addition to dominant English‐language media) and continuous social interactions and discussions in both English and Spanish affect citizens' perspectives on elections, and thus we expect bilinguals to register and vote at higher levels than English dominants, who, in terms of SES and level of political incorporation, are the most similar to the Anglo‐American electorate. However, this increased information might not affect the electoral behavior of Spanish monolinguals because their human capital and social environments are so different from those of bilinguals and English dominants that even increased information may not increase their political involvement."
"46","Finally, we examine differences among language groups in terms of our scale of nonvoting campaign‐related activity for the entire sample of respondents.80 Not surprisingly, Spanish dominants score substantially lower on the 0–6 scale (0.40 point on average) relative to English dominants (mean of 1.48 points) and bilinguals (mean of 1.38 points; see Table 4). These results are in line with our expectations: each of the six political activities requires more time, energy, and other resources compared with being registered to vote and voting. Therefore, it is not surprising that Spanish dominants are the least engaged in these activities given their lower average SES and their lower level of incorporation into the political mainstream. What is surprising, however, is that while the average score is highest for English dominants (1.48 points), a bivariate regression analysis (see Table 8) indicates that there is no significant difference between English dominants and bilinguals. This finding does not support our hypothesis, which states that because of their greater resources and level of incorporation into the mainstream, English dominants will have the highest average levels of nonvoting campaign‐related activity.         "
"47","To determine the impact of language proficiency on political behaviors after accounting for the control variables described previously, we now turn to our multivariate analyses. Note that the sample is limited to citizens in our registration and turnout models. Spanish‐dominant citizens, then, will consist almost entirely of naturalized citizens. Except for highly politicized situations,81 naturalized citizens are less likely to register and to vote than native‐born citizens, net of other factors.82 In this sense, we posit that Spanish dominants will be less involved in electoral activities.         "
"48","For the registration and turnout models, we present results from binary logistic regression, and for the scale of nonvoting campaign‐related activity, we present OLS results (see Appendix C for the full results from our three multivariate models). We begin by noting that the control variables for both the registration and turnout models are identical. However, the control variables used for the scale of nonvoting campaign‐related activity differ in two respects: first, the percentage of life lived in the United States is entered linearly (as opposed to both linearly and as a quadratic term in the registration and turnout models);83 second, this model includes a measure of perception of personal finances compared to one year earlier.84          "
"49","We again note that we are unable to control for political knowledge or the frequency or amount of news media exposure, but we are able to control for the language of news media usage. This would be important to consider if receiving election news from Spanish‐language media motivates bilinguals or Spanish dominants to participate in politics. Our theory, again, assumes that the English‐ and Spanish‐language news media provide different kinds of information. If Latinos watch only English news media, they will receive different information than they receive from Spanish media. All three multivariate models (see Appendix C for full results) control for the conventional variables related to political participation as well as variables that are especially relevant to the focus of this article, such as the percentage of life lived in the United States and in the country of origin.         "
"50","We also tested for an association between language of news media usage and political participation outcomes by running separate multivariate analyses that also controlled for language of news media usage.85 We find that language of news media usage has no independent effect on any of the political participation outcomes in this multivariate setting, while language proficiency does in terms of voting and nonvoting campaign‐related activities. Additionally, we find that the logit coefficient estimates on our language proficiency dummies remain remarkably consistent after the inclusion of the language of news media usage dummies. These separate analyses suggest that the impact of language proficiency on political behaviors is not attributable to the relationship between language abilities and language of news media usage. The results are shown in Appendix D.         "
"51","When the language dummies for English and Spanish dominants are the only predictors of registration (using bilinguals as the base category), the predicted probability of being registered to vote for English dominants is 5.3 percentage points lower than that of bilinguals (with a logit coefficient that is significant at the .10 level) and 15.6 percentage points lower for Spanish dominants than for bilinguals (see Table 5). This bivariate finding is consistent with Hypothesis 1, which stated that bilinguals will have the highest registration rates. However, when we control for variables such as SES, age, percentage of life lived in the United States, partisanship, and encouragement to participate in politics (see Table 5), we find that the likelihood of being registered to vote for both English and Spanish dominants is not significantly different from that of bilinguals (see Appendix C for full results, including all control variables).            "
"52","While our multivariate results show that, contrary to the dominant theoretical explanations of electoral behavior, English dominants are no more likely to be registered to vote than bilinguals, we do not find evidence here to support our hypothesis that it is bilinguals who will have the highest rates of registration. These results also indicate that the lower‐SES Spanish‐dominant Latinos, who are also characterized by low levels of encouragement and partisanship, are as likely as bilingual Latinos to register as the higher‐SES English‐dominant Latinos, who have higher levels of encouragement and partisanship. This is a completely unexpected result that strongly supports our core proposition and contradicts the prevailing explanation offered by such scholars as Sidney Verba, Kay Lehman Schlozman, and Henry Brady and Steven J. Rosenstone and John Mark Hansen."
"53","Comparing the bivariate results to the multivariate results in the voting model follows a similar pattern: when the language dummies are the only predictors of turnout, the bivariate results support our hypothesis that it is bilinguals who are most likely to vote. The predicted probability of voting for English dominants is 9.3 percentage points lower than the predicted probability of voting among bilinguals and is 17.1 percentage points lower for Spanish dominants (see Table 6). As in the case of registering to vote, both English‐dominant and Spanish‐dominant citizens are less likely to vote compared to bilinguals in a bivariate setting. This bivariate result for the Spanish‐dominant estimate is not surprising given that this group is systematically lower in terms of SES, level of incorporation, partisanship, and being encouraged to register and vote compared to bilinguals. Once these differences are controlled for, however (see Table 6), we find that the likelihood of voting is not significantly different when comparing similarly situated Spanish dominants with bilinguals (see Appendix C for full results, including all control variables).            "
"54","Interestingly, and consistent with our hypothesis, however, our multivariate results indicate that English dominants remain significantly (at the .10 level) less likely than bilinguals to report voting in the 2008 election after accounting for differences in our control variables. Holding all control variables at their mean values, the predicted probability of voting for English dominants is 5.3 percentage points lower than that of bilinguals. This result supports our hypothesis that bilinguals will vote at higher levels than the dominant models of political participation would predict.            "
"55","Thus, in our multivariate results, we find that, holding all else constant, bilinguals outperform English dominants in terms of voting, but they do not outperform similarly situated Spanish‐dominant citizens. In order to make sense of this result, we ran a set of interaction models for all three political participation outcomes. In these interaction models, we interacted each control variable with the English‐dominant and Spanish‐dominant dummies,86 allowing for differential effects of our control variables across the three language proficiency groups.87 We note that one key result of this analysis is the interaction between language proficiency and encouragement to register to vote and vote. Prior research has found that personal contact matters: respondents are significantly more likely to participate in politics if someone asks them to participate.88             "
"56","In the interaction model for turnout, we find that while encouragement to participate has no significant effect among bilinguals, the coefficients for English dominants and Spanish dominants are significantly larger (positive) than the coefficient for bilinguals (both at the .05 level). Holding all else at their mean values, the predicted probability of voting is 8.8 percentage points higher when encouraged (versus when not encouraged) among English dominants. Among Spanish dominants, however, the effect is even greater—the predicted probability of voting when encouraged is 21.6 percentage points higher when encouraged versus when not encouraged. The results of our interaction model for registration show a striking similarity: among bilinguals, there is no significant relationship between being encouraged to participate and being registered to vote. The coefficients for English dominants and Spanish dominants are significantly larger than the coefficient for bilinguals (both at the .10 level). Holding all else at their mean values, the predicted probability of being registered is 5.7 percentage points and 15.9 percentage points higher when encouraged (versus when not encouraged) among English dominants and Spanish dominants, respectively. The coefficient results on the interaction between encouragement to participate and language proficiency from the interaction models, as well as the results on encouragement to participate, from the separate models are shown in Table 7 for all three political participation outcomes.89             "
"57","The greater importance of being encouraged to participate among this least incorporated language proficiency group points to the importance of mobilizing that segment of the electorate that is most likely to be influenced by outreach and encouragement but least likely to be targeted: the Spanish dominant. As we noted in the introduction to this article, the VRA created conditions conducive to mobilizing the Spanish‐dominant electorate. Given that the language protections of the VRA are still in place even after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder,90 which struck down the pre‐clearance provisions in Section 4(b) of the VRA, the opportunity to use Spanish to mobilize this sector is still real and potentially very significant. This result may also help explain our finding that (in a multivariate context) bilinguals outperform English dominants but do not outperform Spanish dominants in terms of voting. While Spanish dominants are less likely compared to bilinguals to be encouraged to participate, the effect of being encouraged on those who are encouraged to participate is substantially greater compared to bilinguals (who, according to our interaction model results, show no significant effect whatsoever).            "
"58","In our model of nonvoting campaign‐related activity, we find that when the language proficiency dummies are the only predictors, there is no significant difference between English dominants and bilinguals. These results are consistent with our bivariate and multivariate findings in the registration and turnout models: English dominants do not outperform bilinguals in either model (and actually are outperformed by bilinguals in the multivariate turnout model at the .10 level). Hypothesis 2, which predicted that English dominants would have the highest average nonvoting campaign‐related activity, is therefore not supported in our bivariate analysis. We do, however, find that Spanish dominants have a lower predicted score on the 0–6 scale: on average, Spanish dominants score 0.986 point lower compared to bilinguals (.01 level) in a bivariate setting (see Table 8).            "
"59","Turning to our multivariate results (see Table 8), we find that even after controlling for all else, Spanish dominants score significantly lower (.01 level) on the 0–6 scale (.297 points lower, on average) compared to bilinguals. It is interesting to note that even once we equalize respondents in terms of our control variables, the Spanish dominant/bilingual difference remains (see Appendix C for full results, including all control variables).91 We surmise that this may be related to the types of political activities that are measured by this scale. Most of the six activities measured in this scale require a level of knowledge and resources not required in registering or voting. Lack of English proficiency is apparently an additional hindrance for Spanish dominants in terms of participating in nonvoting campaign‐related activity.            "
"60","The results of our interaction models (shown in Table 7) indicate that being encouraged to “register to vote or get out to vote” on registration and turnout has no significant effect on the likelihood of participating for bilinguals, a moderate positive effect for English dominants, and a very large positive impact among Spanish‐dominant citizens. The interaction model for nonvoting campaign‐related activity (see Table 7) produces different results. Among bilinguals, being encouraged to register to vote or get out to vote, holding all else constant, increases the predicted score on the scale of nonvoting campaign activity by 0.634 point (p < .01). Among Spanish dominants, being encouraged versus not being encouraged increases the predicted score by .254 point (p < .01), and the difference of –0.380 (p < .05) indicates that the effect of encouragement on Spanish dominants is significantly lower than the effect for bilinguals. The interaction model shows that there is no significant difference in the effect of encouragement for English dominants compared to bilinguals. In short, while being encouraged to register to vote or get out to vote has a significant positive impact on nonvoting campaign‐related activities for all language proficiency groups, the impact on Spanish‐dominant Latinos is smallest in magnitude.92 These results stand in sharp contrast to our finding that being encouraged to register to vote or get out to vote has by far the largest mobilizing impact on both registration and voting among Spanish‐dominant Latinos.            "
"61","It is not surprising that many of the control variables have a significant impact in our multivariate analyses. We note that the impact of our control variables is generally consistent with the dominant literature on political participation outcomes. For example, holding all else constant, being encouraged to participate, partisanship, being older, and being better educated increase the likelihood of participation. In both the registration and turnout models, we find a significant quadratic relationship between percentage of life lived in the United States and both participation outcomes. As the percentage of life lived in the United States increases, the likelihood of being registered and voting increases. However, for the most incorporated (that is, the native born and those who have lived in the United States the greatest proportion of their lives), predicted registration and turnout rates drop. This is of particular importance to Latinos because the Latino electorate includes so many naturalized citizens who vary greatly in how they have been socialized because of having lived in the United States for varying percentages of their lives."
"62","Interestingly, while there is no significant income premium in terms of being registered to vote or voting,93 we do find a significant effect in our nonvoting campaign‐related activity model. This is likely because of the higher costs in terms of knowledge and resources (compared to being registered to vote or voting) required to participate in the activities measured in this scale.            "
"63","The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the number of U.S. residents age five and older speaking a language other than English at home increased to 60.6 million in 2011 from 23 million in 1980, with Spanish speakers constituting 66 percent of these. This increase in Spanish‐speaking households will continue, albeit more slowly, into the foreseeable future. By 2030, because of natural population growth, immigration, continued or increased naturalization of immigrants, and the increased number of Latino youth who will celebrate their eighteenth birthday, the number of potential bilingual and Spanish‐dominant Latino voters is likely to expand the size of the Latino electorate so that by 2030, the number of eligible Spanish‐speaking Hispanic voters could increase from 23.7 million to close to 40 million.94          "
"64","While conventional accounts of Latino political behavior directly address the importance of resources in explaining Latino political behavior, they do not address the question of how the linguistic behavior of citizens affects their political behavior, as we have done. Instead, influenced by the pathbreaking work of Rosenstone and Hansen and Verba, Schlozman, and Brady, researchers have assumed that the most resource‐rich citizens have the highest participatory rates. “Resource rich” refers to standard SES variables as well as sociocultural access to mainstream America. According to this perspective, Latinos have the fewest of all types of resources, which may be why they turn out at approximately 10 percent lower rates than whites and African Americans. In other words, these major studies are, in effect, telling us that the nation's political practices affect bilingual and Spanish‐dominant citizens just as they impact the English dominant.         "
"65","Theoretically, however, we argue that the increase in Spanish‐dominant immigrants and the maintenance of Spanish by native‐born second‐, third‐, and fourth‐generation Latinos, as well as the growing pervasiveness of Spanish media, could have created conditions that altered the impact of the polity's institutions on the political behavior of non‐English‐dominant Latinos. We evaluate this theory by testing two hypotheses that measure the independent effect of language abilities on registering, voting, and nonvoting campaign‐related activity governed and influenced by the polity."
"66","As we predicted, Latinos who are bilingual or Spanish dominant register and vote at rates equal to or higher than those of English‐dominant Latinos. This development reflects the influence of the VRA, which created the category of linguistic minority. This category prevented state and local entities from creating linguistic impediments to voting, which promoted greater participation among non‐English‐dominant Latinos."
"67","These results suggest that Latinos could play an even greater role in future elections than they did in 2012, when their support provided President Barack Obama the votes that enabled him to win a majority of all votes cast, even though the only state he won because of Latino votes was New Mexico.95 This is especially significant because it implies that the negative effects of vitiating Section 5 of the VRA could be substantially reduced if parties and candidates target bilingual and Spanish‐dominant voters through a substantial increase in their use of Spanish‐language media. While we found no independent effect of language of news media usage in our multivariate models (see Appendix D), we believe that a better measure of media exposure (the amount and frequency of usage of both English‐ and Spanish‐language media) is needed to better model the direct media role, if any. In other words, while historically the polity's processes were designed to deny Latinos, especially the non‐English dominant, the polity is now accessible to Latinos, including bilinguals and the Spanish dominant. The extent to which they benefit from this new institutional environment will require new mobilization strategies built on Spanish‐language media and effective messaging that reaches both English‐dominant potential voters and Spanish dominants and bilinguals, the very voters that both parties and candidates are most likely to ignore.

"120","We begin with the proposition that we are interested in functional bilinguals and functional English dominants. For example, suppose a respondent is proficient in neither Spanish (speaking and reading) nor English (speaking and reading). In this case, the respondent may be scored at a 2 on both (0–6) scales. If we only looked at the differential between the two scales (which is zero), we might conclude that this respondent was bilingual. However, we would want to distinguish this respondent from a functional bilingual—that is, able to function (that is, speak and read) at or above some threshold level in both Spanish and English. So, an approach that focuses solely on the differential between the Spanish and English proficiency measures could not capture this distinction.            "
"121","To look at the joint distribution of English‐ and Spanish‐language proficiency, we began by examining a cross‐tab and partitioning the sample into six categories (see Table 9):            "
"122","English dominant: English score of 5 or 6, Spanish score of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (differential between 3 and 6—in favor of English).            "
"123","Mostly English: English score of 3 or 4, Spanish score of 0, 1, or 2 (differential between 2 and 4—in favor of English). We wanted this category because English scores of 3 or 4 do not represent high English proficiency.            "
"124","Bilingual: The maximum differential is 0, 1, or 2 and the minimum score on both English and Spanish is 3.            "
"125","Low language functioning: This is a category we do not find in the 2008 Pew data. Just like functional bilinguals, the maximum differential is 0, 1, or 2, only here, the maximum score on both English and Spanish is 3. While the differential is small (0, 1, or 2), we believe that respondents with “low” (3 or lower) scores on both English and Spanish have such low language competencies that they should not be considered bilinguals. A bilingual in our definition should be able to minimally function in both languages.            "
"126","Mostly Spanish: Spanish score of 3 or 4, English score of 0, 1, or 2 (differential between 2 and 4—in favor of Spanish).            "
"127","Spanish dominant: Spanish score of 5 or 6, English score of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (differentials between 3 and 6—in favor of Spanish).            "
"128","Clearly, Table 9 indicates that there are not enough “mostly English” respondents (just 1.2 percent of the sample) to justify further subgroup analysis, so we added these to the “English dominants” (and also added “mostly Spanish” to “Spanish dominants”) (see Table 10).97             "
"129","The weighted distribution of this four‐category language proficiency measure results in a sample that is 23.3 percent English dominant, 40.4 percent bilingual, 32.0 percent Spanish dominant, and 4.3 percent low language functioning.98 Unfortunately, after weighting, this leaves us with only 65 low language functioning respondents. Because our turnout and registration models focus only on citizens, we ultimately dropped this categorization (and folded them in with Spanish dominants). Prior to collapsing low language functioners with Spanish dominants, we examined how similar low language functioners were to the other three language groups on a number of key criterion variables.            "
"130","First, we found that among English dominants, 96 percent took the interview in English (see Table 11). Among bilinguals, 60 percent took the English interview, while 40 percent took the Spanish interview.99 Interestingly, among both Spanish dominants and low language functioners, 100 percent took the interview in Spanish. This is significant, given that the weighted n = 65 for low language functioners is not sufficiently large to perform further multivariate analyses. Given that 100 percent of both groups took the interview in Spanish, and language of interview is an often used proxy for language dominance, we feel comfortable folding the low language functioners in with the Spanish dominants.100             "
