"1","Everyone can agree that American government has become dysfunctional in recent years as polarization has immobilized Congress. Peter H. Schuck, however, offers a far broader and more damning assessment. He argues that even during normal political times, the federal government's policies have failed much more often than not, and its failures “include some of our largest, most durable, most visible, and most fiercely defended programs. Together, they account for a substantial share of total non‐defense discretionary spending” (p. 371). His purpose in this book is to show, through the marshaling of a massive amount of evidence, that failure is in fact the norm—and to explain why the American system is so incapable of effective action."
"2","Schuck is not the first to bring evidence to bear on federal failures. Others, including Derek Bok and Clifford Winston, have done admirable work on the topic. But Schuck makes a uniquely valuable contribution here because of the sheer weight, scope, and comprehensiveness of the evidence he presents. He covers an astoundingly diverse range of domestic policies—from taxes to immigration to energy to student loans to home mortgages to clean air and much, much more. This is a remarkable feat. His assessment of these programs, moreover, is not only faithful to the voluminous, research‐based evidence but also thoughtful, insightful, and systematic. This is the deeply informed analysis of a seasoned professional, a man who knows government inside and out, and it shows. His work is impressive."
"3","Because I am such a fan, I hesitate to say that the book has a downside. Yet it does. As the title implies, Schuck aims to explain why government so often fails—but his approach to explanation, and thus to theoretical thinking, is unfortunately just as encyclopedic as his approach to policies and programs. He argues—rightly—that the “most striking feature of this failure . . . is how deep and structural its causes are” (p. 411), which sounds simple and logically powerful. But it turns out that what he means by this is that policy failures “grow out of a deeply entrenched policy process, a pol culture, a perverse official incentive system, individual or collective irrationality, inadequate information, rigidity and inertia, lack of credibility, mismanagement, market dynamics, the inherent limits of law, implementation problems, and a weak bureaucratic system” (p. 372)—and each of these is given separate and very extensive treatment as a cause of policy failure. Political culture, moreover, is subdivided into 10 components—including constitutionalism, decentralization, individual rights, interest group pluralism, religion, and public opinion—and each of these, too, is treated as a separate cause with much discussion. The aggregation of all these separate but equal elements does not count as a theoretical perspective, and the explanation we get along the way is too complex and far‐flung to provide a coherent understanding of why government fails. The pieces all make sense. But there is no larger perspective on the whole to pull it all together.         "
"4","To bring order and coherence to all this, Schuck would need to recognize that some causes are especially fundamental, and that these fundamentals help explain why many of the other “causes” are so problematic. Most fundamental by far is the Constitution, which goes a long way toward explaining why Congress is so utterly parochial and open to special interest pressure, why the bureaucracy is so politicized and burdened by congressional interference, why the incentives of policymakers so often depart from the public interest, why the courts are constantly intervening to impose their own policy preferences, why the system is prone to rigidity and inertia, and so on—and why the presidency (which Schuck almost totally ignores) stands out as a major force for policy coherence and thus, at least potentially, a major way out of this mess."
"5","But Schuck does not pursue an integrated perspective on how all the various causes he is juggling are actually interrelated. Which they surely are. And without any fundamentals to unite the dizzying array of separate but equal causes, there is no big picture, no explanatory or theoretical takeaway that sheds a bright light on the whole. Most readers will come away convinced—by an avalanche of evidence—that the government often fails. But if they are asked what they have learned about why it fails, they are likely to just say “it's complicated.”"
