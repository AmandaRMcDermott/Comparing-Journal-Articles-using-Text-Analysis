"1","This volume is a comprehensive and well‐crafted study of U.S.–China relations focused on security issues. The authors not only exhibit an impressive grasp of China but also give due attention to both partners in the relationship. Moreover, because James Steinberg and Michael E. O'Hanlon are experts on U.S. national security affairs, their book provides analyses of both countries that are firmly grounded, nuanced, well sourced, and very balanced."
"2","The book proceeds in logical sequence as the authors first identify the sources of U.S.–China conflict and move on to examine in turn the factors shaping China's strategy and then those shaping U.S. strategy. They proceed to defense budgets and military modernization, crisis scenarios, and the strategic domains of nuclear, space, and cyber before examining actual military activities and defense postures. The authors' conclusions are sound, and their policy recommendations—sprinkled throughout the book—are concrete and thoughtful."
"3","Unfortunately, most of the advice proffered is unlikely to be heeded, for at least two reasons. First, Steinberg and O'Hanlon do not directly address a fundamental problem in U.S.–China relations: the reality that neither state views the other as an equal. Of course, the truth is that the United States and China are not equals—at least objectively speaking when economic, military, and diplomatic metrics are compared—but that does not mean that Washington and Beijing cannot relate to each other as peers. The authors' elegant “strategic reassurance” model is drawn from the experience of détente between the United States and the Soviet Union. This approach worked because Washington and Moscow did view each other as peers."
"4","Indeed, the authors clearly view the U.S.–China relationship as mismatched: their proposal that the United States and China agree to fix defense spending levels at a 2:1 ratio highlights this point. While the logic of the proposal is irrefutable—the U.S. military has global responsibilities, while the focus of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is territorial and concentrated in China's immediate neighborhood—the message is clear: the security relationship is not equal."
"5","The result, paradoxically, is that, on the one hand, leaders in both China and the United States seem sincere when they say they want a new and improved working relationship based on mutual respect, while, on the other hand, neither Beijing nor Washington actually respects the other as an equal partner. The authors implicitly recognize this reality—the United States wants continued “primacy,” especially in the military realm, and refers to China as a “rising power.” China, meanwhile, has an inferiority complex and remains deeply reluctant to assume greater external security responsibilities consistent with its growing strength. Chinese leader Xi Jinping's advocacy of the rubric of a “new type of major power relations” is all about promoting a relationship between equals in which Washington gives due deference to Beijing's sensitivities and interests. The Barack Obama administration may have accepted this terminology, but Washington continues to treat Beijing as a junior partner."
"6","The second reason that the sensible ideas in this book are unlikely to be implemented is that the authors tend to proffer them as if the relationship were exclusively bilateral and the roles of other states peripheral. But the impact of the so‐called third‐party problem cannot be omitted from any U.S.–China policy proposal. This is not to say that Steinberg and O'Hanlon completely ignore other countries, but they do downplay their impact. For example, the 2:1 defense spending ratio, already noted, neglects the fact that, in Beijing's view, the PLA also must be prepared and equipped to deal with the militaries of states such as Japan and India. Moreover, the United States has well‐armed and staunch allies and partners in the Asia‐Pacific. while currently China does not."
"7","Although these challenges do not preclude cooperation, they do limit the potential and hamper the scope for successful agreements between the two governments. These caveats aside, this book deserves to be widely read and discussed. Steinberg and O'Hanlon have made an important contribution in advancing the dialogue on strategic relations between the United States and China."
