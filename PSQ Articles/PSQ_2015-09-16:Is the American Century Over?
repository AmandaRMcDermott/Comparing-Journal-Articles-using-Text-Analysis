"1","IS THE AMERICAN CENTURY OVER? MANY SEEM to think so. In recent years, polls showed that in 15 of 22 countries surveyed, most respondents said that China either will replace or has already replaced the United States as the world's leading power. A Pew poll in 2014 found that only 28 percent of Americans thought their country “stands above all others” compared to 38 percent in 2011. Yet perhaps, as Mark Twain famously quipped, “reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.”"
"2","After American independence in the eighteenth century, the British politician Horace Walpole lamented that Britain had been reduced to the level of Sardinia. In fact, Britain was about to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution that created its second century as a global power. In the mid‐1980s, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist asked why, if the British Empire had lasted two centuries, “are we slipping after about 50 years?”1 On the eve of the collapse of the Soviet Union that left the United States as the world's only superpower, best‐selling books compared the U.S. situation to the decline of Philip II's Spain. And after the United States became the sole superpower in a unipolar world, a leading political scientist predicted it would quickly come to an end.2 With such cautionary examples, we need to keep humility in mind as we try to answer the question in our title.         "
"3","First, we need to be clear about what we mean by “the American century.” When did it start? One possible date would be the end of the nineteenth century when the United States became the world's largest industrial power. As the twentieth century began, the United States accounted for nearly a quarter of the world's economy and this was still true on the eve of World War II.3 Because that war devastated all the major economies at the same time that it strengthened the American economy, the United States represented nearly half the world economy in the immediate postwar period. Gradually, as other economies recovered and grew, partly as the result of American policies, the abnormal American share returned to its pre‐war portion of roughly a quarter of the world economy, where it remained for the rest of the century. But this “return to normal” meant a reduction in America's share of the world economy from 1945 to 1970, leading to perceptions of American decline.         "
"4","If one defines it in terms of being the country with the largest economy, the American century roughly coincides with the twentieth century, reaching its peak in mid‐century, and it will end in the next decade or so when analysts expect China to pass the United States as the world's largest economy. Using an adjustment called “purchasing power parity,” a unit of the World Bank believes that China has already passed the United States in total gross domestic product (GDP).4 Other projections measuring economies at the exchange rate of their currencies suggest that China will be the world's largest economy within a decade. Does that mean we are about to see the end of the American century?         "
"5","Not necessarily. Power is the ability to affect others to get the outcomes one wants, and there are three ways to do that: by coercion (sticks); by payments (carrots); and by attraction or persuasion. Sticks and carrots are forms of hard power; attraction and persuasion are called soft power. All these dimensions of power are important, and that is why economic power alone should not be used to define the American century. For example, when the United States became the largest economy at the end of the nineteenth century, it was not regarded as a major player in the global balance of power until Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson invested some of that economic power into military resources. Moreover, even when a country has major power resources, it may have a poor power conversion capability, as the United States demonstrated in the 1930s when it had the largest economy but followed an isolationist policy. So when China passes the United States in total economic size, we will not automatically be witnessing the end of the American century if we consider all three dimensions of economic, military, and soft power. (Moreover, as we will see later, the total size of GDP is only one aspect of economic power.)"
"6","A more useful way of defining and dating the American century is not only in terms of power resources, but also in terms of the ways in which the United States used those resources to affect the global balance of power.5 In the nineteenth century, the Americans used their economic power to trade with the rest of the world, but played a small role in the global balance of power. Following George Washington's advice to avoid entangling alliances and the Monroe Doctrine, which focused on the Western Hemisphere, the United States played only a minor role in the global balance. The United States did not keep a large standing army, and in the 1880s the U.S. Navy was smaller than that of Chile. The Americans did not shun military power (as Mexico and Native American nations can attest), but isolationism described the U.S. attitude toward the European great powers. In the short Spanish‐American War of 1898, the United States took the colonies of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines from a declining Spain; but that period of formal global imperialism was brief. While Theodore Roosevelt built up the American navy and dabbled in global diplomacy, American foreign policy remained primarily focused on the Western Hemisphere.         "
"7","A big change was American entry into World War I. Michael Lind recently argued,            "
"8","[I]n 1914, the American Century began. This year the American Century ended. America's foreign policy is in a state of collapse, America's economy doesn't work well, and American democracy is broken. The days when other countries looked to the U.S. as a successful model of foreign policy prudence, democratic capitalism and liberal democracy may be over. The American Century, 1914–2014. RIP.6"
"9","Leaving hyperbole aside, in 1917 Woodrow Wilson broke with tradition and for the first time sent American troops to fight in Europe. Moreover, he proposed a League of Nations to organize collective security on a global basis. After the Senate rejected American membership in the League and the troops came home, America “returned to normal.” Though it was now a major factor in the global power balance, the United States became virulently isolationist in the 1930s. Thus it would be more accurate to date the American century to Franklin D. Roosevelt's entry into World War II. It was in this context, to resist isolationism and urge American participation in the war, that Henry Luce, the son of missionary parents, wrote his famous February 1941 editorial on “the American Century” in LIFE magazine.7"
"10","Equally important were Harry Truman's postwar decisions that led to a permanent military presence abroad. When Britain was too weak to support Greece and Turkey in 1947, the United States took its place. It invested heavily in the Marshall Plan in 1948, created NATO in 1949, and led a United Nations coalition that fought in Korea in 1950. These actions were part of the strategy of containment. As the diplomat George Kennan (and others) saw the world after World War II, there were five main areas of industrial productivity and strength: the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, Europe, and Japan. It was in the American interest to ally with three of the five as a means of containing the growth of Soviet power. American troops remain in Europe, Japan, Korea and elsewhere to this day."
"11","From 1945 to 1991, the global balance of power was described as bipolar, with two superpowers standing well above the rest. The United States and the Soviet Union had disproportionate shares of power resources and alliance spheres of influence, and competed for advantage in the non‐aligned world. The two giants engaged in a nuclear arms race, and balanced each other's power. But after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union (primarily because of internal reasons) in 1991, the United States become the world's only superpower."
"12","Though the terminology is unfortunate, theorists of international relations called this a “unipolar” world. Some might say that 1991 is a third potential date for the beginning of the American century, when the United States became the only nation able to project military power on a global scale. The American navy was equal in size to the next 17 navies, American forces had air superiority, the United States took the lead in space and cyber space, and the U.S. military budget represented nearly half the global total. In such circumstances, it became very difficult for other states to form coalitions that could balance American military power."
"13","No other state in modern history has had as much military preponderance as the United States. Some analysts call this American “hegemony” and compare it to British hegemony in the nineteenth century. It is common to hear that the United States “appears to be following in the footsteps of Great Britain, the last global hegemon.”8 The historical analogy is popular, but misleading.         "
"14","During the so‐called Pax Britannica, Britain was not as preponderant as the United States is today. British policy was to maintain a navy equal to the next two fleets combined; Britain had an empire on which the sun never set, and ruled over a quarter of humankind. Nonetheless, there were major differences in the relative power resources of imperial Britain and contemporary America. By the time of World War I, Britain ranked only fourth among the great powers in its share of military personnel, fourth in GDP, and third in military spending.9 The costs of defense averaged 2.5 percent to 3.4 percent of GDP and the empire was ruled in large part through local troops. Of the 8.6 million British forces in World War I, nearly a third came from the overseas empire.10 But with the rise of nationalism, it became increasingly difficult for London to declare war on behalf of the empire, and by the time of World War II, protecting the empire became more of a burden than an asset. For all the loose talk of American empire, the United States has more degrees of freedom than Britain had. And while Britain faced powerful neighbors in Germany and Russia, America benefits from two oceans and weaker neighbors.         "
"15","Moreover, the word “hegemony” is used in diverse and confusing ways. There is no general agreement on how much inequality and what types of power resources constitute hegemony. Some writers use the word “hegemonic” interchangeably with “imperial,” but formal empire is not a requirement for hegemony. Others call it the ability to “order the international system,” but argue that it has rarely existed.11 Still others use the term as synonymous with primacy or having the most power resources, and refer to nineteenth‐century Britain as hegemonic even though Britain ranked third (behind the United States and Russia) in GDP, and third (behind Russia and France) in military expenditures even at the height of its power in 1870. While Britain had a preponderant role in naval affairs, its power was balanced in other domains. Similarly, those who speak of American hegemony after 1945 fail to note that American military power was balanced by the Soviet Union for more than four decades. The Americans had disproportionate power in the world economy, but their political and military actions were constrained by Soviet power.         "
"16","Some scholars have described the post‐1945 period as an American‐led hierarchical order with liberal characteristics, where weaker states were given institutional access to the exercise of American power, and the United States provided public goods and operated within a loose system of multilateral rules and institutions. As John Ikenberry describes it, “the United States provided global services—such as security protection and support of open markets—which made other states willing to work with rather than resist American pre‐eminence.”12 Some analysts point out that it can be rational for states that benefit to preserve this institutional framework even if American power resources decline.13 In that sense, the American century could outlive American primacy in power resources. Others argue that this open liberal institutional order is now coming to an end as new powers emerge.         "
"17","Critics point out that there has always been a lot of fiction mixed with the facts in the mythology of American hegemony.14 It was never really a global order, but more a group of like‐minded states centered primarily in the Americas and Western Europe, and it did not always have benign effects on non‐members. As Henry Kissinger notes, no truly global world order has ever existed.15 Because the largest countries in the world—China, India, Indonesia, and the Soviet bloc—were not members, the American world order was really less than half the world. In terms of the global military balance, the United States was not hegemonic. In economics, American leadership created liberal institutions and rules and practices that governed the world economy, but for only half the world. It might, more accurately, be called a “half‐hegemony.”         "
"18","A Norwegian scholar, Geir Lundestad, once categorized this partial American world order after 1945 as an “empire by invitation,”16 and its proponents have argued that by fostering multilateral institutions and allowing access to power for other states, the Americans legitimized a liberal order that in principle could survive the gradual decline of the United States. Can China, India, Brazil, and other emerging powers be co‐opted into this order? Among others, Amitav Acharya thinks not, and he foresees a world order based on regionalism and plural narratives. He offers the metaphor of a multiplex cinema theater where, rather than one film playing, there will be many equal choices under a common architecture. “Hence, instead of pining for the American‐led liberal hegemonic order, we should prepare to ‘boldly go where no‐one has gone before.’”17"
"19","As we have seen, the term “hegemony” is too imprecise a concept to be useful in defining “the American century.” Sometimes it means having a preponderance of power resources, sometimes the behavior of setting the rules for others, and some‐ times getting the outcomes one prefers. Because of this ambiguity, we cannot date when it begins or ends. Noam Chomsky even argues that the “‘loss of China’ was the first major step in ‘America's decline,'” or about the time that many others see ascendance.18 If there ever was a U.S. hegemony, it would have been from 1945, when the United States had nearly half the world economy as a result of World War II, to 1970, when the U.S. share of world product declined to its prewar level of a quarter of world product. Yet during this period, the United States often failed to get what it wanted—witness Soviet acquisition of nuclear weapons; communist takeover of China and half of Vietnam, stalemate in the Korean War, Soviet suppression of the revolts in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, Fidel Castro's control of Cuba, and so forth. Thus, instead of “hegemony,” I prefer to use the terms “primacy” or “preeminence” in terms of a country's disproportionate (and measurable) share of all three types of power resources.         "
"20","After 1945, the United States had pre‐eminence in economic power resources, but in the political‐military dimensions of power, the world was bipolar rather than “hegemonic,” and the Soviet Union balanced American power. Unipolarity did not come until the collapse of the USSR in 1991. As for being a benign hegemon providing public goods, the American world order did provide shared goods such as security and prosperity for parts of the world, but these were club goods available to members rather than global public goods. For many nonmembers of the club, such as India, China, Indonesia, Congo, Iran, Guatemala, and Chile, among others, the measures taken to provide security and prosperity for members of the club did not look like benign public goods. Because of these ambiguities in the concept of hegemony, it is better to define “the American century” as the period since the beginning of World War II, when the United States, without full control, had primacy in economic power resources and became a central actor in the global balance of power. Thus, “the American century” – date of birth: 1941; date of death: uncertain."
"21","The short answer to our question is that we are not entering a post‐American world. It is not possible for this (or any) article to see “the future,” because there are so many possible futures dependent on unpredictable events and they play a larger role the further out one tries to look. Thus it is important to specify a time horizon. For example, if the “American century” began in 1941, will the United States still have primacy in power resources and play the central role in the global balance of power among states in 2041? My guess is yes. In that sense, the American century is not over, but because of transnational and non‐state forces, it is definitely changing in important ways.*"
