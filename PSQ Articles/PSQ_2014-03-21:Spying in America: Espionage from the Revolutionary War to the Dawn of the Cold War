"1","This book is the first of a planned two‐volume set covering espionage against the United States from the Revolutionary period up through today. The author, Michael Sulick, had a lengthy and illustrious career as an intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that culminated in three years at the head of the National Clandestine Service. His book draws almost entirely on secondary sources. (One may imagine that the second volume will also draw, if only implicitly, on his personal knowledge as a counterintelligence practitioner.) The book covers little if any new scholarly ground. However, the author's message seems to be aimed more at the general public than at scholars."
"2","In the introduction, Sulick offers the thesis that Americans historically have been disinclined to believe that fellow citizens could be spying for foreign powers and also that they have been consistently suspicious of government counterespionage efforts, seeing them as intrusive and even as forms of persecution. Sadly, Sulick's argument is not wholly persuasive. Certainly, the book does contain sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case. For instance, the author points to the case of Benedict Arnold during the Revolutionary War. “Americans from the commander in chief down,” he writes, “simply refused to believe that a general of Arnold's caliber and achievements could betray the cause” (p. 3). The controversy surrounding the conviction and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on charges of atomic espionage also supports Sulick's thesis.         "
"3","On the other hand, the book describes several episodes during which Americans were excessively willing to believe that spies were among them. Among these are the indiscriminate actions of Lafayette Baker's National Detective Police during the Civil War; the rampant domestic surveillance during World War I, notably including the activities of the non‐governmental American Protective League; the Palmer Raids that took place during a period of “spy mania” (p. 124) in 1919 and 1920; and the demagoguery of Senator Joseph McCarthy that “inflamed America's fears of Soviet subversion” (p. 232). The overall result is a somewhat mixed and confusing message. Sulick attempts to synthesize these contradictions in the conclusion, where he writes that these “messianic hunt[s] for subversives ultimately backfired and, paradoxically, exacerbated the threat of foreign espionage by discrediting counterespionage” efforts (p. 271). However, a better thesis might have been that the United States has lurched back and forth between naiveté and paranoia about the espionage threat."
"4","Nevertheless, the book has substantial positive points. Sulick was motivated to write it when he found during a stint as head of counterintelligence for the CIA that there was no good compendium of historical cases on which he could draw when preparing presentations for government audiences. In this book, he provides useful short sketches of most of the famous and important espionage cases during the period in question. He highlights the six common threads of all these cases: motivations, access and the secrets actually betrayed, tradecraft, exposure, punishment, and damage. He also covers, though less comprehensively, important American spy hunters and counterespionage operations, ranging from John Jay's Revolutionary‐era Committee on Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies through the Cold War's VENONA project."
"5","Sulick has provided an accessible book that is not only an entertaining read but which also can be a useful reference. Though the surface details vary from case to case and will doubtless continue to evolve in the future, he has successfully illuminated the enduring essence of espionage and made a strong case that the United States needs always to be on guard."
