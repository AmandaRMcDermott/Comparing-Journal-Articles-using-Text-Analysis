"1","Turnout for the 2014 midterm elections hit a 72‐year low of 36.3 percent. Fewer than half of eligible voters participated in 43 states, and fewer than one‐third voted in the three largest states (California, Texas, and New York). Even less common are forms of political participation that require more time and effort, such as attending a local political meeting or rally. According to a recent Pew Research Center study, only 22 percent of survey respondents had attended a meeting on local, town, or school affairs in the previous year, and only 10 percent had attended a rally or speech. What moves individuals to be civically active, to work with their fellow citizens to solve problems and change public policy? A groundbreaking new book by Hahrie Han, How Organizations Develop Activists, uses in‐depth observations of and interviews with members of high‐ and low‐engagement chapters of two national organizations to answer this question.         "
"2","Distinguishing between transactional mobilizing and transformational organizing, Han finds that high‐engagement chapters differ particularly in their use of strategies that develop the capacities of others rather than identifying individuals with latent skills and interest. Mobilizers find supporters by casting wide nets and focusing on developing attractive pitches to potential members; organizers, in contrast, work to transform individuals into leaders and focus on building relationships and community. Mobilizers “allow people to self‐select the level of activity they desire”; organizers “seek to transform people's interests as they recruit them for action” (p. 15)."
"3","A major strength of the book is the concrete examples and individual stories taken from Han's years in the field. For instance, Dale, a doctor who is a member of the National Association of Doctors (the names of the individuals and organizations are replaced with pseudonyms), shares the story of how he started by volunteering at a phone bank but was then asked to organize and run one on his own. He quickly realized that sending emails was not enough, but other leaders held his hand and taught him how to make the event a success. He was transformed into a leader. While a low‐engagement chapter of People for the Environment focused on identifying interested individuals with existing skills, a high‐engagement chapter used one‐on‐one meetings, trainings, and ongoing mentorship to develop people into leaders and teach them how to be activists. The high‐engagement chapters challenged the emotional and cognitive capacities of volunteers, creating interdependent work that involved strategic autonomy and yet was supported through coaching and training. While more labor‐intensive in the short run, these strategies resulted in downstream effects including increased leadership capabilities of members and enhanced organizational capacity for collective action."
"4","In part, the difference also hinges on the development of a sense of community, or social capital. Low‐engagement mobilizing strategies are more likely to be successful among self‐motivated individuals, whose involvement is driven by their own sense of their available time and effort. In contrast, high‐engagement organizers reach out to people personally, building a sense of community; people are motivated to stay active, in part, so as not to let down their peers."
"5","There are important limitations to Han's findings. As she notes, doctors and environmental activists are relatively privileged populations, and the latter were mostly white. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which these findings hold true for communities with lower incomes and levels of education and in diverse ethnoracial communities. That caveat aside, the insights here about the transformational power of organizing and how that differs from mobilizing are compelling, well supported, and chart an inspiring path for those interested in developing a more engaged citizenry and a healthier democracy than the one reflected in recent levels of voter turnout."
