"1","Amnesty International, CARE, and Greenpeace have become household names. But all international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs or NGOs) promise to improve people's lives or the environment a world away for a modest investment and have done so for more than 200 years. Since 1990, INGOs have multiplied to uncountable numbers, generated new issue areas, and spread into all regions and countries of the world. It is no exaggeration to claim that NGOs have become the global go‐to organizational form for addressing old problems and discovering new ones."
"2","Books on INGOs have also burgeoned since 1990. Amanda Murdie acknowledges that one such book “absolutely changed my life” when she read it as an undergraduate: Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politics, the 1998 volume by Margaret Keck and Kathryn Sikkink. Murdie goes on to identify that book as central to the “canonical literature” and “dominant theoretical framework” on INGOs (pp. 7, 19).         "
"3","Murdie is part of a movement among scholars over the past decade to loosen the grip of certain conventional distinctions among INGOs—particularly among issue areas such as human rights, disaster relief, and the environment and between advocacy organizations and service organizations. These distinctions allow observers to limit the scope of their research and simplify conceptualization and field work. However, the distinctions also reflect the self‐understanding of NGOs themselves and therefore limit the ability of scholars to achieve critical distance. Activists Beyond Borders does indeed represent the best scholarship from within this perspective, with the well‐known “boomerang model” in which a transnational advocacy network responds to the society of an oppressive government by gathering powerful international allies to pressure that government.         "
"4","Murdie represents a superb example of a more recent trend to let go of these conventional distinctions, thereby aggregating INGOs and then disaggregating them in new ways to achieve new insights."
"5","Unlike Keck and Sikkink, Murdie considers that the norms and goals of the international actors in an advocacy network may diverge from the norms and goals of the domestic population, thereby reducing the campaign's effectiveness. Similarly, service INGOs may pursue rent seeking to the point of complete corruption. However, Murdie also challenges the revisionist view that NGOs are always narrowly self‐interested. For Murdie, the motives of INGOs are “heterogeneous” (p. 70). In any particular campaign or country, there are both “angels” (principled INGOs working with the population) and “demons” (corrupt INGOs imposing values on the population), but they can be found in different proportions in different contexts (pp. 8–11)."
"6","Murdie's quite breathtaking empirical project is to measure quantitatively, for developing countries after the Cold War, the effects of INGOs on the human security indicators of “freedom from want” (potable water) and “freedom from fear” (human rights and women's rights). The independent variable is the INGOs in a country that “signal” their credibility to adhere operationally to principled values rather than rent seeking and to sharing values with the domestic population rather than imposing them."
"7","Help or Harm: The Human Security Effects of International NGOs falls short of the promise of its title by not considering the security side effects of NGOs, by assuming a degree of state coherence belied by many collapsed and divided states, and by theorizing factors in a causal web more than actors in a political process.         "
"8","Nevertheless, the book is a remarkable achievement. It arranges three movements in a prodigious whole: a compelling account of questions of INGO fairness and accountability, ingenious use of available large‐scale data on INGOs and countries, and a sophisticated theory of INGO “signaling” to link the questions and the data. It will be essential for scholars, students, policymakers, and INGO professionals."
