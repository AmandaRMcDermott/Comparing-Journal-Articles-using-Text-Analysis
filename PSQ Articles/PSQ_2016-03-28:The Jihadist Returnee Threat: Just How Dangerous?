"1","ON 24 MAY 2014, MEHDI NEMMOUCHE OPENED FIRE and killed four people at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels. Nemmouche was a French citizen who had fought in Syria, and his attack appeared to fulfill the biggest fear of U.S. and European counterterrorism officials: that the Syrian war would prove to be an incubator of terrorism on the scale of Afghanistan before September 11 or worse. A few months later, Moner Mohammad Abusalha raised alarms in the United States by becoming the first American to conduct a suicide attack in Syria. Most dramatic and deadly of all, on 13 November 2015, teams of attackers linked to the Islamic State killed 130 people in Paris, and several foreign fighters—including the probable mastermind—were among their ranks. Yet not every war in the Muslim world that draws Western recruits produces international terrorism when the foreign fighters return home. Indeed, some, such as those in Somalia and Mali, led to little terrorism “bleedout”—in contrast to Afghanistan, which spawned numerous terrorist attacks.1"
"2","For Western security officials, the risk seems overwhelming. The Netherlands' national coordinator for security and counterterrorism warned that “these people are not only coming back with radical ideas; they are also traumatised and fully prepared to use violence.”2 American officials have similar fears. Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey stated that “all of us with a memory of the '80s and '90s saw the line drawn from Afghanistan in the '80s and '90s to Sept. 11.” He then warned, “We see Syria as that, but an order of magnitude worse in a couple of respects. Far more people going there. Far easier to travel to and back from. So, there's going to be a diaspora out of Syria at some point and we are determined not to let lines be drawn from Syria today to a future 9/11.”3"
"3","U.S. policy has responded to this potential risk. In June 2014, the United States (again) intervened in Iraq, striking the forces of the Islamic State there and in Syria. Fear that the Islamic State was, like al Qaeda in the past, building a mini‐army that would attack the West was one of the reasons for the intervention. President Barack Obama warned that “if left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region, including to the United States.”4 After the intervention, skeptics grew concerned that the U.S. strikes would further turn the Islamic State against the West, making terrorist attacks more likely.5"
"4","How dangerous is the threat of terrorism from foreign fighters? Why do so many foreign fighters not join terrorist groups? How can effective policy further reduce the threat? These are the questions this article seeks to answer.         "
"5","Officials' fears and policy responses are not unjustified; they draw on a logical (although often unstated) model of how foreign fighters become international terrorists and fears specific to the latest conflict in Syria and Iraq. As examples, officials point to bloody attacks such as the 7 July 2005, transportation bombings in London as vivid illustrations of the risks that returning fighters can pose. Using Afghanistan as the model, they point out that wars in the Muslim world serve as breeding grounds for terrorists: the causes attract Westerners who, when they go abroad, come into contact with international terrorist groups and are indoctrinated into their anti‐Western agenda. They also gain skills and networks that make this new mind‐set far more dangerous. If anything, Syria seems even more deadly, attracting far more Western recruits than any past war and imbuing the fighters with bloody purpose."
"6","These fears are not so much wrong as they are overstated. The potential threat is tremendous, but the actual threat—particularly when counterterrorism efforts are incorporated into the overall assessment—is lower, particularly with regard to attacks on the U.S. homeland. Many important jihads, such as the fight against the United States in Iraq after 2003, produced little terrorism in the West. Of those who go to fight, many do not return: some die, while others stay on in the war zone or become professional jihadists elsewhere in the Muslim world. Of those who return, many come back with no desire to attack their home countries, and others are disillusioned or even traumatized. The skill set gained is more suitable for insurgency or civil war than for clandestine terrorism. In contrast to al Qaeda in Afghanistan when the Taliban ruled, most of the groups in Syria, including the Islamic State, are focused first and foremost on the war zone, not on attacking the West. Perhaps most important, security services play an important role and regularly disrupt those who are dangerous: the potential threat is real, but so is the response. Terrorist use of social media radicalizes potential recruits but plays a positive role as well, revealing valuable intelligence on foreign fighters that makes detection more likely.         "
"7","Effective policy can further reduce the danger. Deradicalization programs can dissuade some potential fighters from ever leaving, and community engagement can identify at‐risk individuals. Efforts to disrupt travel through intelligence coordination and better border security in Turkey can prevent fighters from getting to the war zone or returning undetected. In the war zone, offensive counterintelligence can sow suspicion of foreign fighters. Upon their return, deradicalization programs can again play a role, and effectively triaging returnees can help security services determine which ones should simply be monitored and which deserve arrest. Finally, an effective security service response can stop the most dangerous from conducting attacks—but it must be well resourced to do so."
"8","In making these arguments, this article draws on two sources. First, it looks at the fighters going to Iraq and Syria in the context of past foreign fighter flows such as Iraq after the U.S. invasion in 2003, Mali, and Somalia, as well as Afghanistan. Second, it draws on interviews on both the threat and the response. The author conducted interviews with several dozen officials in the United States and Europe. Most of these interviews were conducted with government officials, often in intelligence services, on the condition of anonymity. Several other interviews involved leading academic and think tank experts. The officials' knowledge is often impressionistic and limited to their own countries, but taken together it gives at least some sense of the scope of the problem and the effectiveness of the response."
"9","The remainder of this article has three sections. The first section looks at the reasons for fearing the influx of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria as they relate to terrorism in their home countries. Drawing in part on the superb work of the scholar Thomas Hegghammer, the article looks at the role foreign fighters have played in important terrorist attacks. With this in mind, it presents a model from initial radicalization to final attack. The second section then takes a step back, examining why foreign fighter violence is usually overpredicted. Using the same model as a framework, it shows a range of mitigating factors that individually make violence less likely and collectively can have a decisive impact. In particular, the attitude of the group training the fighters and the role of security services can be decisive. Finally, the article presents a range of policy steps that can further reduce the danger but argues that the risk level can only be reduced, not brought to zero."
"10","This section lays out the arguments for why counterterrorism officials are so concerned about the threat of terrorism from foreign fighter returnees.6 It then lays out a model for foreign fighters‐cum‐terrorists and explains why the latest bout of fighting in Syria and Iraq is of particular concern.         "
"11","A quick look at major jihadist terrorism plots reveals the important role of foreign fighters in general but also of returnees in particular. Foreign fighters played a role in major post–September 11 attacks such as the 2004 Madrid bombing, the 2005 London bombings, and the 2015 Paris attacks—the three deadliest jihadist terrorist attacks in Europe—and were linked to even bigger plots such as the 2006 attempt to down more than 10 transatlantic airliners. The data compiled and research conducted by a leading scholar on foreign fighters, Thomas Hegghammer, also suggests the danger of returnees.7 Hegghammer offers several findings relevant to the question of the threat of returning foreign fighters to the West:               "
"12","From the plots linked to returnees, the concerns of security officials, and the research of scholars like Hegghammer, we can discern a rough five‐step model of the process by which foreign fighters become returnees who pose a risk of terrorism.14"
"13","The first step is for fighters from a foreign country to decide to join a conflict. At the start, the motivation for the fight abroad is usually specific and local—fighting against an invader or perceived oppressor—rather than struggling against injustices at home. Overall, the security officials I interviewed believe that the decision to fight in a foreign conflict is usually less an act of religious commitment than of young male rebellion and thirst for adventure. One intelligence official noted, “Only one percent know a theologian” or are informed on dogma in any way.15 Indeed, two British foreign fighters on their way to Syria found it necessary to purchase Islam for Dummies and The Koran for Dummies for the trip.16"
"14","In the second step, the foreign fighters travel to the war zone. The aspiring jihadi makes contact with recruitment networks. He begins the sometimes long and arduous journey to the foreign field of battle through normal and specialized travel networks. In the process, he comes into contact with a fighting group. They vet and assess him and assign him to fight their enemies, to martyr himself, or to perform other tasks. The volunteer usually seeks to join the local insurgency, but he may end up in a training camp run by al Qaeda or a like‐minded group that supports terrorism in the West as well.17"
"15","In the third step, the journey transforms as the recruits train and fight in the field of jihad. Training camps give recruits a sense of mission and focus, helping them develop an esprit de corps.18 While in the war zone, callow youths become seasoned combatants. Brutal combat hardens the fighters, making them steady under pressure and giving them a deep sense of loyalty to their comrades‐in‐arms. They also gain immediate and practical skills. Clint Watts notes that Iraq and Afghanistan were “training grounds” for foreign fighters where they learned urban warfare and how to use weapons, including advanced technology.19"
"16","Established insurgent and terrorist groups welcome—and exploit—foreign fighters. A few foreign fighters may be medics or mechanics or otherwise have valuable skills, although this is the exception, not the rule. Others welcome the foreigners for ideological reasons. Still others recruit foreign fighters because they make good cannon fodder and suicide bombers. One study of Iraqi suicide bombing during the height of the civil war found that there were more Europeans serving as suicide bombers than Iraqis.20 Scholar David Malet points out that groups often value foreign fighters because those fighters do not have to worry about retaliation against their families and therefore are more willing to target civilians as part of a group's efforts.21"
"17","Many foreign fighters who go to a war zone are young and ideologically unformed, and the combatant groups see converting them to their worldview as part of their mission: training camps emphasize teaching “true” Islam and the duty of jihad as well as weapons training. So individuals may enter the war with no intention of attacking at home, but their views change and come to encompass a broader set of goals. As one European official succinctly put it to me, “They come back fucked up.”22"
"18","Networks form and strengthen as groups and individuals become connected to one another. Some groups, such as al Qaeda, keep meticulous records, enabling them to track those who work with them and whom they train long after the conflict has ended.23 As Britain's MI5 explains, “foreign fighters can gain combat experience, access to training and a network of overseas extremist contacts. The skills, contacts and status acquired overseas can make these individuals a much greater threat.”24"
"19","In the fourth step, the fighters return to their home countries in the West and keep the circle turning. Returned foreign fighters have gained in status—obtained a sort of “street cred”—that makes them able to recruit and radicalize others.25 Sympathizers admire returnees from Iraq and Afghanistan, giving them the prestige to convince others to enter the fray.26"
"20","In the final step, the returned fighters begin to plot terrorist attacks in their homeland. They turn their attention away from the foreign struggle that took them abroad and begin to focus on perceived injustices at home: insults against Islam from their country's politicians and opinion leaders, support by their fellow countrymen or governments for the forces oppressing Muslims abroad, or the daily prejudices faced by Muslims in America and especially Europe.            "
"21","The model presented in Figure 1 represents a schematic guide to the transformation of foreign fighters into jihadists. As the model suggests, the process is circular, with today's recruits becoming tomorrow's recruiters.            "
"22","Much of the traditional, Afghanistan‐based schematic model of foreign fighters turning into terrorists seems to apply to the current conflict in Syria and Iraq, and many fear that these conflicts will be an even bigger problem. As in past conflicts, foreign fighters appear to be gaining valuable skills and access to terrorist networks. For example, Danish intelligence officials argue that foreign fighters from Denmark “have gained specific military skills” from their time in Syria that would facilitate a terrorist attack and report that some Danish fighters are returning to Denmark, where they can further radicalize local Muslims.27 Similarly, just as they did in past conflicts, foreign fighters today are building networks with dangerous terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and Jabhat al‐Nusra, the official al Qaeda affiliate in Syria.28"
"23","Many of the concerns regarding Syria stem from the large number of foreign fighters involved. By the end of 2015, the Islamic State had attracted about 30,000 foreign Muslim fighters – most were from the Muslim world, but about 5,000 came from the West.29 British expert Peter Neumann contends that Syria is the top “mobilizer for Islamists and jihadists in the last 10 or 20 years … more people from Europe are being mobilized than in all the other foreign conflicts that have happened for the past 20 years taken together.”30 Quantity has a quality all its own; thus, even if this problem has proven to be manageable in the past, its massive growth has caused Western security services to fear that they will not have the resources to deal with the Syria problem.31"
"24","Ease of travel partly explains the large numbers. Traveling to Afghanistan was difficult for would‐be jihadists from Europe and the United States. They had to leave Europe or America and travel to Pakistan or Iran—an expensive, time‐consuming, and dangerous process. Facilitation networks were only just beginning, and information about where to go and whom to contact was often limited and passed by word of mouth."
"25","Syria has proven almost painfully easy to enter. Western volunteers can simply fly, drive, or take a train to Turkey and quickly enter the fray across the border in Syria. Turkey does not require a visa for travelers from European Union countries, enabling foreign fighters to slip in among the millions of tourists from European countries—a relatively cheap and easy journey compared with traveling to Iraq and Afghanistan.32 Trips are self‐funded and social media or even just normal travel agencies can help guide recruits on the trip from Europe across Turkey. Turkish officials, supportive of the anti‐Assad effort, have often been accused of making little effort to stop the flow, although the border had gotten tighter by the fall of 2015.33"
"26","Support for Syrian fighters is popular among elements of Muslim communities in the West, particularly in Europe, according to Western intelligence officials, enhancing the status of volunteers within their communities back home. As one official put it, going to Syria often makes a fighter a hero back home, as he is seen as standing up for his community.34 In addition, local Islamist groups play up the violence there to gain recruits and fund‐raising. These local groups often link the conflict in Syria to problems at home, such as discrimination, or specific affronts, such as cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad.35 Thus, new motivations mingle with existing grievances, and global ones with local ones.            "
"27","Part of the concern is that many fighters are apparently following the banner of the Islamic State—an almost cartoonishly evil terrorist group.36 In 2014, U.S. intelligence officials estimated that the Islamic State had as many as 31,500 fighters.37 The Islamic State's advances in Iraq have given it prestige and created a sense that it is a winner, making it more attractive to young recruits.            "
"28","Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter all emerged during the 2000s as new tools for jihadists to mobilize followers.38 Such tools have taken off around the world and are playing a tremendously influential role in the Syria conflict—it has been called “the most socially mediated civil conflict in history.”39 Groups such as the Islamic State are particularly skilled at using social media to shape their image and recruit fighters.40 At the individual level, foreign fighters use social media to boost their social standing at home—in other words, to look cool—and often pose with impressive‐looking weapons and brag about the fighting they have done. They also post pictures of cats.41"
"29","Nor are the foreign fighters' actions confined to words or attacks abroad. Andrew Zammit's January 2015 survey of plots in Europe found 11 arrests in Europe of plotters linked to groups in Syria such as the Islamic State and Jabhat al‐Nusra. Many of the links are limited or unconfirmed, but in the aggregate, the numbers indicate the legitimacy of the security services' concerns.42 The November 2015 Paris attacks, of course, confirmed the greatest fears of the security services: that foreign fighters would enable a mass casualty attack in the West.            "
"30","Taken together, these factors—some of which are undisputed, others of which are informed conjecture—suggest that Western security services have good reason to be particularly concerned about the flow of their citizens to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq."
"31","The foregoing model presents a disturbing picture that should alarm observers of the threat of returnee violence from Iraq, Syria, and other fields of jihad. It is also overstated. A closer look at previous jihads as well several measurement issues explain the limits of this model and why the threat—while still real—is likely to be less than security officials anticipate, particularly in the United States. Some of the foregoing factors have silver linings or are otherwise more complex than they first appear, and there are numerous mitigating factors that make the conversion rate of foreign fighters into terrorists far lower than might be expected. Government policies can play an important role in further decreasing the dangers foreign fighters pose."
"32","It is useful to consider the precedent of the Iraq War of the 2000s. Two sober and informed analysts warned in 2005 that the Iraq War foreign fighter flow could be “even more dangerous than the fallout from Afghanistan” with regard to terrorism.43 That same year, Central Intelligence Agency director Porter Goss told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that “Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti‐US jihadists.”44 Many dozens of young Western Muslims—one source gives 70 from the United Kingdom and 20 from France through 2006—went to fight in Iraq and, as feared, returned from the fighting with greater prestige.45 In that conflict, volunteers were specifically motivated by anti‐American sentiment and anger at specific European countries such as the United Kingdom that supported the Iraq War.            "
"33","Foreign fighters who went to other jihads—in Somalia and Mali, for example—were also cause for concern. The head of MI5, Jonathan Evans, warned in September 2010 of returnee terrorism from Somalia, and officials in France worried that their country's intervention in Mali would spark terrorism from French residents.46 U.S. officials initially raised concerns about the travel of Somali Americans to fight in Somalia and launched significant investigations but later averred that they were not planning terrorist attacks in the United States: instead, they were “going to war” abroad.47"
"34","However, a survey of major terrorist attacks in Europe from 2003 through 2014 reveals that Iraq and other conflicts did not play nearly as devastating a role as feared. In fact, the number of individuals who went to fight in Iraq and came back to commit terrorist acts may actually be zero, and in any event is a far lower number than originally anticipated.48 Analyst Jean‐Pierre Filiu finds that the Iraq experience contributed to network formation, but these networks were disrupted.49 As Teun van Dongen contends, “Plausible as this may have sounded, no successful terrorist attack has been carried out by a jihadist who gained experience by fighting in Iraq.”50 Foreign fighters returning from conflicts in Somalia, Mali, and elsewhere also were not important to major terrorist attacks.            "
"35","Judgments of the foreign fighter danger are skewed in part because of confusion over how to measure the threat. From a methodological point of view, the numbers should not (but do) include those already violent, radicalized, and trained. In theory, the danger of Syria and Iraq for Western countries is that individuals may return more anti‐Western, more skilled, or both. However, a figure such as Mouhannad Almallah Dabas, a naturalized Spaniard who went to Syria, was already involved in the 2004 Madrid train bombings and other jihadist activity before leaving for a fight abroad—if he were to return and carry out another attack, the foreign conflict would not have been the source of the violence.51 Conversely, Abdul Numan Haider, a young Australian, had his passport taken away in 2014 to prevent him from going to Syria—but this did not stop him from stabbing two Australian security officers.52 As these examples suggest, for a number of individuals, going—or not going—to a war zone does not affect their propensity for violence. Indeed, it is plausible that foreign jihads can actually serve as a diversion for those already radicalized. Hegghammer finds that radicalized Western fighters are more likely to go abroad than to choose violence at home.53"
"36","A related measurement issue is that some of the recruits—particularly those going to fight for the Islamic State after 2013—were criminals who might have committed other forms of violence such as assault and murder, which would not be considered terrorism because they lack a political context. European officials I interviewed in 2014 indicated that an increasing percentage of recruits were from street gangs or otherwise had a history of violence, and part of the appeal of the Islamic State was that they wanted their violence to be legitimated. The Islamic State is developing a “badass” brand, one that may be superseding that of the al Qaeda core, which some see as weak compared with Islamic State.54 Thus, if the measurement is violence, as opposed to political violence, the fight abroad may matter little for some recruits.            "
"37","A final measurement issue is the conflation of plots versus successful operations. When measuring potential threat, including plots is logical: had it not been for the security services disrupting the plot, far more people would have died. When measuring actual threats, however, a regular pattern of disrupted plots suggests competent counterterrorism (or incompetent terrorists).            "
"38","Firm numbers are difficult to determine, as many plots are disrupted early and those convicted are charged with minor crimes, often criminal in nature, making it difficult to assess whether there was a government overreaction or whether the plot was serious.55 Nevertheless, some measures show how common disruption is. Hegghammer's data with plots added in Europe in 2013 and 2014 show the role of foreign fighters but also how often plots are disrupted. In particular, of the 99 post–September 11 attacks and serious plots in the United States and Europe, only 14 succeeded; this excludes many minor cases in which plots were disrupted before they became serious. Of the efforts involving returnees from Syria, only one of 11—Nemmouche—had succeeded as of March 2015.56 The Paris attacks in November 2015 were another grisly terrorism success involving a foreign fighter.            "
"39","Because of the improvement in the performance and capabilities of security services, it is important to separate out the pre– and post–September 11 periods when discussing the foreign fighter danger. Western security services paid little attention to foreign fighters who had returned to their midst from Afghanistan and the Balkans in the 1990s. Not surprisingly, these veterans of foreign jihad were able to organize cells, plot attacks, engage in fund‐raising and recruitment, and otherwise pose a danger to Western countries with only limited opposing pressure.57 However, after September 11 and during the Iraq War in the 2000s, security services were on full alert—as they are now with regard to the fight in Syria and Iraq. As a result, individuals who went to Pakistan, Iraq, and other jihads to train after 2001 were far more likely to be caught than they were before September 11. So it is important to recognize that the one in nine foreign fighters who came back and conducted attacks in the West that Hegghammer identifies includes fighters from a time when security services were not on full alert. Indeed, as Hegghammer himself modestly noted when asked about this question, “The thing about the average that I have put forward is that it is just that: is an average. The challenge is that the return rate—the blow‐back rate if you will—varies enormously between conflicts.” He goes on to add, “Afghanistan, or the AfPak region, has a relatively high return rate. In fact, as many as three‐quarters of the foreign fighters involved in plots in Europe have their background from AfPak, so the point is we cannot extrapolate this ratio to Syria.”58"
"40","With these methodological caveats in mind, it is important to reexamine the standard model to explain why it overpredicts terrorism. A number of factors contribute to a reduced danger at each stage in the model: the lack of desire to carry out attacks back home, terrorist groups that do not prioritize the West, the death of many fighters, the fact that some fighters never come home and simply continue fighting in the next field of jihad, the type of training received, and the role of security services."
"41","Foreign fighters are traveling to war zones, and many die: the fighting is bloody, and the volunteers rarely have effective training. Those who die cannot commit terrorist attacks at home, and thus in some instances, the foreign war reduces the danger because at least some of these individuals might have attacked at home if they had not gone abroad. As one European government official commented, “they are not a concern if they die; only if they come back.”59 Data on death rates are poor, however, and they vary considerably. Hegghammer finds that death rates vary from less than 5 percent among those who traveled to Afghanistan in the 1980s—again, suggesting how exceptional that period was—to more than 90 percent in Chechnya in the late 1990s.60 The death toll is likely to be high in the current conflict in Syria and Iraq because of the ferocity of the fighting (and infighting) there. Preliminary numbers are vague, but estimates by Western intelligence services given in interviews suggest that perhaps 20 percent of those who have traveled from the West to join the fight have died in combat and that these numbers may be increasing because of internal infighting.61 A Pentagon official claimed in October 2015 that 20,000 have died since the U.S. intervention began,62 suggesting that the mortality rate has increased since the August 2014 U.S. intervention.63"
"42","Some of those who survive still do not return home, either because they are now committed to finishing the fight (or taking it to a new foreign land) or because they can no longer return to their home country without fear of arrest—or both. The motivation of perceived community defense, which led many to fight in the first place, applies more neatly to other antiforeign jihads in the Muslim world than to terrorism back at home."
"43","When the anti‐Soviet struggle in Afghanistan ended, fighters dispersed to Bosnia, Chechnya, and other conflict zones, as well as to Pakistan and Sudan. In Syria and Iraq, many foreign fighters have made a point of declaring that they have no intention of returning home, even burning their passports in videos posted on the Internet.64 One European intelligence official estimated that perhaps 10 percent to 20 percent of foreign fighters do not plan to go back to their home countries—ever. Many of these are probably among the most zealous. Indeed, many jihadist leaders—including many most interested in attacks in the West—oppose going abroad to fight.65 They worry, correctly, that jihadists abroad are neglecting their “duties” at home. These fighters pose a danger to other Muslim countries but not directly to the West.66"
"44","Most foreign fighters do not die or stay abroad, but they have several reasons for not taking up arms when they return. In some cases, the jihad itself may have turned them off. Civil wars are brutal and often involve attacks on civilians and—particularly in the Syrian and Iraqi cases—fellow Muslims. Even when fighters are not turned off by the brutality, the tough living and fighting conditions often sour the adventure and make them want to leave. According to one intelligence official, “some come back and are terrified.” Many of these guys “went for the t‐shirt and the pictures” but saw awful things.67 That official believed perhaps 30 percent to 40 percent of those who went to fight return disillusioned or have no intention of attacking at home.               "
"45","Infighting among jihadist groups is making this disillusionment even more real in Syria and Iraq and is already discouraging some would‐be foreign fighters from traveling to the conflict zone. One study of returnees to the Netherlands and Belgium from March 2013 found that infighting among Muslim groups disillusioned many of the returnees—and this study was carried out before serious fighting between the Islamic State and Jabhat al‐Nusra began.68 As of late June 2014, this fighting had taken thousands of lives, and the numbers have only grown.69 Such infighting particularly affects the foreign fighters, who cannot fall back on local networks to protect them. In the first half of 2014, there were five known deaths of British nationals in Syria; four were from infighting.70"
"46","Most of the Westerners who travel to Syria and Iraq do not speak the language, do not understand local culture, and are poor fighters. In addition, they are easier to mistreat because, unlike local fighters, they do not have families who would protest or take revenge. A European intelligence officer indicated that some foreign fighters are executed as presumed spies.71 Despite rather glamorous photos posted online, many are actually tasked with performing dull logistical duties (including unpleasant ones such as burying bodies) or are quickly given the honor of becoming suicide bombers.72"
"47","Some fighters may return glorifying jihad and proud of their role in the fighting—but that does not mean they want to bring the war home. Fighting overseas did not change their minds. As one study of foreign fighters in history found, “The vast majority of them went on to lead essentially ordinary lives,” even if they remained politically active.73"
"48","Indeed, this tendency may be more likely for fighters going to Iraq and Syria. In the past, Western foreign fighters were motivated to join the fight by a romantic desire to defend Islam and Muslims under threat. Most cases historically involved Muslim countries that suffered from invasion or attacks by non‐Muslim countries: Afghanistan (the Soviet Union and later the United States), Bosnia (Serbia), Chechnya (Russia), Kashmir (India), Iraq (the United States), and Somalia (Ethiopia) are among the most prominent examples."
"49","At the start, simply defending the Syrian people against the regime's brutality was the primary motivation of many foreign fighters, not defending them against a Western or other “foreign” enemy. Most joined the fight to gain bragging rights among their friends or to seek “excitement and adventure.”74 In their eyes, Syria seemed an admirable and an honorable way for them to do so. But, in contrast to most previous struggles, the fight in Syria and more recently Iraq does not involve a non‐Muslim invader or an established and corrupt (at least in the eyes of the jihadists) Sunni regime, as in Yemen. Rather, the conflict plays on Sunni prejudices against (and sometimes even pure hatred of) Shia Muslims—a sentiment that grew during the Iraqi civil war and has blossomed further during the Syrian conflict. The Syrian and Iraqi regimes have deliberately and successfully portrayed the conflict as sectarian to discredit the opposition and to unify non‐Sunnis around the governments. Many in the opposition, in turn, have embraced sectarianism.75"
"50","A second new motivation is eschatological: recruiters play on a discourse that the apocalypse is under way and that the conflict in Syria is the battle between the forces of God and his enemies. The hadith (the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) emphasize the importance of Syria as the scene of the last battles.76 This motivates only a minority of those going to fight in the new wars, but it reflects the view that Syria is at the heart of the Arab and Muslim worlds, both historically and symbolically.               "
"51","Third, many recruits travel to fight because they want to live in what they consider a true Islamic State. The group emphasizes this in its propaganda, stressing images of the “good life.” Although the Islamic State's propaganda machine churns out endless images of graphic violence, it also shows images of Ferris wheels and the delivery of sweets to the elderly.77 Indeed, the Islamic State has attracted hundreds of female volunteers, who often stress their domestic fulfillment in their propaganda as well as their commitment to jihad.78"
"52","These common motivations concern Iraq and Syria, not what is happening in the West."
"53","So while conflict abroad often enjoys legitimacy, terrorism at home does not. Waging guerrilla war against conventional forces is easier to justify doctrinally than terrorism against civilians, particularly outside a combat zone.79 Similarly, the social status that comes with fighting abroad is far greater than that of committing terrorist attacks at home—it is one thing to be seen as a heroic soldier fighting an invading army but quite another to be seen as a terrorist who bombs his own country.               "
"54","Some returnees become integrated into their communities upon return and have little desire to engage in violence. In addition, many Muslim communities themselves feel a strong sense of loyalty to their countries—such loyalty in general is stronger in the United States than in Europe—and turn in potential terrorists. This may be because of genuine opposition to the violence or because they fear the consequences for their community if they do not cooperate with law enforcement.80"
"55","Finally, foreign fighters may not want to carry out attacks back in their home countries for the simple fact that such attacks could endanger their own friends and neighbors. Abdisalan Hussein Ali, a Somali American from Minnesota who blew himself up in an attack on African Union troops in Mogadishu in October 2011, told a friend in Minneapolis a couple of years before he left for Somalia that he would never attack the United States. “Why would I do that?,” the friend recalled Ali saying. “My mom could be walking down the street.”81"
"56","Although al Qaeda, the Islamic State, and similar movements share general anti‐Western goals, they vary tremendously in the degree to which they prioritize this. Officials I interviewed as well as a British parliamentary report noted that those who trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan became far more dangerous to the West than those who went to Iraq (despite the presence of an al Qaeda affiliate there), “where there was not the same degree of hostility against the West.”82 Again, this is why Afghanistan and Pakistan should be considered a separate category: the group doing much of the training there, al Qaeda, had a strong anti‐Western focus and imparted that to its recruits.               "
"57","The groups fighting in Syria and Iraq today are not focused primarily on the United States or Europe: in this sense, they are more like the groups that operated in Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion than the al Qaeda core in Afghanistan and Pakistan. To be clear, they have anti‐Western values and would be pleased to see attacks on the West—and the Paris attacks in particular suggest that they are devoting some resources to this objective. However, in contrast to al Qaeda, as Hegghammer contends, the groups in Syria and Iraq today “are not systematically trying to mount operations in the west”83 and are far more focused on killing Shia Muslims than on killing Westerners.               "
"58","The Islamic State seeks to build, well, an Islamic state—but on its own terms. As such, it has gone beyond terrorism and even insurgency, establishing an army and state‐like structures in the vast territory it controls. In contrast to al Qaeda, it does not see itself as a vanguard that wants to force the West to withdraw from the Middle East and rouse the Muslim world. Rather, it wants to build a state, purify it, and then expand it. Fighting its immediate enemies such as the Alawite regime in Syria, the Shiite regime in Iraq, and supposed enemies within like religious minorities and disloyal Sunnis, are its most important goals. Terrorism in the West is a way of striking back at enemies and advertising itself to potential recruits, but it is not at the core of its objectives.84 Many of the plots supposedly linked to the Islamic State do not involve any operational link to the group but rather are inspired by it, often involving individuals who did not travel abroad to fight—a problem of “lone wolf” and homegrown terrorism not directly linked to foreign fighters.               "
"59","Even groups like Jabhat al‐Nusra that are linked to the globally oriented al Qaeda core are still focused more on the local struggle than on the West. These jihadist groups are fighting a civil war, and the demands of combat are overwhelming. They want foreign fighters to help the fight; attacking the West is usually a lesser priority. The case of the American suicide bomber Abusalha, which so alarms U.S. officials, actually illustrates the local focus of these groups. Leaving his home in Florida, Abusalha joined Jabhat al‐Nusra, whose formal affiliation with al Qaeda makes it nominally more focused on the United States and the West. Yet even he—a seemingly perfect candidate to strike the United States—was used for Jabhat al‐Nusra's local campaign."
"60","The focus on the immediate civil war shapes the skills that fighters learn. Small arms proficiency and guerrilla tactics, for example, are at the core of many Syrian groups' tactics; conducting surveillance, building an underground network, operating clandestinely, and other skills useful for conducting terrorist attacks—especially terrorist attacks in hypervigilant Western countries—are not always part of the curriculum. In Afghanistan, foreign fighters did not become a threat to the West during the struggle against the Soviet Union or during the Afghan civil war that followed. Rather, they became a threat after the Taliban took control of most of Afghanistan in the mid‐1990s and al Qaeda was able to profit from the relative calm to set up camps that trained foreign fighters in the techniques of terrorism. Yet Afghanistan was more the exception than the rule, as most jihadist groups focus on civil wars. As Hegghammer cautions, foreign fighters linked to al Qaeda are too often seen in terms of terrorism, when in reality, “They are insurgents in every respect but their passports.”85"
"61","In Syria and Iraq, the civil war rages on, and those foreign fighters who are trained are primarily learning how to fight that war. Danish intelligence notes that Danes who travel to Syria learn how to handle weapons but is more speculative on whether they are actually trained in terrorist‐related skills, noting simply that individuals have an “opportunity” to do so.86 Interviews with European intelligence officials also suggest that training is limited—the emphasis is on small arms training, although there is probably some explosives and sniper training.87"
"62","Proficiency with small arms and guerilla tactics are still valuable skills, and the networks and steadiness gained from combat are useful to domestic groups. The Paris attackers used a mix of small arms, bombs, and suicide vests to do their operations. Still, these are not master terrorism classes. Mehdi Nemmouche, the French national who is suspected of murder at the Jewish Museum of Belgium, proficiently used his weapons to do the killing—a skill he might have picked up in Syria—but the fact that he did not quickly dispose of his weapons and attracted the attention of security services looking for drug runners illustrates both the dangers and limits of the skill set.88"
"63","When extrapolating from Afghanistan to the threat today, security services often miss the most important variable that shapes the risk of attacks: the security services themselves."
"64","Security services grew after September 11, particularly the component focused on terrorism. Before September 11, only a small number of intelligence analysts worked on al Qaeda, with even fewer focusing on the foreign fighter issue. The Washington Post reports that U.S. intelligence budgets have more than doubled since September 11 and that the United States spent more than $17 billion on counterterrorism intelligence in 2013.89 European states also increased spending on counterterrorism after September 11, and this has continued despite severe budget issues during the global financial crisis.90 After the Paris attacks, intelligence budgets are likely to grow even more.               "
"65","Western security services vary tremendously in their competence, size, legal authority, and approach to counterterrorism. Regardless of all these differences, the Western security services have several advantages when it comes to detecting and disrupting potential plots that security services in other less advanced countries do not have. When Western foreign fighters travel abroad, their absence is usually discovered by the local security services. My interviews indicate that many volunteers come from known criminal or radical circles that police or security services were already monitoring.91 Other information may come from a sudden absence from receiving various social welfare benefits, appalled and fearful family members, or informants within the community.               "
"66","Community members are often particularly useful for identifying individuals who have already radicalized but are not yet on the radar screen. In addition, such efforts are usually cumulative: individuals who go to Syria or Iraq may be linked to other current or potential volunteers as well as existing radical networks of which security services may not previously have been aware. Because so many returnees are known, it is hard for them to form the types of large, local networks that would be necessary to carry out a large‐scale attack without attracting the attention of the security services. European security services attest that although the number of their citizens going to Syria is large and threatening, they have a fairly good handle on who most, but not all, of these individuals are. Indeed, the mastermind of the Paris attacks appears to have been well known to French and Belgian intelligence services, and there were numerous opportunities to disrupt his plans.92 As one French official told me, “Every time a network gets big, they make mistakes and get discovered.”93"
"67","Because it is easy to join these networks, it is relatively easy to infiltrate agents into them. Additionally, some of the individuals who join can be turned, used as informers or as spokesmen to discredit the group. Playing up grievances individuals have from their jihadist experiences, threatening the guilty with jail time, and other methods can work to transform fighters into intelligence assets."
"68","Social media is an important means of fund‐raising, recruitment, and travel facilitation for jihadist groups, but it also involves huge risks for them. By publicizing activities on social media—so useful for bragging rights back home—individuals identify themselves to security services and at times provide incriminating information and valuable intelligence, such as their group affiliation, presence when atrocities are being committed, intentions, and comrades. In addition, social media and the associated analysis of “friends” and “followers” can enable intelligence services to rapidly understand broader networks of influence and conspiracy as well as identify when foreign fighters might return home.94 As one observer put it, some potential terrorists were “totally invisible” until they went off to fight and exposed themselves on the Internet.95 A European government official noted that despite the recent revelations by Edward Snowden about the National Security Agency and years of spying on terrorists, many remain “totally oblivious” to the abilities of Western signals intelligence agencies.96 As John Mueller put it 2014, “We've had 13 years in which officials talk about how they listen to ‘chatter’ by jihadists, and yet the jihadists continue to chatter.”97"
"69","Effective policy can reduce the danger of returnees even more dramatically. Using the revised model I have outlined, we can think of policies that will make individuals more likely to take “off‐ramps” at each stage in the journey."
"70","In the decision stage, it makes sense to reduce the numbers of those going to the conflict zone in the first place by interfering in the decision to go. After all, those who do not go cannot be radicalized by foreign fighting. The Danish government has an extensive program to talk to potential volunteers before they go to Syria, working with families and local authorities. They stress the dangers of fighting and the consequences, such as losing welfare benefits, as well as peaceful alternatives to help the Syrian people. Both Denmark and France have recently set up hotlines for family and community members to alert authorities that someone might travel to Syria. Britain also has a “Prevent” program designed to decrease extremism, with its “Channel” effort being particularly valuable. Particularly important is targeting what terrorism expert William McCants calls “law‐abiding supporters”—those who embrace jihadist ideas on social media or are otherwise clearly at risk of joining a terrorist group but have not yet broken the law.98 Using community interventions and otherwise trying to move these people off the path of violence will prevent the stark choice of jail or Syria and give family members of potential recruits a reason to seek out government help.         "
"71","Western countries should push a counternarrative that stresses the brutality of the conflict and the internecine violence among jihadists.99 These briefings can build trust between communities and the government, both helping law enforcement efforts and preventing radicalization. However, in general, governments are poor at developing counternarratives and lack community credibility. It is usually better to elevate existing voices of community leaders who already embrace the counternarrative than to try to handle this directly through government channels. Danish officials found that the stories of infighting are one of the few arguments that dissuade potential foreign fighters from leaving in the first place and that they are particularly convincing if the stories come from returnees: “We tell them you might end up shooting at one of your comrades down the block.”100"
"72","Also vital is developing peaceful alternatives for helping the people affected by the conflicts in the Middle East. Some fighters—certainly not all but a significant portion—were originally motivated by a genuine desire to defend the Syrian people against the brutality of the Assad regime. Indeed, the rhetoric of Western leaders, including President Obama, embraces this goal as well. Encouraging charitable activities, identifying legitimate channels for assistance, and otherwise highlighting what concerned individuals can do to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people may siphon off some of the supply of foreign fighters, though this is less likely for those inspired by the Islamic State today."
"73","For the second stage, travel, disrupting the transit route via Turkey is one of the most promising ways of reducing the threat of foreign fighters to Europe and the United States. Doing so will primarily require better cooperation between Western governments and Turkish authorities, who stepped up border security efforts in late 2015 but have not always seen stopping fighters who seek to overthrow Assad from reaching the battlefield as their highest priority.101"
"74","Security cooperation among European services and between European and American services is also essential. Intelligence collected from the communications of foreign fighters, shared open‐source monitoring, and other information from one service can prove vital for discovering transnational networks. Cooperation within Europe is indispensable for stopping travel, as jihadists from one European country often try to travel to Turkey and then on to Syria via another European country in order to avoid detection. The Paris attacks mastermind traveled to several European countries, and poor coordination meant intelligence services missed chances to stop the attack.102"
"75","It is harder to reach foreign fighters when they are training and fighting in Iraq and Syria, but even here, there are subtle ways of influencing the terrorist production function beyond military efforts to kill Islamic State members. Western security agencies should do everything they can to sow doubt in the minds of extremist leaders in Iraq and Syria about the true loyalties of Western Muslim volunteers. Highlighting information gained from recruits and even disinformation about the degree of infiltration by security services can heighten fears. If jihadist organizations come to view foreigners as potential spies or as corrupting influences, they might assign them to noncombat roles, test their allegiance by offering them the one‐way ticket of suicide bombing, or even avoid recruiting them altogether.         "
"76","When foreign fighters return, it is critical to turn them away from violence and jihad. Western services report that they often know when individuals return and that many return with doubts. As a first step, security services must triage returnees, identifying which ones deserve the most attention. At present, triaging is done inconsistently (and in some cases not at all) among the Western security services. Inevitably, some dangerous individuals will be missed, and some individuals identified as not particularly dangerous might later become a threat, but a first look is vital for prioritization.         "
"77","Community programs deserve considerable attention. The goal should be to move potential terrorists toward nonviolence; as many are in that category already, hounding all of them with the threat of inevitable arrest or otherwise creating a sense of alienation can backfire. In the past, family and community members have at times been successful in steering returned fighters toward a different path, even getting them to inform on their former comrades.103 Indeed, sending returnees to jail for relatively minor crimes such as going abroad to fight with a foreign terrorist organization against a distant enemy may simply put them in prison for a few years and expose them to the radicalizing elements present in many European prisons, where minor players may become exposed to hardened jihadists and integrate into broader networks;104 this happened with several of the Charlie Hebdo attackers, who became far more dangerous after being imprisoned.105"
"78","Harsh steps are at times necessary, but they must be applied carefully or else they may backfire. For example, when an individual on the fence knows he will face imprisonment upon return, he may feel he has less to lose by moving toward terrorism at home. As Shiraz Maher put it, “this makes the decision for you.”106 Such coercive measures can also create “suspect communities” where radicalization is more likely and where community members are less likely to work with the police and government in general.107 As one expert told me, in these communities, young Muslims “hear they are different and dangerous” and thus are more prone to leave for Syria and Iraq.108"
"79","Politically, however, it is easier to take harsh steps, as missing a threat is treated more harshly than is creating one that did not exist before. Even more challenging, some fighters may need psychological counseling: the horrors of Syria and Iraq are as bad as any war, and many returnees have post‐traumatic stress disorder, according to Western security officials.109 Although it may be politically difficult to propose spending money to care for people whom many consider terrorists, failing to do so is likely to lead to violence that could have been prevented. If individuals who need counseling fear they are likely to be imprisoned instead, any psychological disorders they may have are more likely to be left untreated.         "
"80","To disrupt foreign fighters in the fifth and final stage of plotting terrorist attacks, security services must remain focused on the returnee problem and have sufficient resources to monitor the problem as it emerges in their countries. Maintaining vigilance as the numbers increase will be difficult purely for reasons of resources in many countries.110 Jihadists in France, Australia, and elsewhere who conducted attacks fell off the radar screen despite being known to security services, in part because of resource constraints. So ameliorating the foreign fighter threat requires security services that are resourced. In addition, countries' legal codes must enable robust action against terrorists.         "
"81","Keeping track of that many suspects, particularly if it involves full‐time surveillance, is exceptionally resource intensive. The Australian security services estimate that it will cost 8 million Australian dollars (US$7.4 million) per year to monitor just one returning jihadist around the clock.111 Yet failing to monitor a known suspect would be difficult to justify in hindsight after an attack. As one intelligence official explained to me, “This is what gets directors fired.” For intelligence services, often the problem is not accessing or gathering the data but processing, analyzing, and following up on it in a timely manner. “The data are buried in a mountain of data,” noted the same European analyst.112"
"82","There is a “Goldilocks” problem for security services. If they succeed in thwarting attacks, they may not receive sufficient resources. This gives them an incentive to exaggerate the threat in order to maintain sufficient resources for the manpower‐intensive effort to keep track of the many returned foreign fighters. This problem is particularly acute among several European countries, which have spent far less than the United States on security and counterterrorism in the post–September 11 era. After bloody attacks like those in Paris in 2015, however, European resources are likely to increase."
"83","The United States has an advantage over Europe when it comes to the likely threat. Although the United States is probably higher on the Islamic State's enemies list than other countries, far fewer Americans have gone to Iraq and Syria to fight, relative to overall population levels. In addition, American security services are well‐resourced and focused on the problem, and coordination within the United States is far easier than within Europe. Attacks on U.S. facilities in other countries or cross‐border infiltration from Canada, where a far greater percentage of the population has gone to Syria and Iraq to fight, may prove a bigger problem.113"
"84","Security cooperation among European services and between European and American services is absolutely necessary. During the last war in Iraq, networks of fighters with Iraq experience were disrupted in part by European, Arab, and American security cooperation.114 As noted earlier, intelligence from the communications of foreign fighters, shared open‐source monitoring, and other information obtained by one service can prove crucial for discovering transnational networks, and cooperation within Europe is critical for stopping travel.115 In my 2014 interviews, many European officials were more worried about attacks emanating from their neighbors (Denmark from Sweden; France from Belgium) than they are about attacks from their own soil, where they are confident in their surveillance capabilities. The Paris attacks, where key individuals came from Belgium, proved these fears correct.         "
"85","Several of these potential “off‐ramps”—both natural and from effective policy—are represented graphically in Figure 2. As the figure makes clear, there is no single factor or moment that prevents foreign fighters from doing terrorist attacks back home, and some still must be monitored, arrested, and jailed because they are irredeemable. However, at each stage in the process, mitigating factors and policy interventions can affect the likelihood of an attack.         "
"86","This article has argued that the threat of foreign fighters returning home to commit terrorist attacks in the West is real but can be overstated. The potential threat is considerable, but the actual threat is significantly lower. I find that there is no single cause that reduces the threat, but rather a combination of factors—the deaths of fighters, their staying on in a war zone, and their lack of a desire to attack at home—explains the surprisingly low threat. Two factors are most important. The first is the attitude of the groups themselves. Historically, the Islamic State has not prioritized the West, although the Paris attacks suggest this may be changing. Also important are the skills of security services, and if they are well resourced, this has a significant impact on the danger. But some attacks in Europe and the United States will still occur. The measure of success should not be zero: that would force the United States and its allies to spend billions more and perhaps adopt more intrusive security measures to counter a lucky individual or a flash‐in‐the‐pan cell with no guarantee of success."
"87","Terrorism, unfortunately, has become a feature of modern life. It cannot be eradicated, only controlled. Yet it is important not to panic and to recognize that both the United States and Europe have dealt with this problem before and already have measures in place to greatly reduce the threat of terrorism from jihadist returnees and to limit the scale of any attacks that might occur."
