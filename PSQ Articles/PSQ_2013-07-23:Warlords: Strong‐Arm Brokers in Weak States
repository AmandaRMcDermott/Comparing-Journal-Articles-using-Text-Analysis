"1","Some countries do not have effective domestic sovereignty. In these “weak states,” the central government lacks the will or capacity to enforce contracts, punish criminals, or deter terrorists in all parts of the internationally recognized territory. Kimberly Marten's new book, Warlords: Strong‐Arm Brokers in Weak States, chronicles how order is subcontracted. Marten defines warlords as “individuals who control small pieces of territory using a combination of force and patronage” and who “rule in defiance of genuine state sovereignty but through the complicity of state leaders” (p. 3). What exactly is meant by “complicity of state leaders” varies substantially by context, but at base, Marten employs an extended delegation metaphor: “the principal actor (the state) relies on an agent (the warlord) to fulfill assigned tasks” (p. 30). The empirical chapters then take the reader on a sweeping tour of the peripheries of Iraq, Russia, Georgia, and Pakistan. Warlords demonstrates that in all of these places, state officials can be either hoodwinked or coerced into letting charismatic local authorities build their own invisible patronage networks. Though the theoretical insights are neither new nor controversial to students of comparative politics, the particulars of why resources are funneled to local violence entrepreneurs at the periphery of empire make for a compelling read.         "
"2","A virtue of Marten's principal‐agent framework is that it allows the reader to identify the state in bas‐relief, the backdrop against which the warlord moves. What is foreclosed by this approach is the possibility that the state itself is nothing more than a contingent bargain between violence entrepreneurs, as proposed by Harrison Wagner (2007) in his discussion of Rousseau's stag hunt. This is not an abstract theoretical problem, but an empirical one. Consider Georgia or Tajikistan circa 1994. “The state” was quite obviously a group of warlords that had colluded together to seize the capital and install a figurehead civilian president. Manipulating the boundary between the coalition of warlords that are allowed to become the state and the warlords that are left adrift to be criminalized and jailed was the practical stuff of civil war settlement. But these politics are obscured by a definition that treats warlords as already and always distinct from the state.         "
"3","The book concludes with 11 provocative hypotheses, obviously meant to provide signposts for future policy elites. After so many pages of the textured case data, a return to decontextualized abstractions was jarring. Marten's bottom line seems to be that waltzing with warlords, expedient in the short run, trades off with state legitimacy in the long run, and is only defensible if “warlords truly are the least bad alternative” (p. 200)."
"4","Marten pivots between roles, variously presenting herself as an academic specialist, investigative journalist, and editorial essayist. Opinions and speculations on the optimal American foreign policy, or on “social evolution” of distant societies (p. 62), are too often presented as if they were well‐established factual statements. But with that said, for North American teachers looking to introduce the North Caucasus with a lively seminar discussion, I recommend assigning chapter 5, Marten's biography of Ramzan Kadyrov—the archetype of the charismatic, media‐savvy (p. 133), self‐aware, celebrity gangster. He has money, weapons, sociopaths on speed‐dial, political protection from great powers, and a twitter feed @RKadyrov. The story of how this man came to bind himself to the fortunes of Moscow's ruling class is essentially the story of the settlement of the Second Chechen War.         "
