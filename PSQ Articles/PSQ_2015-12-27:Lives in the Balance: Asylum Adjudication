"1","The United States is obligated under international law to provide protection to individuals fleeing persecution and torture in their home country. When an individual asks for that protection in the form of asylum, the legal process that he or she faces most often starts in a very small division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) known as the Asylum Office. There, asylum officers in eight regional offices must contend with horrific stories of abuse, increasingly complicated and restrictive legal standards, and far too little time to devote to decision making. However, the consequences of asylum decisions are enormous. The erroneous denial of an asylum claim can lead to the return of a bona fide refugee to a country where his or her life or freedom is at risk."
"2","In Lives in the Balance, authors Andrew I. Schoenholtz, Philip G. Schrag, and Jaya Ramji‐Nogales comprehensively analyze, for the first time, a database of more than 380,000 asylum applications filed with the DHS from 1 October 1995 to 8 June 2009, leading to valuable insights and policy recommendations. The data in this book are a distillation of exhaustive data compiled at an accompanying Web site and builds on work done by the same authors in an earlier book, Refugee Roulette: Disparities in Asylum Adjudication and Proposals for Reform. The analysis in Lives in the Balance is both quantitative and qualitative, as the authors also interviewed asylum officers and reviewed information provided in questionnaires administered by the DHS.         "
"3","While the authors note that the asylum adjudication system is working well in several ways, much of Lives in the Balance is dedicated to revealing and examining significant findings on disparities in decisions made by asylum officers. The authors meticulously demonstrate that asylum grant rates vary, at times significantly, by regional asylum office, as well as by individual asylum officers. Thus, regardless of the merits of a particular claim, where an applicant decides to settle and therefore apply for asylum has a great impact on his or her chances of obtaining asylum, as does the officer to whom the applicant is randomly assigned. The authors persuasively argue for a variety of reforms to mitigate these disparities, including increasing interaction between asylum officers and regional offices, allowing more time for adjudication, and requiring law degrees for officers.         "
"4","The most important and compelling recommendation made in Lives in the Balance is to eliminate the one‐year filing deadline for asylum. A significant portion of the book is spent examining the one‐year deadline and assessing claims that were rejected by asylum officers for failing to meet the deadline. The authors found that during the 11‐year period they covered, the one‐year deadline led to the rejection of a substantial number of claims that otherwise would have likely resulted in a grant of asylum, affecting 15,792 applicants and 5,843 family members. In addition to the immeasurable and heartbreaking cost of rejecting applications from bona fide refugees, the authors argue that the process of determining whether the one‐year deadline is applicable leads to a waste of government time and resources.         "
"5","The statistical analysis in this book is dense at times, as is the depth of the discussion of asylum law and the U.S. asylum process. However, the authors present their data and findings clearly, with straightforward language and reasoning. Without a doubt, Lives in the Balance is a groundbreaking contribution to the study of U.S. asylum law and a comprehensive work on which much future analysis will be based. It should be required reading for not just those who represent asylum seekers or adjudicate asylum claims but for anyone who wishes to understand or reform the U.S. asylum system.         "
