"1","Mark Rank and his colleagues join a long list of authors (truth in advertising: including myself) who have struggled for decades to elucidate the bittersweet meaning and motivational force of the American Dream. The metaphor's first definer, James Truslow Adams, lauded it in 1931 as the “dream of being able to grow to fullest development as man and woman . . . unrepressed by social orders which had developed for the benefit of classes rather than for the simple human being of any and every class.” In the same paragraph, he captures the American Dream's maddeningly Janus‐faced quality: although “realized more fully . . . here than anywhere else,” it “has been realized . . . very imperfectly even among ourselves.” Rank, Hirschl, and Foster add two elements to the robust literature on this complex concept: extensive quotations from subjects of qualitative interviews and focus groups and an analysis of individuals’ economic well‐being over their lifetimes through life table models derived from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). They also make good use of census data, other scholarship, and some survey data."
"2","Chasing the American Dream is well written, cleanly organized, and generally compelling. It starts with chapters organized around three interviewees who exemplify the themes of passion for the freedom to become whatever one wants to be, the need for economic security in order to benefit from that freedom, and the persistence of hope and optimism even when faced with failure, bad luck, or mistreatment. Some historical or social context surrounds each theme, and data displays, usually but not always from the PSID, buttress each set of quotations.         "
"3","The book then shifts the balance to a focus on the data, supported by quotations from interviews or focus groups. These chapters address “the pathways that allow individuals and families to live out the American Dream” (p. 65), including the nature and trajectory of the economic opportunity structure, changes in patterns of upward and downward mobility, and the cumulative (dis)advantages attendant on race or class. (Despite Adams's hint, the authors do not examine gender, and the PSID does not permit them to examine recent decades of immigration.) The authors add, fascinatingly, a chapter on serendipitous events that yank people off of their presumed pathway (sadly, it eschews quantitative analyses). Chasing the American Dream concludes with two chapters of summary and policy recommendations, generally a liberal laundry list focused on new government policies (for what it is worth, I concur with their recommendations).         "
"4","I see few flaws in Chasing the American Dream, so far as it goes (except that I am not a sociologist). The quotes are moving (I have many stars in the margins), the life table models are illuminating—presented with just enough information and exposition, and more detail in the footnotes and appendices for us obsessives—and the balance between hope and despair seems about right. So, as reviewers are wont to do, I will point to a few things that the authors did not do, but should have in my view. They ignore gender and make no effort to use non‐PSID data to fill in the hugely important arena of recent immigration. Their chapter on cumulative inequalities does not, in fact, present evidence on the accumulation of inequalities, contenting itself instead with separate analyses by race and by education. They quote recent polls but do not show trajectories of public opinion over time, and they do not provide essential comparisons so that we know how to interpret their own fascinating survey item. Perhaps most importantly, Rank and his coauthors do little to integrate the finding that most Americans are in fact upwardly mobile for at least part of their lives with their extensive findings on the failures and ambivalences of the American Dream.         "
"5","We are left with powerful confirmation that Adams was right in his characterization of the American Dream as very imperfectly realized. But the findings on why and how inequalities cumulate, economic insecurity grows, the middle class is hollowed out, hard work often does not pay off, and “twists of fate” damage plans are not reconciled with the findings that “a surprising number of individuals will find themselves in households that reach or exceed” levels of reasonable affluence (p. 96) and that “during long stretches of time, many people [in the United States] will experience upward as well as downward mobility” (p. 100). The old cliché of dream intertwined with nightmare still pertains."
