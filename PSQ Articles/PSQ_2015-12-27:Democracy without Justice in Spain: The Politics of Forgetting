"1","Omar G. Encarnación argues that Spain defied norms concerning transitional justice by sidestepping issues of culpability from its civil war and dictatorship (1939–1975). In the mid‐1970s transition to democracy, the left and the right agreed to what amounted to a “pact of forgetting” (el pacto del olvido) in order to focus on democratization, economic development, and Spain's integration with its European neighbors. Encarnación investigates the details of Spain's “forgetting” and concludes with a consideration of its implications for larger claims about the importance of transitional justice. His descriptions include discussion of the 1977 amnesty law, the decision to leave intact public celebrations of the civil war victors (such as the Valle de los Caídos monument in which Francisco Franco is buried), and the sanitizing of almost all official references to the war and its aftermath.         "
"2","In the process, Encarnación reviews a great deal of post‐transition political discourse and practice concerning Spain's modern history. He advances explanations, for example, for why the left accepted the pact (pp. 55–70), although his evidence is throughout more essayistic than methodical. The book considers the Socialist government's 2007 law of “historical memory,” which lightly revisits some portions of the pact of forgetting. Encarnación mentions the charge by some Spanish conservatives that this law was pursued more for partisan reasons than for a true concern with the past. The project certainly had several hallmarks of that: it was pursued at a time when the Socialists were politically precarious rather than strong; it emphasized an issue that united the Spanish left while dividing the right; and it was not obviously primarily about “memory” in a serious sense, as only Spaniards 70 and older in 2007 were old enough to have been even preteens in 1950 (former prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was born more than two decades after the war ended)."
"3","The largest challenge hanging over this book is the question of whether transitional justice has, in fact, influenced the outcome on which most Spaniards seem to have focused: stabilizing democracy. Spain's democratic success does not seem to have been at all affected by the failure to mete out transitional justice. One could add that this is true not just of Spain. Western European countries have very uneven records concerning transitional justice after numerous nondemocratic episodes in the twentieth century, but there is little evidence of corresponding variation in the quality or stability of their later democracies."
"4","Encarnación sometimes uses language suggesting that the past must be reckoned with, referring, for instance, to “suppression” of memories and “amnesia” about the past. But he acknowledges straightforwardly that claims in favor of transitional justice “do not detract from the overwhelming success of democracy in the post‐Francoist era” (p. 17). He devotes the last chapter to the proposition that the Spanish case may demonstrate that questions of transitional justice must be contextualized rather than one size fits all. Specifically, there may be contexts in which principled pursuit of these forms of justice may be unnecessary or even unhelpful. Here, as elsewhere, there can be costs to both action and inaction. In these cases, inaction can leave victims and their relatives outraged, but it may be no more unhealthy than keeping anger and grief active long after they have served any useful purpose."
