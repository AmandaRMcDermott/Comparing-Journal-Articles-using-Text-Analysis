"1","In this book, Jeni Whalan has united the literatures on power and legitimacy with the technicalities of peace operations in a novel, significant, and thoroughly convincing manner. Whalan's cross‐disciplinary analysis provides an excellent typology for understanding the crucially important role of legitimacy in peace operations. Most studies of peacekeeping focus on problems of effectiveness without seriously considering what Whalan calls the “currencies of power.” These currencies are adapted from Ian Hurd's framework (“Legitimacy and Authority in International Politics,” International Organization 53 [Spring 1999]: 379–408) and mirror the central debates in international relations between realists, liberals, and constructivists, whereby power is exercised through coercion (sticks), inducement (carrots), or legitimacy (normatively appropriate actions). In Whalan's analysis, “The resilience of legitimate power explains the qualitatively better cooperation secured through legitimacy than that attained by coercion or inducement” (p. 66). She goes on to explain further: “Legitimation is a causal process that leads actors to cooperate with a peace operation based on the belief that the operation is right, fair, and appropriate in the local context” (p. 76). In sum, when peace operations influence local behavior through the legitimate means of normatively oriented political persuasion, they are more successful.         "
"2","At the birth of post–Cold War multidimensional peace operations, some members of the United Nations (UN) system were aware of the crucial importance of establishing local legitimacy. An unpublished report on the complex UN Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia, which began in 1989, states that “UNTAG would have, as a condition precedent to its success, to ensure that its legitimacy and authenticity were accepted throughout the country. The establishment of UNTAG's legitimacy, in turn, depended upon the perception of its effectiveness . . . and its reputation for objectivity and integrity. . . . [its leaders advocated] a massive, active intervention to change the political climate in the country” (Lise Howard, UN Peacekeeping in Civil Wars [New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008], 66). The UNTAG operation was ultimately successful, and the origins of its success were rooted in an unbending quest for local legitimacy, integrity, and authenticity, which entailed organizational adaptation and learning on the part of the UN. Unfortunately, this legitimacy‐oriented approach seems to have been lost over time.         "
"3","While Whalan's book does not mention the case of Namibia, it does juxtapose failed and successful elements of the peace operations in Cambodia (conducted by the UN) and the Solomon Islands (overseen by the Australian‐led Regional Assistance Mission). While the Cambodia case lacks sufficient analysis of the power, legitimacy, and authority of the UN's Civilian Administration, the cases are largely compelling. However, the strength of the book lies in its theoretical contribution."
"4","The book also provides an outstanding and thorough review of the peace operations literature, although it somehow misses Séverine Autesserre's work on the culture of peacebuilding, as well as the recent theoretical literature on practice. Both of these trends are fairly recent, though, which may partly explain the oversight."
"5","Some of Whalan's main conclusions overlap with what others (including myself) have been arguing for some time: that more resources and higher troop numbers do not automatically lead to success and that clearer or more “robust” mandates do not necessarily translate into better peace operations. This book is not primarily policy oriented, but it does give rise to some important policy considerations. If peace operations are to recapture the success they have enjoyed in the past, they must be reoriented toward establishing that elusive but crucial element of legitimacy. Peacekeeping's primary means of effective power lies in communicative engagement, not coercion."
