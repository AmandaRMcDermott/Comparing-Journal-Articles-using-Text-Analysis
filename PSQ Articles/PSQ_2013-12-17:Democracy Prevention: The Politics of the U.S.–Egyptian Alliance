"1","Rare is the scholarly work the main proposition of which is tested by real‐world events virtually as soon as it is published. Jason Brownlee's chronological account of the U.S.–Egyptian alliance commences with its formation under President Anwar Sadat in the late 1970s and ends with the military's assumption of power in the wake of President Hosni Mubarak's removal in 2011. His principal argument is that far from supporting the democratization of Egypt, Washington has obstructed it out of fear of its potential incompatibility with U.S. interests in the region. Preserving Israel's security while combatting Soviet influence took precedence over Egypt's democratization for President Jimmy Carter, a policy the substance of which subsequent presidents have maintained as the perceived Soviet threat was supplanted by that of the radical Islamists and as Egypt's role as bridge to the Gulf became ever more central to America's regional security posture. The nub of the issue, according to Brownlee, is that “the regional strategy shared by U.S. and Egyptian officials runs counter to the aspirations of many Egyptians” (p. 14), so those officials “promoted shared elite interests over popular opposition…” (p. 176). The overthrow of Mubarak, “rather than delivering a watershed,” resembled the “aftermath of Sadat's assassination, when officials tweaked Egyptian domestic and foreign policies while reproducing authoritarianism” (p. 177)."
"2","When those words were written, Mubarak's successor, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) was still in power. That it preserved Mubarak's anti‐democratic posture at home while collaborating with the United States in pursuit of its regional interest was hardly surprising, given that the SCAF was led by Mubarak's hand‐picked generals. But that Brownlee's observation that the country's political elite subordinates its own people's preferences to its desire to retain U.S. support remains apposite even after the Muslim Brotherhood replaced the SCAF is indeed surprising. It is also testament to the structural underpinnings for and soundness of the author's thesis. After all, Washington had essentially accepted the Mubarak line that the Brothers posed a mortal threat not only to him, but to American interests in Egypt and the Middle East. That the Brothers and the Obama administration then became political bedfellows immediately after the former dispatched the military surely suggests that mutual political opportunism rather than democratic instincts and preferences guided the behavior of both Egyptian and American incumbent political elites."
"3","The key questions raised by this political alliance forged and then preserved out of mutual elite political opportunism are how durable it is and what its costs and benefits are for both nations. As for durability, that the bilateral alliance has persisted through four Egyptian regimes (Sadat, Mubarak, the SCAF, and the Muslim Brotherhood) and six American presidencies (Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama) seems to suggest that opportunism provides remarkably strong political cement. But the obvious contradictions inherent in an alliance that now links the United States to an anti‐democratic, anti‐Israeli Islamist organization that espouses values profoundly discordant with Western liberal ideals, although affirming the power of opportunism, also suggest the precariousness of a relationship built only on the narrow base that authoritarian rule can provide. As for costs, Brownlee's emphasis on “democracy prevention” neatly describes the most important one, certainly for Egypt, but also for a United States that is now grappling with a collapsing order in Egypt and the Arab world more generally. As for benefits, the United States and Israel have clearly reaped some, as have those wielding power in Cairo. Alas, as for the people of Egypt, they remain oppressed by a newly invigorated, opportunistic authoritarianism that denies its citizens the benefit of both democracy and economic development. Brownlee's book provides the best explanation available of how the United States has contributed to this dismal outcome."
