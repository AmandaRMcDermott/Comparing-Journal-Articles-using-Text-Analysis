"1","In transitioning states, the military arguably poses the most‐serious threat to democratic consolidation. Soldiers ideologically opposed to liberalism, or threatened by the transformations democracy necessarily entails for security institutions, possess the clear capacity to intervene and induce autocratic setbacks. While violent coups remain a persistent threat, militaries also act in numerous other ways to undermine democratic processes. For example, entrenched officers have subverted the justice system, blocking human rights prosecutions, as well as exerted undo influence over foreign and domestic policy. Yet, despite such dangers, the military is a largely neglected subject of empirical study within the literature on democratic transition and consolidation."
"2","Zoltan Barany's important book, The Soldier and the Changing State, redresses this critical oversight. Indeed, his work is the first cross‐regional, comparative study that seeks to explain how armies are successfully transformed to serve democracy. Empirically rich and ambitious, the book analyzes 27 separate country cases across six distinct contexts, including democratization following civil war, defeat in interstate war, transition from military rule, the collapse of communism, colonialism, and state reunification. The case studies are built on extensive interviews with military officers, parliamentarians, journalists, and other security sector reform specialists, complemented with material drawn from secondary sources and newspaper archives.         "
"3","The book makes three central claims. First, Barany argues that democracy cannot be consolidated without the active support of military elites. Second, he finds that the difficulty of building loyal, democratic armies varies according to circumstances, and that different contexts produce distinct challenges. For example, countries emerging from communist rule experienced a generally easier transition, since they had already mastered civilian control over the armed forces. Yet, they also faced a unique hurdle in depoliticizing soldiers accustomed to political indoctrination (p. 341). Finally, he asserts that the heterogeneity of empirical experiences with democratization and military reform precludes the construction of general (or universal) theory. Rather, only conditional lessons and generalizations can be discerned, each highly dependent on context."
"4","Based on this extensive case study analysis, and still cautioning against contextually blind adherence, the conclusion offers a series of policy recommendations for military reformers in democratizing states. These include introducing reforms gradually and making temporary compromises; instilling clarity and transparency in the constitutional obligations of military forces; building legislative oversight as a fundamental component of democratic civil–military relations; cultivating independent defense experts in think tanks, universities, the media, and other parts of civil society; and engaging in new missions that bring purpose and prestige to the armed forces, such as international peacekeeping operations and disaster relief efforts."
"5","Although Barany rightly eschews universal theories of civil–military relations that seek to explain all times and all places, his findings do suggest ways in which future scholars could build and test successful middle‐range theories. We could, for example, imagine a limited theory of military reform following communism and a separate theory of successful democratic military construction following decolonization, both of which would require careful—and distinct—research designs to test. Such endeavors would bolster the book's existing policy recommendations that, although empirically grounded and insightful, remain untested."
"6","That further research could strengthen Barany's findings, however, in no way diminishes the importance or relevance of this book for both scholars and practitioners of democratization. Too often are military institutions and the threat they pose to democratic consolidation ignored. The Soldier and the Changing State provides a necessary corrective to this oversight by directly tackling the many challenges of building democratic militaries. Barany's work should thus inspire a new research agenda within the democratization field.         "
