"1","THE UNITED STATES HAS ENJOYED POWER and success unlike that of any other nation. Regardless of what one may think of the exceptionalist rhetoric that infuses American politics, the American national experience, leading to the United States being the world's sole superpower, is undeniably unusual. America's distinct history and situation, and the political culture that has resulted, underlie a distinctly American way of looking at the rest of the world. This way involves not only preferences and objectives but also, more fundamentally, how Americans perceive things beyond their borders and think about the nature of things. As with other cultures, American political culture determines much of what the people who are part of it take to be factual knowledge.1 That culture and everything that has gone into it constitute a prism that slants, distorts, and colors how Americans see what is around them. Sometimes the slanting is so great that some things are not seen at all.         "
"2","Among the aspects of the American experience that have been most influential in shaping American perceptions of the world abroad are ones that could be placed under the heading “no other nation has had it so good.” Fortunate circumstances for the United States begin with a geographic location that has kept it securely distant from most threats to its homeland. The nation's physical blessings also include a resource‐rich continent that came into Americans’ hands with relative ease. Related to the happy physical circumstances has been the history of building a liberal democratic society without the sort of fundamental ideological struggles that have been much more characteristic of nation‐building efforts elsewhere. This combination of unusual good fortune and success has impaired the ability to anticipate difficulties encountered in the application of U.S. power abroad. It has encouraged a distorted view of what other nations ought to be able to accomplish. And it has reduced understanding of the concerns and reactions of people not similarly blessed."
"3","The distinctively American experience colors how Americans perceive the rest of the world in two basic ways. One concerns current circumstances, including how the American political system works today and the unsurpassed power that the U.S. superpower wields today. At least as important is the cumulative effect of the nation's earlier history. That effect is intrinsic to the concept of culture, which involves the transfer of beliefs and habits from generation to generation. The evolution of the national culture is analogous in this respect to the evolution of the human brain, the workings of which reflect many of the needs and experiences of our Pleistocene ancestors.2 American political culture and the outlook toward the outside world that goes with it demonstrate remarkable continuity, in the senses that today's outlook is rooted in yesterday's experiences and that many aspects of that outlook reappear throughout American history.         "
"4","Most Americans have little awareness of that continuity. That lack of awareness is itself a distinctly American trait.3 Simple ignorance of history is one reason, but so is an American proclivity to overestimate the newness of things—a proclivity rooted in being the dominant power in the New World.4 The turning away from Old World ideologies was an early step toward difficulty in understanding foreign behavior and foreign issues that involve those ideologies. It also meant there was a mostly blank slate on which an American ideology could be quietly, even silently, written and form the basis for a distinctly American way of looking at the world without Americans being self‐conscious about how they were looking at it.5 Aspects of the ideology became part of conventional wisdom and American national myth, taken for granted and rarely the subject of national introspection.6 The paucity of self‐awareness makes the distorting effects of American national myth and ideology all the greater because of a lack of conscious effort to correct for the effects.         "
"5","The distortion and coloration are chiefly unconscious and automatic. American perceptions of the world outside the United States exemplify what psychologists have taught us about human cognition: that mental constructs based on culture and past experience shape perceptions silently but so powerfully that they often outweigh even contrary facts and evidence. The constructs, also called heuristics, are shortcuts the mind uses to cope with daily deluges of information without having to apply slow and laborious analysis to every data point.7"
"6","The distorting prism affects U.S. policy in two ways. First, policymakers are Americans, too. They grew up in the same culture, shaped by the same peculiarly American circumstances and history and national experience as other Americans. They naturally tend to look at the outside world in many of the same ways. Although they may have more of an obligation to act on fact than does the average opinionated member of the general public, their heavy responsibilities make the mental shortcuts all the more attractive and even necessary, and so they, too, tend to use oversimplification and to cling to general images they already hold.8"
"7","Second, policymakers must operate in a climate of opinion that sets significant limits on what they can do or even say, regardless of whether they would have shared the tenets of that opinion in the first place. Elected policymakers could not have attained and held power without having been responsive to American public opinion. Often the statesman's natural tendencies to view the world in a certain way merge with the political need to stay within the confines that public perceptions set. This is what happened, for example, as the United States immersed itself in the Vietnam War, when a strong conventional wisdom held that preventing a communist takeover in South Vietnam was critical to checking a larger advance of worldwide communism. Leslie Gelb and Richard Betts note that nearly all opinion leaders inside and outside government, except for a few lonely voices, accepted this belief. “And the political trapping process,” they write, “kept almost everyone in line. Public doubters would be pounced on by the press. Bureaucratic skeptics would risk their careers. Various public figures vied with each other to explain the importance of Vietnam to the American people. And the people seemed to be believers too.”9"
"8","Public opinion has played at least as great a role in developing foreign and security policy in the United States as it has in almost any other country.10 Major changes in U.S. foreign policy most often involve the rejection of one conventional wisdom in favor of a different conventional wisdom.11 The influence of the American experience and American culture on American conventional wisdom matters a lot because it profoundly shapes the perceptions, and thus the policies, of those who make decisions on behalf of the world's superpower. This fact is too rarely understood; the textbook model of how government ought to operate—with decision makers getting their images of the outside world from an intelligence bureaucracy—is mistakenly assumed to be how it does operate.12"
"9","Anything that shapes a perception and is extraneous to the object being perceived can cause distortion and error. The more idiosyncratic is the basis for preconception, the more likely there will be misperception. The American experience that is the basis for how Americans see the world is idiosyncratic. The United States is more different, in more important ways, from the rest of the world than is any other country, and that is a prime impediment to its citizens understanding the rest of the world."
"10","Adding to the room for distortion and error is the luxury Americans have had of interacting with the rest of the world largely on American terms. The Internet is an American creation, global pop culture is disproportionately American culture, and English is the closest thing to a global lingua franca. Americans and the media they mostly read and listen to are still, despite globalization, cognitively isolated even from other economically advanced liberal democracies.13 Americans have had less incentive than many others to learn from, and about, people in other lands. This fact is reflected in the relatively low knowledge of Americans, compared with their counterparts in other countries, about world affairs and global geography, as repeatedly shown by surveys that have tested such knowledge.14 This ignorance increases further the effects of distortion and misperception that grow out of the peculiar American experience.         "
"11","Obviously, not all Americans think in a single, distinctively American way. Nor are the thoughts of any one American determined wholly by national and cultural influences. The tendencies involved are not necessarily the most important influence in the formation of any one perception. Other, more universally shared cognitive habits also are involved in misperception of the world abroad.15 But the peculiarly American tendencies are strong and significant.         "
"12","Nor are the perceptions that guide U.S. foreign policy an unrelenting cascade of mistaken beliefs. To the extent that U.S. foreign policy has been based on accurate perceptions of the world abroad, however, this is more often in spite of, not because of, the peculiar tinge that the peculiar American experience imparts to such perceptions. Whatever good there is in what makes America exceptional, this is part of what is bad. It is why clearheaded thinking sometimes has difficulty prevailing. It is why, when it does prevail, it often does so only after a struggle to overcome clouded and mistaken beliefs. It is one reason such beliefs are more prevalent in America than otherwise should be expected in an economically advanced country with a well‐educated population. And it is one of the reasons some U.S. policies, based on erroneous views of the outside world, fail."
"13","The special situation of the United States begins with its location on the planet, far removed from any significant and physically proximate threats. Alexis de Tocqueville put at the top of his list of “accidental and providential causes which contribute to the maintenance of the democratic republic in the United States” his observation that “the Americans have no neighbors,” which, among other things, meant they had no “conquest to dread.”16 For most of the nation's history, this physical separation has been one of the biggest differences from the security situation of other countries. The separation was the major reason that, as the historian C. Vann Woodward observed, for much of U.S. history the country's security was not only effective but free.17"
"14","The United States has its neighbors Mexico and Canada, of course, and it has engaged in warfare along the borders of each. The neighbors were mostly irrelevant, however, until the United States grew strong enough to become the dominant power on the continent. Before then, the patterns of settlement were too far away from each other to collide. War between the United States and Mexico, once it became a possibility, was for Americans less a matter of defending against a threat than of seizing an opportunity, with American expansionism being the dominant theme in tensions leading to the war that broke out in 1846.18 The military outcome was a swift and low‐cost U.S. victory, and the political outcome was a huge U.S. annexation of territory.         "
"15","To the north, Canada has never been a threat in its own right to the United States. At the beginning of the War of 1812, fought against the then‐sovereign power of Britain, U.S. leaders viewed the lightly garrisoned Canadian territory less as a source of threat than as a target for capture—perhaps with annexation in mind, but more as a prize of war and a bargaining chip.19 Not long after the war, British power became a benevolent force for the United States, with the Royal Navy in effect enforcing the Monroe Doctrine. By the time the Canadian Confederation was formed in 1867, any warfare between Americans and Canadians had become inconceivable. It has long been a cliché, but one with significance, that their two countries share the world's longest undefended border.         "
"16","From the War of 1812 (in which the last battle, at New Orleans, was a clear U.S. victory) until World War I, the continental United States was untouched and unthreatened by overseas forces. This century of immunity, in which the American nation went from adolescence to maturity, profoundly influenced how Americans think about national security and about threats that one nation can pose to another. Many of the perceptual habits that Americans acquired during this large chunk of their history, regarding the outside world and how their country relates to it, endure. The world wars of the twentieth century, which profoundly affected American attitudes in other respects, did not dispel attitudes based on the separateness and inviolability of the U.S. homeland. The adversaries in those wars were barely able to scratch the continental United States, with significant damage being limited to more distant U.S. territory such as Oahu and the Aleutian Islands."
"17","In the past 60 years, the long‐range bomber and then the intercontinental ballistic missile have increased the physical vulnerability of the United States. Change in American thinking about security threats, however, has lagged technological change. American thinking about modern weapons with intercontinental range also has tended to compartmentalize this danger and associate it with a particular adversary, the Soviet Union, and with the Cold War, which has come and gone. This is indicated by how quickly American public fears about such weapons dissipated once the Soviet Union collapsed, even though Russia still had, as of 2013, about 1,800 strategic nuclear weapons.20 The dissipation of concern dismays the publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, who directs attention to the doomsday clock on the Bulletin's cover, which is intended, she says, “to inform people about the dangers that we still face from the nuclear bombs, the nuclear legacy, and the nuclear material that's still out there.”21 This effort may be largely in vain. When the Chicago Council on Global Affairs in its regular biennial survey asked Americans to name the top two or three foreign policy problems facing the United States, “nuclear war/freeze” still got a 9 percent response in 1983, but in the 1995 survey, nothing related to nuclear war made it onto the list at all.22"
"18","Something similar is true of American thinking about terrorism. A frequent comment is that the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 dispelled an American sense of invulnerability. Certainly September 11 administered an enormous jolt to Americans, but we are still too close to that event to appreciate how it does or does not figure into larger and longer‐term American habits of thinking about threats and vulnerability. That one attack, spectacular though it was, did not mark any real departure in vulnerability of the American homeland in the way that the development of the long‐range bomber or intercontinental ballistic missile did. The historical background of geographic isolation and invulnerability has contributed to a widely oscillating and overall inaccurate American public perception of the terrorist threat; the public underestimated the threat on 10 September 2001 and overestimated it on 12 September 2001. Such oscillation, which did not begin with September 11,23 may now be bringing American public sentiment somewhat more in line with the reality that even a spectacular lucky shot does not change the fundamental facts about vulnerability. American preoccupation with terrorism already has faded significantly in little more than a decade following September 11. This is indicated by how much some measures taken by government agencies in the name of counterterrorism—such as the collection by the National Security Agency of data on telephone calls within the United States—that would have raised few eyebrows in the first couple of years after September 11 have become subjects of public and political controversy.         "
"19","Geographic separation has nurtured a stronger distinction in American minds between the homeland and the rest of the world than one finds elsewhere. Attitudes in America are different in this respect from those in Europe, where land and people have shifted from one sovereign to another as empires have come and gone and wars have been won and lost, where internal upheavals have become meshed with external conflicts, and where sovereignty itself has been shifting and uncertain with supranational institutions from the Holy Roman Empire to the European Union being overlaid on states. America has had none of this. It is a reason the national homeland has a special place and sanctity in American thinking that is not found to nearly the same degree in the thoughts of Europeans.24"
"20","The exceptionally sharp distinction between the homeland and everywhere else sustains not only an inflated perception of the wisdom and virtue of those who dwell in the former but also a contrastingly deflated perception of many who dwell in the latter. This combination of outlooks underlies the sense of a civilizing mission that has motivated American colonial activity abroad—except that Americans, distinguishing themselves from Old World colonialists, do not apply such terms to themselves. The euphemistic vocabulary and the attitudes associated with it have contributed to an inability to anticipate resistance from foreigners who do regard the U.S. activity as imperialism or colonialism. The pattern arose at the beginning of this sort of U.S. endeavor, with a rebellion in the Philippines that lasted for several years after the United States took over that country from Spain. The later American view of Indochina as a place that could overcome its backwardness only through American guidance lingered through the intense U.S. involvement there, when President Lyndon B. Johnson described North Vietnam as a “raggedy‐ass little fourth‐rate country” and a “piss‐ant” nation.25 The pattern also was present with the chaos and resistance to U.S. occupation in Iraq that were not part of the George W. Bush administration's expectations when it invaded in 2003.         "
"21","The exceptionally sharp division in the American worldview between what is foreign and what is domestic also has shaped American perceptions of terrorism. Americans, more so than Europeans and others, have viewed terrorism as overwhelmingly a foreign threat.26 One result has been slowness in recognizing it as a subject worthy of U.S. attention rather than a problem for foreigners to deal with. Theodore Roosevelt, who assumed the presidency when an anarchist assassinated his predecessor, was the first U.S. president to speak about the threat of international terrorism, but even in his time, the United States stayed aloof from measures intended to do something about it, including measures agreed to at an international conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1904. When terrorism claimed many more American victims in Lebanon in the 1980s, the subject received significant official attention, but in the American public mind, it was still a foreign problem that America would avoid as long as it was not in a line of fire overseas.         "
"22","Since the surge of post–September 11 public attention to terrorism, flawed perceptions of the subject have continued to flow from the basic American perspective that terrorism cannot be a made‐in‐America problem. One flaw involves difficulty in fully appreciating the extent to which U.S. policies and relationships overseas have figured prominently in the motivations for anti‐U.S. terrorism—as repeatedly indicated by the interrogation of captured perpetrators, claims of responsibility for attacks, and other statements by terrorist leaders.27 A related shortcoming involves the influences that lead people within the United States, including U.S. citizens, to become terrorists. A natural American inclination is to think in terms of these people having fallen under the spell of malevolent foreign groups. But in most relationships between individual American terrorists and foreign extremists that have come to light, it was the American, already radicalized, who took the initiative to create and maintain the relationship. Another inclination is to focus on training that such individuals may receive from terrorist organizations abroad. That, too, has occurred, but it has been an insignificant part of terrorist threats in the United States. Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin who unsuccessfully attempted to detonate a firecracker‐powered car bomb in Times Square in 2010, reportedly received training in northwest Pakistan, but any such training was insufficient to make him a competent bomb builder. In considering threats of homegrown Islamist terrorism, a reassuring but somewhat misleading thought—frequently voiced in response to major terrorist attacks in France and Belgium in 2015 and 2016—is that Muslims in the United States are better integrated into society than their counterparts in many other countries with Muslim minorities. This is generally true, but integration into a nation's society, economy, and institutions is not the entire story as far as susceptibility to terrorism is concerned. Nidal Hasan, for example, perpetrator of a mass shooting at Fort Hood in 2009 and motivated by issues similar to those that have motivated other Islamist terrorists, was a U.S. Army major and psychiatrist, which is about as well integrated as one could be.         "
"23","The greatest perception‐shaping consequence of the geographically separate and thus relatively secure situation of the United States is an American difficulty in appreciating the circumstances of countries not similarly blessed, which means most countries. Americans have few reference points for understanding the thoughts, calculations, perceptions, and actions of those abroad who confront local security dilemmas or any kind of immediate and continuing threats. The separation has spared American statesmen many of the trade‐offs and tough choices that others have had to face, and Americans are thus slower than their foreign counterparts to recognize such trade‐offs.28 The slowness extends to understanding why other nations see threats where they do and why they take the decisions they do to respond or adapt to those threats. American failure in understanding takes the form either of unfavorably and unsympathetically interpreting the other country's actions, or of being insensitive to the concerns that underlie the other country's policies.         "
"24","Continental Europe again provides a sharp contrast to America's happy milieu. Europeans have lived in a crowded neighborhood filled with competing national aspirations and security dilemmas. Neighboring countries have repeatedly contested the possession of provinces, and a complex ethnic geography has helped fuel the contests. For many states, threats or potential threats have appeared at multiple azimuths. Statesmen and ordinary citizens alike have grown up in a culture shaped by centuries of warfare, with corresponding ways of looking at the outside world that do not come naturally to Americans. Europe now has moved beyond much of its past turmoil with its grand experiment in integration, which with the end of the Cold War has extended across the continent. That experiment itself has expanded the bounds of what Europeans can perceive more easily than most Americans. But the turmoil and the immediacy of threat was such a major part of the continent's history that the mental framework it left in the minds of Europeans has not gone away. Lurking behind European thinking about the integration experiment is awareness of what it replaced, and to which the continent might return if the experiment fails.29"
"25","Americans’ empathy deficit has applied even to the security situation of a major power such as Germany, which, despite its relative strength among European countries, has traditionally had to worry about multiple immediate security threats and the specter of two‐front wars. The diplomatic maestro Otto von Bismarck's way of coping with this situation was to create a complicated array of secret understandings and alliances intended to make every other country more dependent on Germany than Germany would be on the others. The antithesis of Bismarck's approach was Woodrow Wilson's positing as the first point of his Fourteen Points—his statement of war aims after the United States entered World War I—the principle of open covenants openly arrived at.30 The principle reflected a broader American aversion to government secrecy but also a failure to appreciate fully not just what Bismarck had done but also why he had done it. Consistent with the open covenants idea, Wilson believed that insofar as Germany was responsible for the war, it was not the German people who should be blamed but instead the “Prussian autocracy.”31 This perception reflected insensitivity to the geopolitical challenges that any German leader, Prussian autocrat or otherwise, would face from his seat in the middle of Europe.         "
"26","The empathy deficit is all the greater regarding the security situation of lesser states. Low sensitivity to the need of lesser states to accommodate more powerful neighbors has been a recurring pattern in American thinking. The initial reference for the term “Finlandization” was the eponymous country's tempering of its policies to avoid offending its strong neighbor, the Soviet Union. The term became a dirty word with more general applicability in American discourse, first in the 1950s, when small nations’ efforts at achieving neutrality were perceived as part of a Soviet effort to erode the unity of the free world, and then again around 1980, when fears were voiced that other Europeans would follow Finland's route of bowing to what was seen as a still expansionist Soviet Union.32 Resistance to Finlandization was partly a rationale for pursuing Cold War policies that were favored anyway for other reasons, but the concept also helped shape American perceptions and interpretations of any instance of a state accommodating Soviet interests.         "
"27","Some three decades later, the promoters of the U.S. invasion of Iraq failed to anticipate one of that war's most important consequences, which was a rapprochement between Iraq and its neighbor Iran. A marked increase in Iranian influence in Iraq had not been part of the script of the George W. Bush administration, which had labeled Iran as another node on the axis of evil. This development was related to some others that the makers of the war also failed to anticipate sufficiently, including the accentuation of sectarian sentiments and sectarian conflict and how the increased power of Iraq's Shia majority would open the way to better relations with Shia Iran. The failure also, however, stemmed from the more general American insensitivity to how countries and governments tend to cope with the sort of permanent potential threat from neighbors that the United States does not face. Iraq and Iran had fought a very costly eight‐year war in the 1980s. When the instigator of that war, Saddam Hussein, was removed, sidling up to Iran was a natural way for his successors to try to bring more stability to their regional relations."
"28","Debate in the United States over a crisis that erupted in 2014 when political upheaval in Ukraine led to the Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula demonstrated some of the same slowness in understanding geopolitical realities—common to much of the world but not to North America—about living next to powerful and potentially threatening neighbors. The crisis was discussed largely in terms of a zero‐sum contest between Russia and the West. Much of the debate demonstrated insensitivity to the need for close and extensive relations with its larger neighbor if Ukraine was to be peaceful and prosperous, and to how accommodating some Russian interests, including those regarding the status of ethnic Russians within Ukraine, also was a necessary part of resolving the crisis. The concept of Finlandization—used as a pejorative—was used again in American commentary.33"
"29","As with debates on many other issues, there was insightful comment to partially offset the misunderstanding, misperception, and insensitivity. Policymakers and some analysts showed evidence of understanding many of the important nuances in the situation. Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger—two old strategists whose continental European roots imbued their thinking about international politics—explicitly invoked Finland as a positive model for the future of Ukraine.34 The less insightful tendencies in the public discourse, however, imposed political constraints on the policymakers, leading to multiple rounds of sanctions and retribution against Russia.         "
"30","The American difficulty in appreciating foreign fears and concerns about more powerful states extends in particular to difficulty in appreciating fears and concerns about the most powerful state of all: the United States itself. This deficiency is in one respect another instance of a security dilemma, in which each side sees its own actions as less threatening than the other side sees them. Security dilemmas are not unique to relationships involving the United States, but the United States is especially prone to this kind of insensitivity. One reason is that the size and power of the United States inevitably mean it has more impact on other states than other states have on it.35 Another reason is the benign national self‐image that Americans tend to have even more than many other people do, which is inconsistent with the idea that U.S. actions could be negative and threatening. Yet another reason again involves geographic proximity; the U.S. ability to project power at a distance enables it to overcome distance while affecting other states, while most of those states lack the power to act similarly in the reverse direction. Power‐projecting America becomes in effect another large, worrisome neighbor, while Americans do not fully realize the implications of this because they do not have comparable worries in return.         "
"31","The disconnect between foreign perceptions of the United States and corresponding American perceptions involves how much the United States even takes into account how its actions affect the foreigners. A survey by the Pew Research Center in 2013 asked in 38 countries, “How much does the United States consider your country's interests?” In a majority of the nations polled, those who responded “not too much” or “not at all” outnumbered those who replied “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”36 This is quite different from how Americans see things. The Pew Center asked in 2002 and 2004 a more generic version of the same question: “Does U.S. foreign policy consider interests of others?” Large majorities of Americans who were polled—75 percent in 2002 and 70 percent in 2004—replied either “a great deal” or “a fair amount.” The results in the eight foreign countries surveyed yielded virtually the opposite result, with the comparable numbers ranging from a high of 44 percent in Britain to a low of 9 percent in Turkey (both in 2002), and most of the others in the twenties.37 These results do not directly demonstrate American obtuseness about the sentiments of foreigners; it would be possible, after all, for an American to be fully aware that foreigners evaluate U.S. foreign policy differently than he or she does. But the differences in the numbers are huge, and the very fact that many citizens of foreign countries feel as they do about U.S. policy is itself evidence against the proposition that the policy gives a lot of consideration to the interests of those citizens. The polling results likely reflect American misperceptions about foreign perceptions—an American insensitivity to how foreigners believe the United States is insensitive to their interests.         "
"32","The pattern persists when questions turn from merely taking interests into account to how the United States affects those interests or may threaten them. In a Pew poll in 2009, majorities in every one of the 24 countries surveyed said that the United States influences the respondent's country “a great deal” or “a fair amount.” Pluralities in 19 of those countries said that this influence is bad rather than good.38 A poll two years later asked another selection of foreign respondents whether they worry that the United States could become a military threat to their own country. The proportion who said they were “very” or “somewhat” worried about this was 46 percent in Jordan, 54 percent in Egypt, 59 percent in Turkey, 67 percent in Pakistan, 71 percent in Indonesia, and 91 percent in the Palestinian territories. Most of these numbers were not even as large as they had been a few years earlier, when the figure for Jordan was 67 percent.39"
"33","Such foreign fears and negative sentiments about the United States, even in countries deemed to be friends of the United States, are most of the time not part of most Americans’ perception of the outside world. Occasionally a jolting event, the most prominent example of which was the September 11 terrorist attacks, forces awareness of negative sentiments about the United States, but the response in most Americans’ thinking is to attribute a failure of understanding to foreigners (and perhaps to U.S. bureaucracies) and not to themselves. President George W. Bush expressed the thoughts of many of his countrymen when he said a month after September 11, “I'm amazed that there is such misunderstanding of what our country is about, that people would hate us. I am, I am—like most Americans, I just can't believe it. Because I know how good we are, and we've go to do a better job of making our case.”40"
"34","One consequence of this disparity in perceptions is the frequent belief that if there is trouble with how foreigners react to U.S. policies, the problem is less in the substance of the policies themselves than in explaining or selling those policies—“making our case,” in Bush's words. This has led to endless consternation about U.S. public diplomacy, repeated and mostly futile efforts to improve it, and persistent faith in the idea that the global response to U.S. policies would be markedly better if Washington could find the right sales technique.41 Meanwhile, possible redirection of the policy itself gets that much less attention.         "
"35","The “war on terror” has exhibited all of these tendencies as well as typical American insensitivity to how foreigners react to the assertion of U.S. power projected across the oceans and into their neighborhoods. A poll in 2004 of the United States and eight foreign countries (Britain, France, Germany, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Russia, and Turkey) asked whether the “war on terror” was a sincere effort to reduce terrorism. Among American respondents, 67 percent said yes and 25 percent no. The only other country that yielded a result close to this was Britain, where 51 percent said yes and 41 percent no. In Russia, a plurality (48 percent to 35 percent) said no, and in all the other countries, large majorities said no. The same poll also asked about four possible motives for the United States to pursue the “war on terror”: to control Mideast oil, to target unfriendly Muslim governments, to protect Israel, and to dominate the world. Americans gave the lowest positive responses on each of the four—none higher than 18 percent. Again, the responses in most other countries were far different from those of Americans. Respondents saying yes to the “to dominate the world” motivation included 13 percent in the United States, 24 percent in Britain, 44 percent in Russia, 47 percent in Germany, 53 percent in France, 55 percent in Pakistan, 60 percent in Morocco, and 61 percent in both Jordan and Turkey.42"
"36","Such results suggest either widespread unawareness among Americans of how the actions of their own country are viewed abroad or, to the extent that there is awareness, a belief that the only problem is with “making our case” rather than with the actions themselves or with the policies that underlie them. Consistent with this pattern, Americans show little belief that U.S. actions have had anything to do with establishing the conditions or motivations for terrorism. Asked in 2004 whether “there is anything that the United States did wrong in its dealings with other countries that might have motivated the 9/11 terrorist attacks,” most Americans, by a margin of 51 percent to 38 percent, said no. Even fewer Americans (28 percent) believed there was any way in which the United States was “unfair” in its dealings with other countries that might have motivated the attacks.43 The relative importance of the different risk factors underlying international terrorism have long been subject to political and scholarly debate, but the poll results show a marked American unawareness of the significant ways in which the global reach and actions of the sole remaining superpower elicit responses and resentment that are very much related to terrorist motivations.44"
"37","The recurring American tendency to overestimate how favorably U.S. actions in someone else's backyard will be received, and to underestimate the ill will such actions may elicit, has underlain failures in planning for U.S. initiatives overseas. One of the most conspicuous such failures in recent times was the expectation by those who made the Iraq war that the American presence in Iraq would be broadly welcomed. Speaking in the same vein as many other promoters of the war, Vice President Dick Cheney said on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Iraq that there was “no question” that Iraqis “will welcome us as liberators.”45"
"38","Physical separation from what otherwise would be security threats is not the only geographic good fortune that Americans have enjoyed. A combination of climate, geology, and biology made it possible for an unusually rich and powerful nation to arise in North America. The United States is centered on a temperate latitude that, spared the diseases of the tropics and the barrenness of more frigid lands, has constituted a belt along which a disproportionate amount of humanity's advances have occurred. In its midsection is some of the most fertile soil on Earth, and as late as the latter part of the nineteenth century, so much of this rich land was available that it was being given away to anyone willing to settle on it and till it. The physical riches also have included vast forests, large freshwater lakes, mineral resources such as iron ore, huge coal deposits, and enough petroleum for the United States to become the birthplace of the oil industry."
"39","It was not just the riches of the land that made the Americans’ situation special; it was also that there was so little competition for it. The original settlers from Europe found a continent that was far more sparsely populated than what they had known. Estimates of the pre‐Columbian population of the New World vary widely, but the best evidence suggests that all of North America had fewer than two million people at the time of the European voyages of discovery.46 The land was not empty, but, starting from an Old World frame of reference, it seemed close enough to being so that the concept of expanding into empty land became a new frame of reference for Caucasian colonizers and settlers. The later distractions and troubles of outside powers kept those powers from competing for the land. The ease with which Americans took possession of the land was illustrated by the Louisiana Purchase, which the United States picked up for four cents an acre when Napoleon Bonaparte's France was preparing for war with Britain and, for reasons related to a slave revolt in Haiti, lost interest in retaining the territory.         "
"40","The free land and settling of a rich continent led to a characteristically American habit of thought identified more than a century ago by the historian Frederick Jackson Turner, who observed that the frontier experience nurtured a “practical, inventive turn of mind, quick to find expedients” that is “powerful to effect great ends.”47 It is a habit that minimizes obstacles to accomplishment and promotes the belief that with enough dedication and cleverness, the United States can “effect great ends” wherever it tries to do so. This outlook has fostered a slowness in perceiving many of the obstacles that have frustrated U.S. endeavors to effect desired ends abroad, especially in military expeditions from Vietnam to Iraq.         "
"41","The unusual abundance of America has been a major root of American exceptionalism and of the exceptionalist idea that the United States is not subject to the same sorts of obstacles and limitations, or even the same rules, as other nations. The easy marginalization of the native population in this abundant land cultivated the concept of Manifest Destiny: the idea that the successful expansion of America and of American influence abroad was bound to happen. For religiously inclined Americans—and a substantially higher proportion of today's Americans consider religion important than do citizens in most other developed countries48—the rich land has been central to the more religious interpretations of the notion of a foreordained American future. Especially in the early days of the United States, it fostered the beliefs that America's riches were God given and that the nation was playing a millenarian role.49 A belief that a future is not only bound to happen but that it is directed by a divinity makes it even more difficult to perceive things that get in the way, including in modern overseas endeavors such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. In one of the televised debates during his campaign for reelection in 2004, President George W. Bush said, “I believe that God wants everybody to be free. That's what I believe. And that's one part of my foreign policy. In Afghanistan I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty.”50"
"42","The result today is an American population that, along with Bush, thinks it knows “how good we are”—with “good” embracing intentions and character as well as ability and the perceived goodness applying to the impact the United States has on the rest of the world. This connection is made most readily by those with a religious perspective; if God bestowed on Americans an abundant land that made them powerful, then they evidently are a chosen people who are doing God's work in their activities overseas. The connection is less direct and less conscious for those with a more secular perspective, but the psychological tendency to group positive things together helps make the connection. Americans must have been doing something right, the thinking goes, to have used their resources to build the free and prosperous country that is the United States, and similarly, they must be doing right by others overseas. Polls show not only that large majorities of the American public believe the United States is unique and the greatest country and the world but also that a substantial proportion of the population believes the United States is morally better than most other countries.51 This outlook, rooted at least partially in the material good fortune and success of the United States, exacerbates the problem of insufficient anticipation of, and incorrect interpretations of, negative responses to the exercise of American power overseas, whether those responses come in the form of insurgencies, terrorist attacks, or something else.         "
"43","The nature of the Indian Wars and the marginalization of Native Americans have shaped American perceptions of later adversaries, especially ones who, like the Native Americans, were ethnically much different from the dominant ethnicities in the United States. American soldiers in foreign wars have referred to enemy territory as “Injun country,” a frontier land inhabited by savages. Such vocabulary was often used in the Vietnam War and contributed to disparaging views of the adversary not only from the top, as with Lyndon Johnson's dismissal of the “piss‐ant nation,” but at ground level, with scurrilous references to “gooks.” Although the United States, and specifically U.S. military leaders, appreciated in some respects the time and cost that would be required to have a chance at winning a counterinsurgency in South Vietnam, as of late 1964, Johnson's advisers underestimated the pressure that would be required to get the insurgency's sponsors in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) to back down. The authors of the Pentagon Papers conclude that this error stemmed from a misreading of determination in the North: “Underlying this optimistic view was a significant underestimate of the level of the DRV commitment to victory in the South, and an overestimate of the effectiveness of U.S. pressures in weakening that resolve.”52 The secretary of defense at the time, Robert McNamara, wrote years later, “We underestimated the power of nationalism to motivate a people (in this case, the North Vietnamese and Vietcong) to fight and die for their beliefs and values—and we continue to do so today in many parts of the world.”53"
"44","The marginalization of Native Americans, as painful as it was for the ones marginalized, was not one of the harder things that other Americans have done. Most Americans thus have little basis in their own nation's experience for understanding how ubiquitous in the rest of the world are contests between different peoples for control of the same land and how genuinely tough the contests can be. They have little basis for appreciating the intensity of antagonisms and feelings associated with such struggles and how much wider trouble can stem from them."
"45","Largely missing from postmortem American hand‐wringing over the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, for example, let alone from American thinking before the genocide, is that Rwanda was a prime example of how intense a conflict between two ethnic groups can get when they are competing for scarce land. It has been left to academic specialists to observe how the genocide and other ethnic violence in Rwanda have been grounded in land scarcity that has made it difficult for the production of food to keep pace with the growth of population.54 Such explanations are foreign in every sense of the word to Americans, for whom land was not scarce and any competition for it was one‐sided.         "
"46","The most salient and consequential conflict over land in which Americans’ own experience has heavily shaped American perceptions is the conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine. The extraordinary U.S. relationship with, and deference to, the state of Israel, along with the relative scarcity of sympathy for the Palestinians as a people under military occupation—sympathy that is harder to find in the United States than in much of the rest of the world—has multiple roots. These include ethnic and religious affinity as well as the way that power and fear work in contemporary domestic American politics.55 Also involved, however, are the significant parallels in the narratives of Israelis and white Americans and how they built their respective countries. Both are nations of immigrants. The origins of each included the fleeing of religious persecution in Europe, which in the case of European Jews involved one of the deadliest instances of such persecution in history. Both peoples built their countries through settlement and development of the land and a subsequent transition in emphasis from agriculture to industry.         "
"47","The impressive prosperity and well‐being that both peoples achieved gave rise to confidence in the people's own inventiveness and ability, with a tendency to view one's own nation's traits as superior to those of others. The American sense of superiority that was part of America's self‐proclaimed civilizing mission overseas had a parallel in the belief of the founding father of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, that a Jewish state in Palestine would be “a vanguard of culture against barbarianism.”56 Another perceived reason for success was a belief that divine will must be involved. For Israelis, the underlying concept was the ancient one of Jews being God's chosen people. For Americans, it was the more religious interpretations of Manifest Destiny and the role of providence in bestowing upon them a rich continent.         "
"48","Contentious issues involving Israel today, centered on occupation of the West Bank, have additional parallels with the American frontier experience. Settlers on the West Bank are populating a frontier for Jewish Israelis. They resist, displace, and sometimes have to fight off unhappy natives, just as American frontiersmen did. The distinction between civilians and military, and the activities of each, sometimes get blurred, just as they did on the American frontier.57"
"49","Americans have long seen such parallels, even though the comparisons Americans were making in the early days of their own republic were to the ancient Israelites of the Old Testament, the ones who battled Amalekites and Philistines rather than Arabs. Pilgrims and Puritans in what would become Massachusetts thought of their settlements as the “new Israel.”58 Until 1787, undergraduates at Harvard were required to study Hebrew.59 As Canaan was the promised land for the Israelites, so, too, was America seen as the promised land for European‐origin Americans, and the Puritans even called it Canaan.60 When modern Israel came along, transferring the parallels to it flowed naturally from a pattern of thought that was well entrenched and grounded in Americans’ own experience and their interpretation of that experience. American perceptions of Middle Eastern history have come more from the Bible, which tells stories of Israelites inhabiting the land that is now in dispute, than from any accounts of the centuries in which Arabs or others have lived there.61"
"50","Parallel experiences between Americans and Israelis have underlain heavy American sympathy for Israel, which in turn has underlain the tendency for factual beliefs about the Israeli‐Palestinian conflict to tilt heavily in favor of Israel. But there also has been a more direct linkage between Americans’ own experience and their beliefs about the nature of the conflict, and in particular about how much of a presence the preexisting population had on the land and, related to that, how realistic are any nationalist aspirations of that population. As Europeans and their descendants settled North America, the Native American population never constituted enough of a presence to be widely seen as the basis for a separate nation‐state that would limit the expansion, and help set the boundaries, of the United States. This fact was mostly a simple matter of relative numbers, with the already thin native population in what would become the United States thinning further after European colonization began.62 In the 2010 census, only 0.9 percent of the U.S. population was recorded as being wholly American Indian or Alaska Native, with another 0.7 percent identifying themselves as a mixture of that category and some other.63 Even those most troubled by past injustices to, and current social and economic problems of, Native Americans recognize territorial expansion of the United States as a fait accompli. There never has been talk of a “two‐state solution” involving Native Americans.         "
"51","The demographic realities associated with the establishment and expansion of the modern state of Israel have been much different. At the time of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, in which the British government committed itself to establishment of a “national home” for the Jewish people in Palestine without prejudice to “the civil and religious rights of existing non‐Jewish communities” there, the Arab population of Palestine was about ten times that of the Jewish population.64 In the United Nations plan in 1947 to partition Palestine, the population of the projected Jewish state—despite rapid Jewish immigration in the three decades since Balfour's pronouncement—would have been 45 percent Arab, while the projected Arab state would have been only 1 percent Jewish.65 With the American experience appearing to have so much in parallel with that of Israel, however, a natural tendency has been to think of all aspects of Israel's experience as paralleling America's, including the parts involving marginalization of an indigenous population too small to make a plausible claim to a state of its own. The basic American framework for perceiving the situation in Palestine is less one of a struggle for land between two comparable and comparably deserving peoples and more one of a single chosen people making the desert bloom or the prairie yield and expanding its writ from sea to sea, or from sea to river.         "
"52","To a large degree, Americans have bought into the Israeli mythology of “a land without a people for a people without a land,” which echoes some of the American mythology of expanding onto an empty continent. We see manifestations of this in many erroneous statements from American politicians about the history and demography of the region in question. Senator James Inhofe, in a speech on the Senate floor in 2002, said that in the days before the Balfour Declaration, “nobody really wanted this land.” A Palestinian nation, said Inhofe, “did not exist. It was not there. Palestinians were not there. Palestine was a region named by the Romans, but at that time it was under the control of Turkey, and there was no large mass of people there because the land would not support them.”66 Former history professor and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said while running for president that the Palestinians are an “invented people.”67 One of Gingrich's competitors for the 2012 presidential nomination, former senator Rick Santorum, declared that Palestinians do not exist at all and that everyone living in the West Bank is an Israeli.68 That genuine ignorance and not just campaign rhetoric is involved is revealed in private comments that parallel public ones. A journalist witnessed a U.S. senator in the 1980s, for example, asking a Saudi official where the Palestinians had come from “to begin with.”69"
"53","With Americans having fallen into the habit of accepting the Israeli narrative of the Israeli‐Arab conflict and having little awareness of the Palestinian one, further mistaken beliefs arise out of untested trust being placed in anything they hear that favors the Israeli version. This process has been going on since the founding of Israel. A story that quickly caught on during the 1948 war that gave birth to Israel, for example, was that Palestinian Arabs left their homes because Palestinian leaders had broadcast instructions for them to do so, in order to give Arab armies a clear shot at driving Jews out of Palestine. There was no truth to the story, but it became a part of Israeli lore and was widely accepted in the United States.70 Similarly, the prevailing American perception of what happened when the two sides appeared to come close to an agreement in 2000 and early 2001 is that, as Inhofe puts it, the Israeli government “offered the most generous concessions to Yasser Arafat that had ever been laid on the table” but that Arafat “stormed out of the meeting” to launch a premeditated campaign of terrorism and rioting. Competing narratives of that chapter of the peace process persist, but as shown by Jeremy Pressman's careful analysis of the negotiations, the Israeli offer “neglected several elements essential to any comprehensive settlement” and the Palestinian side “favored a genuine two‐state solution and did not seek to destroy Israel by insisting on the right of return or through the second intifada.”71 In one of the most recent rounds, in mid‐2014, of periodic combat between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the prevailing American belief—reflected in a congressional resolution of support for Israel—was that Israel's use of force was a response to Hamas firing rockets into Israel. In fact, the sequence of events was the other way around.72"
"54","America has had little reason to worry about having enough vital resources, including essentials such as food and energy. The oil price shocks and foreign embargoes of the 1970s were insufficient to prevent later renewed profligacy in the use of petroleum. Fracking technology and the shale oil revolution have made energy supplies even less of a worry. An effect of this richness in resources has been slowness in comprehending how nations not blessed with similar abundance may be driven by the need to secure resources, and driven even to acts of desperation. This was the case regarding understanding of Japan's situation leading up to World War II and how acutely Japan felt threatened by the prospect of not having enough oil. The imposition of a de facto embargo of U.S. oil exports to Japan was an immediate precipitant of Japan launching what became World War II in the Pacific.73 The direct Japanese objective was to seize oil resources in Southeast Asia, with a simultaneous preemptive blow against the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor being part of the supporting strategy.         "
"55","Secretary of State Dean Acheson wrote in his memoir that he “knew little, as we tightened the economic blockade of Japan, of the tension it was producing there.” Acheson is probably correct in his more general observation that officials in the State Department and in the government generally “misread Japanese intentions” with particular reference to “the incredibly high risks General Tojo would assume to accomplish his ends. No one in Washington realized that he and his regime regarded the conquest of Asia not as the accomplishment of an ambition but as the survival of a regime.”74 Such realization would have come more easily to people who themselves had to worry about where they would get their next barrel of oil.         "
"56","America's petroleum‐rich and successful experience also was involved in a different way in one of the most costly failures of anticipation: the consequences of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The undue optimism about the speed and ease with which a new political and economic order would fall into place was reflected in predictions by the war's supporters that it would be a “cakewalk”75 and in guidance from one of the most enthusiastic promoters of the war, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, to senior army officers that they should plan on the U.S. military presence in Iraq being down to 30,000 to 34,000 troops just a few months after the invasion.76 That the optimism about Iraq was partly rooted in America's easily won success on a resource‐rich continent was illustrated by Wolfowitz's repeated references to Iraq's oil wealth as a reason to expect that the war could be fought on the cheap. “There is a lot of money there,” he told Congress in February 2003, that could be put to better use “instead of building Saddam's palaces.”77 A month later he told another congressional committee that “Iraq can really finance its own reconstruction.”78 This was another instance of one similarity with the American experience—in this case, being blessed with ample petroleum—being extended inaccurately into an assumption of other similarities.         "
"57","Americans’ relative success, and the ease with which success has come, have involved not only favorable physical and geographic circumstances but also a domestic society that has suffered fewer of the sorts of disruptions and destructive divisions that have beset many other countries. This is easy to forget amid political gridlock in Washington and a related partisan and ideological competition that has become more intense and uncompromising in recent years. That competition is overlaid on a more fundamental, long‐standing consensus about politics and society that is centered on the tenets of liberal democracy.79 The principal consequence of this aspect of the American experience is difficulty in comprehending how hard it is for similar experiments to be repeated and to take hold in other countries. Americans lack a basis for appreciating the extent to which internal divisions and conflicts that they have largely been spared tend to complicate or preclude representative democracy or to feed chronic instability.         "
"58","A long‐standing part of Americans’ collective self‐image, dating back to colonial times,80 has been that in America, people of different ethnic origins swirl together smoothly to produce a new demographic blend. Scholars have questioned exactly how assimilated or blended people of different ethnic origins really are in the United States,81 which also has had a substantial history of nativism, with recent echoes in debates over immigration policy.82 A melting pot clearly has been at work, however, and even more important for the present purpose is the widespread and firm American belief that the pot has worked well.         "
"59","Confidence in the working of America's own melting pot has led to overestimation of the ability of different ethnic groups in other countries to integrate and to work together to build stable and peaceful societies. Associated with this tendency is an underestimation of the large role that ethnic nationalism plays in politics around the world. Moreover, as Jerry Muller observes, Americans “find ethnonationalism discomfiting both intellectually and morally.”83 They are slow to recognize that the roots of ethnically based nationalism grow deeper than most other ways of organizing politics and society.84 The most consequential demonstrations of this have arisen when the United States has attempted large‐scale political engineering in other lands.         "
"60","The clearest expression of the American perspective involved can be found in the statement of national security strategy that the George W. Bush administration issued in September 2002, which declared, “America's experience as a great multi‐ethnic democracy affirms our conviction that people of many heritages and faiths can live and prosper in peace.”85 Six months after issuing this document, the same administration launched the Iraq war, which would sink into a mire of ethnic and sectarian strife and bloodshed. The confidence—of the policymakers, rooted in a larger American attitude—in the ability of people of different heritages and faiths to live in peace and prosperity was strong enough to overcome more informed perspectives, including from the U.S. intelligence community, about how toppling the regime in Iraq was likely to open the door to intense communal conflict.86 The later evolution of the U.S. military expedition in Afghanistan into a long‐term nation‐building program has exhibited some of the same misplaced confidence. Political fault lines in Afghanistan are even more purely ethnic than in Iraq, and whatever stability has been achieved in the past has been based on intercommunal deal making rather than the working of a melting pot. This particular type of deal making is not a process that Americans tend to understand or appreciate, having had little experience with it outside of its limited role in a few big city political machines.         "
"61","The very existence of the United States, which was the first nation other than Iceland to transition from colony to independent state, has been defined by its citizens from the outset in terms of political principles rather than an ethnically based birthright. The United States is almost unique in how much its nationality is identified with a particular political creed—which in this case is a creed of liberal democracy.87 Half a century ago, Louis Hartz explained how historical circumstances account for the near unanimity among American citizens in supporting liberal democratic principles and how they have made the United States different even from its sister modern democracies in Europe. The United States has no residue of feudalism, and neither has it had a significant socialist movement. It thus has not experienced the sort of ideological divisions and associated political strife that have been central to European history. Hartz identified some of the negative effects that America's domestically unchallenged tradition of liberalism has had on Americans’ understanding of conflicts abroad:            "
"62","It is the absence of the experience of social revolution which is at the heart of … our difficulty of communication with the rest of the world. We find it hard to understand Europe's “social question” and hence tend to interpret even the democratic socialisms of Europe in terms of our own antiradical fetishism. We are not familiar with the deeper social struggles of Asia and hence tend to interpret even reactionary regimes as “democratic.”’ We fail to appreciate nonpolitical definitions of “freedom” and hence are baffled by their use.88"
"63","In many places in which a predominant yearning is for freedom from hunger or other forms of want, or from the physical dangers associated with disorder, it is hard for an American to comprehend a willingness to sacrifice the positive political freedom that is at the center of the liberal democratic creed. Another concept used abroad in ways opaque to most Americans today is justice, which for many in the Middle East and elsewhere connotes not so much legal procedure, as it does in the United States, but rather the distribution of power, even getting into questions of economic equality. Failure to understand such usage abroad is one ingredient in American rejection of some manifestations of political Islam, which is seen by its adherents as a vehicle for erecting a more just social order but by Americans as the imposition of undemocratic power structures.         "
"64","American difficulty in appreciating the bases and motivations of many conflicts has led to either of two different but comparably uncomprehending responses. One, exemplified by the American perception of most Islamist movements, is simply to reject any legitimacy of whichever side seems farthest removed from the political principles with which Americans are comfortable. The other, grounded in the American record of reconciling differing interests within the shared consensus of liberalism, is to believe that with enough persistence, negotiating skill, and maybe pressure differences can be bridged and conflict‐resolving deals can be struck. The latter response characterized American perceptions of conflict in Vietnam, including when noncommunist factions were competing among themselves in the early 1960s and later when the United States was trying to entice communists into a compromise settlement. Frances FitzGerald observed in her chronicle of the war, “Never having known a serious ideological struggle in their history, many Americans persisted in thinking of the Vietnamese conflict as…a battle between two fixed groups of people with different but conceivably negotiable interests.”89 The misperception was common both to the Johnson administration, which believed that a mutually acceptable solution could be reached with the help of motivation‐changing firepower, and to dovish opponents of the administration who believed that a stable and genuinely neutralist settlement was possible.         "
"65","In thinking about democracy abroad, Americans have tended to take for granted, and thus to overlook the importance of, the economic and technological bases of their own democracy. One reason for the sharp ideological divides that developed in Europe was that industrial technology was injected into societies that already were stratified, with roles already parceled out. The technology thus was disruptive, engendering fear and resistance from aristocracies and laboring classes alike. In the United States, where social patterns had not yet crystallized, the technology was less disruptive and instead seen more positively as an instrument of mobility and development.90 Then there is the stabilizing effect of the sheer wealth of productive land and other resources. “Thus our whole conception of our mission in the world,” wrote David Potter in his analysis of the effect of economic blessings on the American character, “was distorted by our failure to understand what the world regarded as most significant in our development”—that is, the economic abundance—“and what the essential conditions of democratic life in the American sense really are.”91"
"66","American misunderstanding about what liberal democracy requires—and the failure to appreciate that this involves generations of development of the appropriate political culture, which in turn requires certain historical and economic antecedents—has appeared in consternation over the failure of the Middle Eastern uprisings collectively called the Arab Spring to yield in most countries in the region anything approaching liberal democracy. The misunderstanding has been even more apparent with places, such as Afghanistan and Libya, where the United States has helped to topple an existing authority, with the result being characterized more by instability and violence than by liberalism and democracy. The clearest example was the initiation of the offensive war against Iraq in 2003, in which the chief motivation of promoters of the war (as distinct from the rationales used to sell it) was to use the overthrow of an Iraqi dictator as a hoped‐for catalyst for political and economic change in the Middle East in the direction of American‐style liberal democracy and free market economics.92 The war was a neoconservative project, but the belief that a new Iraqi order would fall into place smoothly and at minimal cost was embedded in a long‐standing American outlook about how all peoples are capable of enjoying freedom and democracy, which in turn was rooted in America's own unusually happy experience. As Patrick Lang summarized the perceptions leading to the Iraq war, “Americans invaded an imaginary Iraq that fit into our vision of the world. We invaded Iraq in the sure belief that inside every Iraqi there was an American trying to get out.”93"
"67","Distinctively American perceptual habits are deeply rooted and likely to endure. They are based on more than two centuries of experience that, by their very success, are not about to be rejected as a basis for thinking about the outside world. This is true of the habits of thought addressed in this article as well as other tendencies rooted in past American experience, such as how Americans think about wars and the foreign adversaries the United States fights against.94 Certainly not all perceptions shaped by the American experience are misperceptions, but the weight of the national past on how Americans interpret the present has frequently contributed to error.         "
"68","Overcoming such error and formulating sound policy in spite of it is a matter of political leadership. It also is a matter of political courage in bucking public opinion, and such courage is often in short supply. The political incentives to exploit public misconceptions rather than to correct them are high. Probably the most that can be expected from most political leaders are corrections that are subtle and gradual."
"69","Not to be expected is any direct political acknowledgment of the sort of systematic errors described in this article. Probably no American politician has won votes by telling voters they are ignorant or biased, much less by telling them that the ignorance or bias stems from what makes them Americans. Acknowledging not only that America is exceptional but also that American exceptionalism is uniformly good is politically required in the United States. As a downside of American exceptionalism, habits of misperception of the world abroad go not only uncorrected but unacknowledged."
"70","Alexis de Tocqueville described long ago the heavy hand of conventional wisdom in the United States, notwithstanding the nation's constitutional commitment to free thought and expression and the extent to which Americans argue with each other about other things. “I know no country in which there is so little true independence of mind and freedom of discussion as in America,” wrote Tocqueville. “In America, the majority raises very formidable barriers to the liberty of opinion; within those barriers an author may write whatever he pleases, but he will repent if he ever step beyond them.”95 The majority opinions of which he wrote include views of the outside world that have been molded by America's own good fortune.*"
