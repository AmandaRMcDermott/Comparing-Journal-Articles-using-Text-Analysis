"1","Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. ends his Age of Roosevelt trilogy about the rise of the New Deal with the Democrats’ resounding victory in the 1936 elections. Schlesinger's choice reflects the scholarly consensus of his time, shared by historians of later generations, that the 1936 election cemented Franklin D. Roosevelt's domestic legacy. The 1940 election, according to this consensus, was focused on looming conflict with the Axis powers.         "
"2","John W. Jeffries's A Third Term for FDR provides a provocative riposte to this conventional wisdom. Given Roosevelt's conflicting statements and propensity for subterfuge, the exact date and nature of the tipping point for his decision to seek a third term must remain opaque. But Jeffries amply documents Roosevelt's concern with the fragility of the New Deal in the wake of his failure to purge conservative Democrats in the 1938 congressional elections and as his two most likely successors, John Garner and James Farley, gravitated to the party's conservative wing. While Polish and Jewish voters anxious about events overseas may have sided in greater numbers with Roosevelt in 1940 than previously because of foreign policy concerns, the victories of Roosevelt and the Democrats in 1940 were driven by the same New Deal–friendly alliance of urban, working‐class, and ethnic voters that fueled their victory four years earlier.         "
"3","Wendell Willkie's rejection of the hard‐line laissez‐faire approach of the Republican Party's two previous presidential nominees also played a crucial role in fortifying the New Deal. His candidacy paved the way for the ascendancy of Republicans, such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, associated with the party's moderate, eastern establishment wing."
"4","Jeffries overstates his case when he claims the election “was among the most compelling in American history” (p. 131). His own account admits that Roosevelt's reelection was never seriously in doubt during the campaign. Still, Jeffries is right that “Democrats remained the normal majority party well into the postwar decades” (p. 194), only because Roosevelt's decision to run as an ardent New Dealer enabled the Party to consolidate the New Deal coalition."
"5","If Jeffries expertly explains that the 1940 election ensured the New Deal would survive, though, he could have provided a more robust discussion of how the election helped determine what type of New Deal would prevail. Alan Brinkley's The End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War (1995) details how Roosevelt, beginning in the late 1930s, retreated from a more ambitious vision of industrial democracy and income redistribution to the more modest Keynesian program of countercyclical stimulus. Brinkley's account is of a piece with those of other esteemed historians, including James MacGregor Burns, Richard Hofstadter, and William Leuchtenburg, who suggest that Roosevelt's dilettantish approach to policy prevented a more thorough reorientation of America's economic individualist tradition. Even Schlesinger's laudatory account of Roosevelt's first term notes that the New Deal was, from its outset, an unstable amalgam of economic approaches at best imperfectly reconciled by Roosevelt himself. All of these authors argue that Roosevelt's evasions about the New Deal bore long‐term consequences for the nation and liberalism.         "
"6","Jeffries's account, though, provides little acknowledgment of these internal divisions, and the reader is left to wonder whether he agrees with these historians. For a book about Roosevelt and the New Deal, the reader receives relatively slight discussion of what version of the New Deal vision Roosevelt embraced, both publicly and privately, prior to and during the 1940 election campaign. While Jeffries provides an exceptionally detailed discussion of the personalities and politics of the election, a more robust treatment of New Deal policies might have given the reader a better sense that the legacy of both Roosevelt and the 1940 election was more ambiguous and less a cause for liberal triumphalism than the author claims."
