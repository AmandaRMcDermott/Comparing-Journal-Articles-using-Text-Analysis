"1","ISRAELI DECISION MAKERS HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY ATTENTIVE to the Iranian nuclear threat since the 1990s.1 They have debated extensively the threat of nuclear Iran and have consistently found it intolerable.2 The United States and Western powers brought Iran to the negotiation table and to signing a nuclear deal through escalating cycles of sanctions.3 A successful conclusion of the negotiations should have presumably alleviated the concerns of alarmists in Israel. This however, is not the case. While the professional Israeli security elite considers favorably if cautiously the nuclear deal with Iran,4 the political leadership remains antagonistic. Israel retains its invested strike option,5 assuming that the deal would at best delay rather than eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat. For Benjamin Netanyahu, Hassan Rouhani remains “a wolf in sheep's clothing,”6 and the July 2015 deal does not bind Israel as it merely made “the world … a much more dangerous place.”7 His previous defense minister Moshe Yaalon (2013–2016) judged that “in the Persian Bazaar, the Iranians were better . . . and therefore it is necessary to conduct oneself in this issue area [nuclear Iran] by the rule of if I am not for myself, who is for me?”8 Whereas his current Defense Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, compared the nuclear deal—merely a year after it was announced—to the 1938 Munich Agreement.9"
"2","What is the true nature of the Iranian nuclear threat? Has it been or would it be severe enough to justify the Israeli propensity to act unilaterally? Whereas many in Israel consider the Iranian nuclear threat a game changer necessitating a strategic change—be it formally exposing Israel's nuclear capabilities10 or striking Iran—I submit that a nuclear Iran would be less of a threat than proposed, and hence its nuclear program did not and is unlikely to justify in the future an Israeli strategy change.         "
"3","Because the alarmist leadership of Netanyahu has displayed and is displaying little faith in the value of negotiated settlement, I start the article from the alarmist assumption that Iran would not abandon its nuclear ambitions even if it tactically delayed its program. A sober assessment may suggest otherwise, but what counts is the threat perception in Israel and specifically within the alarmist camp, simply because it has been in power now for over two terms and may very well continue to play a major role at least in the near future."
"4","I start the discussion by reviewing the three levels of Iranian threat that the Israeli security elite perceives: existential, proliferation and spillover, and conventional. I complement this discussion with insight into the framing of the Iranian threat within the Holocaust context. The remainder of the article is dedicated to a critical evaluation of the alarmist Israeli argument about Iran's irrationality and Israel's multilayered threat perception. In this part, I draw on theory, strategic logic, and a material analysis of the Israeli and regional contexts. In the conclusion, I summarize the arguments and suggest the policy implications of the analysis."
"5","For whatever reason, genuine‐strategic and/or expedient‐domestic, Israeli leaders find it useful to emphasize the existential dimension of the Iranian nuclear threat. Yet a review of their statements reveals a more complex set of threat arguments that share much with the logic of offensive realism, Stephen M. Walt's composite concept of threat, and Scott D. Sagan's work on nuclear proliferation.11 For purposes of simplification, the elements of the Israeli threat perceptions can be assembled into three levels: direct‐existential, proliferation and spillover, and consequential conventional and political. Efforts to assess the merit of Israel's threat perception need to refer to each of these levels.         "
"6","In most instances, Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, depicts the Iranian nuclear threat as purely and directly existential. In his resolute 2012 words, “there is no doubt about Iran's intention to annihilate us,” “Iran is serious, it makes progress towards acquiring nuclear bombs in order to annihilate the state of Israel.”12 Similarly, a year and a half later, he reiterated: “Iran's objective is to overtake the whole Middle East . . . and annihilate the state of Israel. This is not speculation, it is the goal.”13 In other words, as far as Netanyahu is concerned, Iranian intentions wait for capabilities, and while the former cannot be altered, their realization can be prevented by denying the latter.            "
"7","While Netanyahu has been the most consistent advocate of the existential nature of the Iranian threat, he was not alone. Defense Minister, Ehud Barak, by far the most dominant security figure in Netanyahu's 2009–2013 government, submitted that “[n]uclear Iran is one of the most serious things that can happen to Israel . . . if there would be a nuclear Iran, everything here will be different . . . we will move to another existential phase . . . down the road Israel will face a threat of existential proportions.”14 Members of Israel's political elite who share such views ground their assessment in the assumed irrationality and zealot ideology of Iran's leadership. Tzachi Hanegbi, former chair of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (2006–2010), suggested that Iran might be guided by “zealot consciousness” and “zealots . . . are ready to pay the price of millions martyr‐deaths in order to annihilate the hated entity of the heretics,” and thus he concluded that “the possibility of using nuclear weapon against Israel . . . must be considered.”15 (Ret.) General Amos Yadlin described Iran as possibly a “death sanctifying culture” and therefore found that “a nuclear bomb in the hands of [its] regime that daily says that Israel must be wiped of the face of the map is a very high threat to [Israel's] national security.”16 Similarly, the defense minister of Netanyahu's third government, (Ret.) Lieutenant General Moshe Yaalon (2013‐2016), explained that “[t]he Ayatollah regime is an apocalyptic‐messianic regime . . . its value system and its religious beliefs are different and it aspires to apply them to all of us.”17 He further pointed out that “their rationality is entirely different from ours. Their concepts and their calculations are different. They do not resemble at all the former Soviet Union. They do not even resemble Pakistan or North Korea.”18 Incidentally, the opinions of alarmists seem to have struck a chord with the Israeli public. Between 2006 and 2013, an average of 75 percent of Israelis were convinced that nuclear‐armed Iran indeed posed an existential threat to Israel.19"
"8","If the alarmist members of the Israeli security elite would have had to choose sides in the debate between Kenneth N. Waltz and Scott Sagan over nuclear stability,20 they would have sided with the latter. Although priding themselves on being realists, the alarmists nevertheless reject the optimistic argument of Waltz. They do not believe that nuclear proliferation generates stability through better balance of power and deterrence.21 Rather, they accept Sagan's pessimistic argument, which suggests that the frailty of (“other”) human beings and the deficiencies of (“others'”) institutions increase the likelihood of premeditated (national or renegade), mistaken, and accidental launch.22 Essentially, the Israeli alarmist camp subscribes to two tenets: first, that nuclear Iran would necessarily usher in dramatic nuclear proliferation throughout the Middle East, and second, that as a result, the risk of nuclear use would increase dramatically. According to Israelis, nuclear Iran would bring about an unstable multipolar Middle East inhabited by inexperienced actors incapable of properly controlling their nuclear arsenals.            "
"9","Barak, representing the opinion of many, suggested that reactive proliferation would be both inevitable and disastrous. “If Iran becomes nuclear,” he argued, “the World . . . will not have control over the nuclear Jinni. We know this for next to certainty.”23 To the American public, Barak crafted a sharper message: “Saudi Arabia, Turkey and later Egypt would soon follow suit. The danger of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terror groups would increase exponentially.”24"
"10","Indeed, it seems that Israelis could not be more alarmed about the consequences of regional proliferation. Yaalon assesses that “a Middle East with a Nuclear Iran is a Middle East with nuclear chaos. This threatens World stability,”25 whereas Hanegbi reasons that “from a theoretical point of view, it is impossible to maintain in the Middle East deterrence founded on MAD.”26 In fact, even impartial observers believe that the Middle East would become combustible and unmanageable. (Ret.) General Isaac Ben‐Israel—one of the best‐qualified Israelis to pass judgment—believes that “if Iran becomes nuclear, we will find ourselves in an unstable multi‐polar system that includes fanatic actors and terrorist organizations.”27"
"11","As indicated earlier, of all proliferation‐related threats, the Israelis seem to be most troubled by a spillover to terrorist groups, which are the least inhibited among international actors. Barak explained that “since so many states where the level of control is very low will possess nuclear capabilities . . . these capabilities can end in the hands of terrorists.”28 Hanegbi maintained that “there is a high probability that significant non‐conventional capabilities would spill over from states to terror organizations.” Yet perhaps Sagan made the argument better than all Israelis. As the Revolutionary Guards (would) control Iran's nuclear program but also interact with terrorist organizations, obstacles to spillover may hardly exist. “To have your nuclear guardians and your terrorist supporter organizations be one and the same,” suggests Sagan, “is a recipe for disaster.”29"
"12","Although often lost in the debate, Israel is also troubled by conventional threats arising from Iran's nuclear status upgrade. Three possible adverse outcomes concern Israelis in particular: conventional emboldening of its enemies, regional alliance shift, and loss of freedom to regulate the environment by force. As a corollary, Israelis are also concerned that nuclear capabilities would extend the life of the ayatollah regime—the very root of Israel's elevated threat levels."
"13","First, according to Israelis, a nuclear status would embolden both Iran and its proxies and increase their aggressive propensity. The argument is a derivative of the stability/instability paradox, which suggests that nuclear deterrence instills in its holder (the “defender”) a toxic sense of impunity and a penchant for conventional adventurism.30 As Barak wrote in the Wall Street Journal, “Iran's terror proxies would be emboldened—operating under the umbrella of a nuclear Iran.”31 Or, as he suggested in an interview, “if [Iran] possess nuclear weapon, no one could stop it when she will challenge neighbors and adversaries. What happened in the Rhine district in 1936 would be a kids' game compared to what will happen a round Iran.”32"
"14","Second, Israelis fear that Iran's nuclear status would usher in a destabilizing regional realignment, essentially a localized version of the offensive realist “bandwagoning” argument.33 They fear such a development even more, as Iran's rise coincides with a perceived American decline and retrenchment. As Barak noted, “when all aspects are put together, the conclusion is that if Iran becomes nuclear and all moderate forces around us substantially weaken . . . [and] add [to these] the fact that US would leave Iraq and Afghanistan . . . leaving behind confused allies, the emerging picture is clear . . . the region will not be the same region . . . our existence will not be the same existence. We will be under the shadow of a constant storm.”34 Likewise, Efraim Inbar offers, albeit in a softer version of the argument. He writes that “the danger [of nuclear Iran] to the Arab World is more immediate than it is for the United States or perhaps even Israel . . . the mere possession of such weapons—and their use for leverage and intimidation—could force Arab countries to submit to Teheran's demands.”35"
"15","Third, the least noted and least direct consequent threat that the Israelis perceive concerns Israel's loss of capacity to control its strategic environment with force. As Hanegbi suggested, “when the Middle East will turn nuclear . . . after Iran will become nuclear, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, and Syria . . . Israel will be neutralized, hesitant, and devoid of deterrence capacity. Our life will become unbearable.”36 And as he further explained, “the cumulative result of all these [developments] is that . . . Israel would become a Middle Eastern rug. It will be possible to harass [Israel], and hurt and make miserable its residents' lives, while she could not respond properly and decisively.”37"
"16","Finally, as all elevated threats Israel expects to face have one root cause—the zealot Iranian regime—it is the longevity of the latter that is by definition inimical to the Israeli interest. What extends this longevity? According to Barak, the answer is clear: “if Iran becomes nuclear, the ayatollahs could act with unrestrained brutality against freedom loving Iranians. The World would stand idle, the regime would survive, its life expectancy would increase.”38 Netanyahu stretched the argument even further. “If they get nuclear weapons,” he argued, “this brutal regime will be immortal, like North Korea.”39"
"17","Second only in importance to the definition of the Iranian threat is its framing. For Netanyahu, a few others, and a significant minority of Israelis, the Iranian nuclear threat is best understood in the context of the Holocaust. Within this context, the threat is ultimate, the Western response is fickle, and Israel must be ready to fend for itself.40"
"18","It is indicative that Netanyahu, described as ever attentive to history,41 regularly associates the Iranian threat with the Holocaust, and even more telling is the fact that he consistently has been doing so on Holocaust Remembrance Days. On Remembrance Day 2009, he declared that “we will not let Holocaust deniers commit another Holocaust. This is [my] ultimate commitment . . . as Prime Minister . . . again erupts the darkness of hatred for our people and state. In our time, new forces, that openly declare their intention to wipe off the Jewish state, rise. And, what is the reaction of the enlightened world? Instead of strong condemnation we hear, at best, weak voice.”42 In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in March 2012, he promised to “never let [his] people live under the shadow of annihilation” and then emphasized the need to act as he presented two documents detailing the unfulfilled Jewish request to bomb Auschwitz.43 Following AIPAC, he submitted in an interview that “if you do not take a decision and you did not succeed in preventing this [Iran possessing nuclear capabilities], to whom would you explain it, to historians? The previous generations and to the generations that won't be around after this?”44 Then, on Holocaust Remembrance Day 2012, he declared that “Iran armed with nuclear weapons, is an existential threat for Israel . . . It is a duty to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons . . . above all, it is our duty . . . at this day . . . we have to realize a supreme duty. This duty is not only to remember the past, but also learn its lessons, and most important, apply these lessons . . .”45 In a late 2012 interview, he explained, “when we did not have a state, when we did not have an army, and when somebody threatened to annihilate us and acted in reality, actually took the act of annihilation—we went and pleaded others. So, today we do not beg, we prepare [a military option].”46 Finally, in October 2013, Netanyahu told the United Nations (UN) that “the last century has taught us . . . that when a radical regime with global ambitions gets awesome power, sooner or later its appetite for aggression knows no bounds.”47"
"19","It is tempting to consider Netanyahu's beating of the Iranian nuclear drum and his packaging of the Iranian threat in Holocaust cloth as designed to divert public opinion from his stagnant and uninspiring tenure. It is equally tempting to regard his relentless Iranian references as marketing ploys designed to convey a sense of Israeli determination and urgency and mobilize international support for a harsh line against Iran and a soft response toward the Israeli–Palestinian deadlock. It would be safe to speculate that these instrumental considerations did not escape Netanyahu. Nevertheless, those rather familiar with Netanyahu suggest that his preoccupation with Iran and reference to the Holocaust are genuinely deep‐rooted. A leading Israeli military correspondent suggested that “for [Netanyahu] the Arak nuclear reactor, as much as the uranium enrichment plants in Natanz and Kom, resemble the furnaces of Auschwitz. To more than one person he posed the question: do you imagine that we would observe the furnaces of Auschwitz being built and wait until people are led into these in order to attack?”48 It was also the judgment of President Barack Obama that “the prime minister and defense minister [Barak] feel a profound, historic obligation not to put Israel in a position where it cannot act decisively and unilaterally to protect the state . . . the history of the Holocaust and of anti‐Semitism and brutality directed against the Jewish people for more than a millennium weights on [Netanyahu].”49"
"20","The consideration of Iran within the Holocaust context has another effect. It almost automatically evokes in Israel a sense of déjà vu of appeasement. Hanegbi explained that he “did not hear an American commitment to a military action [but rather] . . . amorphous and fancy words that do not promise Israel that it will not be abandoned in the last minute . . . there is some resemblance between what we observe today and the Mark of Cain afflicting the West prior to the Second World War, when it did not bravely face tyranny, fascism, and Nazism.” 50 In 2012, Yaalon expressed similar thoughts. “Is the Western World determined to stop the [Iranian nuclear] project?” he asked and hastened to answer, “when you observe that in this matter there were quite a number of moments of Western fickleness, and it is so perceived by the Iranian regime, it is necessary to raise the issue [of Western resolve].”51 The feeling among Israelis may be best summed up in the words of journalist Ari Shavit, just before Netanyahu's October 2013 UN speech (words echoed in Netanyahu's own 2014 Holocaust Remembrance Day speech):               "
"21","Today no one wishes to hear his somber truth . . . The states are united in a desire not to let the prophet of gloom from Jerusalem demolish the peace‐in‐our‐times the merchant of illusions from Teheran sells them . . . Netanyahu has all the reasons in the World to give next week in the UN a Czechoslovakia speech of his own. The wind of Munich is in the air; there are troubling similarities between the zeitgeist of London—Paris 1938 and London—New‐York 2013.”52"
"22","It would be wrong to underestimate the consequences of the “disaster and appeasement” frame of mind. It is within this frame that the alarmists approach both Iran and the West, including the P5+1 negotiation and deal with Iran. For the alarmists, the two defining reference points are the 1930s and the failure to stop North Korea from becoming nuclear. Essentially, they are guided by little faith in both sides. Iran is regarded as inherently deceiving and treacherous, and the agreement as resulting at best in temporary suspension of Iran's efforts, a perception that previously led Israelis to oppose a deal.53 As far as the negotiating Western states were concerned, the alarmists suspected that being far less threatened than Israel, they had conveniently let Iran outsmart them. Moreover, whereas negotiations were essentially about freezing Iran's nuclear program, the alarmists wanted a radical rollback of the latter and a comprehensive dismantling of its key installations.            "
"23","By almost any standard, most certainly realist—be it relative power or the three other variables specified in Walt's balance of threat theory54—nuclear Iran is naturally regarded in Israel as elevating the level of threat. Iran accumulates relative power, “narrows” the geographic distance to Israel with its ballistic capabilities and through proxies, develops offensive capabilities, and displays offensive intentions. The realist dynamic also suggests that Iranian nuclear capabilities could set in motion regional processes that might increase the threat to Israel further.         "
"24","Contemplating Israeli security from a constructivist perspective55—emphasizing identity and beliefs—would generate in Israel equally alarming conclusions. The threat embedded in Iran's vehement hostility toward Israel is unmistakable. Obviously, revolutionary Shiite Iran lacks no instrumental motivation to champion an anti‐Israel agenda in a predominantly Sunni and Arab Middle East.56 And yet the endurance of exceptional hostility and the fact that anti‐Zionism is a yardstick for revolutionary purity57 leaves little doubt in Jerusalem that the Iranian regime genuinely wishes to harm Israel. Israeli leaders would have felt irresponsible had they ignored the poisonous legacy of Ayatollah Khomeini (who considered their country an “imperial outpost” and a false racist entity to be dismantled)58 or the vile rhetoric of his successors (who described Israel as a malignant tumor exploiting a “fabricated” Holocaust in order to rob the Palestinians of their divine right to a holy Muslim land).         "
"25","Iran's record of behavior further supports an Israeli constructivist threat perception. Iran was implicated in norm‐breaking behavior as a participant in or initiator of the terrorist attacks against the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires (1992) and the Jewish cultural center there (1994). In fact, it was instrumental in establishing Hezbollah and has since been its weapons supplier, trainer, and patron. It has also intermittently supplied weapons to the (Sunni) Hamas in Gaza. Both movements deny Israel's right to exist, have occasionally attacked its military forces and citizens, and have been engaged in cross‐border terrorism. Hezbollah is also involved in international terrorism, and Iran is suspected of having contracted some terrorist actions or at the very least of having provided logistical support to terrorism. In the words of Daniel Byman, Iran has been “one of the World's most active sponsors of terrorism.”59"
"26","In short, Israel's concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions are understandable.60 From an Israeli perspective, proliferation to Iran and beyond would have a negative impact on Israel's national security. However, the relevant issue is not whether Israel would be worse off if Iran acquired nuclear capabilities and these proliferated regionally. Rather, it is by how the threat would increase and whether it would become intolerable. With these issues in mind, we turn to the evaluation of the alarmist assessment of Iran's assumed irrationality and the elevated levels of threat that nuclear Iran would presumably pose for Israel.         "
"27","The very foundation of the Israeli alarmist threat perception, policy objectives, and strategy is the argument that Iran's leadership is irrational to the point of suicidal or, alternatively, informed by a value system that encourages immeasurably high cost tolerance. Yet the alarmists provide hardly any quality evidence in support of these assertions. Rather, their whole rationale rests at best on the ayatollahs' extreme rhetoric and occasional rogue conduct. However, wicked rhetoric and norm‐breaching behavior at home and abroad are not in and of themselves significant enough markers of irrationality, suicidal national tendencies, or exceptional cost tolerance."
"28","To simplify a complex discussion, in order to make a credible case for Iranian irrationality, one has to present evidence that the regime (a) has been unable or unwilling to seriously consider the expected costs and risks of policies, (b) chose policies disregarding costs and risks and irrespective of the fact that they were inconsistent with the ultimate regime purposes, and (c) adhered to policies irrespective of their failure or the escalating risks and costs they involved. Presented in positive terms, one has to show evidence that Iran's leadership was overall willing to take extreme risks and tolerate exceptional costs that defeated its policies' purposes or outweighed their expected utility. The remaining question, then, is whether the historical record supports these definitive patterns of irrational conduct. Or, more specifically, because the Israeli alarmist camp alludes to Iran's ideology and rogue behavior as indications of future irrational conduct in nuclear matters, one should address the following key questions: First, has ideology defeated the leadership's capacity to identify adverse fluctuations in costs, risks, and benefits and, consequently, to take pragmatic decisions? Second, was the regime's international conduct dogmatic, extreme, and oblivious to escalating risks and costs? And finally, has Iran acted irrationally in its pursuit of nuclear military power before the July 2015 deal?"
"29","The most effective way to resolve the complex issue of hierarchy between ideology and pragmatism is to consult expert opinion. Such opinion seems to converge round the conclusion that in spite of ideological zealotry, Iran's leaders have generally been pragmatic—that is, rational. It is not that ideology did not play a role in Iran but rather that its role at home was partially instrumental,61 and more importantly, its role in foreign affairs was more limited than assumed.               "
"30","James M. Linday and Ray Takeyh conclude that revolutionary Iran has proven both “messianic and pragmatic”62—a country that “speaks in ideological terms, wants to become a dominant regional power, and is capable of acting recklessly. . . . but . . . also . . . recognizes its limitations [and] wants to preserve its hold on power.”63 Even more convincing, David Menashri suggests that “with very few exceptions, whenever ideological revolutionary convictions clashed with the interests of the state, Iran's state interests ultimately triumphed, forcing a change in its actual policy . . . such retreat . . . was usually imposed by harsh realities.”64 Further evidence that pragmatism comes before ideology emerges from Iran's selective approach toward abuse of Muslims. Linday and Takeyh point out that “Iran . . . has vociferously defended the Palestinians, but it has stood by as the Russians have slaughtered Chechens and the Chinese have suppressed Muslim Uighurs. Ideological purity, it seems, has been less important than seeking diplomatic cover from Russia and commercial activity with China. Despite their Islamic compulsions, the mullahs like power too much to be martyrs.”65"
"31","All in all, then, as James Dobbins observes, “Iran's odd combination of theocracy and elected institutions has produced generally cautious and pragmatic behavior at the state‐to‐state level.”66 The following discussion of Iranian foreign policy further supports the conclusion that ideology took a backseat to rational pragmatism when core national security issues were at stake.               "
"32","Even a rudimentary review of Iran's belligerent foreign conduct suggests that its leadership has oscillated quite rationally between confrontation and compromise, including when it resorted to or distanced itself from deplorable tactics such as terrorism by proxy. However, in order to flesh out this foreign conduct rationality, one needs first to understand the primary purposes of the regime and the constraints it faces. On the agenda of the Iranian regime, survival and therefore legitimacy at home are second to none, and whatever actions the regime takes abroad, it does so more often than not in the face of more powerful forces, first and foremost the United States."
"33","Bruce Riedel submits that “throughout its history the Islamic Republic has behaved like an unusual and disagreeable state, but it has been careful to avoid decisions that would lead to catastrophic consequences.”67 In support of his conclusion, he brings up six major international occasions between 1980 and 2004 in which Iran proved consistently cautious, calculating, and ready to change policy in the face of escalating prospects of confrontation. While each of the six cases is indicative, none is more important than Iran's decision to accept UN Resolution 598 and end the Iran‐Iraq War (1980–1988). As Takeyh observes, this decision left a “legacy [that] continues to haunt the Islamic Republic and shadow nearly all its deliberations,”68—that is, it proved formative. However, before considering this decision in greater detail, let us recall that policymaking in revolutionary Iran involves—just as in most countries—struggles among different factions. For example, in 1982, during the Iran‐Iraq War, the more bellicose and dogmatic leaders of the Revolutionary Guards won the debate over whether to become revisionist, invade Iraq, and destroy Saddam Hussein, or accept his offer to end the war.69"
"34","The 1982 decision proved bad. It condemned Iran to six additional very costly years of a deadlocked war, although at no point did Iran or its leadership face an existential threat. Importantly, as time passed, investments and costs mounted, and yet no favorable end was in sight. Iran's assessment of the utility of war changed. By 1988, Iran's leadership had become convinced, admittedly belatedly, that the cost of war, poor military performance, prospects of confrontation with the United States, and clear signs of war weariness at home70 required the abandoning of any hope for victory and the acceptance of the cease‐fire resolution. In short, the rationality underlying the leadership decision to end the war is beyond contest. Khomeini weighted the costs, risks, and prospects of achieving the revised 1982 purpose of war, all in light of professional opinion, and then took a decision he dearly wished to have avoided and which he described as “more deadly than drinking hemlock . . . [but] based only on the interest of the Islamic Republic.”71 In fact, in light of the regime's primary purpose of survival and legitimacy, it was a decision that required careful calculation because, as Thomas L. McNaugher observes, it also involved “grave political risks, since . . . [the mullahs] tacitly admitted that the [1982] decision to continue the war . . . was a costly strategic error.”72"
"35","In light of this definitive conflict experience, the regime's use of deplorable rogue tactics, including terrorism by proxy, looms as rational. As Byman suggests, considering Iran's limited capabilities, terror‐by‐proxy “offer[s] Iran some degree of deniability” while still preserving its “capacity to achieve its own interests . . . without paying the consequences that more direct involvement might entail.”73 In fact, considering that the regime perceives terror as instrumentally worthwhile, limiting its use is also suggestive of its rationality. Thus, as Byman further suggests, Iran has restrained its terrorist proxies and, more importantly, its own resort to terrorism whenever its leaders assessed that further use was likely to bring about the punishing wrath of its enemies, mainly the United States.74 The Iranian decision to abstain from terrorism against American targets after their proxy attack on the Khobar Towers complex (June 1996) is a case in point.               "
"36","The drivers and purpose of the Iranian nuclear program can be explained in different ways,75 yet two among these stand supreme. First, the program could eventually provide Iran and the regime with the strategic utility that nuclear military capabilities are assumed to generate: an existential insurance policy. Simply put, as a perceived nuclear power, the threat of foreign military intervention against Iran would be infinitely reduced. Second, until maturation, the program could help generate proud national consensus that would help preserve the legitimacy of the underperforming regime. It is the international opposition to the program that galvanizes Iranian public pride and thereby diminishes the capacity of opposition to challenge the regime. In short, considering the failures at home, a diversionary strategy of raising the specter of threats from abroad is sensible.76 Of course, any foreign diversion is rational only insofar as its political benefit outweighs the risks and costs of confrontation the diversion may entail. The point is, Iran's nuclear program seems to meet well such specifications of rationality. As Uriel Abulof suggests, a nuclear diversion is superior to diversion of domestic discontent through the beating the drums of conventional conflict.77 It is more sustainable and it is less vulnerable to adversary countermeasures. If indeed, as an Iranian political scientist has suggested, nuclearization “is a must for Iran's strategy of survival” because “Iran is in a state of disarray . . . [and] only by becoming a nuclear weapons state [it]can . . . consolidate its social coherence,”78 then as long as the international costs and risks of the program are controlled, the regime's rationality is beyond reproach.               "
"37","It is precisely in this sense of controlling and mitigating risks and costs that the twists and turns of Iran's negotiations with the West reflect—much as its oscillating conflict policy did—the instrumental rationality of the regime. Yet again, the overall pattern is one of alternating between defiance and concessions in an effort to promote the policy but avoid losing control and defeating its purpose. Hence, the Iranians bargain hard, cover up their actions, deceive the West, exploit opportunities, but also accept compromises when their provocative conduct encounters credible military and economic threat or action. Hence, for example, as soon as the regime concluded that the United States was bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was quick to exploit the opportunity and increase the number of centrifuges by a factor of 50, to about 8,000 by mid‐2009.79 However, both before and after, the regime has been ready to slow down the nuclear program, halt it at least temporarily (2003), negotiate, enter into an agreement with the European Union over the application of the Additional Protocol and voluntary suspension of enrichment,80 and offer further concessions and compromises in the negotiations with the P5+1 group. There is not much allure for Israel in Iran's nuclear conduct, besides one aspect: Iran's pattern of behavior in this domain clearly indicates the overall rationality of the regime.               "
"38","Perhaps not surprisingly, several high‐level Israeli officials and scholars seem to agree with the foregoing analysis. They perceive Iran's leadership as by and large rational, and although they consider the regime's values and cost tolerance different from those prevailing in the West, they do not perceive it to be suicidal. For example, Meir Dagan—presumably familiar with the Iranian leadership by virtue of his tenure as head of Mossad (2002‐2011) assigned to focus on Iran—suggested that the regime was “very rational” and did not back down from his assessment even when asked to consider its (former) most venomous anti‐Israeli representative, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.81 Similarly, Israel's chief of general staff, Benny Gantz (2011‐2015), told his fellow Israelis on Independence Day 2012 that “the Iranian leadership is composed of very rational people,” although he added that “[nuclear] capability in the hands of fundamentalist Muslims, who can in certain instances make different calculations, is a dangerous matter.”82"
"39","Perhaps astonishingly, the rationality of the Iranian regime was almost explicitly acknowledged by none other than its foremost denier, Netanyahu. In September 2012, he suggested at the UN that “clear red lines have . . . worked with Iran. Earlier this year, Iran threatened to close the Straits of Hormouz. The United States drew a clear red line and Iran backed off.”83 In October 2013, he declared in the same venue that he himself had “argued for many years, including on this podium, that the only way to peacefully prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons is to combine tough sanctions with a credible military threat.”84 In short, according to Netanyahu, the Iranian leadership is inclined to respond as desired to a proper and credible cost and risk threat‐policy, or by implication it is a classical if savvy rational actor.               "
"40","The short answer to the question concerned with the severity of the first‐level existential threat of an Iranian premeditated nuclear attack is that this threat is marginal, largely because Iran would not operate in a strategic vacuum. Rather, the defining factors are Israel's widely acknowledged nuclear lead and Iran's rationality."
"41","By now, two American presidents have confirmed that Israel has nuclear capabilities in a class with great powers. In 1992, Richard Nixon submitted that he “knew” that Israel had nuclear military capabilities (a matter brought initially to his attention by Henry Kissinger in 1969).85 In 2008, Jimmy Carter suggested that Israel had “150 or more” nuclear weapons.86 Long before then (1986), an Israeli renegade nuclear technician divulged to the Sunday Times key secrets of Israel's nuclear weapons program.87 In 1998, Avner Cohen's study Israel and the Bomb provided a detailed account of the early years of the Israeli nuclear program.88 During the 1990s and early 2000s, Cohen and then (Ret.) Brigadier General Yitzhak Yaakov (head of the Israel Defense Forces' weapons research and development program in the late 1960s and early 1970s) were persecuted in Israel for unraveling parts of its nuclear history. The latter was also prosecuted. More importantly, a 1994 study by Ariel Levite and Emily Landau suggested that Arab leaders had been convinced since the 1970s that Israel possessed nuclear military capabilities.89 At present, it is widely believed that Israel deploys nuclear capabilities on land, in the air, and at sea. As of early 2016, the Israeli strategic submarine fleet counts five modern vessels, and a sixth one is scheduled to either join or replace the older of the five, within two years. For all practical purposes, Israel secured an assured second‐strike capability before it even needed it. Defense Minister Barak was quoted as having said that “the Germans can be proud . . . that they have secured the existence of the State of Israel for many years to come.”90 Not surprisingly, (Ret.) General Ben‐Israel (presumably familiar with Israel's capabilities) cited Anthony Cordesman's assessment of a deep Iran–Israel asymmetry, concluding that while (future) nuclear Iran could not annihilate Israel, (present) Israel could kill about 20 million Iranians and thereby make Iran incapable of resurrecting.91"
"42","The implications of Israel's overwhelming nuclear lead are clear for as long as it would be retained. For Iran to launch a premeditated nuclear attack on Israel, its leadership would have to be exceptionally uninformed, manifestly irrational, or valuing the hope (of fatally hurting Israel) more than the certainty of an almost inconceivable national calamity. In other words, Israel's overwhelming nuclear lead suggests that emerging nuclear Iran can be perceived as posing intolerable existential threat to Israel only if the leadership in Teheran is considered suicidal. This is, of course, precisely what the alarmist Israeli camp suggests, but prominent Iran followers and evidence contradict. Hence, James Dobbins concludes that “there is nothing in the Islamic Republic's actual behavior throughout its existence to substantiate the charge of irrationality, let alone suicidal lunacy.”92 Similarly, Riedel concludes that even if and when Iran gets the bomb, it “will not be a crazy or suicidal state . . . [as] the history of the Islamic Republic suggests . . . Iran will behave like a normal nuclear weapon state. . . . With other nuclear states it will avoid conflict that could escalate into a nuclear exchange.”93 It all can be summarized in the words of Yair Evron, who for years studied the nuclear world and Israel's nuclear posture:               "
"43","In view of Israel's widely assumed large nuclear arsenal and numerous delivery vehicles, including various protected platforms that form a second strike capability, it appears highly improbable that even a fanatic leadership would choose [a premeditated nuclear attack] policy . . . no regime, even if endowed with the most extreme ideology, chooses to commit suicide [and] Iran must consider . . . also the high probability of a devastating American response.94"
"44","Unlike the case of a premeditated state attack, none of Sagan's pessimistic arguments on instability in the context of bilateral Iran–Israel nuclear relations can be ruled out. However, Israel's nuclear and technological lead affects these relations as well. The main proliferation risks that Sagan considers (mistaken, accidental, and renegade use) are characteristics of and particularly high during the initial stages of a nuclear arms race involving relatively small numbers of strike capabilities (small‐N). In such a context, temptation and fear reinforce each other. On the one hand, leaders can delude themselves that a successful first counterforce strike is feasible, and on the other hand, their counterparts would be inclined to preempt because of an acute sense of strategic vulnerability (“use it or lose it”). As scholars have long found, the dynamic and stress of a crisis,95 and only more so between states armed with elementary nuclear capabilities, contain the seeds of catastrophe. Seduction and desperation are strong drivers of instability when small‐N states are involved.            "
"45","Yet this is exactly what would be missing from hypothetical future Israeli–Iranian nuclear relations, precisely because these would start with a robust Israeli lead. Considering Israel's maturing multilayered missile defense system, the risk involved in renegade or accidental use would also be reduced. In other words, although it is best for Israel that Iran remains non‐nuclear, a nuclear Iran in whatever form could not challenge Israel's perceived strategic superiority or make the risks of existential strike and instability intolerable, at least not in the foreseeable future."
"46","Iran could hypothetically impact regional proliferation in three major ways. First, it could transfer nuclear weapons to other states and/or nonstate actors. Second, it could transfer nuclear knowledge and technology (NK&T). Third, it could become the cause of reactive proliferation—that is, induce other states to acquire nuclear capabilities (and thereby possibly cause secondary transfer). As the foregoing types of proliferation threats vary considerably, they must be assessed separately.            "
"47","Of all proliferation risks, the transfer of ready‐made nuclear weapons requires the least discussion. History suggests that for almost 70 years, nuclear states have consistently avoided transferring nuclear weapons or control over these to other states, and this includes frivolous Pakistan and renegade North Korea. Transfer is precluded, most probably, because the perceived risks associated with loss of control and the international cost of exposure are considered too high, while the political and strategic return is assessed as rather low. In some cases, a particularly powerful obstacle might be the fear that transferred weapons might end up threatening their supplier."
"48","The threat of NK&T transfer is real. States have repeatedly engaged in NK&T transfer both formally and semiofficially.96 A French nuclear reactor was crucial for the development of Israel's nuclear capabilities, and Israel apparently supported South Africa's nuclear program.97 North Korea supplied a nuclear reactor to Syria, and most troubling, Pakistani knowledge and logistical help were lavishly extended to a number of Muslim states.98 According to Pakistan's chief nuclear scientist, A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani military elite advised Iran on nuclear equipment suppliers because “Iran was important Muslim country . . . [and] if Iran succeeded in acquiring nuclear technology, we will be a strong block in the region to counter international pressure. Iran's nuclear capability will neutralize Israel's power.”99 According to (Ret.) General Mirza Aslam Beg, Pakistan's former chief of the army staff (1988–1991) and apparent Iran sympathizer, Iranian officials offered his government US$4 billion for nuclear weapon technology and asked him whether they could buy a bomb.100 Pakistan refused to sell nuclear weapons but willingly helped logistically, which is, in and of itself, an alarming development. Top officials of a largely Sunni state (more than 85 percent), guided partially by a sense of solidarity, extended very significant nuclear support to a bordering Shiite power.101 At the very least, this indicates that the realist arguments about natural barriers to proliferation and relative‐power calculations are exaggerated, a matter no threat assessment can afford ignoring.               "
"49","Ostensibly, Shiite Iran could act like Pakistan, disregard all divides, and share NK&T with Sunni enemies of Israel. In fact, Iran is not compelled to wait until it concludes its nuclear military program. Rather, it can start divulging knowledge and technology incrementally as it makes progress, including, for example, concerning the critical fuel cycle it has already mustered. In reality, however, the divides between Sunni Arab states and Shiite Iran—as indicated in the Syrian civil war—are deeper by a few orders of magnitude than any possible divide between Iran and Pakistan. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq (with a powerful Sunni minority) are no actual candidates for Iranian NK&T transfer. Bashar al‐Assad's Syria is a candidate yet too unstable, and while Sunni Egypt under military rule is not, if the Muslim Brotherhood ever returns to power, Iran might reconsider."
"50","As far as reactive proliferation is concerned, the main questions are as follows: Is it inevitable? How likely is it? And, if it takes place, how severe would the threat to Israel be? The answers to these questions are not obvious and cannot be discussed in the abstract. Rather, they should incorporate theoretical knowledge with a context sensitive analysis of what animates Sunni Arab states that contemplate a nuclear Shiite Iran."
"51","The bad news is that whatever is responsible for the good news (limited prospects for a regional Iranian NK&T transfer)—that is, identity and rivalry—presumably makes Sunni Arab powers more likely to proliferate reactively. And yet reactive proliferation is by no means preordained. Indeed, in spite of the spread of knowledge and production technology, the record suggests that states do not rush to proliferate reactively.102 Following an extensive quantitative and qualitative study, Philipp Bleek concludes that “proliferation by rivals make states only modestly more motivated to proliferate themselves [and] this motivation is not sufficient to push most states over the high hurdles to launching nuclear weapons programs or seeing programs through to acquisition.”103 It appears that reactive proliferation is contingent on three factors: the level of motivation, which is a derivative of the intensity of rivalry; the technological, economic, and political costs involved in going nuclear; and the availability of alternative solutions, specifically, a security guarantee in the form of extended deterrence.104 Considering that the United States can impose a high cost on proliferating states but also render proliferation much less attractive by extending its deterrence, the prospects of reactive proliferation would depend on its policy, although one still needs to assess each potential case independently.               "
"52","The two regional powers bordering or closest to Iran and most capable of reactively proliferating are Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, by virtue of its NATO membership, already enjoys implied extended deterrence and thus should not be exceptionally concerned about balancing in kind against Iran.105 Saudi Arabia, as Colin H. Kahl, Melissa G. Dalton, and Matthew Irvine observe, is the one Middle Eastern country most hard‐pressed to reactively proliferate, be it by launching its own nuclear program or by “borrowing” nuclear and delivery capabilities from Pakistan.106 Yet the United States has both interest and capacity to restrain the Saudi (and other) propensity to arm in kind against Iran by extending its vital allies nuclear deterrence.107 Indeed, as Philipp Bleek and Eric Lorber suggest, security guarantees significantly reduce reactive proliferation proclivities, especially before an operational program is put in place.108"
"53","Obviously, the Israeli threat assessment cannot assume such United States commitment. Rather, Israel should weigh carefully the possible consequences of reactive proliferation. In this respect, the main point is that reactive proliferation would pose a greater threat to Iran than to Israel. The fact is that in spite of conflict and fundamental hostility, Arab states have largely refrained from acquiring nuclear capabilities in reaction to Israel's nuclear monopoly. Iran has no major material dispute with Arab states, and yet they seem inclined to respond in kind to its nuclear ambitions. Sunni Arab states clearly indicate that they consider Iran more threatening than Israel. Consequently, reactive proliferation would end up posing Iran an additional threat to the one it invites from superior Israel.109 Explained theoretically, the logic of reactive proliferation is inimical to bandwagoning. Indeed, considering that Iran is non‐Arab, non‐Sunni (Shiite), and perceived to be revisionist, whereas most regional powers are Arab, Sunni, and status quo biased, the bandwagoning hypothesis is a priori implausible.               "
"54","We are left, then, with what Israel considers the most alarming proliferation threat: spillover of nuclear capabilities to terrorist organizations that ignore international norms and are not responsive to traditional state leverages. In first blush, such spillover seems tempting for Iran and therefore more likely. Upon further consideration, it looks less so. First, the spillover proposition is essentially a speculation that does not enjoy significant scholarly or empirical support.110 Second, whatever the prospects of spillover, they are logically related inversely to state strength.111 Hence, spillover prospects should be at a zenith when weak states are involved and in times of chaos and disintegration (as was the fear when the Soviet Union imploded). Iran experiences neither. Its institutional structure is relatively strong, and its organs do not seem out of control. By regional standards, Iran is reasonably well governed. Moreover, as the discussion of the rationality of the regime suggests and in contrast to its image as a “crazy state,”112 Iran did not prove to be particularly risk taking, as, for example, did North Korea, Libya, and Saddam's Iraq. It is not that Iran avoided rogue behavior but rather that its renegade actions were, as argued, of limited scope, at a low signature, mostly by proxies, and largely deniable. Thus, on the basis of logic and Iran's past avoidance of transferring any weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organizations, Byman suggests that “Teheran is not likely to pass chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons to terrorists.”113 Or, as Riedel suggests, Iran “will continue to support terrorism (once it possesses nuclear capabilities), but . . . is not likely to mortgage its future to terrorists.”114"
"55","In any event, Iran can be reminded that spillover would not be protected by deniability. The record suggests (at least in the United States case) that high‐casualty terrorist attacks are attributable115 and that offenders are not protected from retaliation by a demanding standard of incrimination. Indeed, Iran could be reminded that after 11 September 2001 hardly any standard of incrimination guided the American onslaught on Afghanistan. Moreover, Iran can be further told that if Israel were attacked by an “unattributed” nuclear weapon, the response would mirror the advice that Iran presumably received from Pakistani general Beg in 2006: “make it clear that if anything happens to Iran, if anyone attacks it—it doesn't matter who it is or how it is attacked . . . Iran's answer will be to hit Israel; the only target will be Israel.”116 Finally, Iran can also be informed that spillover is a two‐way street and reminded that it also faces nonstate actors that seem fanatic enough to use any available means (Free Life Party of Kurdistan, Mujahadeen e Khalq, and Jundallah) and that it already suspect cooperate with Israel.117"
"56","In summary, the prospects of regional proliferation are not negligible, specifically in terms of the NK&T diffusion, although less so in terms of reactive proliferation. The prospects of spillover to nonstate actors are the smallest. Nevertheless, three points need to be reiterated. First, reactive proliferation is neither preordained nor exceptionally likely. Second, the direct threats arising to Israel from such hypothetical proliferation are not obvious. By definition, any “reactive” proliferation would be directed against Iran, which would have to contend with it in addition to having to deal with Israel's nuclear superiority and a possible boarding of the United States extended deterrence target list. Third, the level of instability risks emanating from proliferation (caused by the organizational and human frailty that Sagan identified) is not that obvious. Considering that Israel is getting closer to deploying a multitier antiballistic missile system, both instability and the potential damage of limited use would be somewhat contained. The wildcard of a terrorist nuclear threat should neither be ignored nor overblown. Yet history reveals no precedent, and the sobering effect of the reciprocal nature of spillover, combined with assured retaliation, should chill hypothetical Iranian spillover inclinations."
"57","The stability/instability paradox suggests that following Iranian nuclearization, Israel might face a conventionally emboldened and more aggressive Iran. The emboldening argument may carry some weight, as indicated, for example, by a study of Saddam's pursuit of the nuclear option. In 1979, Saddam told his lieutenants that nuclear weapons would permit Iraq to conduct a long and bloody conventional war against Israel (by implication, outside the deterring effect of Israel's nuclear monopoly).118 Yet the Saddam anecdote refers to a vision and possible motivation, not practice. Moreover, the emboldening effect is inherently transient.            "
"58","It seems certain that Iran's leadership would feel less vulnerable once it possesses nuclear weapons.119 Yet nuclear immunity would mainly apply to territorial Iran. It would not protect Iranian or proxy forces deployed elsewhere. Iran may very well test the limits of nuclear immunity. However, because Iran would remain vulnerable to nuclear retaliation, sobriety should come rather early. The fact is that even mighty nuclear powers prove non‐immune in the conventional context. Indeed, conventionally armed protagonists have regularly ignored the nuclear capabilities of their enemies, and perhaps even more so when conflict was fought away from these enemies' territories. This was the case with Afghanistan (Soviet Union and United States), Argentina (United Kingdom), Chechnya (Russia), China (United States in Korea), Georgia (Russia), Egypt (Israel), and Vietnam (United States and China). Standing nuclear deterrence can defend mainly the limited national perimeter, whereas extended nuclear deterrence seems largely effective when the granting power is party to an entangling alliance that is based on deep interests. Logic thus suggests that if conventional Iranian and/or proxy forces attack Israel, the latter would be confident enough to retaliate with its superior conventional force and under the cover of its ultimate deterrence—that is, nuclear superiority. Moreover, because Iran's conventional capabilities are assessed as inferior even to those of Egypt,120 providing a radical change, the conventional threat it would pose Israel is highly likely to be limited, containable, and destructible.            "
"59","Sagan is correct to suggest that conventional emboldening could potentially bring about instability and an elevated risk of escalation. However, the two‐dimensional Israeli–Iranian asymmetry severely reduces the escalatory potential of emboldening. Even Barak, who regularly emphasized the Iranian threat, suggested in 2012 that “Israel . . . will continue to be in the foreseeable future the strongest, from Tripoli in Libya to Teheran—including these two places”121 and that if and when Israel would find it necessary to act against Hezbollah, it would not “necessarily . . . be deterred,” even if Iran “announce[s] that attacking Hezbollah is equivalent to attacking Iran.”122"
"60","The foregoing discussion, though, does not suggest that Israel's freedom of action in a proliferated region would remain intact. On the contrary, Israel's strategic calculations would become more complex and risk sensitive, and its behavior is thus expected to be more cautious. At the same time, Iran's strategic calculations and behavior would mirror those of Israel, as Iran would face the very same regional proliferation and risks of escalation, with the likely addition of implicit or explicit extended American deterrence. In the particular case of Israel–Iran asymmetry, Waltz's deductive logic of stability has merit. Both states are expected to calculate and act more cautiously: Israel because it is presently rather proactive and Iran because it would remain inferior."
"61","Last remains the “threat” of regime longevity. Undeniably, nuclear capability would provide the ayatollah regime deterrence against direct foreign military intervention. In fact, the regime may even exploit this immunity, for example, in a bid to destabilize the Persian Gulf so as to push up the price of oil—its main source of foreign revenues but also of vulnerability.123 Improved cash flow can directly affect regime‐legitimacy and therefore hypothetically also its longevity. Still, whereas a nuclear development program can be effectively used to divert public attention from regime failures at home, possessing nuclear weapons cannot in the long run protect regimes from their own people. At least Khamenei seems to have realized this. In 2012, he submitted to the Non‐Aligned Movement's Summit: “Nuclear weapons neither ensure security, nor do they consolidate political power . . . the events that took place in the 1990s showed that the possession of such weapons could not even safeguard a regime like the former Soviet Union.”124 Of course, as much can be learned from the fate of apartheid South Africa. Nuclear weapons deter foreign military intervention and perhaps can help buy regimes short‐term legitimacy at home, but in the longer run, they provide no protection against domestic challenges.            "
"62","The Israeli alarmist perception of the Iranian nuclear threat starts from the assertion that the ayatollah regime is irredeemably zealot, exceptionally offensive, and irrational. This perception is built against the background of the Holocaust, which evokes deep existential and abandonment fears. Within this mindset, alarmist Israeli leaders sense that their country is left to fend for itself against an ultimate threat."
"63","A review of the security discourse of the Israeli elite reveals a more complex set of threat perceptions. Besides an Iranian premeditated nuclear attack, Israeli alarmists are also concerned about regional proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology. They further fear a sharp decline of Israel's capacity to regulate its strategic environment with force. Lastly, they fear that Iran and its proxies would become conventionally adventurous and that the life of the ayatollah regime, the very source of all Iranian threats, would be extended."
"64","By conventional standards of assessment, fundamentalist Iran is understandably considered a threat to Israel. Once Iran acquires nuclear capabilities, the threat that it poses to Israel would almost by definition be perceived as intensifying. In fact, several components of the Israeli alarmist perception register support from theory and history. Moreover, considering all, it is sensible for Israeli leaders to prefer to err in their assessment toward severity rather than leniency."
"65","However, the issue for Israel is not whether nuclear capabilities elevate the level of the Iranian threat, but rather by how much and how best to deal with it. As far as the first level of threat is concerned, Israel's robust nuclear lead pretty much ensures that Iran would not pose to Israel a direct existential threat anytime soon. Perhaps not surprisingly, only the alarmists within the Israeli security elite argue that the Iranian regime would be irrational enough to strike Israel at the peril of assured terminal retaliation. Indeed, the evidence does not suggest that Iran's regime is a “death sanctifying culture” (Yadlin), that it is “apocalyptic‐messianic,” or that its “concepts and calculations” and rationality are “entirely different” (Yaalon) from those of Israel and other states. Moreover, because in the near to medium term, Israel would continue to enjoy an unquestionable nuclear superiority, and because nuclear Iran may very well invite American strategic targeting, it would not be “impossible to maintain in the Middle East deterrence founded on MAD [mutually assured destruction]” (Hanegbi). In fact, the strategic relations that nuclear Iran would face would resemble much more unilateral assured destruction then MAD, and only more so if and when the United States is factored into the nuclear equation. In short, the Iranian threat of the worst consequences is containable."
"66","Second‐level threats of proliferation are more likely, varied, but not inevitable. In terms of prospects, the two main threats are regional NK&T transfer and reactive proliferation. The odds of the former might be significant, but the Jinni has long been out of the bottle. Iran may prove an eager knowledge and technology provider but it has no monopoly in the domain. North Korea, Pakistan, and the illicit global market already provide whatever Iran could. Moreover, the threat of Iranian NK&T transfer, up to but not including weapon design, is not related to future progress toward weaponization. Iran has already met major nuclear milestones, including mastery of the critical fuel cycle, and can thus start NK&T proliferation at will."
"67","Reactive proliferation is possible but not preordained. Regional incentives to balance in kind against Iran largely depend on United States policy. More importantly, reactive proliferation would take time (excluding transfer of Pakistani weapons to Saudi Arabia) and pose a greater threat to Iran than to Israel. Undoubtedly, nuclear Middle Eastern proliferation would generate risks that Sagan aptly identified. Threats of miscalculated, accidental, or unauthorized use—at present nil—would increase, and only more so during acute crises. Yet, considering Israel's nuclear lead, such threats would be relatively contained and their potential damage limited, particularly once Israel deploys its planned multitier anti‐ballistic missiles defense system."
"68","Ostensibly, the threat of spillover to terrorist organizations would be high. In reality, however, this concern seems inflated. Such spillover is currently unprecedented and logic suggests that it would be more likely when the spilling entity is a weak state. Iran is not a weak state. It is less of an authority nightmare than Pakistan, and even the latter did not transfer nuclear weapons to anyone. More importantly, the assumption that deniability generates irresistible temptation to transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists is misconstrued. Potential spillover proliferators can and perhaps should be reminded that they would not be spared massive retaliation, and that spillover to rogue actors can easily be reciprocated."
"69","Remaining, then, are the third‐level consequential threats, which involve nonexistential matters, including conventional enemy emboldening, shrinking Israeli freedom of action, and longevity of the ayatollah regime. Generally, emboldening should be expected and consequent Iranian and/or proxy adventurism cannot be precluded. However, because Israel would continue to enjoy a convenient conventional and nuclear superiority, the effect of emboldening should be relatively short‐lived. Israeli calculations, on the other hand, would become more complex and its actions more cautious. But in a proliferated region, Iran's calculations will mirror those of Israel. Still, Israel might need to demonstrate resolve and use military power to redraw conflict rules. Eventually, though, conventional instability would settle down. It is perhaps indicative that North Korea retained some of its nasty habits after the first October 2006 nuclear test, but at least until early 2017 did not reach its previous rogue records (attempting in 1983 to kill the South Korean President in Rangoon and killing several of his ministers and downing in 1987, by planting a bomb, Korean Air flight 858). No particular attention needs to be devoted to regime longevity (should Iran get the bomb). The argument has neither logical foundations nor empirical support."
"70","One last point to consider is the fundamental nature of human interaction, including in the realm of international relations. Everything we know about Iran suggests that its leaders, just like their counterparts elsewhere, observe, listen, learn, and adapt. As indicated by Khomeini's decision to end the Iran‐Iraq War following consultation, by Ali Khamenei's comment on the limited value of nuclear weapons, and by Sayed Hossein Mousavian's discussion of the adverse effects of proliferation,125 the Iranian regime is neither uninformed nor narrow minded. Rather, Iran's leadership seems quite capable of following the intricacies of the nuclear world and the international debate over Iran's nuclear program. It may actually do so proactively. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that sooner rather than later, Iranian decision makers would be familiar with every key argument made about their nuclear program and its ramifications. Hence, the chances that Iran would over estimate the value of possessing nuclear capabilities or the costs and risks the latter generate, are small. A balanced threat assessment should consider the mitigating impact of such intersubjective process as well.         "
"71","In sum, Inbar's “inescapable conclusion that regional security is best served by denying Iran a nuclear bomb”126 is correct. However, international and national security are rarely about ideal conditions, zero threat, and no flux. Rather, they are all about measured assessments, achievable objectives, and management of risks and costs. In this sense, the multilevel threat that nuclear Iran might pose to Israel would require tight monitoring, but it would be of lesser severity than depicted by Israeli alarmists. Israel's robust nuclear lead, conventional superiority, in‐development multitier missile defense system, and association with the United States form in their totality an adequate answer. The Israeli alarmists do not believe so. The dark shadow of the past distorts the uncertain shadow of the future. Exaggerated Israeli pessimism concerning the nature of Iran's regime and its propensities and, most astonishingly, little faith in the strategic deterrent Israeli leaders have laboriously built to address existential threats, push toward excessive reaction. Such reaction is unnecessary. If Iran would possess nuclear capabilities, Israel would face an unpleasant but nevertheless manageable threat environment that does not call for extreme measures, defensive or offensive. Yet with an inflated Israeli threat assessment, overreaction cannot be precluded.*"
