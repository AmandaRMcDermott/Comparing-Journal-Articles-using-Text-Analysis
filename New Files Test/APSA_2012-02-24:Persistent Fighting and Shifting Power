"1","The baseline model formalizes in a very simple strategic setting the idea that persistent fighting may result from efforts to forestall state consolidation and the adverse shifts in the distribution of power that accompany it. The two key simplifying assumptions of the baseline model are (1) the faction controlling the state consolidates its position in a single period if there is no fighting during that period, and (2) fighting is sure to prevent consolidation. The general model relaxes both of these assumptions."
"2","Formally, consider a two‐player, infinite‐horizon stochastic game in which the faction in charge of the government, G, and a rival faction, R, vie for the spoils that come with control of the state. More specifically, G and R are trying to divide a flow of “pies” in a weakly institutionalized polity where the rule of law is absent or weak. The import of this institutional weakness is that the factions cannot commit to how future pies will be divided or, more accurately, whatever they agree to now can be renegotiated in the future in light of any changes in the distribution of power.2 The size of the “pie” to be divided in each period is one. The factions share a common discount factor , and each tries to maximize its sum of discounted spoils.         "
"3","At the start of any period t, G makes a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offer xt∈ [0, 1] which R can either accept or reject by fighting. If R accepts, R and G respectively get xt and 1 −xt during that round. If the state has already consolidated (i.e., if R accepted an earlier offer), R’s acceptance ends the round and the next begins with G’s offering xt+1. If the state has not yet consolidated when R accepts xt, the state consolidates, the distribution of power shifts in G’s favor, the round ends, and the next begins with a new offer from G.3"
"4","If R fights when offered xt, R and G get their respective flow payoffs of fR > 0 and fG > 0 for that period, and the round can end in one of three ways: a militarily decisive outcome in favor of R, a decisive outcome in favor of G, or a stalemate. A decisive outcome ends the game with the victor getting the entire flow of future benefits and the loser getting nothing. If the fighting ends in a stalemate, the round ends with the distribution of power unchanged. An unconsolidated state remains unconsolidated, and a consolidated state remains consolidated. We assume fighting is inefficient, so fR+fG < 1. The one‐period efficiency loss due to fighting is 1 −fR−fG.         "
"5","As will be seen below, it turns out to be useful to formalize the probabilities of the different ways that a round can end in terms of the decisiveness of the fighting and the chances that a faction will win if there is a decisive outcome. More specifically, let d be the probability of a decisive outcome, i.e., that the game ends if R fights, and, let p and 1 −p, respectively, be the conditional probabilities that R and G win given a decisive outcome. Take d′ and p′ to be the analogous probabilities when the state has consolidated.         "
"6","Stylizing fighting in terms of its decisiveness and the factions’ conditional probabilities of prevailing offers is of course formally equivalent to working with the unconditional probabilities that R and G prevail and the residual probability of a stalemate. However, this stylization offers two advantages. First, decisiveness provides a natural way of parameterizing or linking costly lottery models of civil and interstate war to more recent costly process models.4 In the former, the initial decision to fight is a game‐ending move which results in a lottery where the payoffs and the probability of winning are determined by the cost of fighting and the distribution of power. While such models may help us understand the causes of war, they clearly have little if anything to say about intrawar dynamics. Indeed, Wagner (2000) argues that they are likely to be misleading. By contrast, costly process models formalize war as a continuation game during which the players can continue to bargain and repeatedly have to decide whether to fight (e.g., Fearon 2004, 2007; Leventoğlu and Slantchev 2007; Powell 2004a; Yared 2010).         "
"7","When d= 1 in the present model, the decision to fight is a game‐ending move, and we have a costly lottery model. In fact, the baseline model in this case effectively reduces to what Fearon (1998) calls his “toy” model of ethnic conflict and state consolidation. When d < 1, the decision to fight in a given round may not end the game, and the bargaining may continue in subsequent rounds. When d is very small, neither side has much of a chance of eliminating the other. Fighting simply imposes costs, and the contest between G and R resembles a war of attrition.         "
"8","In terms of the present analysis, there is a second and more important advantage to working with decisiveness and conditional probabilities of victory. The total cost of fighting to the finish, i.e., until there is a militarily decisive outcome, turns out to play a crucial role in the equilibrium analysis. Moreover, this cost is directly related to d but independent of p. In particular, the more decisive the fighting is, the shorter the expected duration of a fight to the finish and lower its expected cost. In symbols, the expected loss of a fight to the finish is  which is clearly decreasing in d and independent of p.5 The conditional probabilities of prevailing determine how the spoils will be divided (in expectation) in the event of a militarily decisive outcome, but they have no effect on the efficiency losses that result from the fighting.         "
"9","The key to analyzing the game is the distribution of power defined by (d, p) and (d′, p′). These determine each faction’s payoff to fighting to the finish, which is the faction’s reservation value, i.e., a faction will never agree to a settlement that gives it less than what it could obtain by fighting to the finish. To ease the exposition, we also refer to changes in these payoffs as shifts in the distribution of power. Let FR and  denote R’s payoffs to fighting to the finish if the state is unconsolidated and consolidated. That is, FR is R’s payoff if it fights in every round until there is a militarily decisive outcome given that the fighting starts from the unconsolidated state where decisiveness and the probability that R wins are d and p. Similarly,  is R’s payoff to fighting until one faction or the other is eliminated given that the level of decisiveness and probability that R wins are d′ and p′.         "
"10","To determine these payoffs, observe that the baseline game has a simple recursive structure. If the factions fight in one round and neither is defeated, the distribution of power is unaffected, and the factions find themselves in exactly the same position at the start of the next round as they were in at the start of the round that ended in a stalemate. This implies that FR also satisfies a simple recursive relation:            "
"11","Similarly, R’s payoff to fighting to the finish once the state has consolidated is . G’s payoffs to fighting to the finish FG and  are defined analogously.         "
"12","Finally, state consolidation in the baseline game results in a once‐and‐for‐all exogenous shift in the distribution of power against R.6 That is, the amount that R can secure for itself by fighting to the finish decreases. Formally, assume . The larger , the larger the shift in power against R. Since this shift occurs over one period,  is also the rate or speed of the shift.         "
"13","The assumption  is equivalent to d′ (fR−p′) > d(fR−p). Observe further that ceteris paribus a lower probability of prevailing means a lower payoff to fighting to the finish (∂FR/∂p > 0). As for the effects of a change in decisiveness, we can think of fR−p as the per‐period difference between what R gets from fighting by, for example, drug trafficking or smuggling, and what R will get (in expectation) when the fighting stops. The larger fR−p, the more profitable war relative to peace. When these profits are positive (fR−p > 0), R’s payoff to fighting to the finish is larger the less decisive the fighting is. Hence, more decisive fighting reduces FR, i.e., ∂FR/∂d < 0 when fR−p > 0. When the profits from fighting are negative, R’s payoff to fighting to the finish increases as fighting becomes more decisive.         "
"14","This section does three things. First, it characterizes the Markov Perfect equilibria (MPE) of the baseline game and identifies conditions under which there is persistent fighting along the equilibrium path. In brief, the factions fight if the anticipated shift in the distribution of power is too large or, more precisely, if . The factions cut deals and avoid fighting when the distribution of power is stable or changing slowly, i.e., when . Second, the section highlights the role and importance of the assumption that fighting forestalls an adverse shift in the distribution of power. Finally, the analysis examines the relation between persistent fighting and the cost of fighting.         "
"15","The intuition underlying persistent fighting is straightforward. Since G makes all of the offers, it can either try to buy R off or it can choose to fight (by making an offer R is sure to reject). G in general prefers buying R off. To see why, observe that if G does try to buy R off, G will offer just enough to leave R indifferent between fighting or not. But if R is indifferent between fighting and accepting, then whatever surplus is saved (i.e., losses avoided) by not fighting must be going to G. Capturing this surplus makes buying R off preferable to fighting.         "
"16","In order to buy R off when the state has yet to consolidate, G’s offer must be large enough to compensate R for the smaller offers it will get once the state consolidates and the distribution of power shifts against it. G, however, can never offer more than one, i.e., all of the current period’s pie. If the shift in the distribution of power is too large, this will not be enough to buy R off, and the factions will fight. Fighting in turn prevents the distribution of power from shifting and, if there is a stalemate, leaves the factions in exactly the same situation in the next round. Hence, they fight again and again and again until there is a militarily decisive outcome.         "
"17","In effect, the inability of the factions to commit to how they will divide future benefits creates a kind of “liquidity constraint.” Since fighting is costly, there is always a division of the present and future flow of benefits that gives each faction more than what it expects to get by fighting at the start of the game. However, the liquidity constraint binds when the shift in power is large enough, and this renders all of these efficient divisions time inconsistent. At some point along every efficient division of the flow, at least one faction will do better by fighting given the distribution of power that exists at that time and the share of the future benefits it expects to get by abiding by the agreement.7"
"18","To solve the game, we reason backwards from the “end,” i.e., once the state has consolidated.8 If G decides to buy R off, it will do so at the cheapest possible price. To determine this price and the associated offer, note first that G’s offers in an MPE can only depend on whether or not the state has consolidated. G’s offers cannot depend, for example, on past play as they would in a tit‐for‐tat or grim‐trigger strategy. Suppose then that G offers x′ in the consolidated state. R’s payoff to getting x′ in every round for the rest of the game is . Since x′∈ [0, 1], we can think of x′V as R’s share of the value of the spoils V. Consequently, R prefers getting x′ forever to fighting if its share of the spoils is at least as large as its payoff to fighting, . Using  gives . Hence, buying R off at the cheapest possible price once the state has consolidated means offering , which is the offer that leaves R indifferent between fighting and accepting.9"
"19","The fact that fighting is costly ensures that G prefers buying R off to fighting. To see that this is the case, note that fighting brings . By contrast, buying R off yields  or, equivalently, , which is G’s payoff to fighting plus the surplus saved by not fighting. Hence, G prefers to buy R off if  which holds because fighting is costly.10"
"20","In sum, once the state consolidates and the distribution of power stabilizes, G buys R off by offering x′ in each period, and there will be no subsequent fighting. Lemma 1 states this formally.         "
"21","The continuation game starting from the consolidated state has a unique MPE.                                 G                                 offers               , andRaccepts allz≥x′and rejects anything less thanx′.11"
"22","We now use this result to determine what happens when the state has not yet consolidated. Let  denote the amount that leaves R just indifferent between accepting  and fighting to the finish when the state is unconsolidated. That is,  where the expression on the left is what R gets if G offers  in the current period, R accepts, the state consolidates, and G offers x′ in all subsequent periods. Observe further that we can rewrite  as . Thus,  is just enough larger than x′ to compensate R for the loss due to the adverse shift in the distribution of power R will suffer if it accepts . The assumption  ensures  since x′ > 0.12"
"23","Clearly, R will never agree to anything less than  in a subgame perfect equilibrium, as it could get a higher expected payoff by fighting to the finish. It is also true that R is sure to accept any offer at least as large as .13"
"24","Now consider G’s decision. As before, G’s payoff to buying R off is the surplus saved by not fighting plus G’s payoff to fighting. In symbols, G’s payoff to buying R off with  is  where . It follows that G prefers buying R off to fighting whenever fighting is costly.            "
"25","However, G may not always be able to buy R off. In particular, G cannot offer more than all of today’s pie (xt= 1). If this is too little to compensate R for the adverse shift in power, i.e., if , R will fight. What is more, fighting in the baseline game is sure to prevent consolidation. As a result, G and R will find themselves in the same situation in the next round, so they will fight in that round and in the round after that and so on.            "
"26","Note further that there is no serious bargaining during this fighting. The probability of G’s making an offer R accepts is zero. This is typical of bargaining failures due to commitment problems (e.g., Fearon 2004; Leventoğlu and Slantchev 2007) and contrasts with most asymmetric‐information accounts of why states fail to reach efficient agreements. In the latter, there is generally a positive probability that an offer will be accepted.14"
"27","Thus, large or rapid shifts in the distribution of power lead to fighting. The factions cut deals and avoid fighting when the distribution of power is stable or changing slowly. More formally,"
"28","If               , Rfights in the unconsolidated state in all MPE of the baseline game.15If, Goffersin the consolidated state, andRaccepts anyand rejects anything less.16"
"29","The condition  is sure to hold, and thus there is sure to be persistent fighting if state consolidation reduces R’s chances of prevailing (p > p′) and if the factions are sufficiently patient. To see that  holds when  is close to one, multiply by  and let  go to one to obtain .            "
"30","If                                 p > p′, thenandRfights in every round in every MPE ifis sufficiently large."
"31","Proposition 1 is the central result for the baseline game and, as will be seen, the underlying intuitions extend to a more general setting. But Proposition 1 also raises two issues. First, the key idea motivating the baseline model and the analysis more broadly is that fighting is more likely when it forestalls adverse shifts in the distribution of power. Roughly, not fighting is more costly if it could have forestalled an adverse shift in power, and the larger cost of not fighting makes fighting more likely."
"32","To show that this intuition holds, suppose that fighting does not forestall the adverse shift in the distribution of power. That is, the game starts out in the unconsolidated state and then consolidates in the second round whether or not R fights. (If R fights and one faction prevails, the game ends with the winner getting all of the subsequent spoils as in the game when fighting stops consolidation.) If the shift in power is sufficiently large, R still fights in the first round (but not in any subsequent round as Lemma 1 shows). However, the size of the shift needed to induce fighting is larger than the size of the shift needed when fighting forestalls the adverse shift. More specifically, the shift  needed to induce fighting must be larger than .            "
"33","If fighting does not impede a shift in the distribution of power, the shift needed to induce fighting is               .            "
"34","The second issue concerns the relative cost of fighting. Note that fighting becomes virtually costless if the factions are very patient. That is, the cost of fighting relative to the value of the flow of benefits goes to zero as  goes to one: . The reason the cost goes to zero is that the fighting is almost certain to end in t rounds if t is large since the probability that a fight to the finish lasts longer than t is (1 −d)t. But the cost of fighting for t rounds is negligible if the factions are very patient.            "
"35","That the cost of fighting becomes vanishingly small as  goes to one raises the possibility that R’s decision to fight in Corollary 1 derives from the fact that fighting is almost costless. To see that this is not the case, consider the limit of  as  goes to one and as d and d′ decrease so that R’s expected payoffs to a fight to the finish relative to the total benefits, FR/V and , remain constant. It follows that the difference )/V remains constant as  goes to one. That is, the time average of  remains constant as  goes to one. Hence, the unaveraged difference  must go to infinity, and this clearly ensures  for  large enough.17 The factions fight even though the relative cost of fighting remains constant.            "
"36","Let                                 d                                 and                                 d′               vary with               so that                                 FR/V               and               remain constant as               . ThenandRfights in every round in every MPE ifis sufficiently large."
"37","In sum, the baseline model exhibits persistent fighting. But it is a fight to the finish. There is never a negotiated settlement. The next section describes a more general model in which persistent fighting may end in a negotiated settlement."
"38","This section generalizes the baseline model in two ways. Complete consolidation now requires multiple periods without fighting rather than the single period assumed in the baseline model. Fighting in the general model also makes consolidation less likely but is not sure to prevent it. The section concludes with a discussion of the “fit” or applicability of the model to interstate conflict. The next section shows how variations in the pattern of shifting power can account for the three stylized facts about fighting."
"39","To specify the more general game, suppose that the distribution of power passes through N+ 1 stages during the consolidation process. Each stage is defined by the decisiveness of fighting and the conditional probability that R prevails, (dk, pk) , for k= 0, …, N.18 That is, the sequence of stages (d0, p0), … , (dN, pN) defines the pattern of shifting power associated with state consolidation. As in the baseline game, these stages determine the payoff to fighting to the finish, and we again refer to changes in these payoffs as shifts in the distribution of power.         "
"40","The game begins in stage 0 with G’s making a proposal which R can accept or reject by fighting. If R accepts, the next round begins in stage 1. If R fights, the game ends with probability d0. If the game continues, there is some chance that the state will consolidate even though R fought. More precisely, the game remains in stage 0 with probability  and transitions to stage 1 with probability .19"
"41","More generally, if R accepts an offer in stage k < N, the distribution of power shifts, and the game moves to stage k+ 1 with probability one. If R fights in k, the game ends with probability dk, moves to k+ 1 with probability , and remains in k with probability . Once play reaches N, the state is fully consolidated, and the distribution of power remains at (dN, pN).         "
"42","As in the baseline model, R’s payoff to fighting to the finish plays a critical role in characterizing the MPE. Let  denote R’s payoff in the continuation game starting from stage k given that R fights in every round. Since the distribution of power remains constant once play reaches N, the expression for  parallels that for  in the baseline game and is given by . The continuation value  for 0 ≤k < N satisfies the recursive relation . The expression on the right is the flow payoff from fighting in the current period, plus the discounted payoff to prevailing with probability dkpk, plus the discounted continuation payoff of remaining in stage k with probability , plus the discounted continuation value of being in stage k+ 1 with probability . Solving for  gives            "
"43","For both substantive and technical reasons, we assume the shift in power  is positive and not equal to one for all k. Formally,         "
"44","and               for all                                 k                  .            "
"45","The substantive significance of  is that it allows for the possibility that R can get stronger during phases of the consolidation process, albeit not too fast. That is,  can be a little larger than  and still satisfy . As shown below, this assumption also means that R is never so much stronger in stage k+ 1 that it would be willing to pay a tax to G in k in order to avoid fighting and move to k+ 1 where R is stronger. Technically, this assumption also ensures that G can always choose to fight by offering something less than  (e.g., x= 0 as discussed in fn. 3). Excluding the nongeneric situation in which  eliminates cases in which R might mix in equilibrium when offered  (see fn. 16).            "
"46","Before characterizing the equilibrium of the more general model, it is useful to discuss its “fit” or applicability to interstate conflict and well as to different types of civil war. The two key forces animating the analysis are that, first, the distribution of power shifts over time in the absence of fighting, and, second, fighting impedes this shift. Large shifts can create commitment problems which lead to inefficient fighting."
"47","This focus on shifting power and the resulting commitment problems is in keeping with existing work on civil war (e.g., Fearon 1998, 2004; Walter 1997, 2002). Indeed, the present model can be seen as a generalization of some of these other models. However, the model’s fit with some types of civil war is better than with others. Fearon and Laitin (2007) stress the importance of distinguishing between center‐seeking disputes, which constitute about 60% of the cases, and seccessionist or autonomy‐seeking contests. Rebels try to take over the central government in the former and try to gain control of a region in the latter. Insofar as the faction controlling the state controls all of the benefits in the present model, it corresponds most directly to center‐seeking conflicts.            "
"48","The model may also apply to some autonomy‐seeking disputes depending on which faction bears the cost of reneging on an agreement in this type of dispute. Because G controls the flow of benefits, G can renege at no direct cost on any agreement regarding the division of future benefits. G pays a cost only if R decides to fight. This would be the case if G’s concessions in an autonomy‐seeking dispute took the form of changes in policy which could be costlessly undone, e.g., permitting a region to use its own language or authorizing it to set its own tax rates. If, by contrast, G’s concessions take the form of allowing the region to set up or maintain its own militia or armed forces which could only be forcibly disarmed by G, e.g., the Peshmerga in Iraq, then G would bear the cost of reneging. This kind of agreement tends to make G’s promises more credible, eases the commitment problem, and is not well modeled by the present specification.20"
"49","Shifting power and the fact that fighting can impede or stop this shift also play a central role in some formal and nonformal work on the causes of interstate war. In power‐transition theory (e.g., Kugler and Lemke 1996; Organski and Kugler 1983), uneven rates of socioeconomic and political development lead to shifts in the distribution of power which a declining state may go to war to stop. In more formal work, Powell (2006) shows that large shifts in power may lead to fighting which stops the shift. In light of this, one might interpret the model by thinking of G as a weak but rising state that is trying to “buy time” until it consolidates its position by buying off its declining adversary R. Goldstein (2007), for example, argues that this is China’s grand strategy.21"
"50","The main result of this section is to link the pattern of fighting to the pattern of anticipated shifts in the distribution of power. The factions fight when these shifts are large; the factions negotiate agreements and avoid fighting when the distribution of power is either completely stable or slowly changing. These agreements subsequently break down in renewed fighting if the distribution of power begins to change rapidly again. We also show that in some circumstances, fighting now rather than later is the way to minimize the total costs of fighting."
"51","Describing the MPE is straightforward, and the intuition is largely the same as in the baseline game. As in that game, G never offers more than what is required to make R indifferent between fighting and accepting. As a result, R gets its payoff to fighting either because it actually does fight or because it accepts an offer equal to its certainty equivalent to fighting. This in turn implies that G, subject to a qualification, prefers to buy R off whenever it can in order to minimize the total cost of fighting and thereby maximize the surplus. G, however, will not be able to buy R off in stage k if the shift in power is too large, i.e., if .         "
"52","The qualification is that minimizing the total cost of fighting when the consolidation process takes multiple periods may mean fighting R today even though G can buy R off. As shown below, fighting today may minimize the total cost of fighting if fighting today is much more decisive than fighting tomorrow.         "
"53","To solve the game, we reason from the end. Lemma 1 holds in the general game as well as in the baseline game. That is, G buys R off with  and obtains the continuation payoff  in any MPE as soon as play reaches N.         "
"54","In light of this, it is useful to define  as G’s payoff to fighting to the finish of the consolidation process, i.e., from k until N at which point G buys R off. This leaves . For k < N, we can again exploit the recursive structure of the game tree to obtain an expression analogous to that for . That is, . Accordingly,  is the total cost of fighting from k until the state fully consolidates at N.         "
"55","To specify the factions’ equilibrium actions at k < N, suppose that we have an MPE, and let  and  denote R’s and G’s respective equilibrium payoffs conditional on being at k. That is, these are the factions’ payoffs starting from stage k and assuming that they play according to their equilibrium strategies.22"
"56","Now define  to be the amount that leaves R indifferent between fighting and accepting. That is,  satisfies . Subgame perfection implies that R strictly prefers accepting any  and strictly prefers fighting to any  .         "
"57","It follows that R’s continuation value at k is its payoff to fighting to the finish, i.e., . The key intuition behind this carries over from the baseline game. Since G makes all of the offers, it will either buy R off at the cheapest possible price by offering  or G will fight (by proposing something R is sure to reject). Either way, R gets its payoff to fighting, and, as a result, its equilibrium continuation value equals its payoff to fighting ().         "
"58","To see that  somewhat more formally, observe that if in equilibrium R obtains its payoff to fighting at k, then  or            "
"59","The recursive relation between  and  defined by equation (3) is identical to the recursive relation between  and  defined by equation (2). Lemma 1 also ensures that these relations start from the same initial condition. That is, R’s equilibrium continuation payoff once the state has fully consolidated is its payoff to fighting to the finish from stage N. Hence,  and recursively  for all k. An immediate consequence of this is that .         "
"60","To characterize G’s decision at stage k, assume that G can buy R off if it wants to. That is, .23 Since R’s continuation value equals its payoff to fighting (), the surplus saved by not fighting must go to G as it did in the baseline game. As a result, G will act at k in the way that minimizes the total cost of fighting and thereby maximizes the surplus which G pockets.         "
"61","To make this argument more precise, let  be G’s payoff to fighting in k and then playing according to the MPE from k+ 1 on. That is, . G’s payoff to buying R off in k and then playing according to the MPE from k+ 1 on is . Hence, G prefers to fight rather than buy R off in k when  and prefers buying R off when this inequality is reversed.         "
"62","To see that this is equivalent to G’s acting in the way that minimizes the total cost of fighting, substitute  and  in the previous inequality to obtain . Using the fact that  and rearranging terms now shows that G prefers to fight R when . The expression on the right is the total surplus V less the actors’ continuation values if they fight in k and then play according to the MPE for the rest of the game. This, in other words, is the amount destroyed by fighting given that G fights at k and then follows its MPE strategy from k+ 1 on. As for the expression on the left, none of the surplus is destroyed in k if G buys R off in that stage. Consequently, the expression on the left is the total surplus destroyed by fighting given that G buys R off in k and then follows its MPE strategy from k+ 1 on. Thus, G fights in k when doing so minimizes the total surplus destroyed by fighting and buys R off when that minimizes the total loss.         "
"63","A sufficient but not necessary condition ensuring that buying R off minimizes the cost of fighting is that the losses due to fighting from k until the state is fully consolidated at N are at least as large as they are from fighting from k+ 1 to N. In symbols, G prefers to buy R off if .24 This leaves:         "

"65","An immediate implication of Proposition 2 is that if the cost of fighting until the state is fully consolidated weakly decreases as the state moves closer to being fully consolidated (i.e., if  is weakly decreasing in k), then G always strictly prefers to buy R off.            "
"66","If               is weakly decreasing in                                 k                  , thenGoffersandRaccepts whenever.            "
"67","In the baseline game, the state consolidates in a single period, and there is no fighting once the state has consolidated. As a result, G’s buying R off whenever possible in the unconsolidated state necessarily minimizes the total losses associated with fighting. In keeping with this, G always prefers to buy R off whenever it can in the baseline game.            "
"68","Matters are more subtle when consolidation takes multiple periods and the decisiveness of fighting can vary. Minimizing the total cost of fighting in the more general game may mean fighting in the current stage. Suppose, for example, that G can buy R off in k and that fighting is very decisive in that stage (dk≈ 1 ). Assume further that G will not be able to buy R off in k+ 1 because  and that fighting is quite indecisive there (dk+1≪ 1). In these circumstances, fighting at k minimizes the total cost of fighting. Because fighting is very decisive in k, the game is very likely to end if G fights and, consequently, the expected loss to fighting will be close to the cost of fighting for a single period. If by contrast G buys R off in k, play moves on to k+ 1 where G is unable to buy R off. Fighting, moreover, is now unlikely to be decisive. As a result, the expected losses will be larger than the cost of fighting for a single period. Thus, minimizing the total losses due to fighting may mean fighting in the current stage if fighting becomes significantly less decisive in future stages.G’s incentive to fight rather than settle seems to result from the possibility that fighting will become much less decisive in the future. Corollary 5 shows that this is the case. G prefers to buy R off whenever it can as long as dk+1 is not too much less than dk. This follows from Corollary 4 and the fact that  is weakly decreasing as long as   for all k and a small enough . Thus, G prefers to buy R off when the level of decisiveness is increasing, constant, or slowly decreasing (i.e., as long as ).            "
"69","There exists an               such that               is weakly decreasing as long as               for all                                 k≤N− 1.            "
"70","Finally, note that the prospect of future fighting makes fighting today more likely. That is, the more fighting there is in the future, the larger the future losses and the less decisive fighting today has to be in order to induce G to fight today. To establish this, use  and equation (2) to rewrite the condition ensuring that G fights as . The expression on the right is decreasing in G’s future payoff  and increasing in the level of decisiveness dk. Thus, the lower G’s future payoff, the lower the level of decisiveness needed for the inequality to hold and for G to prefer to fight. Further, the more often the factions fight as play moves from k+ 1 to N, the smaller . If, for example, there is no fighting from k+ 1 on then . If there is continual fighting, . The more likely the factions are to fight in the future, the more likely they are to fight today.            "
"71","These results complement and extend existing work.Powell (2004b, 2006) shows that large shifts in the distribution of power or, more precisely, in the continuation payoffs can induce inefficient behavior.26 However, he does not consider the sources of persistent inefficient behavior. Fearon’s (2004) analysis of long civil wars is closest to the present analysis. In his model, a government and rebel group are bargaining over regional autonomy for the latter. With minor modification, the model can also be seen as a center‐seeking conflict in which the government and a group of potential putchists are bargaining about the division of benefits. In both versions, G and R are formally bargaining over dividing a flow of benefits as in the present model. Large, exogenous shocks to the distribution of power lead to fighting, and there are periods of persistent recurrent fighting along the equilibrium path. Fighting persists in his model because it prevents an adverse shift in the rebels’ power.27 Moreover, fighting, once it begins, never ends in a negotiated settlement. Either the rebels win and the game ends, or the government prevails and play in effect restarts, i.e., the players enter a subgame which is identical to the game itself.            "
"72","Summarizing the present analysis, G always wants to buy R off  if fighting becomes weakly more decisive during the consolidation process. Nevertheless, the factions fight when the underlying distribution of power defined by (dk, pk) shifts rapidly against R. As in the baseline game, there is no serious bargaining during these periods. The factions agree on a division of the current period’s spoils and avoid fighting when the distribution of power stabilizes or shifts more slowly. Note further that Proposition 2 allows for the possibility that R’s power might increase, albeit not too rapidly, during some phases of the consolidation process.            "
"73","Proposition 2 links the observed pattern of fighting to the way that the distribution of power shifts during the consolidation process. It provides a theoretical account which may at least partly explain the observed patterns of conflict across different empirical cases. This section develops this account further by showing that very simple patterns of shifting power can account for the three important stylized patterns of conflict described above, i.e., peaceful consolidation, persistent fighting ending in both negotiated or tacit settlements as well as militarily decisive outcomes, and persistent recurrent fighting. Determining whether shifting power and the mechanism identified here actually does provide empirical leverage on explaining these patterns is an important and challenging task for future empirical work."
"74","A useful and simplifying first step is to observe that we can approximate  by  if we are willing to assume  is sufficiently small. ( when .) Working with  is much easier than working with the recursively defined .28"
"75","Peaceful consolidation. The first pattern of fighting is really the absence of fighting. Why or under what circumstances would a faction—whether it be an insurgent group or a warlord—ever willingly give up its arms or power? Under what circumstances might a state consolidate without having to fight and defeat an opposing faction? Proposition 2 suggests that this occurs when the shift in the distribution of power against R is sufficiently slow and consequently the fighting constraint never binds.         "
"76","Suppose in particular that the distribution of power continually shifts against R throughout the consolidation process but at a declining rate. Formally, R’s power  is decreasing and convex. It follows that if the initial rate of decline is small enough that G can buy R off (i.e., if ), then G will be able to buy R off in all subsequent periods and the state will consolidate without fighting.         "
"77","Figure 1 illustrates this case. To keep things simple, fighting in Figure 1 becomes more decisive by  in each period as the state consolidates and the probability that R prevails remains constant. In symbols,  and pk=p < fR for 0 ≤k≤N.29 The top panel shows the payoff to fighting to the finish from k. The lower panel graphs the shift in power . Since this shift is always less than one, G can buy R off at every stage and the state consolidates without fighting.         "
"78","                Consolidation without Fighting"
"79","Persistent Fighting and Negotiated Settlement. As observed above, an important empirical feature of both interstate and civil wars is that they often do not end in militarily decisive outcomes. In light of this, Leventoğlu and Slantchev emphasize the need for “complete and coherent theories” (2007, 757), i.e., accounts which explain both why fighting starts and, if it does, why it ever stops short of a decisive military outcome. How, in particular, does fighting solve the problem that gave rise to it? In the context of informational accounts of war (Fearon 1995), fighting starts because of asymmetric information about, say, resolve or the distribution of power, and it ends because the process of fighting reveals information that narrows the asymmetry (e.g., Powell 2004; Slantchev 2003). But it is less clear, Leventoğlu and Slantchev point out, how fighting arising from a commitment problem solves that problem.         "
"80","Proposition 2 suggests the factions reach negotiated settlements and stop fighting when the rate of change of the distribution of power slows sufficiently. Building on the example above, suppose again that the distribution of power continually shifts against R throughout the consolidation process at a declining rate. However, the initial rate of decline is faster than in the previous example. In particular, R’s power approximated by  in the top panel of Figure 2 is decreasing and convex but now with  for k≤ 4. The factions fight as long as play remains in one of these stages. If, despite this fighting, G manages to consolidate and play moves to k > 4, the fighting stops and the factions cut deals.30"
"81","                Persistent Fighting"
"82","Recurrent Fighting. Negotiated settlements to stop fighting frequently break down in renewed fighting. Proposition 2 points to a possible explanation in terms of variations in the rate at which the distribution of power shifts. Most simply, suppose that the distribution of power shifts rapidly against R, stabilizes, and then begins another period of rapid change before finally stabilizing. This induces an initial period of fighting followed by a period during which the factions agree on a division and there is no fighting. However, this phase ultimately breaks down in further fighting when the distribution of power begins to change rapidly. Figure 3 provides an example.31"
"83","                Persistent, Recurrent Fighting"
"84","In brief, relatively simple patterns of change in the distribution of power (dk, pk) can induce important and frequently observed patterns of fighting.         "
"85","An adverse shift in the distribution of power often poses a trade‐off to the declining state or political faction. It can accept its decline and the weaker bargaining position and lower future payoff that comes with the decline. Or, the state or faction can fight in order to arrest or impede the adverse shift. The model of state consolidation developed here formalizes this trade‐off."
"86","The analysis makes four main contributions. First, the analysis links the pattern of equilibrium fighting to the pattern of anticipated changes in the distribution of power. Large, rapid shifts in the distribution of power lead to fighting. The factions cut deals and avoid fighting when the distribution of power is stable or shifting slowly. Second, even though one faction benefits from minimizing the total costs of fighting, doing this sometimes means fighting rather than cutting a deal. Third, future fighting makes fighting today more likely."
"87","Finally, the link between the pattern of fighting and the pattern of shifting power provides a possible mechanism explaining three stylized facts about fighting. Indeed, relatively simple patterns of shifting power can account for these features."
"88","The appendix provides proofs for the propositions and major corollaries. We begin by formalizing the factions’ strategies. A strategy for G in the baseline game as well as in the more general model specifies its offer in each period as a function of the history preceding that period and the current stage. R’s strategy specifies the offers it will accept and reject in each period as a function of the current stage and the history leading up to that stage. (Recall that we refer to states of the stochastic game as stages.) Formally, let k∈{0, …N} denote the stage of the game where the decisiveness and probability that R prevails in stage k is (dk, pk). The stage of the game at time t is . Also let  be one if R fights in round t and zero if R accepts G’s offer at time t. It follows that a history leading up to round t is given by  with . Take Ht−1 to be the set of all feasible histories ht−1. Then a pure strategy for G is an infinite sequence of offer functions  such that  for  and xt :Ht−1 for . R’s strategy is an infinite sequence of acceptance functions  such that  is the probability R accepts z∈ [0, 1] given any stage  and any history ht−1∈Ht−1. In Markov strategies, actions depend on the current stage  but not on the history leading up to that stage.         "
"89","Let  be an MPE of the game starting from stage N (where N= 1 in the baseline game). Let  denote R’s continuation payoff, and let  be the amount that leaves R indifferent between accepting and fighting. That is,  satisfies  or, more simply, . This leaves .

"92","Observe further that . This follows from rewriting the previous expression as . Since R can always obtain FR by fighting to the finish in the unconsolidated stage, VR≥FR and, by assumption, . Hence, . There are now three cases to consider.            "
"93","Case 1: . Since  for all , G will never offer any  with positive probability as G could profitably deviate to the lower offer .            "
"94","Nor will G ever provoke a war by offering something less than  with positive probability. This follows from two observations. First, G’s payoff to agreeing to  is strictly greater than its payoff to fighting: . To establish this, substitute for  and rewrite the previous inequality to obtain  which holds because fighting is inefficient. Observe second that G can obtain a payoff arbitrarily close to  by offering a z larger than but arbitrarily close to . These two observations imply that if G provoked a war with positive probability in equilibrium, then G could profitably deviate to some .            "
"95","Hence, G offers  in equilibrium. The assumption that  now implies that R must accept  for sure (). Otherwise G could profitably deviate to a .R’s indifference between accepting and rejecting  also implies that its value in the unconsolidated stage satisfies  which leaves VR=FR and .            "
"96","Case 2: . Trivially, R’s payoff to accepting any z∈ [0, 1] is less than its payoff to fighting. Hence, R fights as claimed in the proposition.

"97","Case 3: . R is indifferent between accepting an offer of  and rejects anything less. Hence, its continuation value in the unconsolidated stage satisfies . This again gives VR=FR and  then means . "

The expression on the left is the size of the shift in  needed to induce fighting, and this threshold is clearly greater than one. "
"99","Let  denote an MPE and take  to be j’s continuation value in this equilibrium starting in stage k. Lemma 1 ensures that  and  whenever z≥xN and  otherwise.            "
"100","Now define  to be the amount that renders R indifferent between accepting and fighting in k, i.e.,  solves  for k < N. Subgame perfection implies  when  and  when .            "
"101","To show that R fights whenever , it suffices to establish that  for all k and hence that . Arguing by induction, Lemma 1 establishes  for k=N. To show that  given , suppose that .

"102","Now suppose . G will never offer any  in equilibrium as it could profitably deviate to the lower offer (y+ which R would accept.

"103","Finally, assume . R either fights if G offers less than  or possibly agrees to its certainly equivalent of fighting if G proposes . Either way, R’s continuation payoff  is its payoff to fighting. Repeating the argument in the previous paragraph gives . But  by assumption, so this case is moot.            "
"104","Now assume that  and . To demonstrate that G buys R off, we show first that G never offers any . This along with the fact that G never offers any  implies G offers . We then show that R is sure to accept this offer.            "
"105","Arguing by contradiction, suppose G does offer a  with positive probability. Then G could profitably deviate to something slightly above . To establish this, note that since R fights when offered , G’s equilibrium continuation payoff conditional on proposing y in stage k is . Because G offers y with positive probability in k, its payoff to proposing k must be equal to anything else it proposes with positive probability in k. Consequently, G’s equilibrium continuation value conditional on y is simply its unconditional equilibrium continuation value at k. That is, , so .            "
"106","Now observe that since , G can obtain a payoff arbitrarily close to  by offering  for an arbitrarily small  and then reverting to its equilibrium strategy from stage k+ 1 on. It follows that G can profitably deviate from y and therefore that we have a contradiction if .            "

"108","Note that the expression on the right is increasing in . Observe further that  since G can always obtain the latter by offering xj= 0 (which R by construction is sure to reject) in stages j=k+ 1, …, N− 1 and then buying R off in N with . Hence, A1 is sure to hold if               "
"109","To see that this relation does hold, use  to rewrite the previous inequality as . Recalling that  and  leaves . This in turn is certain to hold since  by assumption.            "
