"1","It is common wisdom that “[p]oliticians are notoriously reluctant to take clear stands on the issues of the day” (Page 1976, p. 742). Indeed, during the 2012 American presidential election, media outlets routinely criticized the ambiguity of both Barack Obama's and Mitt Romney's campaign promises (“Conservatives Worry” 2012; “Obama Goes Vague” 2012). Even more recently, in the 2015 British general election, the nonpartisan Institute for Fiscal Studies described parties' manifestos as follows: “Where benefit cuts are proposed, they are largely unspecified (Conservatives), vague (Liberal Democrats) or trivially small relative to the rhetoric being used (Labour)” (Insitute for Fiscal Studies 2015).         "
"2","While many scholars take a dim view of electoral ambiguity, we argue in this article that ambiguity is central to beneficial political representation. Our approach builds on the Downsian framework, with one key twist. We posit that some information relevant to policy‐making is revealed to the elected politician only after the election. We allow candidates, who are both office and policy motivated, to campaign by announcing a policy set. In other words, each candidate commits to a set of policies from which he will choose if elected. A candidate can propose a single policy (e.g., a precise figure for benefit cuts), commit to avoiding extreme policies (e.g., a bound on benefit cuts), or announce more complicated sets (e.g., either a significant benefit cut or none at all).         "
"3","Electoral ambiguity—that is, not committing to a single policy—affords politicians discretion to adapt policies to new information.1 While ambiguity creates uncertainty about which policy will be implemented, it can benefit voters if policies are better tailored to circumstances. However, whenever politicians do not share voters' policy preferences, voters also benefit from constraints on discretion that mitigate post‐electoral policy bias.2 Our framework thus contributes to the classic question, dating back to James Madison and Edmund Burke, of whether political representation should be by delegates or trustees. In our account, voters seek a mixture of the delegate (no discretion) and trustee (full discretion) models of political representation.         "
"4","Actual political representation, however, is determined by politicians' strategic platform choices. Candidates would like maximum discretion, but they must propose platforms that are attractive enough to the electorate—specifically, the representative or median voter (henceforth “the voter”)—relative to their opponent's. We show that candidates' equilibrium platforms take a simple form: They retain some discretion but limit how far they can move policies in the direction of their bias. Actual representation thus resembles optimal representation. There is, however, a critical difference. The winning candidate is overly ambiguous from the voter's point of view unless candidates' policy preferences are symmetrically biased relative to the electorate. When candidates are asymmetric, the less‐biased candidate wins the election while exploiting his greater policy alignment to grant himself more discretion than is optimal for the voter. So, while electoral competition disciplines the winning candidate, it is not generally sufficient to ensure voter‐optimal outcomes.         "
"5","As predicted by our theory, one often observes candidates reassuring voters that their policies would not be too extreme without spelling out exactly what they will do if elected. Examples include the U.K. Conservative Party promising in 2015 to increase funding for the Department of Health by at least £8 billion (“Conservative Party Pledges” 2015); Mitt Romney pledging in 2012 that his reform of Social Security would entail “no change for those at or near retirement” (“Social Security” 2012); and Barack Obama guaranteeing in 2008 that “no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase” (Obama 2008).         "
"6","Furthermore, consistent with empirical evidence (Berensky and Lewis 2007; Tomz and Van Houweling 2009), we find that ambiguity is not punished by the electorate; to the contrary, the winning candidate is generally more ambiguous than his opponent. It bears emphasis that a candidate does not win because he is more ambiguous than his opponent; rather, he is both more ambiguous and more likely to win because he already possesses an electoral advantage of greater preference alignment. The electoral success of ambiguous candidates has long puzzled political scientists; Downs (1957, p. 136) himself noted that “candidates [in the real world] becloud their policies in a fog of ambiguity” despite the fact that ambiguity does not arise in standard specifications of his framework. Some theoretical explanations rely on voters' risk preferences (Aragones and Postlewaite 2002; Shepsle 1972; Zeckhauser 1969) or “behavioral” characteristics (Berliant and Konishi 2005; Callander and Wilson 2008; Jensen 2009). Our results, which are obtained with risk‐averse voters, harken back to the dictum that correlation does not imply causation.         "
"7","Our model also generates policy divergence: The two candidates propose different platforms and induce different expected final policies, tilted toward their own policy preferences. Divergence occurs even when candidates are symmetrically biased and propose platforms that are optimal for the voter. In this case, the voter is indifferent between the two candidates and the election can then be viewed as close. Consistent with the empirical results of Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004), we find that divergence emerges even in close elections. Notably, in our model, the electorate is not merely electing policies; it is genuinely affecting them.         "
"8","There is a nonmonotonic relationship between policy divergence and political polarization (the difference in candidates' preferences). Fixing platforms, greater political polarization leads to greater policy divergence. But platforms also respond to political polarization. As a candidate's policy preferences move further away from the voter's, electoral pressures induce him to propose less ambiguous platforms: To appeal to the voter, he offers himself less discretion. We find that, on balance, policy divergence is increasing in political polarization when polarization is low and decreasing when polarization is high. Indeed, when candidates' policy preferences are very similar to the voter's, they obviously choose approximately the same policy and policy divergence disappears. In contrast, as political polarization gets sufficiently large, policy divergence vanishes because candidates' platforms converge to the voter's ex ante preferred policy. One implication is that a given empirical observation of policy divergence could be consistent with multiple levels of underlying political polarization, complicating identification of the level of political polarization."
"9","We conclude this introduction by connecting our work to the most closely related literature. Meirowitz (2005) argues that both candidates and voters from their own party may desire ambiguity—modeled as not announcing a position—in a primary election; this preserves a candidate's flexibility to adjust his position in the subsequent general election to new information about the location of the whole electorate's median voter.3 While there are some formal similarities, our substantive focus on political representation is entirely different and our modeling of electoral ambiguity is richer. By using policy sets to capture candidates' ambiguity, we follow Aragones and Neeman (2000). In their model, candidates value ambiguity while voters do not; see also Alesina and Cukierman (1990), Westermark (2004), and Frenkel (2014). In our model, all actors benefit from some electoral ambiguity because of a desire to tailor policy to an initially uncertain “state of the world.” How much ambiguity is desired by the electorate depends on parameters such as candidates' preference alignment and uncertainty about the state.         "
"10","Our work is related to the literature on delegation by a principal to a better‐informed agent, pioneered in economics by Holmström (1977, 1984) and adopted for the study of the bureaucracy by Epstein and O'Halloran (1994) and others. Notable references include Melumad and Shibano (1991), Amador, Werning, and Angeletos (2006), and Amador and Bagwell (2013) in economics and Bendor and Meirowitz (2004), Gailmard (2009), and Wiseman (2009) in political science. We specifically build on technical results of Alonso and Matouschek (2008), who derive conditions for the optimality of interval delegation. In contrast to the aforementioned papers, our framework has candidates (multiple agents) strategically proposing platforms (delegation sets) to the voter (principal). We are not aware of any extant literature on such “delegation games.” We establish conditions under which interval policy sets emerge even in our more complex strategic environment, and we use this result to derive new insights about electoral competition and political representation.         "
"11","There is virtually no formal work addressing the delegate–trustee trade‐off in political representation.4 To our knowledge, the only exception is Fox and Shotts (2009), who show how either form of representation may emerge when voters are uncertain about politicians' preferences and competence. Unlike our interest in electoral competition, theirs is in a model of political accountability. Fox and Shotts (2009) also do not consider any intermediate cases between a full delegate and a full trustee relationship. Our theory shows that optimal political representation genuinely spans the entire spectrum between the two models.         "
"12","The rest of the article is organized as follows. The next section introduces our formal model. The subsequent section characterizes optimal platforms from the voter's perspective. We then present our main results, which identify the equilibrium platforms emerging from electoral competition and their implications. In the following section, we discuss how some alternative modeling choices would affect our results. The final section concludes. Formal proofs of all results and some additional technical material are collected in the online supporting information."
"13","We develop a model in the tradition of Downs (1957). There are two political candidates, L (left) and R (right), and a single representative voter, denoted 0.5 The game form is as follows:            "
"14","We assume that candidates have commitment power: The final policy must be consistent with the candidate's platform. Crucially, the impact of any policy depends on a state of the world that is privately revealed to the elected politician only after the election but before his policy choice.6 The state represents changing circumstances or new information that becomes available to a politician at the time of actual policymaking. As David Cameron stated to justify his child benefit cuts in an ITV interview in 2010, “We did not outline all those cuts, we did not know exactly the situation we were going to inherit” (“David Cameron ‘Sorry’” 2010).         "
"15","We allow candidates to choose platforms that are sets of policies. This approach generalizes the standard model, as candidates can always propose a single policy (e.g., a precise figure for benefit cuts). In practice, of course, candidates are not constrained to be specific during their electoral campaigns, and they rarely choose to be. Notice that we have precluded candidates from committing to policies as a function of the state. This is justified because the state is privately observed by the officeholder; the voter only observes the chosen policy. State‐contingent promises during the election would generally not be credible. See the subsection “Alternative Assumptions about Commitment” for further discussion.         "
"16","Each player  has policy preferences in state θ that are single‐peaked around a bliss point . Specifically, player i's policy utility is represented by the quadratic‐loss utility function , where a is the policy.7 We normalize b0 to 0, and to capture candidates on opposite sides of the voter, we assume . For ,  measures the magnitude of preference (mis)alignment of candidate i with the voter. We refer to a candidate with  as unbiased, a candidate with  as biased, and a candidate with  as extreme. As the state lies in [ − 1, 1], an extreme candidate's bliss point is either always positive or always negative no matter the state.               "
"17","Let  denote the winner of the election. The voter only cares about policy, so her overall utility function is simply                  "
"18","The state  is distributed according to a cumulative distribution function (CDF) F that admits a differentiable density f. We assume f is positive and symmetric (i.e., ), and that it does not change too fast:                  "
"19","We further impose that conditional expectations from tail truncations do not increase too fast:                  "
"20","Finally, we require that each candidate i's platform choice  must be a closed set to ensure the officeholder's problem of choosing which policy to implement is well behaved.               "
"21","All aspects of the model except the realization of the state θ are common knowledge, and players are expected‐utility maximizers. Our solution concept is subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, hereafter simply “equilibrium.” (Standard refinements would not alter our results.) Notice that because θ is observed only after the election, the officeholder's policymaking stage and the stage at which the voter chooses whom to elect both constitute proper subgames. Thus, an equilibrium satisfies the following properties: (a) if candidate i is elected with platform , in each state θ he chooses  to maximize ;8 (b) taking (a) as given, for any  and , the voter elects the candidate who gives her the highest expected utility; (c) taking (a) and (b) as given, each candidate i proposes a platform  that maximizes his expected utility.9"
"22","We say that a platform  is minimal if it contains no redundant policy: Every  will be chosen in some state if i is elected. To simplify the exposition and without any real loss of generality, we restrict attention to equilibria in which candidates use minimal platforms.10 We say that (platform) convergence occurs if both candidates propose the same platform: . This is a weak notion of convergence because it does not imply that both candidates implement the same policy if elected. Indeed, final policies coincide in all states only if either the candidates converge to a singleton platform ( for some ) or they share the same policy preferences (). When  is not a singleton, we say that candidate i's platform is ambiguous. In other words, we view a candidate as ambiguous when the voter is uncertain about what policy will be implemented after the election, as argued by Page (1976). This perspective on ambiguity is shared by many others in the literature, including Downs (1957), Shepsle (1972), Aragones and Neeman (2000), and Aragones and Postlewaite (2002).               "
"23","Finally, we view an equilibrium outcome as its (distribution over the) winning candidate and its (possibly stochastic) mapping from states to final policies. In particular, two outcome‐equivalent equilibria provide the same expected payoff to all players.               "
"24","To wrap up this section, we would like to highlight that absent the unknown state of the world, our model satisfies all the assumptions of the Downsian framework (with policy‐motivated candidates): two candidates, unidimensional policy space, strictly concave utility functions, no uncertainty about voters’ and candidates' preferences, and commitment by candidates to their platforms. Consequently, convergence would emerge if there were no uncertainty about the state of the world or, as shown in the subsection “Alternative Assumptions about Commitment,” if platforms were constrained to single policies. With uncertainty about the state and ambiguity, however, candidates with different preferences will not always choose the same policy even if elected with the same platform. This feature generally precludes candidates from perfectly mimicking each other, unlike in most models of electoral competition."
"25","We first characterize candidates' optimal platforms from the voter's perspective. In other words, we identify what platform the voter would like to endow each candidate  with if i is going to be the officeholder. We call such a platform candidate i's voter‐optimal platform. A singleton policy platform is not necessarily voter‐optimal because the voter would like the policy to be adapted ex post to the state of the world. On the other hand, giving full discretion need not be optimal either because of the candidate's policy bias.         "
"26","Proposition 1 below describes how the voter resolves this trade‐off between policy adaptability and policy bias. Recall that  denotes candidate i's ideal policy in state θ. It is convenient to define  and  as the solutions to            "
"27","To interpret Equation 5, consider placing a ceiling  on candidate R's policy choice. R will then choose  whenever the state is larger than . The voter's preferred policy given  is simply . Thus, the first equality in Equation 5 requires that, on average, the voter receives her preferred policy when the policy ceiling on R binds.            "
"28","Proposition 1.Candidate R's voter‐optimal platform is                  "
"29","Proposition 1 says a candidate's voter‐optimal platform is a (possibly degenerate) interval. Technically, the problem of finding a voter‐optimal platform is the same as that of a principal optimally deciding how much discretion to grant an informed agent with biased preferences. We do not require the voter to grant the politician an interval of policies to choose from. Indeed, in general, such interval delegation sets need not be optimal.11 However, as the proof of Proposition 1 establishes, our assumptions on the state distribution—in particular, Requirements 3 and 4—satisfy Alonso and Matouschek's (2008) more general conditions guaranteeing optimality of interval delegation sets for any bias.         "
"30","The optimal intervals in Proposition 1 resolve the fundamental trade‐off the voter faces between policy adaptability and the resulting policy bias (or, as it is sometimes referred to, policy drift). Plainly, when a politician is unbiased (), it is voter‐optimal to impose no constraints, as there is no trade‐off. When a politician is extreme (), the cost from policy bias is large relative to the gain from policy adaptability, and so the voter‐optimal platform is a singleton: her ex ante preferred policy, . When a politician is biased but moderate (), it is optimal for the voter to endow him with some but not full discretion.         "
"31","Candidate R's preferred policy is above the voter's preferred policy in any state. There is thus no benefit to the voter of imposing a minimum policy on R. However, she may want to limit how far to the right R can push policy. R's voter‐optimal platform is thus an interval from , the lowest policy R would ever take, up to a ceiling. Calculus determines the optimal ceiling to be , defined in Equation 5. The reasoning is reversed for candidate L, who prefers policies lower than the voter in each state: L's voter‐optimal platform is an interval with a floor on L's policy options.         "
"32","Interval delegation, while common in the study of the bureaucracy (Gailmard and Patty 2012), has not received attention in electoral politics. It has the intuitive property that the voter would like a politician to utilize his expertise but not distort policies excessively toward his own preferences. In our theory, then, optimal political representation takes a particular form: a mixture of the trustee model (full discretion) and the delegate model (no discretion). In fact, both models arise only as special cases. The trustee model is optimal when the politician is unbiased, whereas the delegate model is optimal when the politician is extreme. Notice that, unless a politician is extreme, ambiguous platforms are necessary to attain optimal representation.         "
"33","Proposition 1 implies interesting comparative statics, which we summarize next. Let  denote the policy chosen by candidate i in state θ when elected with platform A, and let  be the expected utility of player  when candidate  is elected with platform .12                        "
"34","Proposition 2.For any  and  with :                  "
"35","Proposition 2 focuses on the case where politicians are neither unbiased nor extreme because those cases are trivial. Part 1 says that when a politician is more biased, it is optimal to grant him less discretion because the gain from limiting policy bias increases. Part 2 of Proposition 2 says that, unsurprisingly, the voter is worse off when a politician is more biased, even under the voter‐optimal platform. Finally, part 3 says that a politician's policy choice given the voter‐optimal platform is tilted in expectation toward his own policy preferences. However, the average policy bias—as measured by , since the voter's ideal policy is on expectation 0—is nonmonotonic in the politician's bias. When a politician is unbiased, he is given full discretion and chooses the voter's ideal policy in each state, which obviously induces no average policy bias. When a politician is extreme, average policy bias again vanishes, but now because the politician is optimally given no discretion; he is constrained to only choose the voter's ex ante preferred policy, 0. Average policy bias emerges optimally only when a politician is moderately biased.         "
"36","Figure 1 summarizes some aspects of Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 by depicting the voter‐optimal policy ceiling for candidate R as well as the corresponding expected policy.         "
"37","Candidate R's Voter‐Optimal Policy Ceiling and Expected Policy                     "
"38","Note: Candidate R's voter‐optimal ceiling (black dashed line) and resulting expected policy (blue solid curve) are shown as a function of , given a uniform distribution of the state.                     "
"39","While Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 characterize properties of the voter‐optimal platform, the voter does not actually choose a candidate's platform; rather, each candidate is free to propose any platform he would like. Plainly, conditional on being elected, a candidate always benefits from greater discretion (a larger  in the sense of set inclusion). The only reason for him to propose a platform that limits his discretion is to secure office, both because he values holding office per se and in order to avoid his opponent tilting policies away from his preferences. In this section, we study how the officeholder's equilibrium discretion emerges from electoral competition and the strategic interplay between candidates.         "
"40","Candidates are essentially unconstrained in their platform choices. Nevertheless, a winning candidate's equilibrium platform takes a simple form: He either proposes a single policy or constrains how far he can move policy in the direction of his bias.            "
"41","Lemma 1.In any equilibrium in which candidate  wins with positive probability, he plays a pure strategy, choosing a platform  such that                  "
"42","Lemma 1 says that equilibrium platforms are singletons or intervals (for candidates who win with positive probability), analogous to voter‐optimal platforms (Proposition 1). The key idea is that a candidate will only propose platforms that maximize a weighted average of his own utility and the voter's. Only singleton or interval platforms have this property; any other platform would neither help a candidate win the election nor, conditional on winning, benefit him either.14 A subtle but noteworthy feature of equilibrium strategies is that a candidate who wins with positive probability does not randomize over platforms.         "
"43","Notwithstanding the similarities, Lemma 1 also points to an important distinction between equilibrium platforms and voter‐optimal platforms. While both could be intervals that constrain a politician from choosing policies too far in the direction of his policy bias, the former may entail more—but not less—discretion. Proposition 3, our main result, develops this further by providing a full characterization of the equilibrium platforms. Recall that  is the voter's expected utility when candidate  is elected with platform .            "
"44","Proposition 3.Let , so that candidate R is no more biased than L.15 An equilibrium exists. Furthermore:                  "
"45","Proposition 3 shows that the winning platform is equal to the voter‐optimal platform only in three special cases: (a) both candidates are extreme (part 1), (b) at least one candidate is unbiased (part 2), or (c) candidates' biases are perfectly symmetric (part 3). In any other case (parts 4 and 5), the more moderate candidate wins the election with certainty while obtaining more discretion than is voter‐optimal. This does not imply, however, that the voter is better off with more extreme candidates because they propose their voter‐optimal platform. In fact, as we establish later, more moderate candidates can only increase the voter's welfare because their policy choice is on average closer to the voter's preferred policy.         "
"46","To understand Proposition 3, begin by observing that when candidates L and R are biased but equally so (), they must each offer their voter‐optimal platforms. If one did not, say L with , then R can propose a platform  that (a) guarantees he wins the election (i.e.,  such that ) and (b) gives him more discretion than his voter‐optimal platform (e.g.,  with ). But such platforms cannot constitute an equilibrium because L would in turn prefer to offer a platform that provides the voter with higher utility than , guaranteeing victory for L instead of R.16"
"47","Parts 4 and 5 of the proposition follow from the fact that when candidate R is ex ante advantaged because he is less biased than L () and not extreme (), he can guarantee victory by offering his voter‐optimal platform, . But since he prefers more discretion, he will instead offer the most discretionary platform subject to the constraint of providing the voter with at least as much utility as L does when L proposes his voter‐optimal platform. The distinction between parts 4 and 5 concerns whether R could be defeated by L if R proposes a platform that is too discretionary. If L's voter‐optimal platform, , is preferred by the voter to R's having full discretion, then equilibrium forces L to offer precisely that platform and the voter to resolve her equilibrium indifference between the two candidates in favor of R (part 4). In this case, we say that electoral competition is effective, since the presence of L, even though he does not win, influences the equilibrium outcome. If instead R is sufficiently advantaged because  is sufficiently smaller than , then R wins with full discretion no matter what platform L offers. In this case, any platform of L can be supported in equilibrium (part 5). The subsection “Probabilistic Voting” shows that adding aggregate uncertainty pins down both candidates' behavior regardless of their biases.         "
"48","Figure 2 provides a graphical representation of the expected equilibrium policy, comparing it with the expected policy under optimal representation. When the bias of candidate R is small enough, he wins with full discretion, and so the equilibrium policy is always  higher than the voter's preferred policy; this explains the 45‐degree line portion of the figure. As  further increases toward , candidate R is forced to place more constraints on his discretion in order to win, which decreases the expected policy. When  crosses the threshold , L now wins the election, giving himself increasing amounts of discretion until  becomes large enough that L is elected with full discretion. Thereafter, increases in  have no effect on equilibrium policies, which explains the flat line portion of the figure. Notice that except when  or when , the expected policy distortion in the direction of the winning candidate's bias is greater in equilibrium than under optimal representation.         "

"51","We now turn to the important implications of Proposition 3. If electoral competition is not effective or if at least one candidate is unbiased, matters are straightforward: The advantaged candidate or one of the unbiased candidates gets elected and has full discretion. For this reason, we focus in the rest of this section on effective electoral competition in which both candidates are biased.         "
"52","First, our theory predicts that convergence does not generally occur.            "
"53","Implication 1.Convergence occurs if and only if both candidates are extreme or .               "
"54","(Appendix B.4 in the supporting information details how this and subsequent implications follow from parts 1, 3, and 4 of Proposition 3.)         "
"55","Convergence occurs if and only if either (a) candidates are extreme or (b) they are symmetric, , and the knife‐edge condition  holds. In both the Downsian setting and in ours, convergence is at the voter‐optimal platform, which maximizes both candidates' electoral chances. In our setting, only when candidates are extreme does the voter‐optimal platform reduce to the voter's ex ante optimal policy, precluding policy adaptation altogether.         "
"56","When candidates' policy preferences are moderate (i.e., at least one candidate i has ), candidates typically propose divergent platforms. Further, divergence in platforms implies divergence in expected policies.            "
"57","Implication 2.Unless a candidate is extreme, the expected policy he chooses if elected is biased in the direction of his policy preference.               "
"58","As the voter's behavior is entirely predictable in our baseline model (which is relaxed in the subsection “Probabilistic Voting”), the candidates' platforms are invariant to the office motivation parameter ϕ. Hence, equilibrium divergence persists even as . By contrast, in canonical models of divergence with policy‐motivated candidates (Calvert 1985; Wittman 1983), divergence vanishes as candidates become primarily office motivated.         "
"59","Divergence is intricately tied to ambiguity, as only extreme candidates propose single‐policy platforms. More interesting is the relationship between ambiguity and electoral success. To state the next implication, we measure the extent of candidates' ambiguity by the variance of their ex post policies.17 A candidate's platform is ambiguous if and only if the variance of his ex post policies is nonzero; a higher variance reflects more ambiguity in the sense of more uncertainty about the policy the candidate will choose if elected.            "
"60","Implication 3.When the two candidates are not equally ambiguous, the more ambiguous candidate always wins the election.               "
"61","This implication follows from part 4 of Proposition 3. When candidate R is less biased than L, not only is R's voter‐optimal platform more ambiguous than L's, but moreover, R can take advantage of his policy alignment by winning the election with a platform that has even greater ambiguity than his voter‐optimal platform. L is unable to undercut R even though L offers his voter‐optimal platform.         "
"62","The electoral success of ambiguous candidates has long puzzled political scientists. Our theory shows that analysts must be careful with the direction of causality: In our model, a candidate does not win because he is more ambiguous than his opponent; rather, he is more ambiguous because he is able to win by exploiting his ex ante electoral advantage of preference alignment."
"63","Our next implication fleshes out a comparative static concerning policy divergence. We focus on the case with symmetric biases and consider how the degree of policy divergence depends on the level of political polarization. We measure the expected policy divergence by the difference in expected policies of the two candidates (i.e., ) and political polarization by the difference in policy preferences (i.e., ).            "
"64","Implication 4.When , expected policy divergence is nonmonotonic in political polarization. Expected policy divergence is initially increasing in polarization (when ) and eventually decreasing in polarization (when ).               "
"65","Fixing any pair of platforms, at least one of which is ambiguous, an increase in polarization increases expected policy divergence. However, equilibrium platforms also change with polarization. In particular, symmetrically biased candidates who become more polarized impose more stringent constraints on their policy choices in order to win the election. Consequently, expected policy divergence can decrease as polarization increases; it necessarily does when candidates become extreme, as platforms then converge to . Implication 4 has important consequences for the empirical study of political polarization. It demonstrates that any measure of average policy divergence is consistent with at least two levels of political polarization; higher political polarization is compatible with lower average policy divergence.         "
"66","While electoral competition generally produces divergent and ambiguous platforms, it is beneficial to the voter because she values policy adaptability. This normative conclusion contrasts with most of the literature on electoral competition, which often views both divergence and ambiguity as undesirable.18                        "
"67","Implication 5.The voter's equilibrium welfare in a divergent equilibrium is higher than it would be under convergence to singleton platforms.               "
"68","However, electoral competition in our framework does not generally lead to optimal outcomes for the voter.            "
"69","Implication 6.Effective electoral competition induces candidates to limit ambiguity in a manner desired by the voter. However, it is not sufficient to guarantee voter‐optimal platforms unless candidates are symmetrically biased or extreme; in any other case, the winning candidate is overly ambiguous.               "
"70","Put differently, electoral competition benefits the voter as long as it is effective, but only in special cases does it lead to optimal political representation. Equilibrium political representation is generally a mixture of the trustee and delegate models, but overly tilted toward trusteeship from the voter's point of view. By contrast, in the traditional Downsian framework, the (median) voter always obtains her preferred outcome.19"
"71","One salient case in which each candidate proposes his voter‐optimal platform is when candidates are symmetrically biased.20 Nonetheless, unless they are extreme they implement different policies when elected. As the voter is indifferent between the two candidates, she could toss a fair coin to determine the winner. It follows that close elections—elections that each candidate is equally likely to win—are compatible with divergent platforms and expected policy divergence. Our theory thus rationalizes Lee, Moretti, and Butler's (2004) empirical finding of policy divergence in close elections. In our framework, this does not imply that the electorate merely elects policies; rather, divergence in close elections is consistent with candidates' proposing their voter‐optimal platforms.         "
"72","Finally, we highlight the disciplining effect of elections by noting that the voter's welfare depends not only on the winning candidate's bias, but also on the losing candidate's.            "
"73","Implication 7.If the candidates are moderate and symmetrically biased, the voter's expected utility is decreasing in the level of their bias. If the candidates are moderate and asymmetrically biased, the voter's expected utility is decreasing in the losing candidate's bias, and constant in the winning candidate's bias.               "
"74","When the candidates are symmetrically biased, candidates propose their voter‐optimal platform in equilibrium, and voter welfare is decreasing in the candidates' bias. In an effective election with asymmetric candidates, the more moderate candidate wins while making the voter indifferent between the candidates; hence, the voter's utility is determined by the utility she would receive from the voter‐optimal platform of the losing candidate. It should be noted that Implication 7 refers only to effective elections: When the candidates' biases are sufficiently asymmetric, the more moderate candidate wins the election while proposing full discretion, and the voter's utility depends only on the bias of the winning candidate.         "
"75","We now discuss the robustness of our main results to some extensions."
"76","Suppose there are  () voters. Each voter  has utility function               "
"77","Proposition 4.Consider any pair of platforms,  and . Electing candidate  with platform  is preferred to electing candidate  with platform  by a majority of voters if and only if .                  "
"78","Proposition 4 implies that the optimal platform for candidate i from the perspective of the median voter is the unique Condorcet winner among i's platforms in a heterogeneous electorate. It follows that the equilibrium characterization in Proposition 3 and all our other insights remain valid with a heterogeneous electorate.            "
"79","We have assumed that candidates' campaign promises take the form of a set of policy options. We now discuss why this assumption is key for our results, returning to the single‐voter model for simplicity."
"80","Suppose first that candidates are constrained to offer the voter only a single policy. The voter's ex ante preferred policy is 0, and candidates face the same strategic problem as in the classical Downsian framework. Equilibrium platforms are nonambiguous (by stipulation) and convergent (in equilibrium). Precluding ambiguous platforms necessarily reduces the voter's welfare unless both candidates are extreme, in which case it has no effect."
"81","Suppose next that candidates can make state‐contingent promises. For example, they might announce the level of benefit cuts for each possible contingency, effectively making a pronouncement such as “If the budgetary deficit turns out to be θ1 then I will cut benefits by a1, if it is θ2 then I will cut benefits by a2,….” Such commitments are enforceable only if the state of the world is easily observable by the voter, which it often is not. But if such commitments were feasible, there would again be convergence: Both candidates would commit to implementing a policy that matches the state of the world. Nonverifiability of the state may thus harm the voter in two ways: Not only could the officeholder tilt policies toward his own bliss point given his platform, but also the winning platform itself may be overambiguous.            "
"82","We have assumed that elections are deterministic, in the sense that candidates can perfectly predict how the electorate will respond to their platforms. Suppose now that after candidates choose their platforms, the voter's preference is affected by a “valence” shock before she votes. Denoting the valence shock by η and the elected candidate by e, we suppose the voter's utility function is . Thus,  () corresponds to candidate L (R) having a valence advantage.            "
"83","It is common knowledge that η is distributed on the interval  according to a CDF G with a positive density g. To simplify the exposition, we focus on candidates who are biased but not extreme, and we assume that the valence shock can be “large enough”: Even a candidate with  proposing full discretion wins with positive probability against an unbiased candidate proposing full discretion.21 When candidate L proposes platform  and candidate R proposes platform , the voter now elects candidate R (ignoring indifference, which will be an event with zero probability) if and only if .            "
"84","It has been well known since Wittman (1983) and Calvert (1985) that uncertainty about the voter's preferences induces policy‐motivated candidates to propose divergent platforms. Intuitively, probabilistic voting reduces a candidate's electoral cost of tilting platforms toward his own preferred platform. This force is also in effect in our setting.               "
"85","Proposition 5.Suppose  for each . Then in every pure‐strategy equilibrium:                     "
"86","Proposition 5 characterizes candidates' behavior in any pure‐strategy equilibrium.22 Under probabilistic voting, even symmetric candidates propose more ambiguous platforms than is voter‐optimal (Proposition 5, part 1), in contrast to our baseline result (Proposition 3, part 3). The reason is that the electoral cost of proposing a slightly more ambiguous platform is second order, whereas the benefit from having more discretion when elected is first order. The degree of divergence from the voter‐optimal platform turns on how much candidates care about office relative to policy, as in Wittman (1983) and Calvert (1985). As office motivation becomes paramount, both candidates try to maximize their probability of winning, which leads them toward proposing their respective voter‐optimal platforms even when they are asymmetrically biased (Proposition 5, part 2). Thus, probabilistic voting can either increase or decrease ambiguity, depending on candidates' biases and office motivation.            "
"87","Despite the new features induced by probabilistic voting, one central point remains unchanged. When neither candidate has an ex ante valence advantage (i.e., ), greater ambiguity is associated with greater electoral success, at least when candidates are sufficiently office motivated. As before, this positive correlation is a consequence of a more moderate candidate's ex ante electoral advantage.               "
"88","Proposition 6.Assume  for some  and focus on pure‐strategy equilibria. If , then there exists a  such that when , candidate i is more ambiguous than his opponent and wins with probability greater than 1/2.                  "
"89","This article introduces a new model of electoral competition in which policy‐relevant information is revealed to the elected politician after he takes office. Our framework is well suited to formally studying a classical issue in the theory of political representation. We find that optimal political representation consists of a mixture of the trustee and delegate models: Voters would like politicians to have some discretion to adapt policies to changing circumstances, but also constrain how much they can do so to mitigate policy bias. Discretion is obtained through ambiguous electoral platforms. While electoral competition generally benefits voters, it need not lead to optimal political representation; there is instead a slant toward excess trusteeship. Candidates typically propose divergent and ambiguous platforms. Our theory thus provides a single rationale for two well‐documented empirical facts. We also find that the more ambiguous candidate is more likely to win. However, ambiguity does not cause electoral success; rather, the correlation is a consequence of a more moderate candidate's preexisting electoral advantage."
"90","To isolate the channel underlying our results, we have assumed that candidates' policy biases are known. Voter uncertainty about these biases introduces additional issues, in particular whether a candidate's platform can serve as a signal of his bias. We can show that, under some conditions, there are pooling equilibria that preserve our main insights and that the scope for separation is in fact limited (cf. Tanner 2013). A thorough analysis is left for future research.         "
"91","We have modeled an election's outcome as entirely determined by the median voter. In practice, candidates may target other constituencies: voters in the party base (both because of primaries and within general elections), interest groups, donors, and so on. Our logic suggests that if electoral pressures lead a candidate to target a constituency more extreme than himself, he may make commitments that limit his ability to act contrary to his bias (where extremism and bias are relative to the median voter). For example, at the behest of Grover Nordquist's Americans for Tax Reform, many Republicans have pledged to never vote for a tax increase. It would be fruitful to study how electoral competition shapes political representation with multiple constituencies."
"92","Our results rely on the (common) assumption that candidates can credibly commit to their platforms. The degree of commitment is limited, however, as candidates cannot commit to which policy they will implement from an ambiguous platform. In practice, candidates do sometimes break campaign pledges. Another interesting avenue for future research would be to extend our framework to allow for campaign promises to be broken at a cost."
