"1","The analyses are composed of four phases. First, attitude scores are compared between the population who experienced an economic risk event and the population who did not. Second, a series of gene‐environment interaction models, which include the potential for gene‐environment correlation, estimates the influence life events have on the genetic and environmental variance components estimates of economic attitudes. Third, the stability of economic attitudes is displayed by comparing the attitudes of those exposed to financial risk events with those who were not in a subset of the population approximately two years later. Finally, a second series of GxE models explore if the changes in the genetic and environmental sources of variance remain after two years."
"2","The sample consists of a large study of kinships (n = 29,682), aged 18–96 years (μ = 49.5, σ = 17.6), composed of 14,781 twins, 3,184 nontwin siblings, 4,391 spouses, 2,360 parents, 195 other relatives, and 4,771 children of twins. Complete twin pairs include 1,885 female monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, 1,183 female dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, 790 male MZ pairs, 583 male DZ pairs, and 1,134 female‐male twin pairs. The population was drawn from Virginia's Vital Records Office and further supplemented by a national mailer sent to the American Association of Retired Persons (Eaves et al. 1999). A large questionnaire on “Health and Life Styles” (HLQ), which contained measures of political attitudes and life events among many other traits, was administered to the population in the late 1980s. In addition, 4,119 of the twins, composed of 744 female MZ twin pairs, 421 female DZ twin pairs, 195 male MZ pairs, 93 male DZ pairs, and 339 female‐male twin pairs, aged 40–93 (μ = 64, σ = 7.9), took part in a follow‐up two years later. This Health Habits and Opinions study (HHO) assessed many of the same political attitudes in the HLQ. However, the life‐events questions were not similarly assessed in the second wave.            "
"3","Political attitudes in the HLQ are measured by a 28‐item Wilson and Patterson (1968) inventory of contemporary political and social attitudes (see online Appendix A for the individual attitudes, construct validity, and questionnaire). This type of measure has a long history in psychology (Bouchard and McGue 2003; Wilson 1973) and is increasingly used by political scientists (Alford, Funk, and Hibbing 2005; Hatemi, Eaves, and McDermott 2012; Smith et al. 2012; Verhulst, Hatemi, and Martin 2010). The Wilson‐Patterson (WP) inventory is administered by presenting subjects with a list of simple phrases such as “Unions” and eliciting an “agree or yes,” “uncertain or don't know,” or “disagree or no” response. The design captures the immediate opinions of respondents and allows for a quick assessment of the multidimensionality of political ideology. Five attitudes in the WP inventory measure economic interests and reflect the attitudes explored in the extant literature: support for Capitalism, Immigration, Property Tax, Socialism, and Unions. Two additional attitudes, Foreign Aid and Federal Housing, while not identified in the literature, are also included in the study for completeness, due to their economic nature and potential links to larger value systems. The attitudes, in sum, represent policy implications for financial relief or loss through governmental action, larger value systems, and economic ideologies. All seven attitudes were assessed in the HHO follow‐up two years later.            "
"4","The study assesses a wide array of life events through a shortened version of the Holmes and Rahe (1967) stressful life‐events (SLE) inventory. The SLE asks respondents to answer if they had experienced any of the following events within the last 12 months: Divorce, Marital Separation, Broken Engagement, Separation from Loved One, Serious Illness/Injury, Serious Accident, Robbed, Assaulted/Mugged, Laid Off/Fired, Other Serious Difficulties at Work, Major Financial Problems, and Legal Troubles with Police (see online Appendix B for questions, format, and response rates). These types of scales have high test‐retest reliability and are consistent with independently rated measures derived from semistructured interviews (Brugha and Cragg 1990).            "
"5","Four life events in the SLE scale are related to financial loss and risk: experiencing Major Financial Problems, being Laid Off/Fired, Divorce, and Marital Separation. The first two events are explicitly linked to financial loss. The latter two, though most often not inspired by economic loss, incur substantial financial costs. Relocation of home, developing new credit, loss of property, and the associated costs of divorce, including possible alimony and child support, necessitate inclusion of these events (Duncan and Hoffman 1985; McManus and DiPrete 2001). Because Divorced and Marital Separation incur similar costs, and respondents could respond yes to both (see online Appendix C for a comparison), a single measure is constructed (Divorced or Separated) and scored 0 if neither event was experienced or 1 if either event was experienced.            "
"6","Table 1 provides the frequency of endorsement for the economic attitudes under each of the life‐event conditions. Table 2 confirms there are significant differences in economic attitudes between individuals exposed to economic life events and those who were not. However, the attitudes measures are ordinal, and while parametric methods are often suitable to analyze ordinal data (Gaito 1980; Norman 2010), nonparametric tests have considerable advantages for Likert‐type data, particularly if the data violate normality or homogeneity of variance assumptions. Therefore, while Table 2 provides the means, standard deviations, and Cohen's d, I use the Wilcoxon procedure to test if the populations are significantly different from one another. The Wilcoxon Z test can be considered a nonparametric version of a t‐test, but it compares the medians and mean ranks of the two groups, not the means.            "
"7","Regarding attitudes on larger value systems, individuals who suffered economic risk events are less supportive of Capitalism and more supportive of Socialism. The findings are generally modest and reflect the broader literature on the relationships between job insecurity and support for socialism. Individuals who might benefit from additional governmental support are more likely to endorse social welfare policies or positions (Mach and Jackson 2006; Zeitlin 1966). However, other research has not found person‐specific economic conditions to be significant predictors of larger value systems (Feldman 1982; Schlozman and Verba 1979). The lack of support for self‐interested policies in earlier research might be due to sample size limitations or lack of salience (see Citrin et al. 1997; Sears and Funk 1990). For example, in a random sample of 1,000 individuals, in most years, it is likely that on average less than 50 have suffered a specific financial life event (National Center for Health Statistics 1991), making statistical significance for measured effects unlikely. As such, it might be that the larger sample used here, akin to studies of developing democracies (e.g., Mach and Jackson 2006), provides a sufficient number of cases to properly identify these relationships.            "
"8","Individuals who suffered any of the economic risk events are less supportive of Immigration and more supportive of Unions. These results also correspond with the extant literature. The cause of this shift may be self‐interest, but such self‐interest is likely infused by the anxiety caused by elite discourse, partisan influences, the perception of risk, sociotropic conditions, and ethnocentric attitudes (e.g., Hainmueller and Hiscox 2010).            "
"9","Consistent with the extant literature, the relationships between individual economic conditions and taxation attitudes are the most robust. Those who lost their job or were suffering from financial difficulties, including marital dissolution, and who may benefit from reduced taxation, are more likely to oppose Property Tax. Opposition increases with the number of financial risk events experienced. With only one event, the difference is significant (Table 2), but the more financial risk events suffered, the greater the difference, particularly for Property Tax, Unions, and Socialism attitudes. The results support the claim that person‐specific economic life events have a significant influence on attitudes. However, there are no more than 54 cases where individuals experienced three financial risk events in the last year, and only three of the seven relationships in this category are statistically significant.            "
"10","The least explored relationships in the extant literature regarding life events and attitudes are Foreign Aid and Federal Housing. It is not surprising then that the relationships between these attitudes and the economic risk events are not significant or small in magnitude. Support for Federal Housing increases when individuals experience any financial risk event, while support for Foreign Aid decreases with Major Financial Problems.            "
"11","Nonparametric analyses affirm that there are significantly different mean ranks between the populations. However, these estimates only serve as preliminary analyses to the central theme of the study. In a GxE exploration, the effects of life events on the population's attitudes are secondary to the effect life events have on the difference between co‐twins’ attitudes. Variance components models rely on co‐twin covariance, and GxE models focus on the possibility that cross‐twin correlations differ as a function of environmental exposure. If, for example, MZ co‐twins’ attitudes become more similar in response to a life event, or DZ co‐twins’ attitudes more dissimilar, regardless of the population's overall reaction to the life event, the relative influence of genes and environments on attitudes will be significantly different in the affected population. In this case, genetic influence would increase. However, the opposite may also be true. For example, if the effect of a life event is overly large, it is possible that the effect will remove all differences in co‐twin similarity regardless of zygosity type. In this case, the majority of variance will be due to environmental influences. Thus, the overall effect of life events on the population provides little information on the relative importance of genes and environments. It is to this question the article now turns."
"12","Twin designs derive their explanatory power from the difference in the genetic similarity of MZ co‐twins, who share almost identical chromosomal DNA sequences, and DZ co‐twins, who share on average half of their DNA sequence. Comparison of trait concordance between MZ and DZ twin pairs reared together controls for the effects of familial environments, allowing for differences in co‐twin correlations to be partitioned into broad estimates of heritability and environment. Phenotypic (trait of interest) variance (Vp) is most often decomposed into three latent variables (Vp = A2 + C2 + E2): additive genetic variance (A), which is the sum of all genetic influence; shared environmental variance (C); and unique person‐specific environmental variance (E), which also includes error (see Medland and Hatemi 2009).            "
"13","Univariate genetic and environmental variance decomposition estimates for each of the seven attitudes are presented in online Appendix D. Numerous univariate approaches have been applied to this sample, with slightly different results depending on the methodology (Eaves et al. 2011; Hatemi, Medland, and Eaves 2009). Sources of individual differences on economic attitudes are a function of genetic and environmental sources of variance, but the combined environmental sources account for the majority of variation. Because the findings and methods are explicitly detailed in the extant literature, I forgo the structural modeling specifics of the univariate design and focus on the meaning of the estimates and deciphering the model in relation to gene‐environment interaction.            "
"14","First, variance components estimates represent what accounts for individual differences within the population (Hatemi, Byrne, and McDermott 2012). Consider attitudes toward Federal Housing, for example. The proportion of variance estimated for each of the A, C, and E components, 0.40, 0.07, and 0.53, respectively, should not be interpreted to mean that 40% of one's attitudes is determined by genes (Hatemi, Alford, et al. 2009). Rather, 40% of the total variance (i.e., individual differences) on attitudes toward Federal Housing within the population can be attributed to genetic similarity, 7% to shared experiences, and 53% to person‐specific idiosyncratic experiences. In the classical twin design (CTD), each of the variance components remains independent of the others, and any interactions between genes and environments are confounded within the discrete A, C, and E estimates. These estimates contain not only the direct effects of genes or environments but also the effects of interactions between genes and environments (Boomsma and Martin 2002). The CTD provides umbrella estimates—they are the average genetic and environmental influences in a population, masking possible systematic transactions between genetic and specific environmental influences. That is, the effect of genetic variation may be particularly important for individuals within a specific environment and less or nonexistent for those in another circumstance.            "
"15","To investigate the possibility that genetic and environmental influences on economic attitudes are moderated by experiencing an economic life event, a model in which the variance components vary as a continuous function is needed. A modification to the twin design identified by Jinks and Fulker (1970) and elaborated further by Eaves and contemporaries (Eaves 1972; Eaves and Eysenck 1977; Eaves et al. 1977; Purcell 2002) provides this modification. Rather than modeling attitudes using the linear equation shown above, the variance associated with each of the three components is expressed as a linear interaction with the life events: Vp = (A + ßa*Life Event)2 + (C + ßc*Life Event)2 + (E + ße*Life Event).2"
"16","Using this equation, a variance term for gene‐environment interaction (GxE) is incorporated into the variance components model by partitioning genetic effects into a baseline or average impact of the variance component independent of the environmental indicator (analogous to an intercept in linear regression) and the marginal effect of the specific environmental event (analogous to the slope). In this equation, the ß estimates allow the variance components to differ across exposure to the life events. This model is illustrated in Figure 1. Model specifics, algebra, and simulations are specified in detail by Purcell (2002). A reparameterization for ordinal data provided by Medland et al. (2009) is used in this study.            "
"17","Path Diagram of Variance Components Analysis with GxE Interaction"
"18","Note: E is unique environment, A is additive genetic, and C is common environment. T1 is twin 1, and T2 is twin 2. ßa represents the effect of additive genetic variance dependent of the life event; the same applies to c and e.                        "
"19","Entering the life‐event moderator in the means model removes genetic effects that are shared between the attitude and the life event from the covariance model. However, this approach may fail to detect GxE interactions where the moderated genetic component is common between the attitude and the life event (gene‐environment covariance, or rGE as noted above). Therefore, the GxE model is modified as a bivariate model of both trait and moderator in order to detect GxE in the presence of rGE.2 A path diagram presented in online Appendix F illustrates this approach (see Purcell 2002). The life event is entered as a dependent variable and as a moderator on each of the paths to the trait. The main effect in the means model is replaced with a path indicating shared genetic effects. Two sources of genetic influence are estimated for the attitude: that which is shared with the life event and that which is not (common and unique environmental paths, aC and aU, respectively). Each path can interact with the life‐event moderator, represented by the coefficients  and . The C and E components follow the standard bivariate Cholesky parameterization but without moderation. Thus, in the absence of GxE, rGE is calculated as . In the presence of GxE, rGE must be calculated conditional on the life event (M), as it will also vary as a function of the life event:               "
"20","Maximum‐likelihood estimations in a structural equation model are fit to the raw data in the statistical package Mx (Neale et al. 2003). A series of interaction models is fitted to each of the significant political‐attitude and life‐event combinations. Exposure to the life event is included as a moderator on the variance paths A, C, and E to the phenotype. In Figure 1, “a” represents the effect of additive genetic variance independent of the life event; ßa represents the effect of additive genetic variance dependent on the life event; the same goes for “e” and ße. These betas were subsequently constrained to zero in the reduced (nested) models. Model fit for each of the reduced models was compared to the fit of the full model using the −2LL likelihood statistic, which is distributed as χ2.            "
"21","The p‐values for the gene‐environment interaction models are shown in Table 3. The raw −2LL values for each interaction are too numerous to be displayed in the text and are available in online Appendix G. The full model includes the interaction of the life events on the A, C, and E estimates, and if the interaction effects are different for males and females (Sex). Table 3 presents the p‐values for reduced models by comparing the change in model fit between the main effects model and the model with the interaction terms unconstrained; these nested models include removing sex differences and the interactions from the A, C, and E parameters. A significant value (p ≤ .05) represents a model in which the interaction cannot be removed without a significant reduction in model fit. It is customary to focus on the interaction between the measured environmental stimuli (the financial risk life events in this study) and all three sources of variation combined (ACE). However, the p‐values for the interaction between the life events and each A, C, and E parameter are displayed individually for further specification. The parameters in the main‐effects model are interpreted as in any other classical twin design (see online Appendix D for the estimated values of ACE when life events are not modeled). Interaction terms are better understood graphically by plotting the relative variance in the attitudes accounted for by A, C, and E under each of the life‐event conditions. The graphs for the combined ACE interactions are displayed when significant. Graphs for reduced models are only displayed when the combined ACE interaction is not significant, but some reduced combination of ACE is significant.            "
"22","Experiencing a Major Financial Loss within the last year has a significant effect on attitudes but no significant influence on sources of variance. That is, the process by which individuals differ in determining their attitudes remains the same across affected and nonaffected populations, even if the event itself is influential in altering the expressed attitude. Losing one's job, however, significantly moderates the population estimate of genetic and environmental influence on Unions, Federal Housing, and Property Tax attitudes (Figures 2 and 3). For females, genetic variance declines to almost zero on Union attitudes for those who lost their job, while the shared environment increases substantially. For males, the reduction in genetic influence is similar to females, but instead of the common environmental variance increasing, it is the unique environment. Both males and females are more supportive of Unions if they lose their job, but differences in attitudes between females who experience the event are more a function of shared upbringing, while differences between male attitudes in reaction to the event are more of a function of personal experience. For Federal Housing, the loss of one's job reduces genetic variance and increases unique environmental variance, but it has almost no influence on common environmental variance. The difference is significantly greater in males.            "

"27","Perhaps the most intriguing finding is the impact job loss has on Property Tax attitudes. Support for Property Tax decreases for people who lost their job, but the process by which people differed in their opinion if they lost their job appears to be a function of genetic influence. Genetic variance increased by over 0.30 at the cost of environmental influence. That is, one's genetically informed psychological disposition appears to account for differences on Property Tax attitudes to a great degree (over 0.60 of the variance) among individuals who lost their job.            "
"28","Experiencing a recent divorce or marital separation also significantly alters the sources of variance for Immigration, Property Tax, and Socialism attitudes (Figure 4). For Immigration and Property Tax, genetic variance decreases, while unique environmental variance increases. The import of the common environment remains unchanged. The results for Socialism, while statistically significant, are muted. There is a significant decrease in common environmental variance but only marginal increases in genetic and unique environmental variance.            "

"31","So far, the analyses have focused on the effect of a single event. With only one event, it is not possible to identify whether the effect is linear or at which point financial risks no longer influence sources of variance on attitudes. This is addressed by creating a summed scale of risk events, ranging from zero to three, and modeling the interaction between the Combined Risk Events measure and each attitude. A significant GxE interaction exists for Capitalism, Federal Housing, Property Tax, and Socialism (Figure 5). Federal Housing is significant, but the change in the variance components is marginal, and thus the graphs are not displayed. The two measures of value systems, Capitalism and Socialism, are influenced in a similar manner by the Combined Risk Events measure. The import of the common environment accounting for individual differences increases with each subsequent risk event, while the unique environment decreases substantially after the first risk event. Genetic influences decrease in a linear fashion for Capitalism, but they taper off after the second risk event for Socialism.            "

"33","Note: A is additive genetic, C is common environment, and E is unique environment. Full ACE model interactions shown. The shaded areas represent the 95% confidence intervals.                        "
"34","Recall that under the job‐loss condition, genetic variance on Property Tax increases. By including all risk events in one measure, however, genetic influences decrease, but the reduction is modest until after the second event. This makes sense given the increase in genetic influences under the job‐loss condition. Specifically, for females, genetic influences on Property Tax decrease, while common environment decreases after the first event, then returns to near its original magnitude after three events. For males, genetic influences marginally decrease from zero to two events but take a radical drop at three events. For both males and females, unique environmental influence accounts for more of the individual differences within the population as the number of life events increases. The results are largely robust with the exception of the third event. The number of cases where an individual suffers three financial risk events in one year is small (54), and this is reflected by the wide confidence limits.            "
"35","In summary, genetic influences on economic attitudes are quite sensitive to major person‐specific financial contingencies, even if the phenotypic influence is modest. In more than one‐third of the cases, there are significant changes in sources of variance. In almost all cases, genetic influences dissipate, with the one exception being the increase of genetic influence accounting for differences on Property Tax attitudes when individuals have recently lost their job.            "
"36","The question remains as to whether attitude differences persist after the events have passed from recent memory. In time, do people revert to their former attitude position relative to the population? Do sources of individual differences on attitudes remain even if the mean changes on attitudes do not? Do people change not only their position but also the way in which they differ from one another over the long run?"
"37","The panel structure of the study allows for such comparisons on a subset of the population. Table 4 compares the attitude scores between the populations who experienced a financial risk event and the unaffected population two years later. First, for all attitudes except Capitalism, the population of individuals who suffered Major Financial Problems maintains a different mean rank (calculated by Wilcoxon Z) in comparison to the unaffected population. However, in the affected populations, attitudes are no more or less stable, measured by attitude correlations between waves, with one exception. Union attitudes are less stable in the population who suffered Major Financial Problems.            "
"38","The percentage of individuals in the second wave who lost their job is similar to the percent in the first wave, but in absolute terms, there are no more than 70. Nevertheless, statistically different Property Tax, Unions, Socialism, and Immigration attitudes remain between those who were laid off two years prior and those who were not. Foreign Aid, Immigration, and Union attitudes are more stable for those who lost their job two years prior, but Socialism attitudes are less stable.            "
"39","Sample size is a concern regarding the Divorce or Separated event in the second wave. While the relative percent of divorce is consistent with the National Center for Health Statistics (1991), fewer than 60 individuals from the first wave who were divorced or going through a separation were included in the second wave. Nevertheless, the mean rank differences between the affected population and nonaffected population persist for all attitudes except Foreign Aid and Immigration. Attitudes are also less stable for Federal Housing and Socialism in the affected group.            "
"40","In most instances, the influence of the risk events persists. That is, the differences in attitudes found for those who experience a life event in the first wave (Table 2) maintain the same direction and a somewhat relative difference to the unaffected population in the second wave (Table 4). The next question is, do the sources of individual differences also persist? Analyses conducted using attitudes from the second wave resulted in no significant GxE interactions in any model for those affected by financial life events in the first wave. Since no models are significant, the model fitting results are placed in online Appendix G.            "
"41","The rate of adverse life events, while consistent with national averages, is low. However, this sample of more than 29,000 individuals provides ample cases to identify statistically meaningful relationships. The sample is not random, and it is critical to explore different periods of time, cultures, and contexts prior to generalizing. Nevertheless, the attitude relationships are comparable to National Election Studies data (Smith et al. 2012). In addition, the 3‐point attitude measures do not provide the same advantages as 7‐point scales and may not reveal more subtle relationships between attitudes and life events. Yet, with regard to ACE variance components on attitudes, 7‐point Likert‐type scales provide comparable results to the same questions asked using 3‐point scales.            "
"42","The life events measured are not exhaustive. While attitudes are assessed in the second wave, recent life events are not. Thus, analyses across both waves of data in the same structural GxE model are not possible. Additionally, the number of cases in wave 2 where individuals suffered a life event in wave 1 is low on an absolute scale, and it is possible that no significant GxE interactions are identified in wave 2 due to sample limitations. For example, individuals unemployed at time 1 may still be unemployed, or employed in between measures, then unemployed again by time 2. This possibility might account for the persistence of attitude change or the lack of GxE effects in wave 2. While this situation is unlikely for the divorce life event, future studies with additional measures are needed to address these possibilities."
"43","The relationship between economic events and policy positions has long presented a tantalizing puzzle. Recently, researchers have begun to articulate the role of genes in this process, but the dynamics of how person‐specific life events influence political attitudes through both environmental and genetic pathways have remained unclear. The results presented here shed some light on these mechanisms."
"44","First, this study provides further evidence that proximate life events have a significant influence on attitudes in the domain of those events. Individuals who lost their job or suffered from financial problems were more likely to hold positive attitudes toward organizations, policies, or value systems which propose to alleviate those problems, such as Unions, Federal Housing, and Socialism, and more likely to oppose policies that have often been blamed as the cause for lack of jobs or economic woes (i.e., Immigration and Capitalism).         "
"45","Next, this study investigated the extent to which proximate life events altered the sources of variance that account for individual differences on economic attitudes (GxE). Importantly, even though the effects of life events on attitudes can be modest, they can have a substantial influence on variance components estimates. Here, small attitude shifts resulted in large differences in co‐twin covariance. In most instances, genetic variance on attitudes decreases for those who experience an economic life event. The one exception where genetic variance increases and accounts for a greater portion of individual differences is on Property Tax attitudes when individuals have lost their job in the last 12 months.         "
"46","The marked increase on the genetic variance of Property Tax attitudes under a job‐loss condition might provide an ideal case to identify the specific neurobiological pathways subsumed within the heritability estimates on economic attitudes. Indeed, it remains unknown whether the genetic influence on economic attitudes operates through dopamine, serotonin, ketamine, or NMDA receptors and their extended hormonal pathways that have been implicated in cognition (Cropley et al. 2006), emotion (Canli and Lesch 2007; Dolan 2002), risk taking (McClure et al. 2004), delayed gratification (Hariri et al. 2006), anxiety (Hariri and Holmes 2006), rational action (Sanfey et al. 2003), and reward sensitivity (Farrer et al. 2009; Freire et al. 2006). Future work, focusing on these genetic variants and associated hormones under experimental conditions that measure economic risk, gain and loss, may begin to explicate the specific neurobiological pathways toward economic attitudes.         "
"47","The malleability of genetic and environmental influences on political attitudes in the face of life events suggests that studies that partition the variance of attitudes into independent components attributable to genes and environments do not capture the interaction of genes and environments in real time as life events unfold. This alone should not be surprising. However, changes in sources of individual differences due to proximate influences do not persist over the long term. That is, the proportion of genetic influences that account for individual differences on attitudes is quite stable over the long run and is only temporarily modulated by life experiences."
"48","The findings generate a series of important questions. It appears that life events create a shock to the system and alter how individual differences emerge in the population. Yet, it remains unknown whether genetic and environmental influences are simply moderated by life events or if the life events trigger different cognitive and emotive processes which are then used to evaluate attitudes and manage one's preferences at the time. In this case, entirely different genetic and environmental mechanisms that inform those emotive and cognitive processes may be instigated. Future studies that identify specific genetic markers, and explore the expression of those markers under varying social and environmental conditions, are necessary to explore these possibilities."
"49","Once the “crisis” passed, however, for the most part, attitudes did not appear to restabilize into their relative position within the population after two years. Do they at three years? A great deal of research has focused on attitude stability and preference formation (Achen 1975; Converse 1964; Jennings and Markus 1984). There is evidence of long‐term change for certain attitudes based on life experiences, but attitudes may have some reversion, as Alwin, Cohen, and Newcomb (1991) presented in the Bennington study. Stressors often guide individuals to revert to established patterns. In other cases, stressors influence individuals to change their perception of experiences and subsequent behaviors. Time between events and attitude measures is important. Some life events pass away from memory enough that new life events exert their own independent effects in the river of experiences that wash over us through life, while others remain salient for decades (Carstensen et al. 2000; Seidlitz and Diener 1993; Taylor 1983).         "
"50","Indeed, after two years, the phenotypic influence of the financial risk events remained on most attitudes, but the change in the relative importance of genetic and environmental sources of individual differences did not. Thus, it appears it could very well be that genetic influences in part add stability, while environment cues change, and this process is mediated and moderated by new life events and other dispositional traits (ideology, personality, cognition, emotional regulation, etc.). Humans are supremely adaptive, and when times or circumstances change, people also change their position. Such a process would fit within an evolutionary framework that depends on particular environmental triggers to cue particular response sets: “no trigger, no variance” (e.g., Bouchard and Loehlin 2001; Hewstone, Rubin, and Willis 2002). The evidence provided here offers support to further explore this possibility and conduct longitudinal and experimental studies to measure if genetic influence dissipates or increases in a wider array of environmental conditions. A third follow‐up on these respondents is in the field, and it remains to be seen if the attitude positions and genetic and environmental sources of influence in the affected groups remain stable relative to the unaffected population after 30 years.

"51","To argue that differences in political attitudes or behaviors are not in some way influenced by one's genotype requires the assumption that while genes influence all other areas of biological and psychological functions (e.g., group affiliation, cooperation, conflict, etc.), all the mechanisms humans use to evaluate political choice are uniquely outside the sphere of genetic influence. Such a view is not tenable. However, the majority of research in this area has relied on univariate variance components. While these approaches are important and necessary, they represent only the first step in describing a population. They do not capture the influence of proximate events because such effects are often washed out by the greater population. Although there is much that remains to be understood, this study and others have begun to converge on the understanding that within broad variance components estimates of genes and environments, a great deal of action and interaction exists on a daily basis. Dynamic and changing environments have a critical role in the import of genetic influences in the short term, but in the long term, the estimates of genetic and environmental influences appear stable. The results provide reason to begin a comprehensive exploration of the influence that proximate life events, including day‐to‐day and even hour‐to‐hour life experiences, have on a wider range of political attitudes in order to unpack variance components estimates into more meaningful and useful measures of genetic liability within specific environmental contexts."
