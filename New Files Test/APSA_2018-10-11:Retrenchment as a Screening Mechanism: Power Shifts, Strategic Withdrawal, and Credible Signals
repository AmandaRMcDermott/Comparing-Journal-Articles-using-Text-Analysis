"1","Retrenchment is defined here as an irrevocable removal of a state's capabilities regarding a particular region or issue, which does not merely reflect changes in the overall distribution of power. There are several aspects of this definition that bear elaboration. First, retrenchment is distinct from decline: Retrenchment entails a reduction in a declining state's regional capabilities that exceeds its overall loss of relative power. Second, retrenchment must be costly to reverse, at least to some degree. If the retrenching state can reinsert its capabilities immediately or without cost, it does not constitute meaningful withdrawal. Furthermore, the costs of reengagement should be generally observable to other actors, such that the extent of retrenchment approximates common knowledge.3"
"2","Finally, it is important to note that although retrenchment reduces a declining state's capacity to oppose a riser's actions within a particular region, it does not necessarily inhibit the decliner's ability to forestall the riser's power gains more broadly outside that region (e.g., through trade sanctions, balancing alliances, or even preventive war). Thus, retrenchment and containment are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they are often paired as the two components of an ”offshore balancing” strategy (Layne 2012; Mearsheimer and Walt 2016).         "
"3","The literature on retrenchment can be roughly divided into two camps. “Optimists” see retrenchment as a common and effective strategy for reversing decline. Conversely, “pessimists” hold that retrenchment is rare and tends to exacerbate decline. Yet strikingly, there is little conceptual disagreement between the two sides: The literature is nearly unanimous about the content of the costs and benefits of retrenchment. Instead, the optimist–pessimist debate hinges on the magnitude of these costs and benefits relative to those of alternative strategies—prevention or continued overextension. Pessimists emphasize the loss of assets and influence that accompany retrenchment, as well as the damage to the declining state's reputation in the eyes of allies and enemies.4 Optimists minimize these costs and focus on the benefits of reallocating resources to more productive investments and more vital interests, as well as reducing the threat the declining state poses to others.5 They also emphasize the costs of prevention or overextension, likening these strategies to “suicide from fear of death” (MacDonald and Parent 2011, 15).         "
"4","However, optimists and pessimists broadly agree on the conditions under which retrenchment is likely to occur. Pessimists acknowledge that retrenchment is viable if vital interests are not at stake, the costs of preventive conflict are prohibitive, and counterbalancing by other states would be substantially reduced as a result. They simply see these conditions as rare (Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth 2013, 25–27; Copeland 2000, 40–41; Gilpin 1981, 192–93, 197, 232). Similarly, optimists concede that retrenchment is highly contingent on several factors, including the importance of the decliner's international commitments, the returns on reallocated resources, and the presence of allies that can continue to defend the decliner's regional interests (Haynes 2015; MacDonald and Parent 2011).         "
"5","Moreover, despite framing their arguments in support of retrenchment, optimists broadly agree with pessimists that retrenchment is an undesirable strategy that is adopted only as a last resort. They admit that retrenchment is a “fallback option,” implemented “reluctantly, and only after a dramatic military failure has demonstrated the impossibility of maintaining their current position by force” (Haynes 2012, 192–93) and that “retrenchment is by no means easy, but necessity is the mother of invention, and declining great powers face powerful incentives to contract” (MacDonald and Parent 2011, 9‐10). As a result, both optimists and pessimists expect that retrenchment is a strategy that declining states will adopt from a position of weakness, after decline has progressed significantly and other options are no longer available. As Kyle Haynes notes, “Policymakers are extremely loath to retrench, and will do so only after decline has generated overwhelming incentives for it” (Haynes 2012, 192; see also MacDonald and Parent 2011, 21). This is remarkably similar to the pessimist position that if a state does retrench, it “seldom retrenches or makes concessions of its own initiative,” but rather will “retrench in response to threats or military defeat” (Gilpin 1981, 194).         "
"6","In sum, both optimists and pessimists see retrenchment as a costly strategy that declining states adopt only out of desperation; the “least bad” of a menu of undesirable options. The two sides differ mainly over the magnitude of the costs and benefits of retrenchment, rather than their content."
"7","In treating retrenchment as a reactive strategy and a negative outcome, this debate has overlooked how proactive retrenchment can confer positive, informational benefits on declining states. The model below shows that retrenchment acts as a screening mechanism that allows the decliner to more confidently discern rising states' future intentions and adopt more optimal foreign policy strategies. Moreover, in contrast to the noninformational benefits of retrenchment cited in the literature, these informational benefits are greatest early in a power shift, when the decliner's subsequent foreign policy is most consequential.6"
"8","States in relative decline face a strategic conundrum. They are, on the one hand, becoming increasingly vulnerable to exploitation or revision by “hostile” rising states (i.e., those whose goals for the international order are incompatible with the decliner's).7 This gives the decliner strong incentives to contain relatively hostile risers in the present, while it is still strong, in order to forestall their power gains and mitigate its future vulnerability (Copeland 2000; Levy 1987). Yet the decliner obviously wants to avoid costly competition with relatively “benign” risers that have similar inherent goals and will largely maintain its preferred order as they become more powerful (Glaser 2010).         "
"9","The problem the decliner faces is that power shifts engender barriers to distinguishing benign from hostile risers by their behavioral signals, making it difficult to determine which type the decliner is facing. Hostile rising states have strong incentives to misrepresent themselves as being benign as long as they are still relatively weak, by mimicking the cooperative behaviors of benign risers and refraining from attempting to revise the international order in accordance with their true goals (Copeland 2000; Edelstein 2002; Mearsheimer 2001).8 Although forgoing immediate revision is inherently costly to hostile types, for many, these costs are outweighed by the prospects of avoiding opposition from the decliner and attempting revision under a more favorable distribution of power in the future. Only the most extremely hostile risers are unwilling to wait until the shift is complete, and instead reveal their types by attempting immediate revision. Many other hostile types that would reveal their revisionist goals under a static distribution of power instead misrepresent their intentions while rising.         "
"10","Because cooperative signals are likely to be sent by both benign and hostile risers, declining states tend to be highly uncertain about the future intentions of cooperative rising states. As such, decliners face an onerous choice in response to cooperative signals: either preventively oppose the rising state and risk unnecessary, costly conflict with benign risers, or reciprocate cooperation and risk abetting the rise of a hostile state that will use its power to exploit the decliner in the future."
"11","A retrenchment strategy can potentially alleviate this problem of informational scarcity that decliners often confront. By removing constraints over the riser's behavior in a particular region, the decliner offers the riser an easy opportunity to revise the regional order. This decreases (though does not eliminate) the incentive for hostile risers to misrepresent, since by doing so they would forgo this attractive, low‐cost opportunity to achieve their regional goals immediately, rather than deferring them to the end of the power shift. As such, retrenchment makes hostile risers less likely to cooperate, all else equal: Some of the hostile risers that would have misrepresented under high regional constraints instead revise immediately when those constraints are removed.9 This allows the decliner to more confidently distinguish benign risers from hostile ones by their behaviors. It can then adjust its strategy accordingly, more vigorously containing hostile types (through sanctions or balancing beyond the region of retrenchment), while maintaining greater degrees of cooperation with benign ones.10 Figure 1 summarizes the causal argument regarding the informational effects of retrenchment on the rising state's incentives to misrepresent, the credibility of its signals to the declining state, and the decliner's subsequent strategy.11"
"12","This logic is distinct from existing work on reassurance, which has focused on how risky actions such as retrenchment can signal one's own benign intentions to benign‐but‐uncertain states that might otherwise be too fearful to risk cooperation (Glaser 2010; Kydd 1997, 2000, 2005). However, as noted above, rising states are generally well informed of a declining great power's goals, which are manifested in the status quo international order. Instead, the problem during power shifts is not that benign rising states are too fearful to cooperate, but rather that they are unable to do so credibly, due to the strong incentives for hostile risers to misrepresent. The model below—the retrenchment game—shows that by increasing its own vulnerability through retrenchment, the decliner can reduce these incentives to misrepresent, thereby increasing the credibility of risers' cooperative signals. In other words, whereas existing work has focused on how to coax fearful benign states to send honest cooperative signals by alleviating their distrust, the retrenchment game identifies how to get hostile states to not send dishonest cooperative signals, by reducing their incentives to misrepresent.12"
"13","Although there are several other models of incomplete information during power shifts (Debs and Monteiro 2014; Powell 1996, 1999; Wolford, Reiter, and Carrubba 2011; Yoder, forthcoming), none examine the effects of retrenchment. The retrenchment game departs from these models by adding an initial move in which the declining state can choose to lower its share of power in the first round of the game, without directly affecting the second‐round distribution of power. The retrenchment game also departs from the existing retrenchment debate in that the decliner gets no inherent benefit from withdrawing commitments and reallocating resources to other endeavors. This assumption creates a “hard test” insofar as retrenchment occurs in the model for informational incentives only, not the litany of other widely cited benefits that are omitted. Appendix A in the supporting information (SI) discusses the robustness of the model to several other assumptions.         "
"14","Figure 2 shows the retrenchment game in extensive form. The game has two players, a declining state (DS) that is fully satisfied with the status quo order, and a rising state (RS) that is not. The first round of the game corresponds to an early phase of the power shift, in which the distribution of power favors DS. This is expressed as , RS's probability of winning a first‐round conflict. In the second round, the shift is complete, such that RS's power (P2) has increased. In each round, there is a continuously divisible asset at stake, the value of which is 1 for each actor in the second round and  in the first round, where i . The first‐round asset represents the shape of the international order in a particular region, whereas the second‐round asset represents the broader, global international order.13 The intuition behind this specification is that the rising state first gains the capacity to shape its local regional order early in the power shift, but will only subsequently gain influence over the shape of the global order later in its rise. For example, rising states such as contemporary China, the United States at the turn of the twentieth century, and the Soviet Union following WWII first gained influence in East Asia, the Western Hemisphere, and Eastern Europe, respectively, well before they had the capacity to reshape the broader global order beyond those regions. Although there is surely some overlap between regional and global orders in practice, the assumption of separate first‐ and second‐round assets merely captures the intuition that the issues at stake expand beyond the rising state's local region as it gains power.         "
"15","Extensive Form of the Retrenchment Game"
"16","Note: Expected payoffs are written with  above . Under incomplete information, is substituted for g in  expected payoffs.                     "
"17","The model also assumes for simplicity that the compatibility of the actors' goals is constant across the two rounds. In reality, of course, the compatibility of the rising and declining states' goals could differ across the regional and global orders.14 However, as long as the compatibility of the actors' goals is correlated across regional and global issues, this simplification does not affect the results reported below concerning the informational effects of retrenchment.15 This is almost certainly the case. A state that prefers a closed, mercantilist regional economic order likely prefers a similar global economic order. Likewise, a state that values democracy and human rights promotion locally is also likely to do so globally. Even territorial disputes, which are more likely to be limited to the state's own borderlands, offer a window into its broader preferences regarding norms of coercion, use of force, and peaceful dispute resolution. Indeed, American academics and policy makers have long looked to China's regional behavior in East Asia in all of these issue areas as a source of information about its future intentions for the broader global order.16 In short, information about a rising state's regional preferences provides at least some probabilistic insight into its global preferences, which is all that is required for the reported results to remain valid.         "
"18","The game begins with nature choosing the compatibility of the actors' goals, which is represented by the distance between their ideal points for the international order. The decliner's ideal point is the status quo, normalized to 0. The riser's ideal point is represented as g, the gain RS gets from revising the international order from 0 to g. Revision toward g gives RS linearly increasing positive utility and gives DS equal and opposite negative utility. Thus, the larger g is, the less compatible the actors are. Nature draws g from the uniform distribution [0, B0], such that every value of g between 0 and B0 is equally likely. RS observes the exact value of g, but DS is informed only of the range of possible values that g might take. DS's prior beliefs are therefore expressed in terms of B0. DS's posterior beliefs are expressed in terms of  and , the upper and lower bounds on the range of g that DS believes is possible after observing RS's first‐round behavior. Thus, lower values of  and  correspond to more optimistic beliefs that RS is compatible, whereas higher values correspond to more pessimistic beliefs that RS is incompatible.         "
"19","Once nature draws RS's type, DS chooses some degree of retrenchment from the region of interest, w , which is multiplied by P1 (defined above) to determine the regional distribution of power in the first round. When , DS maintains its full capacity to defend the regional order, whereas higher values of w correspond to greater withdrawal of its regional capabilities and increase the likelihood that RS will win a first‐round conflict. RS observes w and then attempts some degree of revision, , to the regional order. DS observes r and then chooses whether to oppose RS (O) or acquiesce (A).17 If DS plays A, RS's first‐round payoff is , and DS's is . If DS plays O, there is a winner‐take‐all conflict, for which RS's first‐round payoff is  and DS's is .18 C is the (uniform) cost of conflict for both actors.         "
"20","DS's first‐round action determines P2, RS's expected power in the second round. If DS plays A in the first round, RS's share of the global distribution of power in the second round becomes . However, if DS plays O in the first round, RS's prospective global power gain is reduced by a factor of , yielding a second‐round distribution of power . Thus, k represents DS's capacity to forestall RS's global power gains.         "
"21","Note that the second‐round global distribution of power is assumed to be exogenous to DS's first‐round degree of regional retrenchment. The substantive interpretation is that RS's power gains are due more to DS's degree of cooperation and to exogenous domestic factors than to the shape of the regional order. As discussed in detail in SI Appendix A, relaxing this assumption either does not affect the results reported below or actually reinforces them. Moreover, this assumption often approximates reality. Although the assets at stake in a particular region often have economic or military value, they generally pale in comparison to the internal economic development processes of the rising and declining states in determining the size of the long‐term power shifts under examination here, especially in postindustrial societies.19 For example, China's rise relative to the United States depends very little on regional issues such as the status of Taiwan or territorial claims in the South China Sea, and very much on exogenous factors such as foreign economic relations, domestic policies, and stage of development.20 Furthermore, as discussed above, there is a high degree of ambiguity in contemporary U.S. foreign policy debates about whether targeted retrenchment would enhance or diminish long‐term U.S. power, which implies that the net effect is likely not very large in either direction.         "
"22","The shape of the global order in the second round, after the power shift is complete, follows automatically from the divergence in the actors' goals and the second‐round distribution of power.21 The second‐round payoffs are  for RS and  for DS. The intuition behind this specification is that RS reveals its goals once the power shift is complete, leaving both actors completely informed and resulting in a peaceful negotiated outcome in accordance with the distribution of power. This greatly simplifies the actors' payoffs while retaining the key features of the strategic situation: DS suffers in the future if it allows highly incompatible risers to gain power, but loses little by accommodating compatible ones. The model's results are robust to relaxation of this assumption to allow the possibility of second‐round conflict (see SI Appendix A).         "
"23","This section presents the equilibria of the retrenchment game under incomplete information. In order to clarify how and under what conditions retrenchment affects a declining state's payoffs, the equilibria of a baseline version of the model in which retrenchment is not an option are presented first (i.e., w is fixed to 1).22 This baseline model highlights the dilemma facing uncertain declining states and shows that under large power shifts in the absence of retrenchment, preventive conflict occurs even with benign risers. The full model then shows how retrenchment alleviates the decliner's dilemma by reducing its uncertainty, allowing it to more efficiently identify hostile risers while avoiding conflict with benign ones. It also identifies conditions under which the informational benefits of retrenchment are greatest.         "
"24","Before proceeding with the incomplete‐information results, it is necessary to establish a formal definition that is derived from the complete‐information model, which is presented in SI Appendix B. When RS is sufficiently compatible (i.e., when g is below a particular threshold, ), a completely informed DS is willing to acquiesce to revision to RS's ideal point. Let RS be defined as a benign type when  and a hostile type when .         "
"25","This section presents the equilibria of the baseline model in which DS does not have the option to retrench. This game contains two equilibria, the “appeasement equilibrium,” which occurs under relatively small projected power shifts, and the “conflict equilibrium,” which occurs under relatively large shifts. These two equilibria contain four equilibrium strategy profiles, which are shown in Figure 3 in terms of the size of the power shift, , and RS's degree of incompatibility, g.23 The “cooperation” and “misrepresentation” profiles occur in the appeasement equilibrium, the “prevention” profile occurs in the conflict equilibrium, and the “revision” occurs in each. Proofs and the equations from which thresholds , , and  (defined below) are derived are presented in Propositions 2–4 of SI Appendix B.            "
"26","The appeasement equilibrium occurs when  is below a certain threshold, . Under this condition, the power shift is small enough that DS is willing to accept some degree of revision, , without opposing. DS is willing to make such concessions under a small projected power shift () because it is not particularly vulnerable to future revision by RS, and thus has little incentive to act preventively. Let  be the threshold of revision above which DS opposes and below which it acquiesces. Any revision  is defined as a cooperative signal, and any revision  is a noncooperative signal. Thus, under a small power shift, benign rising states can avoid opposition by sending cooperative signals, and the declining state initiates conflict only with truly hostile risers that have attempted large revisions.               "
"27","The cooperation profile occurs when , that is, when RS is sufficiently compatible that revision to its ideal point is acceptable to DS. Thus, RS faces no trade‐off in the cooperation profile: It revises to its ideal point (), and DS acquiesces. This implies that DS acquires complete information from RS's signal in the cooperation profile (), since r always equals g when .                  "
"28","Cooperation Profile.When is below a certain threshold, , and g is below a particular threshold, , RS revises to its ideal point and DS acquiesces. DS fully updates its beliefs such that .                     "
"29","Like the cooperation profile, the misrepresentation profile occurs when the power shift is relatively small (), such that DS would fully acquiesce to small first‐round revisions (). But whereas the cooperation profile occurs when RS is highly compatible (), the misrepresentation profile occurs when RS is moderately incompatible (). Here,  is the threshold of incompatibility above which RS prefers to attempt revision to its ideal point and incur full opposition, rather than revising short of g to  and incurring no opposition. In the misrepresentation profile, revision to RS's ideal point would be unacceptable to DS and would result in full opposition. Yet this threat of opposition deters RS from attempting revision to its ideal point. RS is not sufficiently dissatisfied with the status quo that it is willing to incur opposition and sacrifice future power gains for a chance to achieve its regional goals immediately. Instead, RS misrepresents its true goals by playing , the largest revision that induces DS to acquiesce. In response to , DS updates its beliefs that  and , respectively, constitute the highest and lowest possible values of g , .                  "
"30","Misrepresentation Profile.When and , RS plays and DS acquiesces. DS partially updates its beliefs such that and .                     "
"31","Finally, in the revision profile, which occurs when , the outcome is first‐round conflict: RS revises to its ideal point and DS opposes.  therefore fully reveals RS's ideal point, yielding posterior beliefs  for DS.               "
"32","Why would a rising state ever precipitate costly conflict, instead of cooperating in the present and bargaining under a more favorable distribution of power in the future? This occurs because it is costly for a hostile riser to delay revision. Immediate revision, if successful, gives the riser the benefit of realizing its regional goals for the duration of the power shift, whereas by misrepresenting, it forgoes those short‐term benefits. The trade‐off, of course, is that immediate revision incurs full opposition from DS, which mitigates the riser's future power gains and reduces its capacity to revise the global order in the future. When , RS is sufficiently dissatisfied with the status quo that the chance to achieve its regional goals immediately outweighs the cost of conflict and its reduced future bargaining leverage over the broader global order.                  "
"33","Revision Profile.At all values of , when g is above a particular threshold,, RS revises to its ideal point and DS opposes. DS fully updates its beliefs such that .                     "
"34","Under a large projected power shift (), DS will become sufficiently vulnerable in the future that it is unwilling to fully acquiesce to any degree of revision (i.e., ). Instead, DS fully opposes any revision  and adopts a “hedging” strategy in response to  in which it imposes some degree of opposition on RS. In formal terms, DS randomly mixes between O with probability π ∈ [0,1], and A with probability . In other words, with a large power shift in the absence of retrenchment, conflict is unavoidable, even with truly benign rising states. This result is driven by the specter of decline, combined with RS's incentives to misrepresent. With a sufficiently large projected power shift, hostile risers have strong incentives to misrepresent their intentions in the present, leaving the decliner with significant uncertainty even in response to cooperative signals. Thus, even if RS attempts no revision, DS's uncertainty and future vulnerability are too great for it to fully acquiesce to RS's power gains under a large projected power shift.               "
"35","As in the appeasement equilibrium, there is a threshold of g, , above which the revision profile occurs: RS attempts immediate revision to its ideal point () and incurs full opposition. However, when , the prevention profile occurs: RS is compatible enough that it prefers to play  and incur limited containment from DS, rather than attempt revision to its ideal point and incur full opposition (i.e., ). Thus, in the prevention profile, RS is deterred from revising to its ideal point by the credible threat that DS would respond by escalating from its moderate hedging strategy to full opposition, and instead cooperates by playing .               "
"36","DS's mixed strategy is supported when its posterior beliefs in response to  make it indifferent between opposing and acquiescing. Let  be the value of  that makes DS indifferent between O and A when . Thus, since , DS must adopt a degree of opposition, , that makes . As in the misrepresentation profile, a subset of hostile risers () pool with benign risers (), such that DS updates its beliefs in response to  but retains some uncertainty about RS's type.                  "
"37","Prevention Profile.When , . In this case, when , RS plays and DS mixes between O with probability , and A with probability must take on a value that makes , where is the value of that makes DS indifferent between O and A when partially updates its beliefs such that and .                     "
"38","The previous section showed that in the absence of retrenchment, the declining state's combination of uncertainty and future vulnerability produces preventive conflict under large power shifts, even with truly benign rising states. This section shows that giving the declining state the option to retrench can allow the decliner to avoid such conflict with benign risers, while more vigorously opposing hostile ones. Specifically, when the degree of retrenchment is sufficiently high, DS accommodates cooperative risers even under relatively large power shifts () that otherwise would have produced preventive conflict.24 This is manifested in Figure 4 by the expansion of the appeasement equilibrium at the expense of the conflict equilibrium as DS's degree of retrenchment increases.25 Put differently, retrenchment increases the size of the power shift required to induce preventive conflict. Thus, when DS's degree of retrenchment, w, exceeds a particular threshold,  (defined in Proposition 2 of SI Appendix B), conflict no longer occurs with cooperative risers that are potentially benign. Instead, DS opposes only truly hostile rising states that have actually attempted revision.               "
"39","Effect of Retrenchment.When DS has played , the appeasement equilibrium occurs instead of the prevention equilibrium in the post‐retrenchment subgame.                  "
"40","This result occurs primarily because retrenchment increases DS's confidence that cooperative risers that attempt little or no revision are truly benign. Hostile risers face countervailing incentives about whether to attempt revision to the regional order in the first round. On one hand, immediate revision will reveal the riser's hostile intentions, thereby incurring general (extra‐regional) opposition from the declining state. Along with an immediate cost (C), this opposition reduces the riser's overall power gains, and thus its future capacity to revise the broader global order. This is manifested in the model as a reduction in the riser's second‐round power level from  to . Yet on the other hand, hostile risers get inherent benefits from attempting revision because, if successful, they get to enjoy their preferred regional order immediately, instead of continuing to endure an objectionable status quo order for the duration of the power shift.            "
"41","Retrenchment increases incentives for hostile rising states to reveal their future intentions by attempting immediate regional revision, rather than misrepresenting their intentions by behaving cooperatively. In the absence of retrenchment, the declining state's regional capabilities reduce the likelihood that revision would be successful. Combined with the costly opposition that revision would incur, this gives even hostile risers strong incentives to delay revision until they are more powerful. However, by withdrawing its regional capabilities, the decliner removes constraints over the riser's regional behavior, thereby reducing incentives for hostile types to misrepresent. Because the decliner's retrenchment allows the riser to achieve immediate regional revision at lower cost and higher probability of success, it makes revision more attractive for hostile types relative to cooperation. Put differently, retrenchment raises the opportunity cost that hostile risers face from misrepresenting: They would be giving up an easy opportunity to achieve their regional goals immediately, instead of forgoing those goals for the duration of the power shift. Although not all hostile risers will take the bait—for some, the costs of incurring general containment might still outweigh the opportunity for immediate regional revision—retrenchment makes it less likely that hostile risers will misrepresent, all else equal.               "
"42","By reducing the incentive for hostile risers to misrepresent, retrenchment increases the credibility of cooperative behavior as a signal of benign intentions, as shown in Figure 5. In contrast to hostile types, benign rising states have no incentive to attempt revision because they are already quite satisfied with the status quo international order. Thus, they always cooperate, even under low constraints. As the decliner's retrenchment makes hostile types more likely to abandon cooperation in favor of immediate revision, it becomes increasingly likely that any riser that sends cooperative signals is truly benign. Retrenchment therefore simultaneously induces hostile types to reveal their true intentions, while allowing the decliner to confidently update its beliefs in response to cooperative signals. In essence, the riser's behavior under low constraints in the region of retrenchment gives the decliner a preview of how the riser will behave on similar issues elsewhere in the future, as the power shift progresses and constraints over the riser decrease more generally.               "
"43","The credibility of a rising state's cooperative signals increases with the declining state's degree of retrenchment."
"44","These effects of retrenchment yield two additional hypotheses. First, retrenchment reduces the decliner's incentive for preventive containment, such that its degree of general opposition toward cooperative risers is lower than it would be in the absence of retrenchment. As retrenchment increases the credibility of cooperative signals, the declining state becomes less inclined to impose extra‐regional containment on risers that have exhibited cooperative behavior, which includes all truly benign types. Thus, the information yielded by retrenchment allows the decliner to avoid costly competition with benign risers.               "
"45","Finally, Figure 6 shows that retrenchment also allows the declining state to reduce its vulnerability to revision by hostile risers in the future. As retrenchment induces a greater proportion of hostile risers to reveal their intentions through regional revision, the declining state becomes more likely to employ broad measures—such as bilateral economic sanctions, global institutional constraints, and extra‐regional balancing—to contain their global power gains. Moreover, the proportion of hostile risers that continue to misrepresent despite the removal of constraints will be smaller, and more compatible on average, than in the absence of retrenchment. Thus, a greater degree of retrenchment implies that hostile risers are more likely to be contained, and those that are not will attempt less revision of the global order in the future.               "
"46","The probability that the declining state will fully oppose hostile rising states (beyond the region of retrenchment) increases with its degree of retrenchment. Risers that are not opposed are more compatible, on average, under a higher degree of retrenchment."
"47","This section discusses how the parameters of the model—the size of the projected power shift, the timing of retrenchment, and the short‐term value of the regional order—affect DS's equilibrium degree of retrenchment, W, which is the value of w that maximizes Equation (20) in Proposition 5 of SI Appendix B. The hypotheses below are coupled with empirical illustrations that establish their plausibility and imply variation in the informational benefits of retrenchment. These illustrations are not, of course, intended to convincingly demonstrate empirical validity, which would require full detailed case studies that are not possible in an article of this length.            "
"48","Below a certain threshold (defined in note 24), the informational benefits of retrenchment increase with the size of the power shift, . This is because power shifts simultaneously decrease the availability of information about the rising state's future intentions, and increase the value of that information to the decliner. As discussed above, power shifts increase the incentives for hostile risers to misrepresent their revisionist goals by behaving cooperatively in the present, when they are relatively weak. This allows them to avoid costly opposition from the decliner that would jeopardize their future power gains. This incentive to misrepresent, in turn, decreases the credibility of cooperative signals because such behavior is more likely to be exhibited by hostile risers. Larger power shifts therefore increase the decliner's uncertainty about the future intentions of cooperative rising states. Furthermore, the consequences of uncertainty also become more severe as the projected power shift increases because the decliner becomes more vulnerable to revision by hostile risers in the future. Information that allows the decliner to distinguish hostile types from benign ones therefore becomes more valuable as the projected power shift increases. In contrast, under a small power shift the decliner's future vulnerability is low, and it faces little risk from adopting a cooperative “wait‐and‐see” approach even given high uncertainty about the riser's intentions.                  "
"49","For example, as the Soviet Union's projected power trajectory increased with its battlefield victories in the later years of WWII, British and American policy makers placed increasing value on obtaining information about postwar Soviet intentions. This, among other developments, gave the Western Allies significant incentive to shift away from an initial strategy of contesting postwar Soviet control of Eastern Europe, and to instead concede the region to the Soviet sphere (Davis 1974, chap. 4).26 Doing so allowed U.S. leaders to observe Soviet behavior in Eastern Europe under low constraints, yielding considerable informational benefits. The Soviets promptly established an illiberal sphere at odds with liberal U.S. preferences, allowing American policy makers to form accurate beliefs about Soviet intentions and adopt a highly effective strategy of containment before the Soviet rise had progressed very far.27"
"50","The U.S.‐Soviet example also highlights the value of removing constraints over a rising state early in a power shift. The model shows that the informational benefits of retrenchment decrease as the power shift progresses over time (represented by an increase in P1, holding P2 constant). Earlier retrenchment is more valuable to the declining state because the information it provides allows the decliner to oppose hostile risers before they have amassed much power, thereby forestalling their future power gains. In contrast, later retrenchment carries less potential benefit because there is less of a remaining power shift for the decliner to forestall.                  "
"51","In addition to the U.S.‐Soviet example above, the informational benefits of early retrenchment are illustrated by British retrenchment from the Western Hemisphere in the 1890s, which ceded control of the regional order to the rising United States. Contrary to initial British expectations, the United States largely maintained, and even expanded, Britain's preferred liberal economic order in Latin America, allowing British leaders to positively update their beliefs about broader American intentions. This facilitated Anglo‐American rapprochement and the highly beneficial “special relationship” early in the power shift, decades before the United States' rise was complete.28"
"52","The retrenchment game also shows that the informational benefits of retrenchment depend on , the value of the regional order to the rising state.29 This result is straightforward. If the regional order is of low immediate value to the riser, then the benefit to hostile types of immediate regional revision will not be worth the trade‐off of incurring general containment from the decliner, which would reduce the riser's future power gains and hence its capacity to achieve revision elsewhere. Continued cooperation, even under low immediate constraints, would therefore not be a very costly signal and would fail to distinguish benign from hostile types. Thus, as the region becomes more valuable to the riser, the informational benefits of retrenchment increase.30                                    "
"53","Finally, the model shows that the declining state faces a noninformational trade‐off in exchange for the informational gains from retrenchment. By removing constraints over the riser's immediate behavior and inducing hostile types to attempt revision, the declining state risks sacrificing its preferred regional order in the present. The net benefits of retrenchment (i.e., the balance of informational and noninformational trade‐offs) are therefore greater in a region that is of relatively low short‐term value to the decliner (low ). Conversely, declining states will be reluctant to withdraw their power from regions they value highly.                  "
"54","Britain's contrasting foreign policies toward two rising states in the 1890s, Germany and the United States, nicely illustrate these hypotheses. The regional order in the Western Hemisphere, although valuable to Britain, was far more  significant to the United States. Thus, Britain was willing to concede the region to the United States in order to consolidate its power elsewhere, and subsequent U.S. cooperation to maintain the liberal regional order was a credible signal that American goals were largely compatible with Britain's. In contrast, because Britain and Germany shared a home region, Britain was unwilling to concede the European order to Germany and instead sought to maintain a regional balance of power between Germany and its continental rivals, Russia and France. Conversely, the concessions Britain did make, in Africa and East Asia, were of relatively low value to Germany. Thus, Germany's initial support of a liberal “open door” economic order in Asia was seen as noncredible by most British statesmen, and British uncertainty about German intentions persisted into the next decade.31"
"55","This article introduces a novel theoretical insight to the retrenchment debate. Both optimists and pessimists regarding the efficacy of retrenchment have heretofore considered it a “last resort” strategy for a declining state to reduce its foreign commitments after it has already lost the power to sustain them. Both sides in the debate agree about the content of the costs and benefits of retrenchment, and simply disagree about their relative magnitudes."
"56","In contrast, the retrenchment game suggests that retrenchment early in a power shift can benefit a declining state for an entirely different (though not mutually exclusive) reason: By removing constraints over a rising state's behavior in a particular region, retrenchment makes that behavior more informative as a signal of the riser's future intentions elsewhere. That information, in turn, allows the declining state to adopt a more optimal strategy toward the riser, increasing its degree of cooperation with benign rising states, while more effectively opposing the rise of hostile types."
"57","These findings have substantial implications for contemporary U.S. foreign policy, particularly regarding a rising China. First, they identify conditions under which China's cooperative signals are more or less credible. Over the course of China's rise, the United States has adopted a “hedging” strategy that imposes constraints over China's behavior through a combination of deterrent threats and positive inducements.32 This strategy has been quite effective in achieving its intended purpose of inducing China to cooperate under the rule of the U.S.‐led liberal order in the short term. However, the argument in this article implies that by imposing high constraints over a rising China, the United States has increased China's incentives to misrepresent any hostile intentions, and thus reduced the credibility of China's cooperation as a signal of its long‐term intentions. Although this effect has been recognized by some (e.g., Goldstein 2005), much of the academic and policy literature on U.S.–China relations has taken China's cooperative behavior under high constraints at face value.33"
"58","Conversely, this article suggests that China's cooperation is more credible on issues where U.S. influence is low and China's behavior is relatively unconstrained. This implies that there may be a previously unrecognized silver lining to two recent U.S. foreign policy choices that have been roundly derided by U.S.–China experts: failure to join the China‐led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or to prevent U.S. allies from doing so in 2015, and the recent U.S. withdrawal from its own initiative, the Trans‐Pacific Partnership. Although expert consensus is that these policy outcomes are clearly harmful to U.S. interests, they also open up space for China to assume a leadership role regarding regional economic governance in an institutional setting where U.S. power is not immediately present (e.g., Babones 2016; Parameswaran 2016). The argument here suggests that how China shapes regional institutions under relatively low constraints is more informative of its long‐term preferences for the broader, global international economic order than its previous cooperation within U.S.‐led institutions has been.         "
"59","Second, this article identifies informational benefits of retrenchment that are likely novel to policy makers, as evidenced by the absence of informational considerations in the academic or policy literature on retrenchment. The magnitude of this informational incentive for retrenchment in U.S.–China relations—like the magnitude of noninformational incentives—is difficult to measure and requires extensive empirical work. Yet given the ambiguity about the net costs and benefits of American retrenchment manifested in the current retrenchment debate, even relatively small informational incentives for retrenchment vis‐à‐vis China could potentially alter the U.S. calculus.         "
"60","This is particularly true regarding issues that both the model and the existing literature suggest are strong candidates for U.S. retrenchment, such as the maritime disputes in the South China Sea (SCS) and the status of Taiwan (e.g., Glaser 2015). Each of these issues is significantly more valuable to China (which considers them “core national interests”) than to the United States, which is when the informational benefits of retrenchment are greatest. Of course, Taiwan and the SCS still have significant strategic value to the United States, which may outweigh the net informational and material benefits of withdrawal. This is ultimately an empirical question. Answering it will require that the informational effects of retrenchment be included alongside noninformational variables in subsequent work on retrenchment in U.S. foreign policy.         "
