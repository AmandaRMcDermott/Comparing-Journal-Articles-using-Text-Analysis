"1","What does it mean for utility functions to be Gaussian or quadratic? Figure 1 plots a pair of corresponding spatial utility functions as assumed by NOMINATE's Gaussian utility model and IDEAL's quadratic utility model.2 The functions correspond to each other in the sense that they both imply Euclidean preferences with the same ideal point. The curves have been further harmonized to yield similar utility levels for outcome locations in the neighborhood of the ideal point. First, note that the two functions are very similar in the region where both functions are concave. In fact, the quadratic utility function is the first‐order approximation of the Gaussian utility function, a relationship that we exploit in our test of utility functions.            "
"2","NOMINATE and IDEAL Utility Functions"
"3","Note: Lines show the deterministic utility functions assumed by NOMINATE (solid line) and IDEAL (dotted line) for a legislator with an ideal point of 0.                        "
"4","The key differences between the two distributions are seen in the tails of the plotted curves. In the tails, the marginal loss in utility is decreasing under Gaussian utility, while it is increasing at an increasing rate under quadratic utility. Thus, under quadratic utility, legislators are increasingly more disposed to support the closer alternative the farther away both the bill and status quo are from their ideal points. In contrast, the convex nature of the tails in the Gaussian utility function implies that as the bill and status quo are moved sufficiently far from the legislator's ideal points, the utility differences between the bill and status quo are decreasing."
"5","Stated more informally, consider the example of a legislator who is voting on a bill authorizing the construction of a number of F‐22 fighters. The legislator has an ideal point of building 50 new fighters, while the status quo and an amendment propose the construction of 1,000 and 998 fighters, respectively—numbers that are both far from the legislator's bliss point. Gaussian utility implies the legislator will be almost indifferent between the bill and the alternative, while quadratic utility implies that the legislator will perceive an enormous difference—more than, say, if the amendment were moving from a status quo of 60 fighters to 58."
"6","As noted in the first section, if one does not want to take our one‐dimensional random utility model literally, the probabilistic choice function that the combination of F and assumed independent stochastic choice shocks can be taken as primitive. In terms of the F‐22 example, a legislator with Gaussian preferences wishing to build 50 new fighters could have a greater probability of choosing to build 1, 000 over 998 fighters than she does of choosing to build 60 over 58, whereas for a similar legislator with quadratic preferences, the probability of choosing 60 over 58 must exceed the probability of choosing 1, 000 over 998. As shown in Figure 1, in the limit as two alternatives are moved away from the legislator's ideal point, the probability of choosing the closer alternative grows monotonically to one under quadratic preferences, but not under Gaussian preferences. Under Gaussian preferences, in the limit as the alternatives move away from a legislator's ideal point, her probability of choosing the closer alternative goes to one‐half. Whether the nonmonotonicity shown in Figure 1 is manifest over the range of alternatives available to the legislators or not, it is the voting behavior of legislators located far from the alternatives that we expect to be most affected by the choice of F.            "
"7","In developing NOMINATE, Poole and Rosenthal chose the Gaussian deterministic utility function for substantive reasons. Their belief was “that political actors (were) relatively insensitive to small changes in distance from their ideal points; at somewhat greater distances, utility should change sharply; finally, at very great distances, changes in distance should have little effect on utility” (1983, 14). Later work in psychology provided independent support for the Gaussian utility model (Poole 2005). In particular, the psychological experiments of Shepard (1986), Nosofsky (1986), and Ennis (1988) that examined how people judged similarity between stimuli such as light and sound intensity revealed that these judgments appeared to use an exponential response function (Shepard 1987). More specifically, let A represent a distance measure between two different stimuli, where  if the two stimuli are identical. Shepard found that given two competing stimuli with distance A, individuals tend to report the distance  instead, where k is a scaling constant. When perceptual error is added to the Shepard model, the expected value of this response function becomes Gaussian—that is, .            "
"8","The Shepard–Nosofsky–Ennis model thus implies Gaussian utility functions in spatial models of voting, because the concept of preference can be reduced to the psychological notion of comparing similarities. In spatial models of voting, legislators with ideal point  use that standard to judge other legislative stimuli, . The distances between the ideal point and the stimuli are then perceived as , where A is the distance measure between the ideal point and stimulus. Spatial models of voting can therefore be regarded as being consistent with the Shepard–Nosofsky–Ennis similarity model.            "
"9","In this experimental work that lends empirical support to the exponential response function, the characteristics of the stimuli are observable and fixed by the experimenter. In our setting, the characteristics of the alternatives (the stimuli) are unknown latent quantities to be estimated. Because both the nature of the response function (as parameterized in our model by F) and values assigned by the stimuli must be inferred, there is considerably more freedom in our setting to fit any response function to the observed data by adjusting the values of alternatives being voted upon (as well as the locations of legislators' ideal points). So much so that one might suppose that there would be very little ability to empirically discriminate between a model which fixed F to be Gaussian and one which fixed F to be quadratic. However, as we show later, it is possible to discriminate between these two alternative models in typical empirical settings.            "
"10","In this section, we begin with an overview of the quadratic and Gaussian choice utility models in one dimension. We then describe our model, which estimates an additional parameter α that allows convex combinations of the two utility models. Let p denote the number of legislators (), and q denote the number of roll‐call votes (), and  represent the two possible choices on each vote, yea and nay. Let legislator i's ideal point be represented by , and let  and  represent the yea and nay locations of roll‐call j. Then in the quadratic utility model, the utility that legislator i derives from voting yea on roll‐call j is:               "
"11","In the Gaussian utility model, given the signal to noise parameter β and weight w (which is fixed to w = 0.5), the corresponding yea and nay utilities for legislator i on vote j are:               "
"12","Note that we can take the first‐order exponential expansion of the utility from a yea vote under Gaussian utility as:               "
"13","Hence, the quadratic utility function is a first‐order approximation of the Gaussian utility function."
"14","Under both models, the difference between the two errors is assumed to have a standard normal distribution, that is, . This leads to the standard probit formulation of the probability that legislator i votes yea on the jth roll call as:               "
"15","The mixture model we estimate is similar to the two models presented here, with the exception of an additional α parameter to be estimated that is permitted to vary from 0 to 1. We take the exponential expansion of the Gaussian utility function, break out the first‐order approximation from the remainder, and estimate the following:               "
"16","Note the close relationship between the utilities from the mixture model presented here compared to the quadratic and Gaussian utilities presented earlier. When , the utility function of the mixture model is identical to the Gaussian model. When , the utility function of the mixture model is identical to the quadratic model with the exception of a constant, which disappears in the vote‐choice probability function when the yea and nay utilities are subtracted from one another. Hence, estimation of α allows for a convex combination of quadratic and Gaussian utilities to be used in scaling the data, and we set the prior accordingly as . α close to zero or one can be interpreted as evidence supporting the quadratic or Gaussian utility functions, respectively. Intermediate values of α imply a hybrid choice function in which properties of both models are combined. Note that our prior rules out values of α outside of the unit interval. We do this because we are seeking to discriminate between the two leading models and thus treat those models as polar. We also do this because if we allow α outside of the unit interval, we are not imposing the more fundamental restriction that utility is decreasing in the distance between the legislator and the alternative.3"
"17","Given the p x q matrix of observed votes V, Bayesian inference for the legislators' ideal points, bill parameters, and auxiliary parameters proceeds by simulating the posterior density given by               "
"18","The likelihood is given by:               "
"19","In this section, we present three sets of empirical results. We begin with Monte Carlo tests that validate our estimator's ability to distinguish between Gaussian and quadratic forms of utility. These results suggest that the estimator is able to distinguish between different utility functions as expected. We apply our estimator to the 109th Senate and find strong evidence in support of a Gaussian utility function. We then proceed to apply the estimator to all U.S. Congresses. In the vast majority of cases, we continue to find strong evidence of a Gaussian utility function consistent with the results of the 109th Senate."
"20","Our primary means of validating the estimator is through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. We generated two separate roll‐call matrices with 100 legislators and 500 roll calls using Gaussian and quadratic utility functions.6 Recall that α values of 0 are consistent with quadratic utility while α values of 1 are consistent with Gaussian utility. We then applied the mixture estimator to the two data sets over 60,000 iterations, discarding the first 10,000 as a burn‐in and thinning every 10th iteration. Posterior distributions from both data sets are shown in Figure 2. When choice data generated under the assumption of Gaussian utility were scaled, α had a posterior mean of 0.985 and a posterior standard deviation of 0.014. When the quadratic data were scaled, α had a posterior mean of 0.054 and a posterior standard deviation of 0.043. These results are fully consistent with the theoretical expectations of the two models, providing evidence that our estimator is able to distinguish data from two similar but distinct utility functions.7"
"21","Posterior Distributions of the Alpha Parameter"
"22","Note: Distributions are estimated alpha parameters from two Monte Carlo data sets of 100 legislators and 500 roll calls. The distribution to the right is estimated from data generated from Gaussian utility, while the distribution to the left is estimated from data generated using quadratic utility.                        "
"23","We then applied the estimator to the 109th Senate (2005–2007), with some additional changes designed to bias our results toward the quadratic utility model as favorably as possible. Our concern here is ensuring that the results estimated by our Markov Chain have reached convergence. We began our estimation by constraining  throughout the estimation and generating posterior samples of both legislator coordinates and bill parameters following convergence. We then take these posterior means as the start values of our estimation and start α at 0. The idea here is to start the estimation at the parameters that are most favorable to obtaining low values of α; if the α parameter subsequently moves to higher levels, then we can be reasonably sure that the global maximum truly does converge at higher levels of α.            "
"24","Our results for the 109th Senate are summarized in the posterior density and trace plots of α in Figure 3. The posterior plot shown for the 109th Senate is very similar to the plot shown for the Gaussian utility Monte Carlo, with a posterior mean of 0.996 and a posterior standard deviation of 0.004 for α. The trace plot suggests rapid convergence to high values of α, despite the quadratic utility‐biased starting values used to begin the simulation. These high values persist throughout almost all of the samples of α drawn. It should be emphasized that while the results from our mixture model suggest that choice probabilities are maximized using a Gaussian utility model, they do not imply that the ideal points recovered via quadratic utility are “wrong.” The ideal points recovered from the quadratic model and mixture model do correlate highly, at 0.950. The correlation for the Gaussian model with the mixture model is slightly higher, at 0.958, suggesting that the pattern of errors is more consistent with Gaussian than with quadratic utility.            "
"25","Posterior and Trace Plot of α: 109th Senate"
"26","Note: The posterior plot is consistent with Gaussian utility posterior from Monte Carlo simulation. Despite using start values biased toward low values of alpha, the trace plot suggests steady state convergence at much higher levels. α = 1 is consistent with Gaussian utility while α = 0 is consistent with quadratic utility.                        "
"27","These results naturally lead to the question of how α has varied across legislatures over time and whether the results of the 109th Senate are exceptional or common across legislatures. We attempt to answer this question by applying the mixture estimator to every U.S. Senate and House roll‐call matrix and obtaining estimates of their α parameters.8 Figure 4 summarizes these results, plotting the posterior means and empirical 95% credible intervals of α for the U.S. House and Senate. In general, these results suggest that high values of α, consistent with Gaussian utility, are pervasive throughout most U.S. Congresses. The major exception appears to be the early Congresses—we hypothesize that this is mainly due to the limited amount of information available for those Congresses due to the lower numbers of legislators and bills. The hypothesis draws support from the observation that Gaussian utility is strongly supported, starting with the 20th House, for the House of Representatives, which is typically at least four times the size of the Senate. We plot the posterior densities of two early Congresses—the 5th Senate (1797–99) and the 6th House (1799–1801)—in Figure 5. These densities can be distributed approximately normal, as in the case of the 6th House, but they can also be skewed, as in the case of the 5th Senate. In the House, which has many more legislators than the Senate, the Gaussian model is always strongly supported after the 20th Congress (1827–29). A similar pattern for the Senate kicks in only at the 80th Congress (1947–49). The precision of our estimates also appears to be attributable to the quantity of data available in each estimate. Table 1 shows the results of a simple OLS regression where the dependent variable is the length of the 95% credible intervals for each Congress, and the independent variables are the number of legislators, the number of roll calls, and their interaction. In both cases, precision of the estimates increases with both the number of legislators and the number of votes.            "
"28","Estimates of α Over Time: U.S. House and Senate"
"29","Note: Points represent the posterior mean of the α draws for each Congress. The lines show the range of the empirical 95% credible intervals of α. α = 1 is consistent with Gaussian utility while α = 0 is consistent with quadratic utility.                        "
"30","Posterior Distribution of α: 6th House and 5th Senate"
"31","Note: The 6th House had 112 legislators voting on 95 bills, leading to a mean α of 0.607 and a standard deviation of 0.170. The 5th Senate had 43 legislators voting on 194 bills, leading to a mean α of 0.215 and a standard deviation of 0.166.                        "
"32","While these results suggest that it can be difficult to distinguish between quadratic and Gaussian utilities in smaller legislatures, judicial settings such as courts may provide a substantively important venue to further evaluate assumptions about utility functions. We applied the mixture estimator to U.S. Supreme Court decisions from 1953 to 2008, a roll‐call matrix that includes 31 different justices and 4,333 decisions.9 Our results for the Supreme Court are consistent with Gaussian utility, with a posterior mean of 0.998 for α and a posterior standard deviation of 0.002.10"
"33","Finally, we attempted to determine whether our estimates of a Gaussian α are unique to the U.S. legislature. Given the psychological foundations of the Gaussian utility function in the Shepard–Ennis–Nosofsky stimulus response model, we hypothesize Gaussian utility is likely prevalent in choice data in general. To test this hypothesis, we conducted the same estimation for four different sources of choice data: the U.S. Supreme Court, the French Fourth Republic, the European Parliament, and the California legislature. Our results, summarized in Table 2, are consistent with our hypothesis that choice data outside the U.S. legislative context also appear to fit well with Gaussian utility functions.            "
"34","The mixture model presented in the previous section is predominantly a story of choices at the extremes—that is, how likely are legislators to select the closer alternative when both the bill and the status quo are situated far from their ideal point? Separate but related to this is the question of whether extremists have utility functions that are distinctly different from those of moderates. In the context of the Gaussian utility model, this suggests that the weight parameter w is not constant as assumed by NOMINATE, but instead it varies across legislators. More intense preferences are associated with utility functions with lower variance and larger weight parameters. In particular, we are interested in the possibility that the deterministic component of the utility functions of extremists exhibits greater intensity than that of moderates.            "
"35","The hypothesis that the choice behavior of extremists may differ systematically from that of moderates is perhaps most forcefully developed in social psychology in the social judgment theory of Sherif and Hovland (1961) and Keisler, Collins, and Miller (1969). Under this theory, behavior is related to “involvements”—that is, more politically involved people may have different utility functions. Moreover, operationally, Sherif, Sherif, and Nebergall (1965) define involvement as membership in a group with a position on an issue. They postulate that individuals will partition the dimension into the three latitudes of acceptance, rejection, and noncommitment. The theory furthermore claims that involvement increases the latitude of rejection. To translate to our model, we hypothesize that extremists will have more sharply peaked utility functions than moderates—that is, a higher individual weight parameter . A series of empirical studies (Hovland, Harvey, and Sherif 1957; Sherif 1952; Sherif, Sherif, and Nebergall 1965) all developed the finding that “those with extreme positions use broader categories for rejection than for acceptance and that their category for rejection is wider than the rejection category of more moderate subjects” (Keisler, Collins, and Miller 1969, 252).            "
"36","To observe the substantive impact of such a difference, consider a situation where Justices Kennedy and Scalia are deciding between voting with () or dissenting () from a majority opinion, as depicted in Figure 6. The locations of the majority and dissenting opinions are set at 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. The deterministic components of Kennedy's and Scalia's Gaussian utility functions are depicted in dotted lines, centered on their respective ideal points of 0.2 and 0.8. In the case of the utilities depicted with dotted lines, the standard deviation of the Gaussian utility function for both Kennedy and Scalia is set at 0.3. We also show the utility function of a counterfactual “high‐intensity” Scalia on a solid line, whose ideal point is still located at 0.8, but has a utility function with noticeably smaller variance.            "
"37","Utility of Functions of Kennedy and Two Scalias"
"38","Note: Kennedy's ideal point is set at 0.2, while both Scalias' ideal points are set at 0.8. While both the low‐ and high‐variance Scalias prefer to dissent, the low‐variance Scalia experiences a much higher utility difference between voting with the majority and dissenting and is thus much less likely to err.                        "
"39","In the absence of stochastic utility, each justice joins the opinion closest to his ideal point—Kennedy is predicted to join in the majority, while both the low‐ and high‐intensity Scalias are predicted to join the dissenting opinion. But note that in the presence of random shocks to utility, the justices have different propensities to cast votes that do not conform to this expectation. Both Kennedy and the low‐intensity Scalia have the same probability of voting for the alternative that is farther from their ideal point, as their deterministic utility differences between the majority opinion and dissent are identical. However, the high‐intensity Scalia obtains much more utility from choosing to dissent than the low‐intensity Scalia. This in turn suggests that the high‐intensity Scalia is much less likely to vote for the alternative that is farther from his ideal point than either Kennedy or the low‐intensity Scalia."
"40","The intensity model we estimate to determine if extremists have more sharply peaked utility functions than moderates is similar to the Gaussian utility‐choice model presented earlier. Recall from the Gaussian utility model, given the signal to noise parameter β and weight w, the corresponding yea and nay utilities for legislator i on vote j were:               "
"41","Rather than using a global weight parameter w, the intensity model allows each legislator's weight parameter  to be estimated separately, resulting in the new utility functions:               "
"42","This again leads to the standard probit formulation of the probability that legislator i votes yea on the jth roll call as:               "
"43","The choice probability function nicely illustrates the identification issues that we highlighted in the introduction. Note that we could also allow variation in the importance of the idiosyncratic shocks across members rather than variation in the importance of the spatial utility (what we are referring to as intensity). In either case, we would make choice more a function of spatial location for some members and less for others. Indeed, in the quadratic utility models, increasing w and decreasing the variance of the shocks are isomorphic. In the Gaussian model, increasing the w and decreasing the variance of the idiosyncratic shocks are not isomorphic, but they are similar. Thus, we can only say that spatial utility is more important for extremists because we are assuming that idiosyncratic shocks are similarly important across members. Of course, all utility calculations are relative, and so this is not a surprising situation. However, if we focus on the probabilistic choice function, our inability to separate variation in behavior across legislators that is due to spatial or idiosyncratic considerations is of little consequence.            "
"44","We use the same diffuse priors on the legislator and vote parameters described in the second section. Given the p x q matrix of observed votes V, Bayesian inference for the legislators' ideal points, bill parameters, and auxiliary parameters proceeds by simulating the posterior density given by:               "
"45","Our model is closely related to a “robust” ideal point estimator proposed by Bafumi et al. (2005) and later extended by Lauderdale (2010). Both models examine the extent to which individual legislators vote on the basis of the dominant spatial‐preference dimensions. However, our work differs in two significant ways. First, our model builds on work from the preceding section and is based on the Gaussian utility models used in a large number of empirical applications, whereas the earlier papers exclusively assume quadratic utility. Secondly, our substantive focus examines the relationship between intensity and extremism, an issue left unexplored in the other papers.            "
"46","Similar to our earlier model, our primary means of validating the estimator is through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. In this instance, we generate a roll‐call matrix with 100 legislators and 1,000 roll calls using the Gaussian utility function.11 However, in contrast to our earlier Monte Carlo, we vary the weights for each legislator, drawing true weights from the distribution . Our estimated ideal points correlate with the true ideal points at , and our estimated weights correlate with the true weights at —providing evidence that our estimator is able to recover the parameters of interest successfully.            "
"47","We note that weights in our Monte Carlo simulations are drawn independently from ideal points. Figure 7 shows a plot of recovered ideal points against the recovered weights. In both the true data and in our estimates, a lowess smoother detects no systematic relationship between the extremism of a legislator and the intensity of their preferences. This is important for our model in demonstrating that extremism and intensity are different concepts that can be separately identified in estimation. More informally, it confirms the fact that the model allows for four types of legislators to be estimated: intense and moderate legislators, intense and extreme legislators, noisy and moderate legislators, and noisy and extreme legislators. Thus, our estimator is able to detect a wide range of possible relationships, both linear and nonlinear, between ideological positioning and intensity.            "

"49","Note: Lines reflect the 80% confidence bands on each simulated legislator's estimated weight. Recovered ideal points correlate with true ideal points at , while recovered weights correlate with true weights at .

"50","We applied the intensity estimator separately to the 106th to 109th Senates (1999–2007), with the results of our estimation shown later in Figure 8.

The posterior mean weight parameter  is plotted on the y‐axis, and an 80% confidence band for each legislator's weight is displayed. A lowess smoother is then applied to the points on each graph in an effort to detect nonlinear patterns in the distribution of weights.            "
"51","Ideal Points vs. Estimated Weights: 106th to 109th Senate"
"52","Note: Lines reflect the 80% confidence bands on each senator's estimated weight. The dashed line is a lowess smoother of the points and provides evidence that extremists have larger weight parameters than their moderate counterparts. The circled estimate corresponds to Russ Feingold (D‐WI) while the estimate enclosed in the diamond corresponds to Tom Harkin (D‐IA). In three of the four plots shown here, Feingold is a notable outlier.                        "
"53","Building on the social judgment theory of Sherif and Hovland (1961), we hypothesized that extremists would have more sharply peaked utility functions than moderates—that is, a higher individual weight parameter . In all four cases we examined, the lowess‐smoothed weights generally appear consistent with this hypothesis, though there appears to be some deviation from this trend at the conservative end of the 109th Senate.12"
"54","In three of the four cases shown above, Russ Feingold (D‐WI) appears as a notable outlier, both in terms of the extremity of his estimated ideal point and his weight parameter. These estimates result from Feingold occasionally deviating from other Democrats and voting with Republicans despite being an otherwise liberal‐voting senator. To understand the impact of his occasional “party maverick” behavior on the estimates, we compare the choice probabilities for Feingold in the 109th Senate to that of the second most liberal senator, Tom Harkin (D‐IA). In drawing this comparison, we seek to understand why Feingold's estimates deviate so substantially from those of Harkin, despite being similar in their ideological rank positions."
"55","Note that both Feingold's weight and ideal point estimate differ considerably from those of Harkin. How do differences in each of these parameters between Feingold and Harkin affect the fit of the model? We examine this question by calculating how well Feingold's voting record fits the model if his weight and ideal point parameters were set to those of Harkin. Table 3 shows the log‐likelihood for Feingold's votes for combinations of weights and ideal points that we estimated for Feingold and Harkin. The upper‐left cell shows Feingold's log‐likelihood under his estimated ideal point and weight of  and . The other cells show new likelihood values for combinations of Feingold's and Harkin's parameter estimates. Moving Feingold's ideal point to Harkin's position while maintaining the same weight (i.e., the bottom‐left cell) results in a decrease in the log‐likelihood of approximately 9 (about 8,000 times less likely). However, shifting Feingold's weight to Harkin's weight while holding constant Feingold's ideal point (i.e., the top‐right cell) decreases the log‐likelihood by 89 (about 1038 times less likely). This shows that the change in weight is the dominant factor explaining the discrepancy in fit.            "
"56","What sort of voting behavior can account for the large differences in fit for Feingold's voting record when using Feingold's weight and ideal point estimates, compared to those of Harkin? Stated differently, what sorts of votes drive the difference between the top‐left and bottom‐right corner that we observe in Table 3? Earlier, we characterized Feingold as an occasional ideological maverick who sometimes votes with Republicans and against those in his party. As an illustrative example, consider a Senate motion to concur with the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 6111, a bill that amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The motion passed with a vote of 79 to 9, with all Democrats other than Feingold voting for the bill; Feingold joined eight Republican senators in voting against it. For this bill, we again separately consider how shifts in weight and ideal point affect the probability of the vote.            "
"57","The left panel of Figure 9 shows the log‐likelihood of a nay vote at Feingold's weight parameter value versus the value estimated for Harkin, holding Feingold's ideal point fixed at its estimated value. The diamond indicates Feingold's log‐likelihood for this vote, while the point indicated by the circle indicates what Feingold's log‐likelihood would be for this vote if his weight were shifted to that of Harkin. We observe that a shift from Harkin's weight of 0.92 to Feingold's estimated weight of 0.40 increases the log‐likelihood by 4.08. Stated differently, this implies that the lower weight makes the observed maverick vote 59 times more likely to occur.13"
"58","Log‐Likelihood of Nay Vote by Feingold (D‐WI), H.R. 6111 Concurrence with House"
"59","Note: The left panel shows the log‐likelihood of a nay vote for different values of w with , while the right panel shows the log‐likelihood of a nay vote for different values of x with . The diamond indicates the log‐likelihood for Feingold, while the point indicated by the circle indicates what Feingold's log‐likelihood would have been if his weight/location were identical to that of Tom Harkin (D‐IA), the second most liberal senator in the 109th Senate. The triangle and square in the right panel show the estimated yea and nay locations, respectively.                        "
"60","The right panel of Figure 9 plots the same log‐likelihood of a nay vote as Feingold's ideal point is changed from its estimated value to the value estimated for Harkin, holding Feingold's weight parameter fixed at its estimated value. The diamond and circle indicate Feingold's and Harkin's estimated ideal point, respectively. As Feingold's ideal point shifts from Harkin's ideal point of −1.31 to Feingold's estimated ideal point of −3.23, the log‐likelihood associated with the vote increases by 1.15, implying that the nay vote is 3.15 times more likely to occur. In short, reductions in weight and ideal point both substantially improve the fit for Feingold's maverick votes, but the effect of varying w is much greater.14"
"61","Despite its smaller size, we repeat this analysis for the 1953–2008 U.S. Supreme Court, as shown in Figure 10. Our results for the Court suggest a pattern similar to the Senate, with the lowess‐smoothed weights suggesting that extremists have more sharply peaked utility functions than moderates. Additionally, we provide a dot chart of the weights that individually identifies each justice separately. The dot chart reveals no obvious pattern in the weight estimates, though a significant number of justices across the ideological spectrum have low estimated weights.            "

"64","Because most theoretical analysis of legislative bargaining and outcomes from within the spatial voting framework assumes simple deterministic Euclidean preferences, it is not clear that our expectations about legislative outcomes or behavior depend in any way on the form of the legislators' utility functions. Indeed, because the ideal point estimates generated under various assumptions about the form of legislators' utility functions are generally similar, if legislative outcomes and bargaining only depend upon legislators' ideal points, then the broader theoretical importance of the preceding discussion would be rather limited."
"65","To demonstrate how the shape of legislators' spatial utility functions (or corresponding probabilistic choice functions) might affect predictions about legislative behavior and outcomes, we consider a probabilistic voting version of a commonly employed modeling framework for analyzing legislative outcomes (in particular, Cox and McCubbins 1993, 2005; Krehbiel 1998). In this framework, legislators have Euclidean preferences over a single spatial dimension. We also assume a one‐dimensional policy space. However, we assume that in additional to spatial considerations, legislators have nonspatial utility components of the sort described earlier.         "
"66","Ideal point estimates produced by NOMINATE have been used to estimate important quantities such as “gridlock intervals” or “blockout zones” that arise from this modeling framework (for recent examples, see Jenkins and Monroe 2012; Krehbiel, Meirowitz, and Woon 2005; Richman 2011; Stiglitz and Weingast 2010; Wiseman and Wright 2008). However, those estimates are based on the assumption that legislators' preferences are fully determined by their spatial location. By extending the framework to include the nonspatial utility components that are a hallmark of empirical models of spatial voting, we are able to characterize likely legislative outcomes in a way that is fully consistent with the empirical models of legislator choice (like NOMINATE).         "
"67","Because of nonspatial considerations, our legislators do not always vote for the closer alternative. We assume that the proposer is aware not only of the location of the status quo policy and the locations of each legislator's ideal point but also knows the nonspatial utility values that legislators associate with the status quo and with the proposal that she might offer. While the proposer can observe the nonspatial utility values, she cannot affect them. She can only choose the spatial location of the proposal. That is, in the context of any particular legislating opportunity, we assume that the nonspatial utility components are fixed and do not vary as a function of spatial location of the legislation."
"68","In our model, voting is probabilistic ex ante. From the standpoint of an outside observer (or an actor prior to the revelation of the idiosyncratic utility components), the choice of one alternative over another is not fully determined by the legislator's ideal point and the location of the two alternatives under consideration. As in the empirical models of voting that we considered in the preceding sections, ex ante, the probability with which one alternative is selected over another is determined by the shape of the spatial utility function and the distribution of the utility shocks."
"69","The model proceeds in the usual way with the proposer selecting the bill (if any) that most improves upon the status quo subject to the constraint that it is preferred to the status quo by a majority of the legislators and will not be vetoed by the executive. For simplicity, we omit institutions such as the filibuster, a bicameral legislature, or a veto override. This simple setting is sufficient to demonstrate how the distribution of legislative outcomes depends upon how spatial and nonspatial considerations are combined or, more specifically, the form of the random utility functions (described in the second section). As we will demonstrate shortly, the distribution of legislative proposals and outcomes generated by legislators with Gaussian preferences and legislators with quadratic preferences differs."
"70","Because our chief objective in this article is to probe the limits of how much can be learned about the shape of actors' utility functions, we leave for future work to consider all of the theoretical implications that differently shaped utility functions might imply for the distribution of legislative outcomes or other quantities of interest. Here we will provide a simple motivating example of one such difference."
"71","Consider an  member legislature in which members' ideal points are spaced evenly between −1 and 1, implying a floor median of . Suppose a leader with proposal power is located at  and is faced with a legislative status quo at  and a president with veto power at . In the usual world of Euclidean preferences without nonspatial utility considerations, there is no legislative proposal by the party leader that improves upon the status quo (from her perspective). However, if legislators also have nonspatial utility components that can be treated as stochastic from the perspective of the analyst, then it will be possible for the proposer to improve upon the status quo with positive probability and the features of the utility functions that we estimate here affect the distribution of optimal proposals.         "
"72","To study how the distribution of optimal proposals depends upon the assumed utility function, we conduct a Monte Carlo experiment in which we randomly draw a set of stochastic utility shocks for each alternative and for each of the 101 legislators and the president.15 Then given these shocks, we consider a series of proposals, beginning at the proposer's ideal point and moving toward the status quo. For each proposal considered, we ask whether a majority of legislators and the president would support the proposal (note that the nonspatial utility components are fixed in each iteration of the experiment). The first proposal that is supported by a majority of the legislators is the optimal bill for the leader to offer. If we find no proposal between the proposer's ideal point and the status quo that is preferred by a majority of the legislators and the president to the status quo, then it is not possible for the proposer to improve upon the status quo in that instance. In that case, the addition of the nonspatial utility components does not alter the prediction of the standard theoretical framework which omits such nonspatial considerations.         "
"73","We run the experiment separately for the Gaussian and quadratic utility functions 10,000 times. Under both Gaussian and quadratic utility and given the assumed locations of the proposer, the legislators, the president, and the status quo, we find that the proposer can offer a bill that passes and improves upon the status quo (from her perspective) approximately 33% of the time. Thus, once additional nonspatial utility components are allowed, the sharp prediction of the standard framework disappears and profitable proposals for this status quo in the black‐out interval become possible about one‐third of the time. We provide insight as to why the proposer is able to move policy so frequently even under very unfavorable circumstances and also why the probability of a successful proposal is similar under Gaussian and quadratic utility in the appendix. In our appendix, we characterize the conditions under which, and frequency with which, a successful proposal is possible in a three‐person legislature that is otherwise similar to the legislature considered in our experiment.         "
"74","While the proposer can move an advantageous proposal in one‐third of the instances under both quadratic and Gaussian utility, the distribution of the optimal proposals is not the same under both utility functions. The left panel of Figure 11 shows a quantile–quantile (QQ) plot of the winning proposals made under quadratic and Gaussian utility. The dashed 45‐degree line illustrates what the QQ plot would look like if the distribution of winning proposals under Gaussian and quadratic utility were identical. Instead, all the points on the QQ plot fall below the 45‐degree line, demonstrating that the proposer generally does better (i.e., achieves winning proposals closer to her own ideal point) under Gaussian utility.

"75","Results of Monte Carlo Simulations from Our Legislative Bargaining Model with Stochastic Utility"
"76","Note: The left panel shows a QQ plot of the distribution of optimal proposals under quadratic utility against the distribution of optimal proposals under Gaussian utility. Notice that the distribution of optimal proposals under Gaussian utility is more favorable to the proposer. The right panel shows the frequency with which legislators at each point in the ideological spectrum support these proposals. The solid line represents the probability of support under Gaussian utility. The dashed line shows the probability of support under quadratic utility.                     "
"77","How can we explain superior legislative outcomes for the proposer under Gaussian utility? We explore this question in the right panel of Figure 11, which plots the fraction of trials for each utility function and each ideal point in which a yea vote is observed across all of the winning proposals. The dark line shows the vote probabilities under Gaussian utility, while the dashed line shows the probabilities under quadratic utility. For both lines, a lowess smoother is used to reduce noise from the simulation. Locations of the proposer, status quo, legislative floor median, and president are shown below. The key trend to note is that under quadratic utility, the probability of a yea vote is strictly decreasing as legislators' ideal points increase. In contrast, the flatter tails under Gaussian utility create regions where the probability of voting yea is somewhat flat and even begins to increase as legislators' ideal points move far away from the proposer. The ability of the Gaussian utility function to more frequently induce spatial “mistakes” in the far tails of the ideological distribution makes it somewhat easier for the prosper to achieve outcomes closer to her own ideal point.         "
"78","This simple experiment does not describe all of the ways in which the shape of legislators' utility functions might affect legislative bargaining. However, it does demonstrate that a better understanding of how spatial preferences are translated into voting decisions could affect theoretical expectations about the legislative process and policy outcomes."
"79","Empirical models of spatial voting are typically random utility models of Euclidean spatial voting, where voters assign utility to each of two alternatives associated with each roll call. However, the functions used to assign these utilities are usually assumed rather than estimated. In this article, we attempt to examine the effects of variations in utility functions for ideal point estimation methods."
"80","We began by considering the assumed utility functions of two leading implementations of ideal point estimation, Poole and Rosenthal's (1985) NOMINATE and Jackman's IDEAL (2008b). We noted that despite many similarities between the Gaussian and quadratic utility functions, the two functions imply different behavior by legislators when choices are located far from the legislator's ideal point. Exploiting the fact that the quadratic utility function is the first‐order exponential approximation of the Gaussian utility function, we then introduce a test designed to determine which utility function best fits a particular roll‐call data set. Our application of the estimator to the U.S. Congress suggests that Gaussian utility functions generally tend to fit the data better than quadratic utility functions. This trend appears to hold true in a wide variety of contexts outside the U.S. Congress, including the U.S. Supreme Court.         "
"81","We then examined the possibility that extremists and moderates may have different utility functions. Building on the work of Sherif and Hovland (1961) and Keisler, Collins, and Miller (1969), we hypothesized that extremists would have more sharply peaked utility functions than moderates. Substantively, this hypothesis implies that extremists are relatively more likely to select the closer alternative than moderates. We then introduce a variation of our original model that allows separate weight parameters to be estimated for each individual legislator. In applying this intensity estimator to four recent U.S. Senates, we found evidence that was supportive of our hypothesis. This trend appears to hold when the same estimator is applied to data from the U.S. Supreme Court.         "
