"1","In order to understand Locke's reflections on international relations it is first necessary to examine the moral and political significance of the state of nature. According to Locke, the natural human condition is “a State of perfect Freedom” and “a State of Equality, wherein all Power and Jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another.”3 While the state of nature is in one sense profoundly individualistic—there is no government—Locke contends that there is a natural law derived from reason regulating the relations of individuals in the natural condition. The law of nature contains three distinct but interrelated commands. First, it enjoins “no one ought to harm another in his Life, Health, Liberty or Possessions” (II, 6). Second, every individual “is bound to preserve himself” (II, 6). Third, each person ought “when his own Preservation comes not in competition, … as much as he can, to preserve the rest of Mankind” (II, 6). Locke claims that the power to execute the natural law is “put into every Mans hands,” whereby each individual has the right to punish anyone who violates the natural law by threatening one's self‐preservation or harming another in their life, liberty, or possessions (II, 7). The law of nature would “be in vain, if there were no body that in the state of Nature, had a Power to execute that, and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders” (II, 7).         "
"2","Perhaps the most striking feature in Locke's account of the state of nature, a condition practically defined by the absence of civil law, is his emphasis on the logic and rhetoric of law enforcement. While Locke affirms that the scope of the self‐defense right enjoyed by every individual in the state of nature must be proportionate to the goal of “Reparation and Restraint” (II, 8), he also reveals that this punishment right extends to “the power to kill” (II, 11) an aggressor. There are, however, two elements of Locke's natural executive power teaching that extend well beyond a self‐defense right.4 First, Locke argues that one may punish and even kill not only an actual physical aggressor, but anyone who has shown “an Enmity to his being” (II, 16). The state of war, which activates the natural executive power, therefore relates not only to the actual use of force, but may reasonably be deduced from the discovery of any “sedate settled design” upon one's life (II, 11). Second, Locke extends the punishment right beyond the direct victims of aggression by advancing the right of “every man” and “any other Person” (II, 8, 10) to intervene against an aggressor who endangers another. Not only is the natural executive power emphatically not restricted to a special victims right, Locke extends it, in principle at least, into a right of every individual to intervene in a conflict in order to punish wrongdoers and protect the innocent.         "
"3","The law of nature is a mixed blessing providing the state of nature with both its moral foundation and its fundamental problem. Auto‐interpretation of the law of nature and its permissive stance toward the use of force for punishing wrongdoers and protecting the innocent practically ensures that “the Inconveniences” of the state of nature must be great “where Men may be Judges in their own Case” (II, 13). As is well known, civil government emerges as Locke's primary remedy to the “Inconveniences” of the state of nature. By surrendering their natural executive power of the law of nature to a common “Umpire” in the legislative and executive power of society, individuals consent to form a civil arrangement that promises to better secure their life and property (II, 87–88). The formerly discrete individuals of the natural condition now agree to form “One Body Politick” (II, 89) distinct from the rest of humankind by delegating their general right of executing the law of nature to a civil government empowered not only to punish injuries within the community, but also “Injuries from without” (II, 88, 3)."
"4","The law of nature supplies the conceptual and moral link between Lockean civil government and international relations. The primary evidence Locke provides to support the existence of the state of nature is that “since all Princes and Rulers of Independent Governments all through the World, are in a State of Nature, 'tis plain the World never was, nor ever will be without Numbers of Men in that State” (II, 14). For Locke, the definitive demonstration of the existence of the state of nature is the permanent condition of international relations. The significance of Locke's identification of an international state of nature is twofold. First, he indicates that the international state of nature exists despite the many leagues and compacts between the “Governours of Independent Communities” (II, 14).5 Agreements and promises among independent communities do not form civil society in the proper sense of “One Body Politick” with a common legislative to which a group of individuals have transferred their natural executive power. The rulers of independent communities retain their natural freedom and equality regardless of leagues and compacts with other commonwealths. However, Locke also insists that treaties and compacts among nations possess genuine normative force and are “binding to them, though they are perfectly in a State of Nature” (II, 14; Dunn 1969, 163). Even in absence of a common legislative power or “Umpire” among independent commonwealths, Locke suggests that some form of moral rule operates in the international state of nature.         "
"5","Second, Locke maintains that the state of nature is the permanent feature of the international arena. Independent commonwealths subject to no higher secular authority are, and “ever will be,” the primary actors in the international arena. By removing from the international state of nature the possibility of a common legislature among distinct bodies politic, Locke rejects the idea of global government and thus effectively precludes the sole reliable remedy for the “inconveniences” of the state of nature, which must be great when independent communities and rulers, no less than individuals “may be Judges in their own Case” (II, 13). Each independent commonwealth invests in its government the right to act in foreign relations with the degree of freedom and moral authority that “answers to the Power every Man naturally had before he entered into Society” (II, 145). Thus the personhood of each independent community flows from the natural law command about self‐preservation, or in the case of independent commonwealths, the aggregate preservation right of each of its members."
"6","The moral core of Locke's law of nature is the prohibition on aggression, which he defines broadly as the use of “Force without Right” (II, 19). This definition of aggression serves double duty. First, it applies, by virtue of the “domestic analogy,” to both the international and individual context: no commonwealth or individual may use “Force without Right” against another (Bull 1966, 64–68; Walzer 1977, 58). Second, it simultaneously defines the rightful use of force narrowly in terms of self‐defense and punishment for aggression. In this respect Locke departs somewhat from the older tradition of Christian natural law according to which commonwealths were authorized to enforce natural law provisions, but the crimes for whose punishment justifies punitive wars need not be restricted to aggression.6 For example, punitive war may be justified by the iniquity of the adversary, which may include punishment for practices perceived to be contrary to natural reason such as idolatry, cannibalism, human sacrifice, and even the violation of the rights of hospitality (Augustine 1972, 861–62; Aquinas [1274] 1988, 221). While the later form of Christian natural law thinking on just war, advanced most notably by Spanish scholastics such as Vitoria and de las Casas, tried to limit the justification for punitive war in order to check the bellicosity of Spanish imperialism and the maltreatment of native peoples, it still retained a strong connection to the idea of war as a way to enforce certain norms and punish certain practices (de las Casas [1552] 1992, 207; Vitoria [1528] 1991, 30, 225–26, 288). In this older tradition of natural law, the claims of sovereignty and political independence had less normative status than the moral imperative to punish wrongdoers and protect the innocent.         "
"7","In contrast to the Christian natural law tradition, Locke's effort to define just war solely in terms of self‐defense and punishment of aggression seems to make respect for the political independence of separate commonwealths an integral feature of international relations. Locke's international state of nature simply reinterprets the natural law teaching about equality of individuals in terms of independent public persons or commonwealths: aggression is fundamentally a violation of the principle of natural equality. However, the domestic analogy supporting the doctrine of nonaggression is highly strained, especially with regard to the punitive dimension of the natural law. In the moral economy of Locke's law of nature, the punishment of aggression involves the forfeiting of rights by one party to another. With regard to the individual in the state of nature the aggressor may forfeit his or her right of self‐preservation to the victim, and indeed to every individual who may intervene in the conflict (II, 8, 10). Locke graphically illustrates that the range of legitimate punishment may extend from reparation and restraint (imprisonment), to capital punishment, and even a morally permissible form of slavery (II, 23–24). In the context of aggression among individuals in the state of nature the forfeiture of rights is in principle absolute."
"8","With respect to punishment of aggression in the international state of nature, the moral significance of the social reality necessarily makes the situation much more complex. In one sense the domestic analogy between individual and commonwealth is relatively unambiguous. Just as the natural law authorizes the individual to punish an aggressor with a view to reparation and restraint, so too may a victim society and its allies reasonably compel an aggressor to pay reparation for damages or agree to restraint perhaps in the form of arms limitation or a nonaggression treaty (II, 181). However, the natural law authorization of capital punishment and slavery strains the domestic analogy and the legal fiction of the public person of the commonwealth to its logical extreme. Does the forfeiture of rights involve the entire aggressor commonwealth or is it limited to specific parties in it? Is the forfeiture of rights related to the whole victim society, restricted to specific individuals in it, or even extended to the entirety of humankind?"
"9","The law of nature authorizes conquest as a legitimate punishment for aggression, but Locke is careful to place limits on the rights even of lawful conquerors. He admits the shaky basis of the domestic analogy when he establishes moral limits on the punitive conduct of governments that simply do not pertain to individuals in the state of nature (Coby 1987, 19). His strategy is to narrow the scope of responsibility for aggression to those individuals “who have actually assisted, concurr'd, or consented to that unjust force” (II, 179). With respect to this group “what Power a lawful Conqueror has over the Subdued; … is purely Despotical” (II, 178). While the defeated aggressor may likely (and legitimately) feel the sword or the lash, Locke vehemently maintains that noncombatants in the defeated society, and particularly women and children, must be exempt from this fate (II, 182–83). Moreover, lawful conquest—military action authorized by the natural law—brings the conqueror no title to the property of the defeated people apart from proportionate monetary reparation (II, 180, 184) and must in no sense be construed to be the basis for legitimate government without the free consent of the conquered (II, 186–87). In the international state of nature, lawful conquest is punishment, not government.         "
"10","Although conquest may not in itself produce government without consent of the conquered, the meaningful political independence of the lawfully conquered people can hardly be taken for granted either. Locke recognizes the difficulty, if not practical impossibility, of harmonizing a natural law authorizing conquest, on the one hand, and the idea of inviolable sovereignty, on the other. The natural equality of independent commonwealths signifies simultaneously one of the guiding moral principles of Locke's international state of nature, as well as perhaps its most problematic feature."
"11","The defining characteristic of the international state of nature is, according to Locke, the natural freedom and equality of independent commonwealths. Thus, in one sense, some element of the idea of national sovereignty is woven into the very fabric of Lockean international relations inasmuch as the international state of nature recognizes no higher legislative and political authority than independent civil governments with sole competence to make and execute law within a given body politic (II, 131). However, in a more fundamental sense, Locke's conception of political independence departs considerably from the traditional notion of sovereignty. For Locke, the idea of legal supremacy replaces sovereignty as the central organizing principle of legitimate government.7 He is typically careful not to identify the highest legal authority in the commonwealth as sovereign, preferring rather to describe it as supreme in relation to the subordinate magistrates and inferior offices. The “supreme” legislative power, whether held solely by the legislature or shared with the executive, represents the organic unity or “soul” of the society that “puts Men out of a State of Nature into that of a Commonwealth” (II, 89, 151, 212).         "
"12","While the supreme power is a delegated authority given by society and held in trust (and thus cannot be sovereign in the traditional sense), the commonwealth as a distinct social and political entity is nonetheless quintessentially independent in a way in which the individual in the state of nature can never be. Unlike the individual person, the supreme power of the independent commonwealth is incapable of surrendering its natural executive power, at least in any significant sense, to a higher institutional authority (II, 141; cf. Franklin 1978, 93–95). Thus, Locke's concept of legal supremacy reveals the problem in trying to understand his notion of the international state of nature in terms of the discourse of sovereignty. On the one hand, the doctrine of nonaggression seems to endorse the idea of sovereignty by asserting the natural equality of self‐governing communities. For Locke, independent commonwealths represent a moral good in themselves inasmuch as their purpose is to guarantee human welfare and security (II, 158; Grant 1987, 128). On the other hand, legal supremacy, as Locke conceives of it, implicitly undermines the idea of sovereignty by offering no theoretical or moral obstacle to natural law authorization for the defensive use of force broadly conceived to include not only repulsing aggression, but even permitting a form of conquest and occupation.         "
"13","Locke's theory of lawful conquest undermines the moral primacy of sovereignty in three ways. The first can be seen in Locke's suggestion that it “seldom happens” that the conquered and conquerors fail to incorporate “into one People under the same Laws and Freedoms” (II, 178). Indeed, his prime example for this historical pattern is the foundation of modern English society in the gradual incorporation of Normans and Saxons following the Conquest of 1066 (II, 177).8 While Locke suggests that the consent of the conquered is the moral precondition for this political union, it is nonetheless striking that the incorporation of two peoples does not strictly speaking originate in consent, but rather in the ex post facto agreement to a situation produced by prior military intervention and conquest. Far from endorsing the inviolability of sovereignty, Locke suggests that the reasonable, and in some respects natural, course of events is for lawful conquest to eventuate in a new body politic (Josephson 2002, 191–96). The redemptive power of compact even extends to aggressors who have forfeited their lives and liberty, for “once Compact enter between” the lawful conqueror and captive, “the state of War and Slavery ceases, as long as the Compact endures” (II, 24). Thus, even the most absolute form of subjection contains the seeds of new civil association.         "
"14","The second aspect of Locke's conquest theory with direct bearing on the status of sovereignty is his restriction of responsibility for aggression to those who “actually assisted, concurr'd, or consented” to the unjust use of force (II, 178). The obvious interpretive difficulty in this formulation of war guilt lies in determining what constitutes assistance, concurrence, or consent. Depending on the criteria employed, the category of individuals subject to despotic punishment may include not only the political and military leadership of the defeated community, but also a wide swath of enemy combatants and potentially even segments of the public supportive of the war.9 Does Locke's argument for selective war guilt preserve the integrity of the defeated society? Selective responsibility is incompatible with full sovereignty insofar as, despite his tendency to eschew the discourse of sovereignty (Scott 2000), Locke's idea of supremacy retains one important connection to the traditional idea of sovereignty, according to which “making War and Peace are marks of Sovereignty” solely reserved to the “Supream Power” in society (I, 131; Parry 1978, 134). The group or individual possessing this sovereign right of war and peace is logically the parties directly responsible for the actual prosecution of an unjust war. Thus, whether we interpret assistance, concurrence, and consent narrowly to signify command responsibility or more broadly to include a wide range of combatants and civilians, Locke's natural law authorization for punishment, for all intents and purposes, necessarily included the supreme legal power in the aggressor commonwealth.         "
"15","Alternatively, however, Locke's rationale for selective responsibility does make an important concession to the principle of self‐government by framing aggressive war as an abuse of power not delegated by the community to its governors. The legitimate war power of a government cannot justify aggression because “the People [have] given to their Gouvernours no Power to do an unjust thing, such as is to make an unjust War” (II, 179). A government that launches an unjust war loses its claim to legitimacy. The aggressor government loses its public character by this abuse of power; it effectively relinquishes its claim to legal supremacy and becomes a collection of private individuals subject to natural law punishment by the conqueror (Grant 1987, 129–30). Accordingly, to the extent that Locke retains any significant connection with the idea of sovereignty, this supreme power must be said to devolve to society when the community's governors forfeit their natural rights by an act of aggression. This argument, at least partially, serves Locke's moral aim of restricting war guilt and exempting whole societies from the despotic punishment of lawful conquest. Aggression cannot be justified in the name or interests of the people.         "
"16","However, there are two serious difficulties in Locke's reasoning about delegated powers and aggression. First, the argument that an aggressor government loses its legitimacy does not clarify in what sense supremacy can be understood to devolve to the community. To argue that the government loses its public, and indeed supreme character, does not automatically indicate who or what body may rightfully assume the public representation of that society to the other bodies politic in the international state of nature. Lawful conquest appears to leave a community in a form of legal and national limbo—neither fully subject, nor possessing an independent government of its own. The second problem relates to Locke's ambiguous use of the domestic analogy. On the one hand, he maintains that the people had no more “Power in themselves” to consent to an unjust war than they would to enslaving themselves or voluntarily submitting to arbitrary rule (II, 23, 135, 179). Yet, on the other hand, Locke gives no suggestion that we must assume that the general public would never be so wicked or foolish as to consent to or support an unjust war. Indeed, even in his most restrictive formulation of war guilt Locke included those individuals who “consented” to the unjust use of force (II, 179). He appears to accept the commonsense empirical observation that communities can, have in the past, and probably will in the future support aggressive, expansionist policies."
"17","The unifying thread in Locke's analogy between external aggression and domestic arbitrary rule is the purportedly self‐destructive character of each, inasmuch as both endanger the basic freedom instrumental to self‐preservation (Glenn 1984, 90–96; Zuckert 1994, 240–46). Once again, however, the domestic analogy between civil and international relations is by no means obvious. Is consenting to or supporting aggression against a weaker neighbor as clearly self‐destructive as enslaving oneself or submitting to an arbitrary government? Admittedly, the aggressor government submits itself to the possibility of universal punishment by all other peace‐loving peoples, but this punishment is hardly guaranteed. The more fundamental moral imperative against international aggression must be that as a general principle aggression undermines the equal respect for political independence which, in theory at least, all commonwealths including the aggressor have a presumptive right to enjoy.         "
"18","The third aspect of Locke's lawful conquest theory with a direct bearing on the issue of sovereignty is his treatment of the concept of total war. Locke considers the possibility that every adult male may be held responsible for aggression by virtue of their membership in a given political society: “Let us suppose that all Men of that Community being all Members of the same Body Politick, may be taken to have joyn'd in that unjust War, wherein they are subdued, and so their Lives are at the Mercy of the Conquerour” (II, 188). From this very expansive idea of war guilt, Locke nonetheless still manages to establish clear limits on lawful conquest that never extends to punishing “innocent” women and children or claiming the property originally held by the captive men (II, 180, 182–84). Even Locke's broadest construction of responsibility for aggression does not justify national enslavement or mass expropriation and annexation of territory. In this situation, the lawful conqueror is checked primarily by the natural right of children to inherit their parent's estate (II, 190; Gauthier 1966, 41–45). The blameless legitimate inheritors of the national wealth retain an indefeasible right both to possess their family property and to establish their own government charged with securing it (II, 192). A conquered people cannot be ruled without their consent, and those who retain the right to inherit estates forfeited by their fathers have a complementary right to form or consent to a government directed to protecting their property. The argument that self‐government flows in some sense out of the structure of the right to property may explain why conquerors cannot rightfully claim permanent government over the conquered; however, the natural right of inheritance does not demonstrate that the political independence of a given society survives intact in any form but in potentia through the course of invasion and occupation.10 This limit on conquest has perhaps as much to do with the natural law obligation on the conqueror to refrain from despoiling a conquered people as it has to do with conflicting rights claims arising from the presumptive independence of the vanquished.         "
"19","Locke's theory of lawful conquest, then, is in considerable tension with the notion of inviolable sovereignty. Conquest does not produce a right to govern in absence of the consent of the governed. But while the conquered retain a moral right to choose their governors or may be said never to have wholly forfeited this right, the retention of an abstract right is a far cry from full sovereignty or meaningful independence. Whether we (or the conqueror) interpret Locke's conception of war guilt broadly or narrowly, we are left with the inescapable conclusion that a society's effective political independence can be lost or suspended due to actions punishable on the basis of principles of natural justice extrinsic to the consent of the community."
"20","While Locke insists that independent communities operate in a context of fundamental norms superintending their relations, neither sovereignty nor natural law adequately articulates the moral basis of international relations, which he conceives as a form of society without government. Locke does not flinch from the harsh conclusion that lawful conquest potentially involves a severe diminution of political independence. However, he maintains that distinct societies retain an inherent right of self‐government, even following lawful conquest. In the moral framework of mutually reinforcing limits, Locke's account of lawful conquest effectively nullifies the principle of inviolable national sovereignty, while the normative claims of communal self‐government strictly restrain the punitive measures allowed by the law of nature. In order to understand Locke's idea of international society and self‐government, we need to reconsider the normative status of the bodies politic inhabiting the international state of nature."
"21","The moral plane upon which independent peoples interact and conflict in international society has both a natural and a conventional or legitimist foundation. For Locke, the natural foundation of international society rests on the seminal distinction between government and society, two separate forms of association that, like supremacy and self‐government, reflect distinct principles of construction and dissolution. Legal supremacy is a feature of civil government, a political phenomenon with a distinct institutional expression produced by the consent of the majority of society. According to the theoretical “original Compact” forming civil government, “every one of that Society” must submit “to the determination of the majority” with respect to the constitution of the legislative power (II, 97, 132). Locke indicates that the legislative power is “Supream” not only because its creation signifies “the first and fundamental positive Law of all Commonwealths” (II, 134), but also due to the quasi‐natural law of “greater force” by which the majority may be held to act for the whole in regards to matters of general societal concern (II, 96). Locke's endorsement of legislative supremacy means that only the legislature, or possibly a supreme executive (II, 151–52) with a share of the legislative power, can be identified in any meaningful way as supreme. Civil government and the supreme power it possesses can only be dissolved by two means. First, the people have a natural right to revolt against oppressive or tyrannical rule, and thereby dissolve the government and reconstitute a new one as they see fit (II, 212–17). Second, the legislature may be destroyed and civil government de facto dissolved by the external force of conquest (II, 178–83). By this logic, civil governments are the primary victims of lawful conquest."
"22","On one level, Locke's idea of society is simply the seedbed of civil government, a form of association produced “by the consent of every individual” in the community (II, 96). In theory, the unanimous consent grounding society informs and in essence authorizes the majority to act for the whole in determining the form of government for a community. Herein lies the radically democratic foundation of every “lawful government,” whether the particular form of civil government established by the majority of society is democratic or most likely not (II, 99, 132; Tarcov 1981, 205). However, on a deeper level society reflects the flesh and blood social reality of common life for which the cold abstractions of contractual legalism are always in some sense an impoverished metaphor (Rabkin 1997, 306–309; Walzer 1977, 53–54). In the normal course of events, civil government and society are practically inseparable. As independent commonwealths interact with others internationally and govern themselves by general standing laws domestically, the greater part represents the whole in a relatively seamless web of consensual connections. The dissolution of government by conquest or revolution exposes the fundamental distinction between these two interrelated, but discrete modes of existence. Society reconstitutes governments. The implication for international relations is that it is not simply the establishment of a common legislative that separates one independent community from all others in the international state of nature. Rather the prior commitment to social union, to form one “Society,” reflects the deeper moral and social reality that preexists and emphatically outlives the dissolution of any particular government a people may create. For Locke, society is where the people are.         "
"23","Although society is not subject to the same logic of dissolution that affects government, it hardly needs to be said that Locke does not suggest that society is indestructible in the manner of Rousseau's general will (Rousseau [1762] 1978, 108–109). He freely admits that societies may be dissolved consensually to form new ones through the act of incorporation (II, 177–78) or societies may be dissolved brutally by “Conquerors Swords,” which “cut up Governments by the Roots, and mangle Societies to pieces” (II, 211). However, the distinction between consensual incorporation and brutal deracination may not be as clear as it initially appears. As a practical matter, Locke indicates that conquerors have historically been much less nice about the rights of conquered peoples than his theoretical treatment would suggest (II, 175, 180, 186). As a matter of fact, dissolution of society by the “Conquerors Sword” can be seen as the prevalent historical practice to which Locke's entire conquest theory stands in opposition. The normative thrust of Locke's teaching on lawful conquest is to exempt and protect societies, as opposed to governments, from the full weight of natural law punishments. The humanizing tendency of Locke's limits on lawful conquerors, especially with regard to respecting property and civilian life, thus has a decidedly prescriptive character meant to reconceptualize notions of just war and natural law in moral terms compatible with a right of self‐government inhering in society. The basic constituent elements of Locke's international order are societies.         "
"24","Whereas the political independence associated with the idea of sovereignty is qualified or contingent on adherence to the natural law principle of nonaggression, the inherent right of self‐government is absolute. However, this right is absolute only in the negative sense that one society must not be governed arbitrarily or permanently by another without its consent. It is a right of nondomination rather than an absolute right in the positive sense of a right to have a particular form of government or rule by specific individuals.11 The principle of nondomination involves the right of a people to choose any form of government consistent with natural law. The salutary consequences of lawful conquest may include the destruction and punishment of criminal leaders and even the elimination of aggressive regimes. In the harsh school of lawful conquest, societies may be instructed about the kinds of governments to which a people mindful of the natural law should consent (Josephson 2002, 190–96). In this sense, the inherent right of a society to govern itself is integrally linked to the framework of norms governing the international realm that may guide reasoned consent. Self‐government as a right of nondomination contains the immanent causality of political independence, but it does not necessitate full sovereignty in the immediate sense.         "
"25","There is also a distinct conventional or legitimist dimension to Locke's conception of international society. As several commentators have observed, Locke, unlike his immediate predecessor Hugo Grotius, did not advance any substantive notion of the “law of nations” (ius gentium; Grotius [1625] 2005, 162–64, 189), an inductively established body of norms and general principles of law recognized in many different communities (Ahrensdorf and Pangle 1999, 162–67; Cox 1960, 140–46; Forde 1998, 643–45; Nardin 2002, 58). For Locke, the law of nature constitutes the only class of universally enforceable laws binding on all rational beings. This being granted, however, it is important to observe that much as Locke maintains that municipal laws strengthen the moral saliency of natural law principles by annexing “known penalties … to them, to enforce their observation” (II, 135), so too do the various leagues, alliances, and compacts among nations signify a form of conventional glue binding the autonomous parts of international society (II, 14, 146). As Locke remarks, the various “Promises and Compacts” that individuals or communities make “are binding to them, though they are perfectly in a State of Nature, in reference to one another” (II, 14). The social character of the international state of nature derives in part from the capacity of these public persons to generate moral claims and obligations.         "
"26","The kind of international agreement to which Locke attributes the greatest significance relates to the issue of territorial recognition. In the course of describing the manner in which “several Communities settled the Bounds of their distinct Territories,” Locke makes reference to “the Leagues that have been made between several States and Kingdoms, either expressly or tacitly disowning all Claim and Right to the land in the others Possession” (II, 45). The legitimist aspect of international society involves both the explicit renunciation of territorial claims and an implicit recognition of the equality of the independent “States and Kingdoms” party to these reciprocal agreements. What is perhaps most striking about Locke's argument for the conventional legal basis of territorial recognition is his contention that this recognition may be explicit or tacit. We may understand this implicit recognition in several ways. First, Locke may mean no more than that any explicit agreement with another state regarding one matter includes implicit recognition of the territorial integrity of the various parties. For example, an agreement regarding trade or the establishment of diplomatic relations implies mutual recognition of borders. Alternatively, Locke may intend a more expansive construction of the meaning of implicit recognition such that any explicit assertion of territorial integrity by one state produces an implicit renunciation by that state of any territorial claim against any other state. Being a recognized member of international society involves affirming, even if only tacitly, the independence and territorial integrity of the other members. Locke assumes that every society must have a territory of its own."
"27","The argument for tacit territorial recognition suggests another international norm, in addition to the inheritance and self‐rule rights of the “innocent” individuals in the defeated societies, that limits conquest. Lawful conquerors are prohibited from annexing territory of the defeated society because of a moral obligation on the victor produced by the prior, if even implicit, recognition of the territorial integrity of the other party. The recognition of distinct territorial units is, in essence, a validation of the right of self‐government inhering in the society possessing and organizing that territory. How does the legal principle of territoriality relate to the norm of nonaggression?"
"28","The various leagues and compacts establishing territorial boundaries provide legal or conventional markers for determining aggression in the international arena. By delimiting a recognizable threshold for measuring aggression, these international agreements establish a basis for self‐defense and collective security arrangements allowing intervention and counterintervention to assist allies and victims of aggression. However, this position begs the question whether annexation of territory is permissible, not as reparation, but rather as a security guarantee to prevent future aggression (Coby 1987, 21). In absence of a broadly accepted revision of the territorial settlement, such action would be inconsistent with international norms inasmuch as the practice of violating treaties and implicit obligations threatens to unravel the moral fabric of international society. Nations are less likely to treat, and wars likely to be more bitterly fought, if permanent loss of territory is an acceptable outcome. Locke suggests that the broader security interest of every member of international society is served by refraining from strategic or punitive annexation. By similar reasoning, the international norms that permit preemptive war prohibit preventive war.12 The natural law sanctions preemptive attack against an adversary showing an “Enmity to [ones] being” and a “sedate settled design” to harm (II, 16). However, preventive war lacking immediate threat of attack and intended to weaken a potential rival or future threat is itself a form of aggression, and would be no more morally defensible than a war launched to preserve a nation's hegemony or restore a balance of power. Both annexation and preventive war involve violations of principles and norms, the universal renunciation of which would make international peace impossible.         "
"29","It is in light of the natural and legitimist basis of international morality that the question of Locke's relation to colonialism is clearly germane. While a full examination of the relation of liberalism and imperialism is well beyond the scope of the present study (Mehta 1999; Muthu 2003; Pitts 2005), it may be fitting to consider briefly the implications of Locke's international society argument for colonialism. Several recent commentators have offered studies associating Locke's permissive natural law justification of the use of force with the aggressive mercantilist and colonial policies of early modern England (Arneil 1996, 16–20; Pagden 2003, 183–84; Tuck 1999, 73–78; Tully 1993, 154–55).13 They generally reach this conclusion by drawing together several pieces of evidence. First, there is Locke's admission that the prohibition on annexing territory does not extend to unoccupied land of which “anyone had liberty to make use of the waste” (II, 184). Second, the consequentialist logic of Locke's argument that the one who cultivates “the wild woods and uncultivated waste of America” does not by his industry deprive anyone else of their rights, but rather may be said to give the bounty of increased productivity “to Mankind,” is interpreted by some as a specious pseudo‐humanitarian rationalization for dispossessing native peoples of their land (II, 37). Finally, Locke's doctrine of nonaggression is sometimes viewed in the colonial context as little more than a transparent, self‐serving justification for the destruction and enslavement of native peoples who have the temerity to resist their own dispossession. Together these arguments form a serious indictment against Locke.         "
"30","It may be helpful to analyze these charges in light of our findings regarding Locke's notion of self‐government and international society. There are two central questions at issue. First, does Locke see non‐European peoples as independent nations or distinct societies against whom the unprovoked use of force is simply aggression? Second, do these non‐European peoples have property rights in the territory they inhabit?"
"31","When we consider the charges against Locke in terms of these questions, neither the punitive aspect of the law of nature nor the consequentialist justification for private property necessarily serves the purposes alleged. It is important to observe that, in contrast to later liberal international lawyers such as Vattel, Locke does not refer to leaving land undeveloped as a violation of the natural law that is in any way punishable by another party (Vattel 1793, I, 149–50; cf. Pagden 2003, 183). While Locke is vague as to what constitutes insufficiently habited land, it is clear that he does not make the brutal argument that any nation that cannot protect private property cannot exclude foreign settlement (Rabkin 1997, 313). Moreover, the consequentialist and utilitarian justification for private acquisition cannot on its own constitute an apology for colonialism, inasmuch as Locke in no way entertains this reasoning with respect to lawful conquest.14 Why could a lawful conqueror not claim any land (not just “waste”) on the grounds that they can make it more productive than its original owners? On the basis of the consequentialist argument alone, there is no reason why a lawful conqueror could not make such a claim, even though Locke denies any such permission to the conqueror. Clearly, any conflict between settler and native may be rationalized, even by the most self‐serving logic, as a response to “force without right,” and thus exploited by the moral hypocrisy of the colonial powers seeking to justify their territorial ambitions. However, would the natural law authorization for the use of lethal force and enslavement not apply at least as much, and with potentially even more dramatic consequences, to aggression among the settled peoples and kingdoms of Europe, who Locke assumes are parties to the comprehensive territorial settlement, as it would to native peoples who may or may not be? The most radical thrust of Locke's punitive law of nature is perhaps directed against belligerent European autocrats such as Louis XIV and much less suited to colonial apologetics.15"
"32","Although Locke suggests that where there is “more Land, than the Inhabitants possess, and make use of, anyone has liberty to make use of the waste,” he also displays a remarkable insouciance about this advantage claiming, “but there Conquerors take little care to possess themselves of the Lands of the Vanquished” (II, 184). Locke's underlying assumption here is that wasteland is unlikely anywhere money is widely used and available. This argument clearly leaves open the possibility for colonial powers to claim “waste” land that they might assert (reasonably or not) is not materially connected to the well‐being of a people in a distinct territorial area. However, this argument serves as moral justification for colonial possession only with the crucial qualification that the land is not claimed by people “who have consented to the use of Money,” a possibility increasingly foreclosed in Locke's view by the widespread use of money in his day (II, 45, 49, 184). Nonmonetarized native peoples would not, in this argument, constitute societies included in the implicit territorial settlement underlying Locke's international society, and thus are, or were, subject to colonial predations with respect to surplus land they could not “possess, and make use of” from which the monetarized societies of Europe were largely immune. However, Locke does suggest a version of the claim right to vacant or uncultivated land that holds potentially explosive populist implications even in Europe: “I have heard it affirmed that in Spain itself, a Man may be permitted to plough, sow, and reap, without being disturbed, upon Land he has no other Title to, but only his making use of it” (II, 36). With this statement, Locke takes a jab, if only in passing, at the premier colonial power of the age. In the final analysis, Locke's argument is perhaps best understood as a rights claim to vacant land that has colonial implications but is also historically contingent on the development of a global monetary system that would, by his own formulation, gradually make colonialism morally indefensible."
"33","This article has tried to show that Locke's thoughts on international relations are better understood by shifting from the familiar discourse of natural law and sovereignty to a discourse of international society and self‐government. The normative content of this international society rests on the recognition of distinct societies with an inherent right of self‐government, a notion of just war as self‐defense and law enforcement, and the identification of the source of international norms in a combination of natural law and conventional legitimist principles."
"34","It may be fitting to conclude by briefly exploring Locke's vision of international society with a view to considering its application to the contemporary debate about sovereignty and intervention. The debate over the ethics of intervention raises fundamental questions about territorial integrity, political independence, and the right of nations to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations. This debate typically involves two distinct conceptions of international society: the pluralist and solidarist models (Bull 1966, 52).16 Pluralists derive the normative content of international society primarily from the mutual recognition of the component societal units' right to exist and promote their diverse national ends with minimal outside interference (Jackson 2000, 156–84; Mayall 2000, 14). In the pluralist model of international society, as in international law generally, the emphasis is on the principle of nonintervention and the primacy of state sovereignty. The solidarist model, on the other hand, maintains that human solidarity assumes moral priority to state sovereignty since distinct national communities can reach broad agreement about substantive moral standards. According to solidarists, the use of force is legitimate when conceived as a form of law enforcement including not only self‐defense and collective security, but also the possibility of intervening to uphold the shared moral purposes of international society (Nardin 2002, 64–70; Wheeler 2000). The tension between the pluralist and solidarist view has, if anything, only intensified with recent developments such as the effort by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (2001) to shift the terms of the debate from the “right of intervention” to the idea of “sovereignty as responsibility” (Bellamy 2003, 326). Proponents of the idea of international society, however conceived, feel the pressing need to establish clear criteria as to which kinds of situations constitute a legitimate exception to the general principle of state sovereignty and nonintervention underlying international law.         "
"35","Locke offers a perspective on the contemporary debate about intervention that is neither wholly pluralist nor solidarist. With the pluralist model, Locke views the mutual recognition of the constituent units' right to exist as an important normative component of international society. Moreover, he shares the pluralists' enthusiasm for the diverse ends available to independent communities formed by the consent of their people and embodying the moral purpose of society in their distinctive fashion. Locke demonstrates no desire or confidence that international institutions will replace self‐governing societies as the primary actors in the international state of nature. However, as we have seen, Locke departs from the pluralists insofar as he does not share their emphasis on the moral primacy of state sovereignty. Rather, more in keeping with the solidarist model, Locke's state of nature grounds an idea of human solidarity prior to the state that legitimizes the use of force broadly conceived as a form of law enforcement. While Locke does not deal systematically with the normative content of international morality, especially with regard to the status of individuals in international society, he does present a vision for the basis of international agreement about substantive moral standards in the generalities of the law of nature."
"36","In order to develop a Lockean reading of the ethics of intervention, we must piece together various aspects of his argument about international society. The law of nature that grounds the right of each “to preserve himself” also commands “the preservation of Society” (II, 6, 134). The underlying tension between self‐preservation and preservation of society only intensifies in international society wherein preservation of one society may conflict with the command to “preserve the rest of Mankind” (II, 6; Grant 1987, 128). In the case of both the individual and society Locke is adamant that the duty of universal preservation only assumes genuine moral saliency when it “comes not in competition” with communal or self‐preservation. Locke clearly establishes that the overarching moral purpose of each society is the security and welfare of its own people, and thus any moral duty on states to intervene can never be more than an imperfect duty qualified by the danger involved. On its face, this formulation of global responsibility appears to provide little guidance for the ethics of intervention. Does the natural law command to “preserve the rest of Mankind’ authorize or even require states and international society to intervene in order, for example, to end humanitarian disasters or severe oppression when their own safety or prosperity is not in jeopardy?         "
"37","Locke's discussion of the Turkish occupation of Greece may be significant in this regard. On one level, it is meant as an illustration of the natural right of revolution, a call for the Greeks to “cast off the Turkish yoke … whenever they have a power to do it” (II, 192). Locke clearly asserts the nondomination right of Greek society, or any distinct society that retains its inherent right of self‐government despite the loss of political independence through conquest. What is not so clear, however, is whether Locke intended the Greek example to be simply an objective observation about the natural right of revolution, or if it can be construed as an appeal for intervention by sympathetic European states on behalf of the Greek people. As a theoretical question, Locke's general endorsement of the natural law principle of third‐party intervention (II, 8) would be applicable to this situation if, as is likely, Locke and his audience construed Greek society to be the victim of Turkish aggression. Admittedly, Locke does not explicitly identify a right of international society to intervene militarily on behalf of the oppressed Greeks. However, unlike John Stuart Mill for instance, neither does he place strict terms and qualifications on the right of intervention such as requiring a direct appeal for aid or a demonstration of actual military resistance by the oppressed party (Mill [1859] 1873, 238–63; cf. Pitts 2005, 142–43). It is precisely the open‐ended nature of Locke's appeal to the Greek cause that allows intervention to be, at least, a plausible interpretation of his broader intention.         "
"38","While the Greek example may suggest Locke's openness to international support for, and even intervention in, wars of national liberation, contemporary analysts generally believe it is a much more questionable proposition to consider intervention in the purely internal affairs of a sovereign nation (Hoffman 1996, 19; Walzer 1977, 106; Wight 1966, 112–13; but see Teson 1988, 15–16). However, Locke's account of lawful conquest contains the core of an argument for even more direct intervention in the internal affairs of another nation than we saw in the Greek case. Locke's theory of selective war guilt proposed that the people of a given society are no more to be thought responsible for external aggression than they are “to be thought guilty of any Violence or Oppression their Gouvernours should use upon the People themselves, or any Part of their Fellow Subjects, they having impowered them no more to the one, than to the other” (II, 179). Locke employs the argument that aggressive war violates the raison d'etre of society and is thus inconceivable as a delegated power of legitimate government. One effect of Locke's moral parallel between external aggression and domestic oppression is to present every lawful conquest as a kind of foreign intervention to liberate an oppressed people who can no more be thought to authorize aggressive war by their government against others as against themselves. The theoretical distinction between government and society allows Locke to suggest that society is the party injured by an aggressive government (Lowenthal 1988, 132). The extension of this logic to aggression against “Part” of society forms the basis for a conception of sovereign responsibility that makes government oppression of minorities a justification not only of revolution, but also conceivably for intervention to aid oppressed groups.         "
"39","External aggression and domestic oppression against a “Part of their Fellow Subjects” violates the same basic principle of natural justice. Insofar as a given society may no more be held responsible for one than the other, then at least in principle, international society is no less restricted in its right to punish those responsible for either kind of aggression. Although Locke does not detail the precise forms of government action that would constitute such oppression of minorities, the logic of the Greek example, as a kind of minority within an empire, suggests the framework for establishing the normative content of international standards regarding the status of individuals that might include a prohibition against discriminatory treatment or the systematic violation of fundamental natural rights pertaining to physical security, ownership and inheritance of property, and freedom of religion. In lieu of concrete international agreement on the substantive normative content of the individual rights governments are charged to secure, Locke's theory arguably limns the outline of what form such an agreement might take."
"40","Another topic that receives considerable attention in the contemporary debate over intervention is the idea of “supreme humanitarian emergencies” (Bellamy 2003, 335–38; Nardin 2003, 66–67; Walzer 1977, 251–54). Even strong proponents of the principle of nonintervention frequently admit that there are rare situations of extreme humanitarian crisis such as genocide or natural disaster that “shock the conscience of mankind” and may justify intervention. Locke's account of lawful conquest speaks to this issue indirectly. His insistence on the humane treatment of those conquered people not directly implicated in aggression provides a rather stringent moral framework regulating how states and militaries should conduct themselves when intervening. The law of nature “that willeth the preservation of all Mankind as much as is possible” (II, 182) requires lawful conquerors to respect the property rights of noncombatants, and even to remit legitimate reparation if it threatens the survival of innocent people. With this argument, Locke indicates that a lawful conqueror assumes a considerable measure of moral responsibility for the security and well‐being of the defeated people. Does this notion of responsibility extend globally into a justification for intervention in order, for example, to relieve a supreme humanitarian emergency?         "
"41","Although Locke does not address this question directly, the general direction of his argument suggests two distinct lines of thought on the issue of humanitarian intervention. On the one hand, he indicates that the normal rules of justice such as those applying to reparation may be suspended by the greater humanitarian need of those “who are in danger to perish without” these resources (II, 183). By this reasoning, supplemented by the natural law imperative to preserve humankind, Locke could endorse temporary suspension of the nonintervention principle, at the very least, to relieve rare and severe cases of humanitarian crisis such as mass starvation.17 On the other hand, there is an aspect of the domestic analogy with decidedly more radical implications for intervention. According to Locke, the federative power that conducts a commonwealth's foreign policy “answers to the Power every Man naturally had before he entered into Society” (II, 145). The natural executive power of the individual includes the general, or even universal, right to “joyn with” another that is injured and assist in the punishment of the offender (II, 10). One implication of Locke's argument would be that when individuals in the state of nature transfer this punishment right to their government it is thereby authorized by this third‐party right to punish governments that abuse their own people and even to prosecute violators of the law of nature who may escape punishment in their own country (Simmons 1992, 129–30). While the claim that borders may be crossed in order to punish wrongdoers does not necessarily translate into a similar permission with respect to protecting the innocent, the logic of punishment and protection are clearly interwoven in the moral framework of Locke's international society; and thus the extraterritorial implications of such a punishment right could make humanitarian intervention a common feature of Lockean international relations.         "
"42","While Locke's argument may be said to support the logic of humanitarian intervention, he offers little guidance with respect to the vital question regarding who, if anyone, would have an obligation to fight in humanitarian causes.18 There is a clear Lockean argument that a soldier's duty to fight in a just, primarily defensive, war follows from one's obligation to one's own society and the government's legitimate power to preserve the society (II, 139, 143). However, the moral duty to fight in wars of intervention on behalf of others is more ambiguous. Possibly these wars would have to be fought solely by volunteer armies. However, another potential source for the individual's obligation to fight in wars of humanitarian intervention is the obligation arising from the comprehension of the individual's natural executive power into the federative power of the government. By this reasoning, the individual would authorize the government to execute the natural law in the international sphere on the same moral basis that he or she is obliged to assist in the execution of the civil law internally. Of course, according to Locke, the individual would still have the natural right to decide whether the intervention by his or her government is legitimate or constitutes an abuse of power and thus would always retain the right of resistance and even revolution.         "
"43","Locke's treatment of the moral basis of international relations outlines what he takes to be the promise and problems of international society. He exhibits promise regarding possible agreement about international norms pertaining to territorial integrity, the limits on conquest, and the mutual recognition of the right of self‐government inhering in distinct societies. Locke even provides a rough sketch of the normative basis for a way of thinking about rights of individuals and minorities in the international context. There are also, however, definite limits to Locke's optimism about international cooperation. He shows little confidence that the natural law principles of morality can be effectively embodied in international institutions. Moreover, the latent possibility of anarchy is no less apparent where each society is its own judge of humanitarian justice, than it is for the individual in the state of nature. Indeed, Locke's famous epistemological scepticism about the notion of innate moral sense, as well as his deep pessimism with respect to the normative value of historical tradition and the customary law of nations, point to what he must have seen as powerful social, cultural, and intellectual obstacles to the formalization and effective enforcement of international norms of behavior (I, 58; II, 103, 175, 180, 186; Locke [1700] 1975, 65–84). In the final analysis, however, Locke's account of the moral basis of international relations may speak more to his cautious hope for general moral and intellectual progress, than to a radical transformation in the international state of nature. The natural, if more distant, corollary to the creation of citizens who develop the proper rational habts and conduct befitting rights bearing individuals in liberal society may be the global citizen who respects and secures rights at home and in international society. Perhaps the prescriptive thrust of Locke's theory of international society aimed toward the inculcation of liberal principles in areas and aspects hitherto scarcely observed.         "
