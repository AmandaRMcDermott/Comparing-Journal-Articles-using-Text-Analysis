"1","This article examines the 1989–2003 period. It covers the two terms of President Carlos Menem (1989–95, 1995–99) of the Partido Justicialista (PJ), the abbreviated tenure of President Fernando de la Rúa (1999–2001) of the Unión Cívica Radical (UCR), which formed a governmental alliance with the Frente País Solidario (FREPASO), and the tenure of interim President Eduardo Duhalde (2002–2003) of the PJ. In this section we provide a series of general conclusions from the extant literature on contemporary Argentine politics."
"2","First, Argentina is a presidential democracy. The president is endowed with considerable constitutional powers, including a strong veto and decree authority. It has a bicameral legislature and a federal system of government in which provincial governors exercise substantial autonomy (Eaton 2002; Spiller and Tommasi N.d.). The 24 provinces receive a number of deputies (minimum of five) proportional to their 1980 population. The Argentine Congress, while more a reactive blunt veto player than proactive agenda setter, is nevertheless an important actor in the policy process (Eaton 2002; Jones et al. 2002).         "
"3","Second, during the 1989–2003 period two political parties (the PJ and UCR) dominated the political arena. For instance, in the Chamber the PJ occupied nearly half of the seats (median of 45%, range of 38–51%), and the UCR nearly one‐third (32%, 25–45%). The remaining seats were held by a multitude of minor parties, with the third largest delegation (a status held by four parties) only accounting for a median of 5% of the seats.2"
"4","Third, the locus of partisan politics is the province (Calvo and Murillo 2003; De Luca, Jones, and Tula 2002; Eaton 2002; Gibson and Calvo 2000; Remmer and Wibbels 2000; Spiller and Tommasi N.d.). Political careers are normally provincial‐based (with even positions in the national government often determined by provincial factors), and the base of political support for politicians and parties is concentrated at the provincial level.         "
"5","Fourth, a single person or small group of leaders generally dominates political parties at the provincial level (De Luca, Jones, and Tula 2002; Jones et al. 2002). In provinces where the party controls the governorship, with rare exceptions the governor is the undisputed (or at least dominant) boss of the provincial party. In other provinces where the governorship is not held by the party, the party is nonetheless often dominated in a comparable manner (with a greater amount of space for intraparty opponents) by a single individual. Finally, in the remaining provinces where the party does not control the governorship and there is not a dominant boss, there is a small group of leaders who predominate in party life.         "
"6","Fifth, this dominance of the provincial party is based principally on patronage, pork barrel politics, and clientelism (Calvo and Murillo 2003; De Luca, Jones, and Tula 2002; Remmer and Wibbels 2000). Dominance of the provincial party requires a boss be able to defeat any rival in a party primary. Patronage, pork barrel activities, and clientelism are important for success in general elections, but are indispensable for success in primary elections. In addition, patronage, pork barrel, and clientelistic‐based support often has the same anticipated reaction effect on potential intraparty challengers that a large campaign war chest has in the United States; it causes them to desist from any attempt to defeat the party boss.3"
"7","The electorate for primaries is party members alone or party members and independents.4 When a primary is held, success depends almost entirely on material resources. As former (1999–2003) Chubut governor José Lizurume recently stated, “la interna es aparato puro”[the primary is pure machine] (Diario El Chubut, 7/18/03).         "
"8","Sixth, Chamber deputies are elected from closed party lists in multimember districts, lists that are created at the provincial level through elite arrangement or party primary (primaries are held using closed lists) (De Luca, Jones, and Tula 2002). In most instances the reelection decision for deputies (as well as their political future) lies primarily with the provincial party boss(es), not with the individual deputy. Furthermore, these bosses practice rotation, with the consequence being very low reelection rates for deputies. Between 1989 and 2003 only a median of 19% (20% and 12% for the PJ and UCR, respectively) of deputies achieved immediate reelection, with an overwhelming majority returning to political posts in their province, or going to national level posts, often in “representation” of their province (Jones et al. 2002). Once a deputy obtained a position on the party list however, his/her probability of reelection skyrocketed to a median of 73% (92% and 69% for the PJ and UCR), illustrating the importance of the influence exercised by the party boss over the list creation process. In sum, deputies are in most cases dependent on the provincial party boss and hence possess limited political autonomy.         "
"9","The above description suggests we should expect provincial factors to have a powerful effect on deputy behavior in the Chamber. Provincial party bosses generally exercise a profound amount of influence over both who is elected as a deputy as well as what the political future of a deputy will be. The following two sections test for a “provincial” influence in two ways. First, an analysis of the number of issue dimensions present in Chamber roll‐call voting is conducted. Second, the influence of provincial party bosses (especially governors) on the behavior of their provincial copartisans in the Chamber is examined."
"10","Poole and Rosenthal's seminal work identifies two dimensions to roll‐call voting in the U.S. House. The dominant first dimension “almost always picks up the fundamental economic issues that separate the two major parties of the time” (1997, 27). This dimension “can be thought of as ranging from strong loyalty to one party (Jeffersonian Republicans or the Democrats) to weak loyalty to either party and to strong loyalty to the second, opposing party (Federalists, Whigs, or Republicans)” (46). The second, regional, dimension “divides the parties internally over regional issues” (27)."
"11","The above discussion of the prominent role of the provinces and provincial actors in Argentine politics suggests that, in addition to a partisan dimension, a similar, regional, dimension may also be present in Argentina. In particular, several authors (Calvo and Murillo 2003; Eaton 2002; Gibson 1997; Gibson and Calvo 2000; Sawers 1996) contrast the stark differences between the populous advanced industrial (metropolitan) provinces (Buenos Aires, Capital Federal, Córdoba, Santa Fe) and their less populous and developed counterparts in the interior (periphery). They underscore the salient metropolitan‐periphery cleavage that exists among the Argentine provinces, suggesting its potential to serve as a second, regional, dimension comparable to that observed in the United States.5"
"12","We examine roll‐call votes held between July 8, 1989 and May 24, 2003.6 These data represent six full two‐year legislative periods, corresponding to the Chamber's biennial partial renovations (1989–91, 1991–93, 1993–95, 1995–97, 1997–99, 1999–2001), and two partial periods (July 8 to December 9, 1989 and December 10, 2001 to May 24, 2003).         "
"13","To evaluate the dimensionality of Chamber roll‐call votes we use the Bayesian estimation procedure developed by Jackman and his colleagues (Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004; Jackman 2001).7 With a one‐dimensional model, the roll‐call vote analysis is expressed as:            "
"14","Uniform (1.0, −1.0) priors are given to the density over the ideal points Xi. These uniform priors result in ideal points located within the intervals of 1.0 and −1.0. For one‐dimensional fits we assigned initial values for the ideal points, with the PJ at 1.0, and the UCR at −1.0.9 Most other parties were placed at 0.0. Normal priors are given for the discrimination parameters βj: βj∼N(0,2).10"
"15","After obtaining discrimination parameters for each period, we can determine how many discrimination parameters are distinguishable from zero. The discrimination parameters βj show “how change in Xi translates into support for proposal j” (Jackman 2001, 229). If only a small number of discrimination parameters are distinguishable from zero in a one‐dimensional model, then there may exist higher dimensions in the data.         "
"16"," Table 1 provides information on the extent to which the roll‐call votes achieved discrimination on this single dimension for each of the eight legislative periods. The lowest percentage of votes that achieved discrimination is 86.2% (1997–99), while the highest is 98.8% (1999–01). The median percentage of votes that achieved discrimination with respect to the recovered policy continuum is 95%. These results indicate there exists only one dimension underlying the observed policy space in the Chamber between 1989 and 2003.         "
"17","In addition, by plotting discrimination parameters (posterior means) against the percentage of deputies voting “Yes,” we obtained a figure for each period in which the roll‐call votes that achieved discrimination on the single dimension are distinguished from those that did not. By examining these eight figures (available upon request), we can determine if a one‐dimensional model is a reasonable fit to the data (Jackman 2001). Since there are few votes that were close and failed to discriminate among deputies simultaneously, it is very unlikely that a higher‐dimensional model would provide a better fit to the data.         "
"18","Furthermore, all votes that failed to discriminate on this dimension were examined in detail (through analysis of parliamentary debates and newspaper coverage as well as interviews with deputies in office at the time of the vote) in search of any common trait shared among any of them. No conceivable second dimension was detected. These votes were on transient topics that do not belong to any consistent dimension."
"19","Similar to the United States, roll‐call vote behavior in Argentina occurs along a partisan dimension. One end of that dimension is occupied by the PJ (where the median ideal point of the party's deputies for the eight periods was 0.58), and the other by the UCR (with a median ideal point of −0.63), with a considerable gap (median of 1.14) separating the two parties. The amount of overlap between the PJ and UCR legislators also is extremely low, with a median of only 4% of the PJ and UCR deputy ideal points having to be moved to yield complete separation between the two parties."
"20","However, unlike in the United States, where a less salient regional dimension has coexisted with the dominant partisan dimension, in Argentina virtually all roll‐call vote behavior occurs along this single partisan dimension. In spite of the large literature demonstrating the importance of provincial politics as well as highlighting a prominent metropolitan‐periphery cleavage, no provincial or regional based dimension was detected."
"21","The combination of the provincial‐centric nature of Argentine politics and the powerful control wielded by provincial party bosses over the election of deputies and their political future leads us to expect governors to exercise an important degree of influence over the behavior of their provincial copartisans in the Chamber (Carey and Reinhardt 2004; Jones et al. 2002; Spiller and Tommasi N.d.). Given their superior resources and institutional advantages, a provincial boss who is a governor will on average be more powerful and thus have a greater ability to affect the political future of deputies belonging to their provincial party delegation (PPD), than a boss who does not control the governorship.         "
"22","In their innovative work on Brazil, Carey and Reinhardt (2004) present a model where this gubernatorial effect is hypothesized to influence legislator behavior under two separate conditions. Where the governor and the national party (i.e., the president and/or legislative party leadership) share the same position on the legislation being voted upon (reinforcing principals), when a PPD is from a province where a copartisan is governor, PPD behavior is more homogenous than when a copartisan is not governor. The more powerful this governor is, the greater the level of homogeneity. Where the governor and the national party do not share the same position (competing principals), there is a curvilinear relationship between governor power and PPD homogeneity, with homogeneity initially decreasing as a governor becomes more influential and then, at the point of national party‐governor power parity, homogeneity increasing. Given its curvilinear nature, we cannot fully test the competing principals hypothesis, but we can test the portion most relevant for Argentina, where governors possess at least power parity with the national party.         "
"23","The analysis population consists of the PPDs, of two deputies or more, of the PJ and the UCR during each of the eight legislative periods. Given the different conditions under which the parties' respective deputies functioned, homogeneity data for the PJ and UCR are not entirely comparable. Since pooling data for the two parties obfuscates more than it elucidates, we examine them separately."
"24","PPD homogeneity is measured using the deputy ideal points discussed earlier. First, the standard deviation (SD) of each PPD (the standard deviation of its deputies' median ideal points) of two deputies or more is calculated for each of the eight periods. Second, the grand mean of these respective PJ and UCR PPD SDs is calculated for each of the eight periods. Third, PPD homogeneity is measured as the difference between the party's grand mean SD for the respective period and the SD of each PPD. Higher (positive) values signify the PPD is more homogeneous than the party delegation's grand mean, while lower (negative) values signify the PPD is less homogenous. This dependent variable (PPD HOMOGENEITY) ranges from −0.36 to 0.25 for the PJ and −0.31 to 0.25 for the UCR."
"25"," Carey and Reinhardt (2004) measure governor influence using a binary variable (1 if the PPD was from a province governed by a copartisan, and 0 if not). We employ an identical variable (GOVERNOR). The relationship between GOVERNOR and the level of PPD homogeneity is expected to be positive (Carey and Reinhardt 2004).         "
"26","Given Brazilian data limitations, Carey and Reinhardt (2004) could not distinguish among governors in terms of their power. We, however, are able to control for two vital factors that influence gubernatorial power. First, the rules on the immediate reelection of the governor vary across provinces and within provinces over time. Governors eligible to run for reelection (and hence much more likely to be able to continue influencing deputies' careers) are hypothesized to have more homogenous PPDs than their lame duck counterparts (Carey and Reinhardt 2004). GOV. REELECTION is coded 1 if the governor was eligible to run for immediate reelection, and 0 if not. Second, governors vary in their level of intraparty opposition at the provincial level. An excellent measure of the extent of this opposition is whether the governor faced a serious primary challenge to obtain the party's nomination for governor. Governors who did not face a significant level of intraparty opposition are considered more powerful (resulting in higher levels of PPD homogeneity) than governors who faced significant opposition. In the event the governor's candidacy was uncontested or he/she won a primary by a margin of more than 50% of the vote, GOV. PARTY CONTROL is coded 1, otherwise it is coded 0 (De Luca, Jones, and Tula 2002).         "
"27","Because of the data's pooled cross‐sectional structure, two sets of control variables are incorporated. Binary variables (splines) are included for the different PPD sizes (two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine members), with delegations of 10 or more the excluded category. Splines also are included for seven of the eight legislative periods (1989 is the excluded category). Since they are employed solely for control purposes, and due to space limitations, the results for these variables are omitted from Table 2.         "
"28"," Table 2 provides 10 models.11 Models 1 and 6 (PJ and UCR, respectively) display the results when, among the influential variables, only GOVERNOR is included. Models 2 and 7 include all three influential variables, but exclude the splines. Models 3 and 8 include all of the variables, while Models 4 and 9 are identical with the exception that a fixed effects model (the cross sectional unit is the PPD) is utilized. Models 5 and 10 are limited to PPDs from provinces where the PJ and UCR held the governorship.         "
"29","The fact that a PPD is from a province where a copartisan is governor exercises no influence on PPD homogeneity. Furthermore, whether or not the governor is powerful (i.e., can seek reelection, faces insignificant intraparty opposition) also has no effect on PPD homogeneity. This is the case both when examining the complete population, as well as when examining the subset of cases where the PPD was from a province governed by a copartisan (Models 5 and 10)."
"30","These results provide no support for the reinforcing principals hypothesis. In a similar vein, support for the competing principals hypothesis would have entailed powerful governors having PPDs that were significantly more homogenous than those of less powerful governors. No such effect was detected. In sum, analysis of PPD homogeneity uncovers no provincial related effects.12"
"31","A review of the contemporary literature on Argentine politics underscores the vital importance of provincial‐level factors for the functioning of the country's political system. When, however, Chamber deputy behavior is analyzed using roll‐call vote data, no provincial effects are detected. This article explains this apparent disjuncture between the literature and the roll‐call vote analysis through the application of a modified version of Cartel Theory."
"32","Cartel Theory (Cox and McCubbins 1993) was developed to explain the functioning of the U.S. House. In spite of the dramatic differences between the institutional contexts in which the United States and Argentine legislatures are located, this study demonstrates how Cartel Theory can be adapted to explain the functioning of the legislature in an “intermediate” democracy such as Argentina.         "
"33","Under Cartel Theory, U.S. House members are considered to be independent entrepreneurs, exercising a great deal of control over their political careers (Finocchiaro and Rohde 2002). Aldrich and Rohde (2000) and Cox and McCubbins (1993) highlight the manner in which individual representatives delegate power to the House party leadership to further their own reelection efforts both generally (party reputation) and specifically (perks of office, pork) as well as to influence public policy. This delegation to the party leadership helps the representatives achieve their collective goals.            "
"34","Argentine deputies do not possess a level of autonomy comparable to that of U.S. representatives, but most Argentine provincial party bosses do. Hence, in both legislatures delegation occurs. But whereas delegation is by the representatives to the House party leadership in the United States, delegation is by the provincial party bosses to the Chamber party leadership in Argentina. These bosses delegate in order to further their collective goal of maintaining control of the provincial party machine and maintaining (governors) or obtaining (bosses in the opposition at the provincial level) control of the governorship."
"35","Another difference between the two countries is the extent to which one can separate the party leadership in the legislature from the President. In the United States these two institutions are relatively separate political entities (although see Rohde 1991), whereas in Argentina the majority party leadership in the Chamber is in most instances a faithful servant of the President (e.g., between 1989 and 2003 the Chamber majority party leadership always was comprised of individuals loyal to the President). As a consequence, and similar to the case in most presidential democracies, the distinction between the President and his party's leadership in the Congress is not as clear cut in Argentina as is the case in the United States (Cox and Morgenstern 2001).            "
"36","The U.S. House majority leadership employs a number of mechanisms to insure it has as complete information as possible on the preferences of its rank‐and‐file members and at the same time to insure these members are aware of the leadership's positions and strategy. These mechanisms include the activities of the party whips, the representation of different party sectors in leadership positions, and the holding of regular caucus meetings (Cox and McCubbins 1993; Rohde 1991). The leadership then uses this information to draft legislation that will obtain passage (positive agenda control), to manipulate the legislative agenda to insure legislation is only voted upon when conditions are appropriate (negative agenda control), and to determine to what extent individual, or groups of, representatives will have to be pressured or enticed into supporting legislation (Cox and McCubbins 1993; Rohde 1991). The leadership possesses a variety of tools with which to pressure and entice representatives such as its control over the distribution of committee assignments and the flow of legislation (e.g., its ability to coordinate across policies), and its power to influence the amount of pork that flows to a representative's district.            "
"37","The Argentine Chamber majority leadership employs a number of mechanisms to insure it has as complete information as possible on the preferences of the party's provincial bosses as well as to insure the bosses (and deputies) are aware of the leadership's preferences (which are generally also those of the President). These mechanisms are of two types: intralegislative and extralegislative."
"38","The intralegislative mechanisms include guaranteeing that most provincial bosses have a representative on the party leadership committee. Between 1989 and 2003 a median of 66% of the majority party's deputies came from a province with a member on the leadership committee. Another mechanism is the party caucus meeting held prior to every session, where the leadership explains its positions/strategy on upcoming legislation and listens to the deputies' concerns (and indirectly those of their provincial bosses). Finally, the leadership maintains direct lines of communication with the provincial bosses, though the latter normally interact with the leadership via their deputies."
"39","The extralegislative mechanisms stem from the prominent role of the President (Executive Branch) in the functioning of the majority party in the Chamber. The Executive thus serves as an additional nexus between the provincial party bosses and the Chamber leadership, and at the same time plays a prominent role in informing the provincial bosses of the Executive's policy preferences. The Executive utilizes several methods to learn the bosses' preferences and to inform them of the Executive's preferences. The most basic is the ability of most copartisans (especially governors) to contact the President directly to discuss important issues. On a more day‐to‐day basis, the Executive maintains fluid relations with the provinces through the activities of different individuals. While these individuals have varied over time (in name, number, and the formal position occupied), they share the common trait of possessing the confidence of, and direct access to, the President. Party bosses (especially governors) and national cabinet ministers also maintain an open dialogue, and in the most important policy areas (e.g., education, public works) there exist formal ministerial working groups consisting of all provincial cabinet ministers in that area."
"40","The Chamber leadership (often in conjunction with the Executive) uses the information gleaned from these interactions to obtain the legislative passage of the party's (normally the President's) policy agenda. On legislation that directly affects the provinces it insures the provincial bosses' interests are incorporated (positive agenda control) either in the specific piece of legislation or through some type of side‐payment.13 For legislation that does not directly affect the provincial bosses' interests, the Chamber leadership has the necessary information to know to what extent (if any) it has to entice or pressure the provincial bosses to obtain the support of their deputies for the legislation. In a similar manner, provincial bosses gather information on the extent to which they can employ the votes of their deputies in the Chamber to extract benefits on this nonprovincial‐oriented legislation. While the bosses generally leave the Chamber's day‐to‐day functioning to the Chamber leadership, they remain alert for instances where the President needs to pass vital or unpopular legislation, and hence may be willing to provide additional benefits to the bosses in exchange for their support. The default however is for the deputies, absent instructions to the contrary from their provincial boss, to follow the instructions of the Chamber leadership. Finally, in the event an agreement cannot be reached on legislation, the leadership can insure the legislation does not reach the floor (negative agenda control).            "
"41","The Chamber leadership possesses a variety of tools, primarily economic and wielded by the Executive, with which to pressure and entice provincial bosses. During the 1989–2003 period, the median province obtained 72% of its revenue from national government transfers, over which the Executive possesses a great deal of discretional control (Tommasi, Saiegh, and Sanguinetti 2001). While the Executive is legally obligated to transfer approximately one‐half of the funds, even with these “ guaranteed funds” it possesses considerable latitude. For instance, it can delay transfer for a few months, which often wreaks havoc on provincial finances (it also can send less than the amount merited). Conversely, it can advance funds by a few months, thereby allowing provinces to resolve immediate financial crises. The Executive possesses even greater discretion regarding other transfers ranging from the implementation of national government programs (e.g., targeting specific provinces and municipalities for disproportional benefits) to the distribution of purely discretionary funds (Gibson 1997; Gibson and Calvo 2000; Tommasi, Saiegh, and Sanguinetti 2001). In addition, the Executive regularly assists provinces by implementing programs that bail out bankrupt pension systems, rescue provincial bonds, etc. (Eaton 2002; Sawers 1996; Tommasi, Saiegh, and Sanguinetti 2001). Finally, the Executive is continually creating and modifying a host of programs that subsidize agriculture, employment, energy, industry, social assistance, and transportation in the provinces. Provincial party bosses (especially governors) who support the majority party initiatives in the Chamber are rewarded via the above mechanisms by the Executive, while those who fail to support the initiatives receive fewer transfers and subsidies and are less likely to be included in the bail‐out programs.            "
"42","In the United States, the institutional rules provide representatives with a strong incentive to cultivate a personal vote through their roll‐call vote behavior (Aldrich and Rohde 2000). This often causes them to vote against the party line when it conflicts with the preferences of their constituencies (geographic, primary), an action often condoned by the party leadership if it believes voting the party line will undermine the representative's reelection chances. Since the representative's reelection constituency is concerned with a wide range of issues, this potential leadership‐constituency conflict is latent in a majority of the roll‐call votes.            "
"43","In Argentina, the institutional rules (see our earlier discussion) provide deputies with a very weak incentive to cultivate a personal vote through their roll‐call vote behavior; their career is determined by the provincial party boss, not the voters. Furthermore, unlike the case for the U.S. representatives, provincial bosses are primarily concerned with a limited range of legislation (that affecting the resources they receive), and hence a potential leadership‐constituency conflict between the Chamber leadership and the provincial bosses is latent in a more limited percentage of the roll‐call votes (primarily issues that directly affect the resources received by/interests of the provinces, which represented a median of 34% of the votes during the 1989–2003 period). Finally, since the Chamber leadership realizes that maintaining the provincial bosses' support is vital to the broader goal of implementing the President's policy agenda (e.g., the leadership coordinates across policies), when legislation that directly concerns the provinces is on the floor, the leadership attempts to insure the bosses' preferences are accounted for (either in the legislation or through side payments).14"
"44","Majority control of the legislature in the United States is based on a ideological, reputational, and, to a lesser extent, distributive logic (Cox and McCubbins 1993; Finocchiaro and Rohde 2002). In Argentina, majority control of the legislature is based on a similar mix, but with the distributive incentives easily dominating ideology and party reputation. The goals of the provincial party bosses are best served by distributive policy, since their hold on power is based primarily on patronage, pork, and clientelism. However, provincial bosses also are concerned with the national reputation of their party, since its success at the national level affects them in three ways. First, the success of their party at the national level is vital to its maintaining (or obtaining) control of the presidency, and hence the distributive benefits they receive from “their” president. A similar argument applies to majority control of the legislature and the benefits it provides. Finally, the party's electoral success in the province is affected by the national party's reputation (Kellam and Alemán 2004; Remmer and Gélineau 2003).            "
"45","There is considerable variance in the level of control exercised by Argentine provincial party bosses over the political careers of deputies and other politicians. At one extreme are situations where there is a single boss who is governor, is unencumbered by any constraints on his/her immediate reelection, and faces no significant intraparty opposition. At the other extreme are situations where the party does not control the governorship and no one person exercises dominance over the provincial party. Most PJ deputies have come from provinces with a PJ governor, who in all but a few instances was the undisputed party boss. Between 1989 and 2003 a median of 73% of the PJ delegation came from provinces with a PJ governor (range of 69–80%). In contrast, only a median of 24% of the UCR delegation came from provinces where the UCR held the governorship (range of 11–38%; 34% for 1999–2001). In the PJ an overwhelming majority of delegation was by provincial bosses to the Chamber party leadership, with the individual deputies most commonly following orders from the provinces. In the UCR, there was a broader mix in the distribution of deputies for whom provincial bosses were delegating power on their behalf and who themselves were the bosses delegating power, although the former easily represented the majority of the UCR delegation."
"46","In the United States, the representatives are the crucial actors who delegate power to the party leadership, while in Argentina provincial party bosses are the key players who engage in this delegation (on behalf of their deputies), but the end effect on the functioning of the legislature is quite similar. Just as U.S. representatives delegate power to the House party leadership to achieve collective goals, so too do the Argentine provincial bosses delegate power to the Chamber party leadership (and indirectly to the President in the case of the majority party). The majority party leadership uses its majority status (especially negative and positive agenda control) to dominate the legislative process, excluding legislation it believes may pass despite its objection, as well as implementing legislation it desires. The opposition, lacking this agenda control, is left in a very reactive position."
"47","The normal operating procedure in Argentina is for the majority party leadership (generally following presidential directives) to manage the functioning of the Chamber. In equilibrium, the party leadership, not the provincial bosses, exercises the principal day‐to‐day influence over deputy voting behavior. The decisions made by the party leadership are though constantly influenced by the preferences of the provincial bosses (generally on topics that directly affect the provinces), both in terms of what they place on the legislative agenda and in terms of the drafting of the legislation they want to pass."
"48","The above reality in large part explains the absence of provincial factors affecting the dimensions underlying the roll‐call votes and PPD homogeneity. Of course, provincial bosses reserve the right to dissent (via their deputies), and at times they must be called on by the party leadership to control their deputies. Serious dissent by the provincial bosses is however relatively uncommon due to the skill of the majority party leadership (and the President) in internalizing their preferences (i.e., the leadership is a good agent of the provincial bosses)."
"49","There is considerable evidence that in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies the majority party functions as an effective cartel (à la Cox and McCubbins 1993). Given space limitations however, we restrict our focus to two key pieces of evidence that provide support for the applicability of Cartel Theory to the Chamber.            "
"50","As would be expected in a legislature where the majority party functions as an effective cartel (Cox and McCubbins 1993), the Chamber rules provide the majority party leadership with substantial power and nearly complete control over the legislative agenda (Danesi 2003; Jones 2002). This can be seen in the allocation of the most coveted committee chairs, partisan composition of the key committees, and construction of the legislative agenda in the Rules Committee (Comisión de Labor Parlamentaria [CLP]).         "
"51","Between 1989 (December) and 1999, and 2001 and 2003, the PJ delegation was the dominant force in the Chamber, enjoying either an absolute majority or near majority of the seats. The UCR‐FREPASO Alianza occupied a similar position between 1999 and 2001. While an absolute majority was rarely achieved, the majority party possessed a sufficient number of seats (median of 47%, range of 45–51%) such that it was able to exercise majority control of the Chamber, either alone or via the tacit support of a subset of the numerous minor parties. This latter ability was enhanced by the fact that the majority party was always the party of the President, who was in the unique position of possessing substantial resources with which to influence the behavior of nonmajority party deputies."
"52","While the formal and informal Chamber rules provide for the allocation of some committee chairs to the opposition parties, the majority party generally maintains control of the most politically important committees (e.g., the Budget Committee always has a majority party chair; Danesi 2003). The majority party also receives a number of chairs far out of proportion to its number of seats. During the 1989–2003 period, the majority party occupied a median of 77% of the chairs, but only 47% of the seats. Furthermore, the majority party insures it always possesses a working majority on the politically important committees. Finally, the majority party determines which committee(s) will review a bill (allowing it to further refine the partisan distribution of those reviewing key legislation) and which will be the lead committee (Danesi 2003). This latter power is very important, since the lead committee chair can keep a bill from emerging from the committee process, a veto power also held by the chair of the Budget Committee if it is assigned the bill.         "
"53","Prior to all legislative sessions, the CLP drafts the agenda. While the CLP operates in part based on consensus, when a disagreement occurs the majority party's position prevails. When the CLP meets is left to the majority party's discretion. The CLP decides which bills will be discussed during the session, who will speak during the floor debate, the session hours, etc. The majority leadership often unilaterally modifies the agenda without consultation or warning when it considers the modification to be in its best interest (Danesi 2003). Furthermore, the agenda customarily contains more bills than actually can be discussed, thereby providing additional flexibility to the majority leadership.         "
"54","Finally, the majority party leadership possesses several resources with which to directly influence deputy behavior. They include committee assignments (especially chairs), modest budgetary resources, and control over the flow of legislation (Jones 2002).         "
"55","The above presentation indicates that in Argentina the majority party functions as an effective cartel. In this section we evaluate this premise employing the methodology advocated by Cox and McCubbins (2002) as the ideal empirical test for the applicability of Cartel Theory to a given legislature. Cox and McCubbins (2002) employ data on majority and minority roll rates, on the floor and in committees, to assess the agenda control exercised by the majority party over the legislative process in the U.S. House (a party is rolled when a majority of its members are on the losing side of a vote that results in legislation being passed). A complete information model derived from Cartel Theory (Cox and McCubbins 2002) predicts the majority party will never be rolled. Through negative agenda control the majority party leadership keeps legislation that divides the party (and which might lead to the party being rolled) off the floor. Through positive agenda control the majority party leadership obtains the passage of legislation by drafting it (or making alternative arrangements) so as to achieve (at least) the minimum threshold of party support necessary.         "
"56","Neither the PJ nor Alianza possessed an absolute majority of the seats during most of the 1989–2003 period. However, the combination of the majority party's at least near‐majority status in all instances, the fact the opposition was fragmented among a large number of parties, and the reality that the majority party was also the party of the President, turned these near majorities into absolute majorities in terms of negative agenda control and functionally absolute majorities in most instances for positive agenda control."
"57"," Table 3 provides the majority and minority floor roll rates for the 1989–2003 period. Following Cox and McCubbins (2002), analysis is restricted to simple majority final passage votes. During this time the PJ was the majority party, except for 1999–2001 when the UCR‐FREPASO Alianza was in the majority. The principal minority party was the UCR, except for 1999–2001, when the PJ occupied this role.         "
"58","In line with Cartel Theory, the majority party is almost never rolled on the Chamber floor. The majority roll rate ranges from 0% to 2.8%, with a median of 0%. These roll rates are indicative of a majority party with strong negative agenda control. With the exception of 2001–03, the minority roll rates are very high, ranging from 55% to 83%."
"59"," Table 3 also provides majority and minority roll rates for legislation involving the Chamber's most prestigious and powerful committee: the Budget Committee (Danesi 2003). The majority party was never rolled on legislation considered by the Budget Committee. In contrast, the minority party roll rate ranged from 10% to 41%. The lower minority roll rate for committee votes is due to the fact that while roll calls on the Chamber floor are generally held on only controversial issues, all legislation must be voted on nominally in committee.         "
"60","This section provides substantial evidence suggesting the majority party in the Argentine Chamber functions as an effective cartel. The majority party's control over the agenda results in it being rolled very infrequently, while the minority party suffers rolls on a consistent basis. The majority party provincial bosses delegate a considerable amount of power to the Chamber party leadership. The leadership in turn uses its majority power to obtain distributive and reputational benefits for the bosses. The minority party often has weak incentives to support the majority party's agenda, and strong incentives to oppose it, given the general lack of distributive benefits for the minority party and the reputational benefits (these legislators are the party's only national‐level counterweight to the President) that can be achieved through opposing some legislation."
"61","In spite of a large literature demonstrating the strong province‐based nature of Argentine politics, analysis of roll‐call vote behavior in the Argentine Chamber failed to uncover any provincial effects. To the contrary, the roll‐call data highlighted the prominent role played by the national party. The solution to this apparent puzzle lies with the nature of delegation by provincial party bosses. In order to further their collective goal of maintaining control of the provincial party machine and maintaining (governors) or obtaining (opposition provincial bosses) control of the provincial administration, provincial bosses delegate substantial power to their party's leadership in the Chamber, which for the majority party also can be considered delegating to the President, due to the influence he wields over the Chamber majority party leadership. As a consequence of this delegation, the majority party leadership controls the day‐to‐day functioning of the Chamber. In sum, provincial factors have a powerful effect on deputy behavior in the Chamber. Due however to the influence wielded by provincial bosses over political careers in Argentina, and the consequent ability of these bosses to delegate power to the Chamber party leadership, this provincial effect is unobserved in roll‐call analysis of deputy behavior."
"62","This article highlights the utility of Cartel Theory for the understanding of legislatures outside of the United States. The U.S. Congress literature occupies the pinnacle of legislative scholarship, providing the ideal theoretical foundation for those interested in improving general legislative theory. While theories developed to explain U.S. politics cannot be blindly applied to other countries, it is possible to adapt these theories and successfully employ them in other contexts (Gamm and Huber 2002). The development of general theories of legislative institutions in fact requires such extensions and adaptations of existing theory, and given its status as one of the premier theories of legislative organization in the United States, Cartel Theory represents an ideal candidate for extension and adaptation to other democracies.         "
"63","The institutional context in which U.S. congressional politics occurs is rather unique: legislators in virtually all other presidential democracies possess far less autonomy over their political future than their U.S. counterparts. A fundamental assumption undergirding most U.S. theories of congressional organization (including Cartel Theory) is, however, the existence of autonomous legislators. Therefore, in order for many of these theories to be useful for explaining behavior outside of the United States, they need to be adapted to take account of the different institutional context present in other democracies."
"64","In this article, a modified version of Cartel Theory was utilized to help explain why, in spite of the provincial‐based nature of Argentine politics, no provincial effects were observed in analyses of roll‐call vote behavior. The article highlights the strong potential for a similar modified version of Cartel Theory to explain legislative politics in other presidential democracies where neither the individual legislators nor a single centralized national party leadership control the political future of the members of the party's legislative delegation. In these intermediate democracies, state‐level party bosses (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) and intraparty faction bosses (e.g., Paraguay, Taiwan, Uruguay) exercise considerable influence over the careers of legislators. Future research should therefore attempt to analyze legislative politics in these and other intermediate presidential democracies using a modified version of Cartel Theory. In doing so, these studies will provide invaluable further evidence on the viability of Cartel Theory to serve as a foundation for the development of a general theory of legislative institutions."
"65","Included in the initial population are all valid roll‐call votes held during the eight legislative periods. Following Jackman (2001) and Poole and Rosenthal (1997), we exclude lopsided votes in which fewer than 2.5% of the deputies were on the losing side.               "
"66","To insure the sample obtained through the Gibbs sampler is representative of the underlying stationary distribution, we employ a combination of convergence diagnostics as well as a visual inspection of the trace plots. To perform convergence diagnostics and statistical and graphical analysis of Gibbs sampling output we use BOA (Bayesian Output Analysis program; Smith 2003). We utilize two distinct convergence diagnostics (i.e., Geweke and Heidelbergen and Welch; Cowles and Carlin 1996; Smith 2003).               "
"67","These diagnostics indicate that, in the eight periods, the sample output almost perfectly converges to the posterior distribution. More than 96% of the parameters (in the case of both votes and deputies) are statistically significant at the 5% level in the convergence tests. With a few exceptions, deputies who did not achieve convergence did so due to the small percentage of roll calls on which they voted. Following the general methodology of Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004), deputies who failed to register a preference on more than 70% of the roll‐call votes were excluded from the analysis in which the Bayesian ideal points are employed.               "
"68","Assessing Markov Chain convergence is crucial in Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. One strategy for insuring convergence is to run the chain as long as possible. Another strategy is to use multiple chains with widely dispersed starting points (Gelman and Rubin 1992). In our analysis we employ the former strategy. However, as a diagnostic we also conducted the analysis using the latter (with two chains) strategy. Our rates of correct discrimination, estimates of ideal points, goodness of fit results, and discrimination parameters are virtually identical when employing the one chain and two chain strategies (Smith 2003).
