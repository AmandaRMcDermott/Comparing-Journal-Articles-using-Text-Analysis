"1","One of the central concerns within international politics is the question of how states interact in an anarchic international environment. In the absence of compelling mechanisms to enforce agreements, how do states make their promises (or threats) credible? Baldwin captures the essence of this problem when he says, “The projection of credible images is difficult for sovereign states. In the absence of an overarching authority capable of enforcing agreements, it is often difficult for statesmen to convince others that they mean what they say” (1985, 106). Fearon describes the problem more succinctly as, “how can a leader make a threat to use force credible when the leader would, in fact, be willing to use the military?” (1997, 69)."
"2","How do states overcome credibility problems of this type? One way of increasing the credibility of commitments, frequently proposed by international relations theorists, is the use of costly signals that allow observers to separate states into types. Costly signals are actions that generate costs that the leader would not be inclined to absorb if he or she were unwilling to carry out the promise or commitment that was made (Fearon 1997). By incurring costs, a state can separate itself from other, less committed states, which are unwilling to incur those costs (Morrow 1999; Schwebach 2000).         "
"3","We propose that the imposition of economic sanctions can function as just such a costly signal of a state's commitment to have a dispute resolved in its favor. When a state chooses to respond to a crisis by imposing economic sanctions, it chooses to impose costs on itself, partly economic and partly political, that will restrict its future range of choices. Furthermore, according to Baldwin (1985), when a powerful state goes out of its way to signal the importance of an issue by incurring costs, that action should neither be ignored nor written off as trivial.         "
"4","There is wide agreement in the sanctions literature that the imposition of sanctions can be economically costly not only to the target state, but also to the sender nation (Askari et al. 2003; Barber 1979; Hart 2000; Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott 1990; Wagner 1988).2Hufbauer et al., for example, estimated the economic costs of unilateral sanctions to the United States and concluded “as a consequence of U.S. sanctions, workers probably lost somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion in export sector wage premiums in 1995” (1997, 7). Since these costs are lost when sanctions are imposed, and are unrecoverable, they represent sunk costs associated with the imposition of sanctions.         "
"5","However, economic costs are not the only type of cost associated with sanctions. Given the public nature of a proclamation breaking trade, audience costs (Fearon 1994; Partell and Palmer 1999; Smith 1998, 623; Schultz 1998) will also be generated. Barber describes the costs associated with sanctions in a manner consistent with the type of costs typically associated with audience costs. Speaking about sanctions, he writes, “Once commitments have been made to a policy, whether by individual political leaders, or by governments or international organizations, reputations and pride are at stake” (1979, 380). Domestic actors could choose to punish a leader who loses a crisis or war—be it a trade war or military war (Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson 1995; Bueno de Mesquita et al. 1999; Smith 1996). Thus, we argue that states can enhance the credibility of their resolve in a dispute by incurring both economic and political costs through the imposition of economic sanctions.         "
"6","However, this strategy of incurring costs through the imposition of economic sanctions is not without risk. There are important differences in the way states behave as a result of political or economic costs. Essentially, economic costs are lost throughout the imposition of sanctions while political costs are only paid after a perceived policy failure. The political costs of backing down in a public dispute, such as economic sanctions, tie the hands (Fearon 1997) of the sender nation, making it too costly to back down from a threat, and may lead to a greater likelihood of achieving policy goals while simultaneously increasing the likelihood that the dispute will escalate to the military level.         "
"7","While most scholars agree that sanctions can be costly to the sender, there is disagreement as to whether sanctions increase or decrease the probability of militarized conflicts. For some, sanctions are a sign of commitment due to the costs incurred in their implementation. To others, the fact that sanctions were chosen and not a stronger form of statecraft, such as a use of military force, can be interpreted as a sign of weakness. For example, Baldwin asks, “Is the use of economic instruments of statecraft a sign of weak and pusillanimous statesmanship or an indication of firm commitment?” (1985, 102)."
"8","Because of these contending views on whether sanctions signal resolve or indecision, there is disagreement in the literature on whether sanctions should make war more or less likely. Many scholars note a generally positive association between sanctions and war. Renwick, for example, referring to the League of Nations sanctions against Italy, noted, “It was impossible to make sanctions effective without running the risk of war” (1981, 23). Bienen and Gilpin also saw the possibility that sanctions would increase the probability of war, noting that sanctions “carry with them the possibility of war if they are to be effective” (1979, 9). Additionally, Grieve argued that sanctions, “if effectively applied, challenge a …[target] state in as direct and positive a manner as a threat of war” (1968, 433).         "
"9","More recently, Clark and Reed (2005) tested a model of foreign policy substitutability to see how the United States responds when it is targeted militarily by another state. While Clark and Reed did not directly test whether the presence of sanctions increased or decreased the likelihood of a subsequent militarized dispute, they did test a multinomial model that included the use of military force and the use of sanctions as possible responses of the United States to being targeted. One conclusion of this model was that “the positive correlation between the use of force and sanctions equations indicates that unobserved variables increase the chances policy makers implement both sanctions and force: This is evidence sanctions and force are implemented as complements rather than strictly as substitutes” (Clark and Reed 2005, 620).         "
"10","However, others such as Morgan and Schwebach concluded that “sanctions should reduce the likelihood that the disputants will resort to force to settle their differences” (1997, 35). Likewise, Drezner says that evidence from previous empirical studies of the success of economic sanctions is “consistent with the theoretical argument, [Which he attributes to Morgan, Palmer, and Miers (2000)], that economic coercion acts as a foreign policy substitute for military coercion, rather than a complement” (2003, 650).         "
"11","It is to this question in the literature regarding whether sanctions increase or decrease the probability of militarized conflicts that this article seeks to contribute. But it is not enough to simply establish empirically whether sanctions tend to complement or substitute for uses of militarized force. The more important questions, as always, revolve around the theoretical reasons why sanctions might tend to increase or decrease the probability of uses of militarized force. Thus, we develop theoretical propositions regarding the role of sanctions as a signal of commitment and test them against empirical data on sanctions and militarized conflicts to help understand under what conditions sanctions might be more or less likely to be associated with uses of military force."
"12","Our theoretical argument focuses on the importance of signaling as a way of demonstrating resolve and is grounded in an informational explanation of the causes of military conflicts (Fearon 1994, 1995, 1997; Gartzke 1998; Reiter 2003). Informational arguments stress the importance of uncertainty and the ability of states to send effective signals as a way to avoid military conflict. The informational approach views conflicts as a bargaining process where escalation is most likely when states are unsure about the resolve of the other party. “Unless reliable mechanisms exist for credibly revealing private information, bargaining can fail to reach an efficient, peaceful solution” (Schultz 1999, 236).         "
"13","Given the need to reveal information to demonstrate credibility, what actions can states take? States can signal their resolve by taking costly actions that unresolved states would not take. Thus, costly signals can provide information about resolve necessary to avoid military conflict. In the next section we discuss two ideal types of costly signals to show how costly signaling can simultaneously help states achieve policy goals and increase their risk of war involvement."
"14","The role of signaling lies at the heart of much of modern international relations theory. Fearon (1997) distinguishes between two ideal types of costly signals: tying hands and sunk costs. The first type of signal, tying‐hands, typically works by creating audience costs (Fearon 1994) that the leadership would suffer if it backs down on a publicly made challenge. Tying hands, according to Fearon (1997), involves taking actions that increase the costs of backing down if challenged, but otherwise entail no costs if no challenge materializes.         "
"15","Two important elements of the costs associated with tying‐hands signals are that, first, the costs are only paid if the state is forced to back down. If the other side backs down, or if the threat is carried out after the other side does not back down, then the costs cease to exist. Second, not all countries will generate the audience costs that tie their hands at the same level. Audience costs are essentially the costs of going back on one's word or not following through on one's promises, and they are typically thought of in terms of domestic political costs. Democracies are generally viewed as better at tying hands than nondemocracies because of their ability to generate audience costs as a result of credible opposition parties and a free press (Schultz 1998, 1999). Following this line of reasoning, Hart argued that “nondemocratic states, because they generally lack the institutional mechanisms to generate domestic costs, are unable to use economic sanctions as signals of resolve” (2000, 268).         "
"16","This is not to say that autocracies will be unable to signal their resolve through the use of costly signals. Autocracies are also able to signal resolve by generating costs, but in general, autocracies will be constrained to the use of what Fearon describes as sunk costs. Sunk‐cost signals are actions that incur costs that the defender must pay when sending the signal in the first place, such as the costs for stationing troops on foreign soil or restricting domestic firms from trading in foreign markets."
"17","Because democracies can more easily generate audience costs than nondemocracies, they should also more effectively tie their hands when they use sanctions. Essentially all countries, regardless of regime type, have the ability to signal their intentions by incurring the sunk costs associated with sanctions. But a major difference in the signaling properties of democracies and nondemocracies when using sanctions is that democracies should typically have a higher rate of success in achieving policy goals because they are better able to credibly commit themselves by incurring audience costs when they impose sanctions that make it difficult for them to back down short of success or war. This should result in democracies being more successful in their use of sanctions."
"18","In fact, one of Fearon's primary results regarding the usefulness of differing types of costly signals is that “the signaling state does strictly better with tying‐hands signals, despite the fact that tying‐hands signals necessarily generate a greater risk of war” (1997, 71). Thus, an irony that arises according to Fearon is that even though tying‐hands signals are more attractive because of their increased credibility, “tying‐hands signals invariably generate a higher ex ante probability of war” (1997, 81).         "
"19","Previous research by Hart (2000) found strong support for the expectation that democracies will be more successful users of sanctions. In Hart's empirical analysis he controlled for other factors associated with the success of sanctions3 and still found that democracies were more likely to be successful when using sanctions. We agree with Hart's (2000) conclusion that the reason democracies are more successful at using sanctions is that they are better able to credibly use sanctions as a costly signal by accumulating audience costs. However, because of the type of costs generated when democracies signal with sanctions, using sanctions will be a risky policy that ties the hands of democratic leaders, making militarized conflicts more likely.         "
"20","An important part of the argument is that when sanctions are imposed there are two potential types of costs, tying hands and sunk costs, and that these two types of costs are distinct, and as such, are not inseparable. Slantchev (2005) makes a somewhat similar argument, but is focusing on military rather than economic actions, and thus comes to a different conclusion. He argued that military mobilization incurs sunk costs that contribute positively to the probability of victory in a dispute and thus increase the expected utility of war. Hence, he concludes, “Military actions can sink costs and tie hands at the same time” (Slantchev 2005, 545).         "
"21","Because sunk costs in our argument represent the economic costs to the sender and not the costs of mobilizing troops, sunk costs do not increase the probability of victory. Unlike the mobilization of military troops, sunk costs imposed on the sender of sanctions should have a negative effect on the probability of military victory because they represent losses to the sender economy. In other words, when considering economic rather than military costs, a country can simultaneously signal increased resolve through the accumulation of tying‐hands costs and signal lack of resolve by demonstrating an unwillingness to invest sunk costs. This can happen, for example, when a leader makes public statements accompanying sanctions to the effect that the target must comply or face punishing sanctions, but the sanctions themselves are costless to the sender. Speaking about the motivations for the initiation of sanctions, Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott say that “U.S. presidents seemingly feel compelled to dramatize their opposition to foreign misdeeds, even when the likelihood of changing the target country's behavior seems remote” (1990, 11). In these situations, they note, sanctions are often imposed because the cost of the sanctions to the sender is less than the cost of inaction."
"22","When a country sends mixed signals in this manner, with audience costs being high, but sunk costs low, it is difficult to predict the effect on the receiver of the signals. However, Jervis's (1970) distinction between signals and indices, which are very loosely connected to what others have referred to as words versus deeds, can help. Jervis (1970, 18) notes that both the sender and the receiver know that signals can be issued by a deceiver just as well as by an honest actor because the costs of issuing signals that are deceptive is put off until the time that the signal is shown to be false. In this regard Jervis's signaling costs are very similar to Fearon's tying‐hands costs.         "
"23","Indices, on the other hand, are defined by Jervis as “Statements or actions that carry some inherent evidence that the image projected is correct because they are believed to be inextricably linked to the actor's capabilities or intentions” (1970, 18). We see the sunk costs of sanctions as representing what Jervis describes as an index that can be linked to true limitations on the sender government. Weak sanctions signal that the sender does not truly have the ability to send a costly signal with economic sanctions, most likely due to lack of domestic support. This should be particularly true of democracies given their relative inability to manipulate the economic costs signaling element of sanctions because they are more constrained by domestic forces in their ability to manipulate the economy.4 According to Jervis (1970), when the words and actions of the sender signal different levels of resolve, there are reasons to believe that the receiver will trust the actions. Jervis says, “[S]ince observers believe that indices cannot or at least are not being used for deception, they often rely heavily on them when signals are suspect” (1970, 27). Thus, even though the sender's audience costs may truly prevent it from backing down, the accurate image is not always accepted, especially when the perceiver has reason to believe otherwise.         "
"24","It might seem logical to argue, as did Morgan and Schwebach (1997), that if sanctions are a costly signal, increasing the probability of successfully attaining policy goals, they should also decrease the probability of militarized conflict ensuing. We do not disagree with this logic, but note that typically sanctions are not viewed by the target as a costly signal of resolve. Because states have a strong incentive to maximize costs to the target while minimizing costs to themselves, they generally end up sending weak signals with sanctions. For example, Gartzke, Li, and Boehmer note somewhat humorously that “states can technically signal through almost any costly act, but doing so makes little sense given incentives to compete. A man may seek to demonstrate his resolve by severing a limb, but subsequent efforts to bargain will be hindered by the fact that his opponent retains all his initial appendages” (2001, 402).         "
"25","The previous example helps illustrate a qualitative difference between signaling with sanctions and other types of signaling. A state preparing for war may be able to send a costly signal by mobilizing its forces on an opponent's border. While these actions are costly, they also enhance a state's preparation for war, and hence its probability of winning if conflict ensues (Slantchev 2005). However, a resolved state, preparing for war, has no such incentive to impose economic costs on itself through the use of economic restrictions that are costly to its own economy. It is particularly difficult to imagine a democratic leader justifying this behavior to constituents. Theoretically, no state should freely choose to give up relative economic gains to an adversary knowing that they can be converted to military advantage. The result is that when states choose to impose sanctions, they generally devise them in a way that maximizes target costs, minimizes sender costs, and generally produces a weak signal that tends to increase the likelihood of militarized conflict.         "
"26","Thus, we see sanctions as a generally risky policy that will increase the probability of war by simultaneously sending an external signal of weakness and (for democracies) internally generating audience costs that make it more difficult to back down. We present this as our first hypothesis for empirical testing."
"27","                        "
"28"," H1: Sanctions use will be positively related to the use of military force.                  "
"29","There are two reasons for expecting the relationship hypothesized above. The first reason concerns the political costs of sanctions to the sender, and the second is related to the economic costs. Democracies are the primary users of sanctions, and democratic leaders face greater political costs for foreign policy failures. The audience costs associated with backing down in a public dispute tend to tie the hands of democratic sanctioners, increasing their costs for backing down against a resolute target state. While an increased incentive to stand firm on the part of democratic sanctioners may increase the probability of sanctions being successful, the risk of the dispute spiraling into militarized conflict also increases. According to Fearon (1997, 81), while tying‐hands signals are initially cheaper, and thus more attractive, they generate a greater risk that the countries in the dispute will wind up committed to an unwanted conflict. However, a major problem for democracies when using sanctions is that they tend to send a mixed signal. While their audience costs signal resolve through the tying of hands, the overt action of sanctioning, more often than not, signals weakness because the sanctions are designed to be economically costless to the sender.         "
"30","The ability of democracies to effectively tie their hands with sanctions, while simultaneously facing strong domestic incentives to devise sanctions to be costless to the domestic economy, leads us to hypothesize that democracies will be more likely than nondemocracies to end up in militarized conflicts after initiating sanctions."
"31","                        "
"32"," H2: Democracies should be more likely than autocracies to be involved in a militarized dispute after a sanction.                  "
"33","When thinking about the signaling properties of the economic, rather than the political, cost of sanctions, the question becomes whether sanctions are costly enough to send a strong signal of resolve. If the target sees sanctions as a cheap alternative to the use of force, it may result in dispute escalation that increases the chance of a militarized conflict. Fearon concluded that “signaling anything less than total commitment leads to the inference that the defender will surely not fight” (1997, 75). Hoffman adds that “when sanctions are used, the manifest goal will probably not be attained, because the very decision to apply sanctions probably indicates that the motivation of the sanctioning country is relatively low” (1967, 155).         "
"34","Policy makers and political scientists alike have frequently cautioned against the tendency for the United States and other great powers to use sanctions as a type of foreign policy “on the cheap” (Deline 2002; Elliot 1993, 34; Hufbauer 1998; Paulson 1999; Schott 1998). One of the leading empirical sanctions researchers, Gary Clyde Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics, asks, somewhat unctuously, “But since military force is too costly and diplomacy is too feeble, why not apply economic sanctions as the global salve to problems abroad and consciences at home? Why not drink the marvelous tonic of foreign policy on the cheap?” (Hufbauer, 1998, 1).         "
"35","The implication is that when sanctions are chosen as the initial response to a crisis, there is a danger that the target of the sanctions will interpret this as a sign of weakness on the part of the sender. This can increase the probability of war if it emboldens the target against acquiescing to the sender's demands. The suggestion is that sanctions viewed as “foreign policy on the cheap” may increase the probability of military conflict by signaling a lack of willingness to commit costly resources, indicating weak and uncertain statesmanship on the part of the sender rather than an indication of firm commitment. Moreover, as noted above, when democracies use weak sanctions while simultaneously tying their hands with audience costs, the probability of war should be greatest."
"36","One might ask, however, why a rational state would choose to impose sanctions if this action might increase the probability of militarized conflict?Jervis (1970) notes that throughout history, and especially regarding the great powers since 1945, states have often cared more about an issue for the image others would create of them than for the intrinsic value of the issue itself. Similarly, a common argument in the sanctions literature is that if the United States, as a great power with the ability to project its power all over the world, chooses to ignore international crises it runs the risk of providing tacit approval for these actions.5 Since the United States cannot respond to every international crisis with military force, but ignoring such events as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ethnic cleansing, political torture, etc., runs the risk of providing tacit approval, the United States, and by extension other great powers as well, turn to economic sanctions as a way to show disapproval. Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot (1990, 11) note that the signal sent by sanctions is received by not only the target state, but also allies wanting to see that that sender nation will act on these issues, and by domestic constituents observing the leadership in the sender country's willingness to act on behalf of the national interest. In this regard, it may not be necessary that states believe sanctions will be successful or that they will be able to help in peacefully resolving the issue at hand. All that is necessary for them to be chosen is that there is no option that is perceived to be better (see Baldwin 1985 on this point).         "
"37","We can evaluate the importance of the economic (sunk) costs of sanctions as signals of resolve by adding a hypothesis regarding the cost of sanctions to the sender. The tying‐hands argument proposed that the political costs associated with backing down, which tie the hands of democracies, also lead to an increased risk of war when sanctions are used by democracies. The sunk‐costs argument proposes that when senders devise sanctions in a way that is costless to themselves, the signal will be weak and militarized conflict will be more likely."
"38","                        "
"39"," H3: Low‐cost economic sanctions to the sender nation will increase the probability of a militarized conflict.                  "
"40","To test the hypotheses regarding the relationship between uses of economic and military force, we create a data set consisting of all dyads from 1948 to 1998, with the dyad year as the unit of analysis.6 We are interested in the signaling properties of sanctions and whether sanctions generally complement or substitute for uses of military force. The primary dependent variable of interest is the existence of a dyadic militarized interstate dispute, which is operationalized with data from the Correlates of War project (Gochman and Maoz 1984; Jones, Bremer, and Singer 1996; Maoz 2001). This variable is coded 1 when there is an onset of a militarized dispute at the level that involves the actual use of force. MIDs are coded on the following scale: 0 = No Hostility, 1 = No Militarized Action, 2 = Threat to Use Force, 3 = Display of Force, 4 = Use of Force, 5 = War. Thus, we code an onset of force when the dispute hostility level is > 3. When multiple MIDs exist in the same dyad year, the most serious MID is included.         "
"41","After establishing the basic relationship between military disputes and sanctions in all dyads, we analyze the effect of sanctions within existing crises. We conduct the remainder of the tests in the crisis environment because a finding that sanctions and militarized conflicts are correlated in the all‐dyads model may be biased if the occurrence of a crisis makes both sanctions and militarized disputes more likely. The all‐dyads model helps to answer the question posed in Hypothesis 1 about whether sanctions are complements or substitutes to militarized force, but it does not further our understanding of the signaling properties of sanctions. A finding that sanctions and militarized disputes occur together in all dyads may or may not have anything to do with the signaling properties of sanctions. However, within an existing crisis dyad, the probability of military conflict is high, thus creating an ideal environment to observe the signaling properties of sanctions for avoiding conflict in an already highly disputatious environment."
"42","To operationalize the existence of a crisis, we use dyadic crises data from the ICB project (Brecher, Wilkenfeld, and Moser 1988; Wilkenfeld, Brecher, and Moser 1988). The ICB project bases its definition of a crisis on perceptions held by foreign policy leaders about the existence of “a threat to one or more basic values, along with an awareness of finite time for response to the value threat, and a heightened probability of involvement in military hostilities” (Brecher and Wilkenfeld 2000, 3). From this definition we can discern that, while MIDs are initiated by an act involving the use of military force, an ICB crisis stems from a broader class of actions, none of which involve by definition a threat, a display, or use of force (Hewitt 2003, 672). Thus, the ICB data can be used to establish the existence of a crisis and observe how the use of sanctions affects the likelihood that the dispute will be militarized. As in Hewitt (2003) we generate a variable to indicate when a crisis includes militarized action as coded by Maoz's (2001) dyadic militarized interstate dispute data. When both a crisis and a use of force MID exist in the same year, this variable is coded as a 1; otherwise it is 0.         "
"43","The primary independent variable of interest for this study is the use of economic sanctions. Information regarding sanctions cases comes from Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot (1990) for cases up to 1989 and from Hufbauer (1998), O'Sullivan (2003), Elliot et al. (2005), and Keesing's Record of World Events for post‐1989 cases. Most previous empirical work on sanctions identifies one primary sanctioner and one primary target for each sanctions case.7 While this might be prudent for analyses that are highly dependent on the Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot (1990) variables, it can distort the sanctions picture by throwing out sanctions dyads involving multiple senders and targets. Because of the insistence on identifying a single sender and target of sanctions, most studies of sanctions have thus also failed to include cases involving the Arab League, Western Allies (United States, United Kingdom, and France), the OAU, or ECOWAS as a sender or target of sanctions. Because the interest here is in the use of sanctions related to the use of military force, and not on the specifics of the sanctions themselves,8 we are able to disaggregate these multiple cases of sanctions into individual sanctions dyads. This greatly expands the number of sanctions cases for our study.         "
"44","More important than just expanding the number of cases for analysis, we believe that the proper set of cases for this analysis should include disaggregated sanctions cases when possible. Each state involved in sanctions makes a decision to impose sanctions and thus sends a signal to the target of the sanctions. Sovereign states are responsible for their own actions, and the choice to impose sanctions will not be taken lightly nor ignored by other states. However, to safeguard against the possibility that the signal sent by the primary sanctioning state is different from the signal sent by additional states, we also ran all of our empirical models on just the primary senders and primary targets to see if this would change our results. For cases prior to 1990 we rely on the coding of Dorussen and Mo (2001). For post‐1989 cases determinations regarding the primary senders and targets are based on descriptions of the cases. None of the substantive results change when running the models on primary senders and targets. Because of space limitations we only present the results of what we believe to be the more correct models using the disaggregated sanctions cases.9"
"45","Because of our focus on the costly signaling properties of sanctions, we include a measure of how economically costly sanctions were to the sender nation. According to Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot, “Domestic firms pay an immediate price when trade, aid, or financial flows are disrupted” (1990, 75). However, Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot (1990) note that there are exceptions to the general rule that sanctions will be economically costly to the sender nation. In some cases, such as reductions in aid or revocation of credit, they say that “the sender may enjoy an immediate economic gain” (1990, 76). Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot code a variable for the economic cost of sanctions to the sender, in which they “have not attempted to systematically assess the political cost of each episode to the sender country” (82). The explicit focus is on the economic cost of the sanctions to the sender. For sanctions cases between 1948 and 1989, we use Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot's (1990) economic cost to sender variable which is originally coded on a scale of 1–4, with (1) representing a net economic gain for the sender, (2) indicating little economic effect on the sender, (3) representing a modest welfare loss, and (4) being a major economic loss to the sender. This variable is then recoded into a dichotomous indicator for sanctions in which the sender actually gains economically as a result of sanctions (i.e., 1 = 1 and 2–4 = 0).         "
"46","In addition, following Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot's coding rules, the variable sender gain is coded for the following post‐1989 sanctions initiated by the United States: Military trade, aid, and financial sanctions against China in 1990 for weapons proliferation were coded as not a net gain for the sender. Aid sanctions against the Sudan in 1990 related to a military coup were coded as a gain to the sender. Trade, financial, and aid sanctions against Haiti in 1991 related to the military coup were not coded as a gain to the sender. The aid sanctions against Afghanistan in 1995 for narcotics trafficking were coded as a gain to the sender. We also coded the Russian sanctions against Georgia over the capture of Sukhumi, which entailed cutting electrical supplies and banning the sale of military equipment. These sanctions were coded as a nonsender gain (Keesing's Online Record of World Events).10"
"47","When there are multiple sanctions ongoing within a dyad in the same year, the sanction that occurred first is included. If both sanctions began in the same year, the most severe sanction is maintained. Severity is determined by the cost to the target as a percent of target gross national product. When severity information is not available, the sanction that ended last is maintained. Also, when the sender and target both initiate sanctions against one another in the same year, the more serious of the two sanctions is included. For example, in 1968 the United States initiated sanctions against Peru over the expropriation of property and the purchase of aircraft from France. The sanctions over expropriation lasted until 1974, while the other sanctions ended the next year, so the expropriation sanctions are included in the dataset since they subsume the aircraft sanctions. Another example is the United States sanctions directed at the Soviet Union in 1948 as part of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) technology control sanctions. During this same year, the Soviets, in connection with the Berlin Blockade ICB crises, imposed sanctions against the United States. Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot estimate the cost of the U.S.‐imposed sanctions at $756 million annually and the Soviet‐imposed sanctions at $258 million; therefore the more costly United States sanctions are included."
"48","The dataset consists of 211 sanctions dyad onset years, and 1,554 total sanctions dyad years. Of the 211 sanctions onsets, 177 were initiated by a primary sender, and 34 were initiated by an additional sender. Also, 197 were initiated against a primary target and 14 against a secondary target. Of the sanctions with an identifiable number of senders (Non‐UN Sanctions), nearly 45% are imposed by multiple senders. However, sanctions are generally only targeted at a single country. Over 80% of the cases were directed at a single target."
"49","Because the model ultimately predicts the use of militarized force, we include several control11 variables frequently found to be associated with the use of force. Joint Democracy is included due to the vast amount of evidence that democratic states avoid militarized conflict with one another. We use Polity IV (Marshall and Jaggers 2002) data and consider dyads where both states reach a minimum of 6 on the democracy score to be jointly democratic. Capabilities are measured using Correlates of War national capabilities data (Singer and Small 1982; Singer, Bremer, and Stuckey 1972). Relative capabilities are then computed as the larger capability score divided by the smaller score. A variable to measure the distance between states is also included. When two actors are distant from one another, it diminishes opportunities to interact and reduces the probability of conflict. Evidence exists indicating that major power states may behave differently in crises than minor states (Morgan and Campbell 1991). Therefore, a control variable is included for whether there is a major power in the dyad based on criteria in Singer and Small (1982). Major powers during the period of observation include United States (1948–98); United Kingdom (1948–98); France (1948–98); Russia (1948–98); China (1950–98); Germany (1991–98); and Japan (1991–98). Alliance ties may also affect a state's propensity to use military force. To control for this affect we include a dummy variable that equals one for any dyad with a defense pact, entente, or nonaggression agreement. Alliance data comes from the Correlates of War project (Gibler 2004).         "
"50","The final two controls pertain to dyadic economic trade and development. Because the model focuses on the response of states to the use of economic restrictions, it is important to control for both the level of trade in the dyad and the economic conditions in countries involved. We measure total dyadic trade between states A and B with data obtained from Gleditsch (2002).12 To measure the level of development in the dyad, we employ the weak link approach and include the lower of the two states' gross domestic product per capita.         "
"51","Finally, we also include a measure of peace years that indicates the number of years since the states in the dyad last fought a militarized dispute. As this measure increases, the probability of a dispute is expected to diminish (e.g., Beck, Katz, and Tucker 1998; Raknerud and Hegre 1997; Reed 2000). The peace‐years variable along with three cubic splines are included, but not reported, in each of the models to control for temporal dependence (Beck, Katz, and Tucker 1998).         "
"52","The first task is to establish the connection between the use of sanctions and the use of military force. In other words, do sanctions tend to substitute for, or complement uses of military force? As we shall demonstrate, the empirical evidence provides strong support for the expectation of Hypothesis 1, that sanctions complement uses of military force rather than substitute for them."
"53"," Table 1 shows a logistic regression model used to predict the occurrence of militarized disputes with and without an indicator for the presence of sanctions. A peace‐years variable and three cubic splines (Beck, Katz, and Tucker 1998) are included, but not reported, to account for temporal dependence. Because we have good reason to believe that observations within dyads are not independent, violating the assumption of independence and producing incorrect standard errors if not accounted for, the traditional standard errors are replaced with robust standard errors clustered across dyads.         "
"54","Models 1 and 2 of Table 1 show a standard conflict model of all dyads from 1948 to 1998, with sanctions (Model 2) and without sanctions (Model 1). The results of Model 1 are robust to the inclusion of sanctions, with no variable changing sign or significance. Most importantly, Model 2 reveals a significant and positive association between the use of sanctions and the occurrence of militarized disputes in the all‐dyads model. Substantively, the coefficient on the lagged sanctions variable means that when a dyad includes the use of sanctions it is six times as likely to experience a use of military force in the next year.13 Based on the goodness‐of‐fit statistics presented at the bottom of Table 1, we also see that Model 2, with sanctions, performs better than the model without sanctions. Raftery (1996) suggests the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as both a measure of overall fit and a way to compare models. According to Long and Freese, “If BIC1– BIC2 < 0, then the first model is preferred” (2003, 94). The difference between the models with and without sanctions is 93.703, indicating that the model with sanctions is preferred. But how strong is this difference?Raftery (1996) provides suggested guidelines for interpreting the difference. According to Raftery's scale, any absolute difference greater than 10 indicates very strong support. This leaves little doubt that economic sanctions play an important and positive role in explaining the occurrence of militarized disputes.         "
"55","While Model 2 provides strong support for the expectation that sanctions complement rather than substitute for uses of force,14 as noted above, one might question whether the comparison group is appropriate. Models 3 through 5 in Table 1 restrict the analysis to dyads that experienced an ICB crisis. This allows us to view how crisis actors respond to the use of sanctions. The fact that there is a crisis tells us that there is a serious dispute, but not necessarily that it is militarized. Therefore, in the models presented in Table 1, the focus shifts and the question becomes, are actors that are involved in a crisis, that use sanctions, more likely to be involved in militarized disputes? Even within states already involved in a crisis, we find that the use of sanctions is associated with an increased probability for militarized interstate disputes. Once again, sanctions are seen as complementary to, rather than a substitute for, military force.         "
"56","While the lagged sanctions variable in Model 4 is only significant at the 10% level, it does exert a strong positive influence on crisis escalation to the use of military force. We also show in Model 5 that the reason for the relatively weak significance of the sanctions variable in this model is that the effect is masked by the difference in dispute propensity for democracies and nondemocracies following sanctions. Nonetheless, the effect of sanctions being used in a crisis dyad has a more statistically significant effect on a militarized dispute occurrence than does the presence of a jointly democratic dyad.15"
"57","Substantively, the effect of sanctions can be seen by calculating the change in the predicted probability of a crisis involving militarized action with and without sanctions, while holding the other variables in the model constant at their means. The effect of sanctions on the likelihood of a crisis involving the use of military force is to increase the probability of militarized conflict by 17%, resulting in a near doubling of the probability of conflict from .18 without sanctions to .35 with sanctions."
"58","Overall, Model 4 is a good fit to the data, producing a significant Likelihood Ratio Chi2 indicating that the specified model is a significant improvement over a null model. We can observe goodness‐of‐fit indicators to see whether Model 4, with the inclusion of the lagged sanctions variable, significantly improves on Model 3 without sanctions.         "
"59","The various Psuedo‐R2s available for likelihood estimation all reveal that regardless of which method is used the model with sanctions is preferred (only McFadden's Pseudo R2 is displayed). We can also assess the various information measures used to compare models. First, Akaike's (1973) information criterion, defined as , where  is the model's likelihood and P is the number of parameters, is smaller, and therefore preferred, for the model with sanctions. Next, the Bayesian Information Criterion, described above, is more negative for the model with sanctions. The absolute difference in the BIC between the model with and without sanctions is 3.020, providing positive support for the model with sanctions (Raftery 1996).         "
"60","In Hypothesis 2, we predicted that because democracies tend to tie their hands through the accumulation of audience costs, they will be more likely to be involved in a militarized dispute following the use of a sanction. Model 5 provides strong support for this hypothesis. Democratic senders of sanctions are more likely to be involved in a militarized dispute with the target of the sanctions in the year following a sanction.16 By including both democratic senders and all sanctions as dummy variables in the model, we see why the more general sanctions variable was only significant at the 10% level in Model 4. Democratic senders of sanctions are significantly more likely to be involved in a militarized dispute following sanctions, as predicted by Hypothesis 2. The leftover effect of sanctions, after controlling for the effect of democracy, is insignificant and negatively related to the use of force.17"
"61","Hypothesis 3 proposed that low‐cost sanctions to the sender nation increase the probability of militarized conflicts. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the results of Model 5. The coefficient on lagged sender gains from sanctions is positive and significant. Logically, when senders use sanctions that are costly to themselves they generate sunk costs that signal their resolve. Costly sanctions to the sender can be a strong signal allowing states to avoid military conflict. However, when states orchestrate sanctions such in a way that they actually benefit from them, very little, if any, resolve is displayed, and the probability of a use of force is significantly increased."
"62"," Table 2 summarizes the substantive effect of sanctions on the probability of a use of military force. Scenario 1 shows that the effect of sanctions initiated by a nondemocracy in a crisis is to reduce the probability of militarized conflict by about 58%. As we can see in scenarios 2 and 3, the result is changed greatly when the initiator of sanctions is a democracy. The probability of a militarized conflict increases by 195% when a democracy initiates sanctions in a crisis. Scenario 3 reveals the substantive difference between a democracy and a nondemocracy using sanctions in a crisis. Democracies are an astonishing 600% more likely to be involved in a militarized conflict following the use of sanctions than are nondemocracies. Observing these changes in predicted probabilities confirms our earlier expectation that the strength of the coefficient on sanctions in Model 4 is weakened due to the difference in dispute propensity after sanctions for democracies and nondemocracies.         "
"63","Scenarios 4–6 assess the effect of weak sanctions, designed for the sender to gain economically, on the probability of militarized conflict in a crisis. In scenario 4, we see that the overall effect of such sanctions, regardless of sender regime type, is to increase the probability of militarized conflict by 366%. As predicted, the change in probability of militarized conflict after weak sanctions is greater for nondemocratic states, whose ability to signal is governed solely by their ability to incur sunk costs. Nondemocratic states are generally better able to avoid militarized conflict following the use of sanctions because they do not tie their hands through the accumulation of audience costs as democratic leaders do. However, as seen in scenario 5, when nondemocracies send weak signals with sanctions, by crafting the sanctions in a way in which they will gain economically, they increase their probability of being involved in a military conflict by 420%."
"64","Democracies, on the other hand, are more likely to be involved in a militarized dispute following sanctions because of their propensity to accumulate audience costs that prevent them from backing down. Furthermore, scenario 6 shows that when a democracy sends a weak sunk‐cost signal while simultaneously facing audience costs, the probability of a militarized dispute occurring reaches near certainty, at a level greater than 90%. This helps confirm our expectation that the most conflict‐prone scenario is when a democracy signals weakly by using costless sanctions, but simultaneously ties its hands through the accumulation of audience costs."
"65","As an additional test of the robustness of our findings, we estimated a unified model of crisis onset and use of militarized force, with sanctions as a determinant at both stages. Reed (2000), Lemke and Reed (2001), and Nooruddin (2002) analyze similar strategic processes with a censored selection statistical estimator.18 While we found that the two stages were linked through a positive and significant coefficient on rho, the findings on our key sanctions variables were incredibly robust. The major differences between the unified model and the models estimated in Table 1 are the increased levels of statistical significance in the conflict‐related control variables in the Heckman model. The results of this estimation are displayed below, in Table 3.         "
"66","Because our theoretical argument concludes that sanctions are likely to lead to militarized conflict, we have been careful to always lag our sanctions variables on the right‐hand side. However, one might still object that the analysis only shows that sanctions and conflict are coincidental, and not that sanctions lead to military conflict. Therefore, as a final test, we analyze a model of sanctions initiation that includes militarized conflict as a lagged explanatory variable for the occurrence of sanctions onset. If one form of conflict simply makes another form of conflict more likely,19 then we should be just as likely to see lagged militarized conflict as a positive explanatory variable for sanctions. However, if we find that lagged sanctions lead to militarized conflict (as we have) but that lagged militarized conflict does not lead to sanctions, this would strengthen the argument made here.         "
"67","The previous models in this article were focused on militarized conflict and are not intended to explain the onset of sanctions. Therefore, we modify our model in accordance with an existing model of dyadic sanctions onset (Lektzian and Souva 2003) and include a lagged variable on the right‐hand side for militarized conflict. Table 4 shows the results of this analysis and confirms that, while sanctions tend to lead to militarized conflict, the reverse is not true. Previous work by Lektzian and Souva (2003) used a GEE model to estimate the onset of sanctions and only focused on politically relevant dyads. The results, reported in Table 4, for the all‐dyads model are very similar to their findings. The only variables to change sign or significance are relative capabilities, which they found to be negative and significant, and we found to be negative but insignificant, and the effect of distance. They found distance to be insignificant, and we found that the further states are from one another, the less likely they are to use sanctions.         "
"68","Of most importance to this article is that lagged militarized conflict does not significantly increase the probability of sanctions onset in either the all‐dyads model, or the model of existing crises. This may be why existing empirical work on the onset of sanctions by Cox and Drury (2006) and Lektzian and Souva (2003) does not include militarized conflict as an explanatory variable for the onset of sanctions.20 Evaluating the BIC statistic for Models 6 and 7 provides very strong support for the all‐dyads model without lagged militarized conflict (difference in BIC = 12.864) and positive support for the model without lagged militarized conflict in the crises dyads sample (difference in BIC = 2.990). Thus, we conclude that there is more to this relationship than one form of conflict simply being associated with the other. Sanctions, as our signaling argument expects, increase the probability of militarized conflict when they are used by democracies and when they are made to be costless to the sender. Militarized conflicts, however, do not increase the probability of economic sanctions.         "
"69","The findings of this article are supportive of the logic developed in signaling arguments of the causes of war. Others (Drezner 2003, Gartzke, Li, and Boehmer 2001; Morgan and Schwebach 1997) have proposed that sanctions will reduce the probability of conflict because of the costly nature of their signal. We find the signaling logic to be supported by our research. Where we differ is in the costliness of sanctions. Because sanctions are predominantly used in a manner that minimizes costs to the sender and maximizes costs to the target, they tend to send a signal of weakness rather than strength. As such, sanctions increase the probability of conflict, as expected under the logic of the signaling argument. Moreover, when democracies, which are the primary users of sanctions, send externally weak signals with costless sanctions, they are even more conflict prone due to their propensity to generate internal audience costs that prevent them from backing down. However, if sanctions can be devised to be costly to the sending country, our theory and empirical analysis show that, consistent with signaling arguments, they will decrease the probability of militarized conflicts. For example, Gartzke, Li, and Boehmer (2001) say that it was not out of the question that military force might have been used by the United States to block British and French efforts in the Suez crisis. However, they say, “The Bretton Woods system made it possible for the United States to demonstrate resolve short of military force, jeopardizing valuable economic linkages but averting the need for costlier actions” (Gartzke, Li, and Boehmer 2001, 404). Thus, when policy makers take strong actions with sanctions, commitment can be shown and the use of military force avoided.         "
"70","Costs play a paradoxical role in augmenting the credibility of commitments. Costs are generally thought of as something to be avoided, as a value forgone, but when establishing the credibility of commitments (sending credible signals) they are actually desirable. Therefore, we would caution that while it may enhance the probability of success if senders employ sanctions in a way that maximizes the cost to the target while minimizing the cost to themselves, states should be aware of the implications of the signal that they send with this type of policy."
"71","In conclusion, we find that when you see a sanction, there is a significantly increased probability that a militarized dispute will follow. Thus, it appears that sanctions have not typically served as an effective signal of resolve. Our conclusion is not that costly signaling arguments about sanctions are incorrect, but that sanctions tend to send a signal of weakness rather than strength. A final irony is that touting sanctions as a policy alternative to war may make their signaling properties even weaker, resulting in an increased probability of war accompanying the use of sanctions."
