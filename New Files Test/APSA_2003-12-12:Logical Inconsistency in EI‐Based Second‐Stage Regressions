"1","Suppose that we have precinct‐level data for an election: let Ti∈[0, 1], i= 1, … , p, denote precinct i's turnout rate in the election and Xi∈[0, 1] the fraction African American of precinct i. The goal of ecological inference is using Ti and Xi to estimate βbi, the fraction of blacks in precinct i who voted in the election, and βwi, the fraction of whites who voted.         "
"2"," King (1997, ch. 6–8) develops two different implementations of his ecological inference technique, standard and extended. Critiques of King's approach to ecological inference can be found in Freedman et al. (1998), Tam (1998), Cho and Gaines (2004), and McCue (2001) (but see Lewis (2002a) and Lewis (2002b) on McCue). Until further notice is given, our comments on King's technique apply to the standard model.         "
"3","King's standard model is grounded in Duncan and Davis's (1953) accounting identity:            "
"4","             "
"5","             "
"6","Three facts about the above equations are worth noting. First, εbi in Equation (2) reflects unmodeled variation in βbi just as a disturbance in a regular linear regression reflects unmodeled terms that affect the regression's dependent variable (and similarly for εwi and βwi). Second, since it follows from an accounting identity, Equation (4) holds exactly. Third, King's technique requires that the disturbance of εi, conditional on Xi, be mean zero. Indeed, since King assumes E(εbi | Xi) =E(εwi | Xi) = 0, where E(·) denotes expectation and in this case is taken over βbi and βwi, εi has this property.3"
"7","The twin conditional expectation assumptions on the black and white disturbances, εbi and εwi, respectively, imply that there is no aggregation bias. Substantively speaking, if E(εbi | Xi) = 0 then, once fraction black Xi in precinct i is known, there is nothing in the random disturbance εbi that affects βbi and is also mean dependent on Xi (and similarly for εwi and βwi). It cannot be the case, according to King's standard ecological inference technique, that εbi includes a nonrandom component (e.g., median family income in precinct i) that is a linear function of Xi (percent black in precinct i) and also influences βbi (black turnout in precinct i).         "
"8","Let , and  denote the point estimates of , and ρ, respectively, based on applying King's standard model to an ecological dataset.4 These five‐point estimates are collected in a five–vector . Assuming that the standard model's regularity conditions hold,  where  denotes convergence in probability. In other words,  is a consistent estimate of , and a similar statement applies to the other four‐point estimates in . In general, then,  (and, accordingly,  where  is the estimate of the vector ).         "
"9","Finally, let  be the point estimate of βbi(βwi) produced by applying King's technique to an ecological dataset Xi and Ti, i= 1, … , p. These estimates are functions of , and Ti. In particular, and as explained in King (1997),  is the mean of the univariate normal distribution for βbi that results from conditioning and then truncating the bivariate normal distribution with parameters  on precinct i's values of Xi and Ti (and similarly for  and βwi).         "
"10","In EI–R,  (or , as discussed below) point estimates are used as dependent variables in a second‐stage regression. Namely, when using EI–R a researcher who wants to estimate            "
"11","Thus, EI–R consists of, first, estimating  using King's ecological inference technique and, second, estimating Equation (6) with least squares. King suggests using weighted least squares when estimating this equation, and Adolph et al. call this weighted procedure EI–W. Weighting, however, is not germane to our discussion of logical inconsistency, because both EI–R and EI–W model βbi as a function of covariates—see Equation (5)—in exactly the same way. As is shown below, it is this equation that is the source of logical inconsistency, and hence from our perspective EI–R and EI–W are equivalent. To avoid tedious language we henceforth refer only to the former.         "
"12","The final products of EI–R, therefore, are the estimates  and , and, ultimately, whether EI–R is statistically consistent depends on whether  and . On the other hand, first‐stage statistical consistency of EI–R depends on whether  where the five‐vector , as noted previously, is produced by applying King's standard model to an ecological dataset.         "
"13","Of course, Equations (5) and (6) could have had βwi and , respectively, on their left‐hand sides, in which case EI–R is based on            "
"14","The two underlying regressions in a given application of EI–R are Equations (5) and (7). Substituting these into the accounting identity of Equation (1) yields            "
"15","We henceforth assume E(νbi | Xi) =E(νwi | Xi) = 0. This conservative assumption guarantees that two of the four components of  are mean zero conditional on Xi, as required for logical consistency of EI–R. However, this is not enough since our assumptions about νbi and νwi do not ensure that . Rather, for this latter equality to hold it must also be true that E(Xi(γ−α)′Zi+α′Zi | Xi) =0, where E(Xi(γ−α)′Zi+α′Zi | Xi) = (Xi(γ−α) +α)′E(Zi | Xi). We have, therefore, just derived the following result:         "
"16"," Proposition 1  For EI–R to be logically consistent, it must be true that(Xi(γ−α) +α)′E(Zi | Xi) =0.6"
"17","If γ=α=0 then the restriction in Proposition 1 clearly holds. This is a trivial case, of course, since one would never want to assume γ=α=0. Doing so assumes that all second‐stage slope coefficients are zero and that there is nothing to estimate! We cannot, therefore, assume that the restriction in Proposition 1 holds on account of γ=α=0, and we must look elsewhere to see what might help with it.         "
"18","Suppose that E(Zi | Xi) ≠0. Is it possible in this circumstance that the restriction in Proposition 1 holds? Unless the slope vectors γ and α satisfy an extremely tight and arbitrary restriction, the answer to this question is no. To see this, suppose for purposes of exposition that α and γ are scalars (which means that Zi is a scalar, too). Then, E(Zi | Xi) ≠ 0 implies that the restriction in Proposition 1 holds only if Xi(γ−α) +α= 0, which simplifies to γ=α(1 − 1/Xi). It is obvious that, if Xi takes on more than two different strictly positive values, which it must for the first stage of EI–R to be identified, then there are no values of γ and α that are consistent with γ=α(1 − 1/Xi) except γ=α= 0.         "
"19","This logic is easily generalizable to the case where α and γ are vectors. In this general case, if E(Zi | Xi) ≠0, then the restriction in Proposition 1 holds only under extremely tight constraints on γ and α. These latter constraints are nongeneric meaning that, if γ and α were drawn from a continuous probability distribution, the restriction would hold with probability zero.         "
"20","On the other hand, if E(Zi | Xi) = 0, then the restrictions in Proposition 1 hold regardless of γ and α. Thus,         "
"21"," Proposition 2  Barring trivial and probability zero circumstances, logical consistency of EI–R requiresE(Zi | Xi) =0.         "
"22","Recall that Zi was assumed, without loss of generality, to be mean zero. Therefore, Proposition 2 requires that the unconditional expectation of Zi be identical to its expectation conditional on Xi.         "
"23","If, however, Xi does contain information about the mean of Zi so that E(Zi | Xi) ≠0, then it follows that, barring trivial and probability zero circumstances, . Since , E(Zi | Xi) ≠0 implies that either εbi and/or εwi from EI–R's first stage contains unmodeled variables. Thus, when the restriction in Proposition 2 does not hold, then the second stage of EI–R implies that its first stage is affected by aggregation bias.         "
"24","It is straightforward to test whether, in a given application of EI–R, the k conditional expectations in Proposition 2, one for each element of Zi, are zero. But before we explain how to do this, it is useful to think in a substantive way about what Proposition 2 implies.         "
"25","Consider a hypothetical EI–R analysis of the precinct‐level factors that affect black and white turnout rates in a given election. In this framework, as in the example described in the introduction, Xi is the fraction African American of precinct i, βbi (βwi) is precinct i's black (white) turnout rate, and Zi is a vector of covariates assumed to affect βbi and βwi.         "
"26","There are a variety of precinct‐level variables, e.g., socioeconomic measures or political variables such as the race of an incumbent candidate, that one might want to include in a Zi vector for a second‐stage regression that is intended to explain black and white turnout rates. However, all of these prospective second‐stage explanatory variables are almost certainly highly related to precinct racial composition (Xi). For example, the unconditional expectation of a precinct's wealth level (a possible element of the covariate vector Zi) will in general not equal the expectation of the precinct's wealth level conditional on its racial composition; this is because African Americans tend to be less wealthy than whites. Nonetheless, for our hypothetical application of EI–R to be logically consistent, one would have to argue that a precinct's wealth and racial composition were not connected in this way.         "
"27","In general, then, the mathematical restrictions in Proposition 2 have very strong substantive implications, implications that are almost certainly impossible to satisfy given known political and social realities. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any politically interesting applications of EI–R that contain Zi vectors unrelated to Xi levels as required in the proposition. In theory, however, such applications might exist, and hence it is important to develop a specification test for logical consistency of EI–R.         "
"28","To test the conditional expectation restrictions in Proposition 2 on a ecological dataset, one estimates a system of k linear equations, each of which consists of a regression of a single element of Zi on Xi. If a Wald test for the null hypothesis that all k‐slope estimates are zero rejects (intercepts are irrelevant, since, as noted earlier, there is no loss of generality in assuming that Zi is mean zero) then it follows that, barring trivial and probability zero circumstances, the restriction in Proposition 2 does not hold. Thus, our test for logical consistency of EI–R requires nothing more than estimating a system of linear regressions with data that EI–R itself requires in the first place, computing a standard Wald statistic, and comparing it to a chi‐squared (k degrees of freedom) critical value.7"
"29","It is important to recognize that the test we propose for logical consistency of EI–R is one of necessity as opposed to sufficiency. That is, an application of EI–R must pass our test; if not, it is logically inconsistent. However, if an application of EI–R does pass the test, it does not therefore follow that the application is logically consistent. Rather, as we discuss blow, it is still possible that the application is logically inconsistent in some manner not covered by our test. Or, the failure to reject could simply reflect that fact that our test does not have a power of one."
"30","When a researcher's ecological dataset fails the test for logical consistency of EI–R, he has two options. He can abandon EI–R entirely and choose another method of data analysis. Or, he can model the aggregation bias that caused test failure with King's extended ecological inference model. We now discuss the latter option."
"31","King's extended ecological inference model is a one‐stage procedure as opposed to the two stage EI–R. Recall that, in the standard implementation of King's technique, the mean of (βbi, βwi) is  where this mean vector is constant across observations. However, in King's extended model the two elements of this latter vector are denoted  where subscripts denote dependence on observation i. This implies that (βbi, βwi) can be drawn from a different distribution than (βbj, βwj) where i≠j.         "
"32","By allowing the means  and  to vary in i, King's extended model allows dependence of βbi and βwi on covariates to be modeled in one stage. Hence, when the extended model is employed there are no second‐stage regressions.         "
"33","Readers interested in the details of the extended model should consult King (1997, 168–74). In brief, however, the extended model posits that the means  and  are linear functions of covariates Zi in much the same way as EI–R posits that βbi and βwi are linear functions of covariates:            "
"34","Three aspects of Equations (11) and (12) are worth noting. First, the role of Zi in the two equations is analogous to the role of a covariate vector in a regular least‐squares regression. Consider, for example, the case in which Zi contains only a single covariate so that αb, αw, and Zi are scalars. If, say, αb is positive, then it follows from Equation (11) that increases in Zi lead to increases in , i.e., to increases in βbi. This example shows in a simple way how the extended model directly estimates the influence that exogenous covariates have on the unknowns βbi and βwi.         "
"35","Second, the use in Equations (11) and (12) of elements of the five‐vector  (as opposed to elements of the ψ that was discussed in an earlier section) and the introduction of scalar terms φ1 and φ2 is of no substantive relevance. The only reason that the extended model does not assume something akin to  and similarly for  is that such a formulation would cause numerical difficulties during estimation.         "
"36","Third, even though the relationship between Zi and  is linear, the relationship between Zi and βbi is nonlinear (and similarly for  and βwi). This is because βbi and βwi are drawn from truncated distributions that are parameterized by, among other things,  and .         "
"37","Thus, what is important in Equations (11) and (12) is whether the elements of the parameter vectors αb and αw are zero. Note how this parallels questions in regression analysis: are estimated slope estimates zero or not? When the elements of αb and αw are all zero, then Zi has no influence on  and  and hence on βbi and βwi. However, if at least one element of αb or αw is nonzero, then at least one element of Zi systematically affects either βbi or βwi.         "
"38","Determining whether the elements of the vectors αb and αw are zero requires interpreting the output, i.e., parameter estimates and a covariance matrix, of an implementation of King's extended model to an ecological dataset. Adolph et al. argue that output of King's extended model can be interpreted in two ways, and the way that a researcher chooses for a given application of the extended model will depend on whether the researcher is interested in what are called superpopulation estimates or whether he seeks population estimates. Although, as discussed below, we believe that superpopulation estimates are almost always preferable for political science research, we nonetheless discuss both types of estimates.         "
"39","Perhaps the easiest way to see the difference between superpopulation and population estimates is via an example, Burden and Kimball's (1998) study of ticket‐splitting in the 1988 presidential and Congressional elections. If Burden and Kimball treat their study of the 1988 elections as an analysis of ticket‐splitting in general, then they are implicitly adopting a superpopulation approach. In such an approach, the 1988 election reflects a random draw from a pool of elections, and the object of inference is the pool. That is, superpopulation estimates in the ticket splitting context are estimates of the factors that drive ticket‐splitting in general and not just estimates of factors that influenced ticket splitting in 1988.         "
"40","On the other hand, if Burden and Kimball seek to test theories of ticket splitting that are specific or unique to the 1988 election, then generality beyond this election may not be an issue for them. In such a case, Burden and Kimball's study has a population approach. With this type of approach one does not extrapolate from data, i.e., treat estimates of the factors that affected 1988 ticket splitting as estimates of the factors that could have affected ticket splitting in 1992 and beyond.         "
"41","Whether a scholar chooses a superpopulation or a population approach ultimately reflects research objectives. Theory testing—i.e., determining whether ticket splitting reflects attempts by voters to balance elected officials who have opposed preferences—requires superpopulation estimates. Specific case analyses—i.e., was there ticket splitting in 1988 and what motivated it?—may sometimes call for population estimates."
"42","In the superpopulation approach, the role of a given ecological dataset is producing estimates of αb and αw. Hence, in this approach significance tests based on t‐statistics for the extended model vector estimates  and  can be used to determine whether the elements of Zi are significantly related to βbi and βwi. The superpopulation approach to analyzing extended model output rests on standard hypothesis testing theory and the fact that  and  have sampling distributions like all maximum‐likelihood estimates (note that King's extended model produces a likelihood function that can be estimated with standard optimization techniques).         "
"43","For the population approach, Adolph et al. suggest interpreting extended model output by plotting estimated densities of βbi against elements of Zi. Adolph et al.'s study of the extended model considers scalar Zi only, and to generalize this to vector Zi requires multivariate regressions as opposed to bivariate plots. In the appendix we describe a procedure to implement this generalization.         "
"44","Our generalization notwithstanding, there are several reasons to be skeptical of population estimates. First, political research almost invariably involves theory testing, and for this purpose superpopulation estimates are required. Second, and as detailed in the appendix, population estimates for King's ecological inference model are based on linear regressions of simulated βbi values on Zi values. Such linear models are inappropriate, as by construction there has to be a nonlinear relationship between βbi and Zi (note that βbi and βwi are bounded). Whereas the superpopulation estimates of αb and αw do not impose a linear relationship between βbi and Zi, the population estimates do impose this. Third, population estimates call for regressing the fitted values of a statistical model on the covariates that produced the fitted values. This sort of circularity, we suspect, is virtually guaranteed to make weak relationships between variables appear stronger than they are.         "
"45","When a given ecological dataset fails the test for logical consistency in EI–R, then this two‐stage statistical procedure is dominated by King's extended model since every problem which affects the latter also affects EI–R, plus EI–R is logically inconsistent. This does not depend on whether one uses a superpopulation or a population approach in an application of the extended model. The key point is that when one statistical procedure (the extended model) has associated with it a collection of problems and when a second procedure (EI–R) has the same collection of problems plus others, the latter procedure should not be used."
"46","Dominance and the importance of not using dominated statistical procedures should end the debate on EI–R. Nonetheless, one might think that quantitative research in political science routinely violates assumptions and that logical inconsistency in EI–R is no worse than other problems that are regularly ignored by scholars engaged in ecological inference. Indeed, empirical researchers make assumptions all the time, and it is virtually certain that some of these assumptions are wrong."
"47","Dominance notwithstanding, this does not imply that logical inconsistency can be safely ignored. Consider the following three points. First, our analysis below of Burden and Kimball (1998) shows that logical inconsistency in EI–R is not a minor empirical problem: applications of EI–R that suffer from it can produce gross errors. Second, when EI–R is logically inconsistent, whether severely or mildly, there are no regularity conditions that can be used to support its second stage. All statistical procedures must ultimately rest on noncontradictory regularity conditions, but this is literally impossible for a logically inconsistent application of EI–R. Third, and somewhat more philosophically, even if logical inconsistency were only a minor problem, researchers should always seek to make their analysis as internally coherent as possible and to violate as few assumptions as possible.         "
"48","Moreover, another reason to use King's extended model in lieu of EI–R reflects other sources of logical inconsistency that can plague the latter. We have focused solely on whether the two stages of EI–R make contradictory assumptions about aggregation bias. But, there are other ways in which EI–R can be logically inconsistent. For instance, EI–R's first stage assumes that (βbi, βwi) have a truncated, bivariate normal distribution, and this has implications for the disturbance terms νbi and νwi in Equations (5) and (7), respectively. It is unknown whether second‐stage assumptions about νbi and νwi are compatible with first‐stage bivariate normality, and the use of King's extended model renders this issue moot.         "
"49","Finally, and unrelated to logical inconsistency, Herron and Shotts (2003b) and Herron and Shotts (2003a) show that EI–R estimates are inconsistent regardless of whether the first stage of EI–R is compatible with its second. Thus, EI–R estimates are inaccurate even when this procedure is logically consistent.         "
"50","We now apply our test for logical consistency of EI–R to the ecological dataset used by Burden and Kimball (1998) in their study of ticket splitting in the U.S. Congressional and Presidential elections of 1988.8 For Burden and Kimball's House election data, Xi is the proportion of House voters in Congressional district i who voted for Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race, and Ti is the fraction who voted for the Democratic House candidate.9 Furthermore, βbi is the fraction who voted for a Democratic Congressional candidate as well as for Dukakis (straight ticket Democrats), and βwi is fraction who voted for Republican presidential candidate George H. W. Bush and a Democratic Congressional candidate (Burden and Kimball call these RD ticket splitters). In their application of EI–R to the study of RD ticket splitting, Burden and Kimball use estimates  as dependent variables in a second‐stage regression. Burden and Kimball also use values of  as dependent variables in an EI–R analysis of DR ticket‐splitting, i.e., rates at which individuals voted Democratic in the presidential race and Republican in a Congressional contest.10"
"51","The second‐stage covariate vector Zi that Burden and Kimball use to study RD ticket splitting has four elements. These consist of an indicator as to whether district i had a Democratic incumbent (Democratic Incumbent), the Democratic candidate's proportion of House campaign spending (Spending Ratio), whether district i allowed straight‐party voting (Ballot Format), and whether district i was located in the South (South).         "
"52","To apply our specification test for logical consistency of EI–R to Burden and Kimball's analysis of RD ticket splitting, we regress the four elements of Burden and Kimball's Zi vector on Xi. For DR ticket splitting, Burden and Kimball use the same covariates as in their RD analysis but with a Republican Incumbent indicator in place of Democratic Incumbent. Table 1 displays results for both RD and DR specification tests (which are the same except for the incumbent issue).11"
"53","The key row in Table 1 is labeled “Logical Consistency Test.” The two values in this row are Wald statistics which consider whether all slope estimates in the four RD regressions and in the four DR regressions are zero. The two associated Wald tests easily reject (the Chi‐squared, four degrees of freedom, critical value is 18.5 for a test with level 0.001), and this implies that Burden and Kimball's RD and DR ticket‐splitting analyses are logically inconsistent.         "
"54","In light of the elements of Burden and Kimball's Zi vector, our results on logical inconsistency should hardly be considered surprising. For example, Table 1 implies that the probability of a Congressional district's having a Democratic incumbent (element of Zi) is relatively high in districts that have many Dukakis voters (high Xi Districts). Indeed, it would be very anomalous if, as required by Proposition 2, there were no relationship between a district's presidential vote proclivity and the partisan affiliation of its incumbent Congressional representative.         "
"55","Thus, a researcher who wants to study RD and DR ticket splitting with Burden and Kimball's dataset should use King's extended ecological inference model to estimate how covariates affect ticket‐splitting rates. See Table 2 for Burden and Kimball superpopulation estimates (Ext–Super) as well as population estimates (denoted Ext–Pop and based on 5,000 iterations of the procedure described in the appendix).12 The table also reports verbatim Burden and Kimball's second‐stage regression estimates which, as has been shown, are based on a logically inconsistent application of EI–R.13"
"56","It is important to note that the magnitudes of EI–R and superpopulation estimates for RD and DR ticket splitting are not directly comparable. Extended model estimates of the vectors αb and αw are not regression coefficients but, as we explained in the context of Equations (11) and (12), represent shifts in the means of the distributions from which βbi and βwi, respectively, are drawn.         "
"57","In their analysis of RD ticket splitting, Burden and Kimball find that Democratic Incumbent, Spending Ratio, and South all have positive and significant effects on Republican presidential voters' propensities to split their tickets. Moreover, Burden and Kimball find that Ballot Format has a negative and significant effect. The superpopulation estimates for RD ticket splitting, however, provide support for only one of these results: Democratic Incumbent has a positive and significant effect on RD ticket splitting. The extended model superpopulation estimates for Spending Ratio, South, and Ballot Format, which in the logically inconsistent EI–R analysis are highly significant, are not statistically significant once this problem is corrected.         "
"58","In contrast, the population estimate of the relationship between RD ticket splitting and Spending Ratio is statistically significant at the 0.001 level. What, then, can one make of the disparity between the superpopulation and the population estimates for Spending Ratio? There is compelling statistical evidence that campaign spending in the 1988 elections influenced ticket splitting levels. One cannot conclude from this, however, that campaign spending influences ticket splitting in a general way; to make such an extrapolation requires superpopulation estimates, and the superpopulation estimate corresponding to Spending Ratio is not significant.         "
"59","It is intuitive that the RD population estimates in Table 2 have higher levels of statistical significance than the corresponding superpopulation estimates. A superpopulation approach requires greater generality and imposes more on one's data than a population approach, which is akin to a single case study that cannot be generalized.         "
"60","We now turn to DR ticket splitting. In the right side of Table 2, Burden and Kimball's logically inconsistent EI–R results indicate that Republican Incumbent and Spending Ratio have highly significant effects on DR splitting. According to superpopulation estimates from the extended model, Republican Incumbent has a significant effect whereas there is no evidence to support the significance of Spending Ratio. As in the RD analysis the population estimate of the relationship between Spending Ratio and DR ticket splitting is statistically significant.         "
"61","There are, notably, no results in Table 2 that are statistically significant in an extended model analysis, either superpopulation or population based, yet nonsignificant in EI–R (at a level of 0.05 or below). This means that, by employing EI–R in a logically inconsistent way, Burden and Kimball generated findings that are not sustained once logical consistency is adjusted for.14"
"62","It is straightforward to see from their discussion of ticket splitting in the 1988 election that Burden and Kimball chose a superpopulation approach in their research. Namely, they use 1988 election results to test theories of intentional ticket splitting, which describe the effect of ballots formats on vote returns, and so forth. These general theories can only be tested with superpopulation estimates. Indeed, at the conclusion of their article on ticket splitting Burden and Kimball say, “Though our application was to 1988, we believe that our conclusions apply to most modern presidential elections” (1998, 542).         "
"63","Thus, the key columns in Table 2 are those labeled “Ext–Super,” and hence we conclude that most of Burden and Kimball's substantive results on ticket splitting are artifacts of a self‐contradictory statistical technique.15 Using a method that is logically consistent we have shown that, with one exception (the effect of incumbent partisan affiliation), Burden and Kimball's substantive findings on the causes of ticket splitting are statistically unfounded. The exception is notable since it is quite intuitive: House districts with Democratic incumbents are more likely to produce split tickets that support both a Republican presidential candidate as well as the incumbent Congressional incumbent (and symmetrically for districts with Republican Congressional incumbent). Because the extended model analysis of Burden and Kimball's House data produces several nonnull results, the model's failure to produce such results in other cases does not reflect an overall inability to estimate anything. Rather, the extended model produces nonnull results when such findings are justified by data.16"
"64","We have proposed a test for logical consistency of the two‐stage statistical procedure EI–R and illustrated its usefulness by applying the test to an ecological dataset from Burden and Kimball (1998). Our test easily rejects the logical consistency of Burden and Kimball's EI–R analysis of the causes of ticket splitting in House elections. Moreover, in a logically consistent statistical analysis of their ticket‐splitting dataset, the majority of Burden and Kimball's findings vanish.         "
"65","We suspect that researchers have in the past turned to EI–R and may wish to continue doing so, because applications of its logical replacement, King's extended model, are likely to generate numerous null results from which few substantive conclusions about political behavior can be drawn. A prevalence of null results does not reflect flaws in the extended model. Rather, null results reflect the difficulty of incorporating covariates in ecological inference."
"66","In contemporary political science research and in social science more generally, statistically significant “findings” are valued more than null results. But, research findings should not be taken seriously if they exist solely because of a statistical quirk, i.e., solely because they appear in a logically inconsistent application of EI–R yet not in a logically consistent ecological inference model. Some problems in political science, and the study of ticket splitting may be one especially good example, may simply be intractable with aggregate data. It is better to accept this rather than attempt to extract unsupportable findings from data with a misleading statistical technique."
