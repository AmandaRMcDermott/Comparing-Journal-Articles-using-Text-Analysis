"1","Emile is born into a disenchanted world (Bloom 1979; Vogel 1995, 220). Commercial society, by its very nature, seems to doom individuals to be unfree. Rousseau sets the most arduous standard for Emile's education: He wants him to understand how to be free in a world of dependence. The challenge, however, is necessary for Rousseau. Being a man, in our historical circumstances, involves having to live in commercial society. Emile is “a savage made to inhabit cities. He has to know how to find his necessities in them, to draw on its inhabitants, and to live, if not like them, at least with them” (E 205). But everywhere on earth, there are just “simulacra of laws” (E 473) and people are enslaved to superfluity and public opinion.         "
"2","Commercial society, however, does not present itself immediately as a disenchanted world. On the contrary, it promises a great improvement of everyone's wealth thanks to an advanced form of division of labor, which creates a state of mutual dependence.The division of labor is deemed “the apparent principle of all our institutions” (E 193: OC IV.467):            "
"3","Let us form a society of these ten men and let each apply himself, for himself and for the nine others, to the kind of occupation which suits him best. Each will profit from the talents of the others as if he alone had them all. Each will perfect his own by continuous practice, and it will turn out that all ten, perfectly well provided for, will even have a surplus for others. (E 193)               "
"4","Proponents of commercial society claim that the division of labor enables the natural complementarity of human abilities to be beneficial to all.6 Each individual's ability will be enhanced by its exclusive exercise. And the division of labor itself, by saving time and effort, will create a surplus. Therefore, they claim, by working for one's own interest, each person will work for the public good. In a commercial society, the dependence of each on everyone is the very condition for society to be prosperous. Dependence is desirable because it is based on complementarity, and this complementarity generates a better outcome than the mere juxtaposition of independent individuals.         "
"5","For economists like Lemercier de la Rivière (Lemercier 1767, 40) or Forbonnais,7 commercial society is based on the idea that the general will or the state does not need to interfere with economic exchanges because self‐interest brings about the common good through a spontaneous order created by commercial relations. For instance, Lemercier favors a strong state that would guarantee order and property rights, yet not one that would intervene within economic exchanges once these rights are secured (1767, 46–50). Rousseau was aware that presenting commercial society in the glowing light of beneficial interdependence was becoming a consensus in his time (PN 100). He criticizes this system, writing that it “puts men in a position where they can live only by obstructing, supplanting, deceiving, betraying, destroying one another” (PN 100).         "
"6","Rousseau's concern with commercial society cannot be, however, that it is based on mutual dependence as such. Mutual dependence can be desirable, if it is mutually beneficial. Indeed, in the Social Contract, but also in Poland, he argues that individuals should be not only excessively dependent on the state (SC II.12)8 but also create a system of mutually beneficial dependence (even though there would be only a basic division of labor)9 between citizens. His critique is that the dependence praised by the proponents of commercial society is harmful because it is mutually beneficial only in appearance. We thus need to pause to define which features dependence ought to have in order not to compromise freedom.         "
"7","Relying on others to fulfill one's needs is not a threat to my freedom if I can count on the fact that others will track my interests either because they are forced to do so by the law (as in the Social Contract) or because they are naturally inclined to do so (as in the family). In the Social Contract, the lack of personal dependence (SC I.7, II.12) comes from the excessive dependence on the City (SC II.12).10 The dependence on the City is not worrying for Rousseau because it is based on a radical equality (SC I.6), which makes subjection “equal for all.” By contrast, what prevents dependence from being harmful in a closed community is not equality. In Julie, the community of Clarens is based on explicit paternalism. Yet the close union between masters and servants, which generates feelings of duty and devotion, guarantees that everyone's best interest will be taken into account.11 None of these mechanisms are at play in commercial society: Neither the law nor sentiments guarantee that others will be forced to track my interest. Rousseau argues that dependence in commercial society is not mutually beneficial because it is not based on equality and because no sentiment compensates for this inequality.         "
"8","It now becomes easier to understand why dependence in commercial society threatens freedom. In the Social Contract, Rousseau distinguishes four different kinds of freedom: natural, civil, democratic, and moral (Simpson 2006). While each of them depends on specific political and psychological conditions, we can sort them out into two broad categories from the point of view of their relation to dependence: either positive or negative forms of freedom (Wokler 2012, 178). On the one hand, natural and civil freedom articulate a negative conception of freedom: Being free means not being subjected to any kind of harmful dependence. In the Letters from the Mountain, Rousseau claims that I am free insofar as I do not have to obey others. “Liberty consists less in doing just as you will than in not being submitted to the will of another; it further consists in not submitting the will of another to our own” (LM 8th letter, III.84). On the other hand, democratic and moral freedom are positive kinds of freedom. Whether individually or collectively, freedom in this sense is self‐ruling, that is, dependence on one's own law (either as part of a collective or alone). In the Social Contract, Rousseau maintains that I am free when I obey myself alone (SC I.6.iv). In a commercial society, where dependence is pervasive and not kept in check by law or virtuous sentiments, neither positive nor negative freedom seems possible. Either freedom does not exist at all in commercial society or it takes another form, which Rousseau has not yet acknowledged and endorsed.         "
"9","Throughout his writings, Rousseau analyzes how the corrupt world of commercial society threatens freedom in seemingly inescapable ways: the division of labor, which curtails individuals’ abilities (DI 167); private property, which fosters inequality (DI 161, 172; E 195); and the inflammation of amour propre fueled by conspicuous consumption and the endless pursuit of useless objects (P 224). As she starts to read Emile, the reader witnesses Emile faced with a double challenge: learning to see behind the shining appearance of commercial society and learning to deal with the widespread dependence created by inequality and the advanced division of labor. Like Emile himself, the reader will have to assess the nature and limits of freedom as defined and promised by the emerging trend of political economy.         "
"10","Rousseau makes Emile fulfill this task through the highly contested means of a “natural” education.12 Since Emile's education is entirely manipulated by his preceptor, it may be difficult to understand what Rousseau means by nature. The first meaning of nature is its equivalence with the primitive dispositions of man (E 39). This is why anything that develops or extends these primitive dispositions, without corrupting them, is still called “natural,” even though this extension is artificial. A second, and related, sense is that nature, understood as a set of laws, is equivalent to necessity and distinct from the disorderly world of human will. Emile will thus learn to develop his primitive dispositions by exercising them in the world of fixed laws, rather than the chaos of human will and desire. Lastly, and most importantly, Rousseau uses the idea of nature as an equivalent of “goodness”: “Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man” (E 37). As I will show in the last section, the “natural” education is a standard set in contrast with the existing corruption of society: It is a mental construct that we should use to exercise our judgment on actual society.13"
"11","The main goal of natural education is to teach Emile to be an independent man who is “always in his own place” (E 42), no matter what fortune throws his way. This is why central parts of the book specifically target the possibility of independence in commercial society. As Emile grows older, he learns that commercial society is a world of dependence through a series of “economic lessons” on property, the division of labor, and economic exchange (Books II and III in particular). Rousseau organizes Emile's education to independence along two strategies: (1) taking distance from the evils of commercial society by learning how to be materially, morally, and epistemically independent and (2) adapting to commercial society in order to be able to survive in it, all the while keeping one's integrity. These two complementary strategies target the different obstacles to independence in commercial society (division of labor, destitution, distorted moral economy, inflamed amour propre.) While they are mostly learned during Emile's early adolescence (Book III), different stages of these two strategies take place throughout Emile's life and culminate at the end of Book V.         "
"12","The first educational strategy in Emile is to teach the boy to be self‐sufficient both through the acquisition of practical skills and by channeling his mental and epistemic dispositions. Emile has to be raised not only as someone who could survive without anyone's assistance, but also as someone who judges well (i.e., for himself without depending on others’ opinions; E 205–7). This is the part of his education that is akin to a strategy of withdrawal from the world, as any premature contact with the corruption of the world would destroy Emile's education.            "
"13","In order to escape economic dependence, one must first learn how to be self‐sufficient by acquiring practical skills. Appropriately, Emile is supposed to learn self‐sufficiency “by himself,” with the aid of Robinson Crusoe, the first book he is given (E 184), and the secret guidance of Jean‐Jacques. Modern man has forgotten how to provide for himself under the division of labor. He has unlearned the basic skills necessary to find shelter, food, and protection against a hostile environment. Emile thus needs to go back to the source of man's perfectibility, thanks to an exercise of the imagination: What if he were alone on a desert island like Robinson?               "
"14","The acquisition of skills is a reappropriation of one's body as a tool that can be used to extract nature's resources. Instead of asking others to give him food, Emile learns to get it from nature itself, by using his own forces (E 119). The disease of men in commercial society is that they believe subsistence appears by being sold or provided by others.14 They are deceived by commercial society, which makes things appear magically without any labor or relation to nature.               "
"15","The development of skills in “natural” education counters man's loss of skills in commercial society. Just like primitive man, Emile learns how to build a shelter, sow, harvest, and make weapons (E 185). Later, as a young adult in civil society (Book V), Emile is shown demonstrating these skills, earning the admiration of peasants and workers for his many talents (E 435). The most natural feature of man—his perfectibility, which is also a plasticity allowing him to learn any skill—is an exceptional talent in modern society. By emphasizing the denaturation of men in commercial societies, Rousseau also underlines their radical impoverishment.               "
"16","The acquisition of practical skills has an immediate moral dimension. Emile's relation to nature means that he learns to “submit to necessity.” Rousseau distinguishes between dependence on things and dependence on men (E 85). Learning to extract food and shelter from nature is a lesson of dependence upon things: Emile is confronted with the limits of his strength and the fact that no amount of anger, flattery, or begging will get him what he wants from nature. Instead, he has to subject himself to the laws of nature to get his sustenance. Dependence on things limits the scope of Emile's freedom, if freedom is understood as the power to accomplish one's will. But Rousseau never understands freedom strictly in this way. Freedom is a relation between one's power and one's will (SC III.1). As Emile accepts the natural limits of his strength, he feels no frustration that nature presents itself as an obstacle to his will. Dependence on things is not corrupting.               "
"17","By imitating Robinson Crusoe, Emile learns to “limit his desires to his strength” (E 68). When a young child develops the habit of subjecting himself to the will of others, or having others obey him,15 he loses his capacity for self‐mastery. Because his desires are unbounded by his strength, they go beyond their natural limit. This is why the story of Robinson Crusoe is a story of the reappropriation of self‐mastery. Emile's education to independence entails not being subjected to external wills with superior strength. The point is not that he will not encounter such superior strength as an adult, but rather that he should not get used to obeying without understanding the source of his obedience (E 121). Independence is not only the work of the body and its capacity to generate new skills. It is a moral quality.               "
"18","Why Emile would be allowed to read Robinson Crusoe seems puzzling at first. Indeed, Jean‐Jacques insists that education should be practical rather than bookish. Education should allow Emile to “get by” everywhere, rather than initiate him to wisdom: “You will never get to the point of producing wise men if you do not in the first place produce rascals. This was the education of the Spartans: instead of being glued to books, they began by being taught how to steal their dinner” (E 119). Knowledge is practical: “I hate books,” Rousseau tells us (E 184), because “they only teach one to talk about what one does not know.”               "
"19","The choice of this book may seem all the stranger since we could read it as extolling what Rousseau hates with passion: bourgeois ethics. Defoe's novel shows how a man pursuing capitalist ventures of the worst kind (slave trade) has to transform his thirst for money into the simple desire of fulfilling his needs through hard work (Moretti 2013, 34). Robinson is the same kind of bourgeois that Emile sets out to criticize.               "
"20","But Rousseau reads Robinson as a “treatise on natural education,” which contains the key to moral and epistemic independence: It provides an original position that should be the basis to exercise one's judgment.               "
"21","A practical book aiming to teach Emile useful skills to enhance his material independence, Robinson Crusoe turns out to be the means of displacing the point of view of social man to a situation of isolation. A man obsessed by worldly success and deeply influenced by social passions, Robinson is forced into a position where the semblance of the world has been removed. He has to focus on what is useful. By taking all relevance away from opinion, the point of view of the isolated man reveals the true value of things, which is their utility:                  "
"22","The surest means of raising oneself above prejudices and ordering one's judgments about the true relations of things is to put oneself in the place of an isolated man and to judge everything as this man himself ought to judge of it with respect to his own utility. (E III.185)                     "
"23","Viewing the world through Crusoe's eyes enables Emile to develop diverse skills. But even more importantly, this thought experiment functions as an epochè, a suspension of common judgment, to distinguish the reality of usefulness from its semblance: If the whole social world disappeared, which needs would I first have to fulfill? Thinking like Robinson is to purge the superfluous. This knowledge proves invaluable for the young Emile who aspires to be free: If one knows what is truly useful, always and everywhere, one can use this knowledge to be necessary to others, without becoming beholden to them. The science of the useful (l'utile) turns out to be a powerful one, not to retreat from society, but to learn how to thrive in any kind of society, even corrupt ones. It is a necessary epistemic device to take distance from the corrupt values of commercial society.               "
"24","The knowledge of utility and the original experience of Robinson provide Emile with a third possibility between retreating from the world or embracing social values. They provide him with the possibility of internally taking a distinct point of view that enables him to be everywhere in his place because he does not depend on anyone for his knowledge. Using epistemic displacement as a tool, Emile becomes able to resist the need for public recognition in a corrupt society, which will necessarily coax him in false directions. The knowledge of truth is morally freeing. Knowing what is truly useful, he can resist enslavement to the false goods that are universally sought after."
"25","Wealth, however, has a special place in commercial society and is particularly hard to resist. As in his other writings, such as the unpublished Fragments on Wealth, Rousseau maintains that wealth, the lure of commercial society, is corrupting (E 52, 354). Wealth does not simply refer to the possession of things. It entirely transforms and redefines the person by changing his moral dispositions and making him incapable of humane feelings (W 472, 476).               "
"26","The epistemic displacement of Robinson thus needs to be supplemented with a second moral displacement: Emile must learn to think as if he were poor. Since economic relations are subject to constant reversals of fortune, Emile, who is an heir (E I; OC IV.267), needs to learn to “think poor” to resist economic cycles. Rousseau describes such a change of fortune in the Second Discourse, pointing out that the supernumeraries (les surnuméraires) became poor because they did not change when everything was changing around them (DI II; OC III.175). Poverty is a consequence of the incapacity of adapting to circumstances. We have seen so far that adaptability has proved necessary for Emile to be free in commercial society. Moral independence is the further and necessary step for him to be everywhere in his place.               "
"27","Moral independence is not grounded on habituation or a pure moral conviction. It is based on knowledge: the knowledge that the commercial world is morally arbitrary. Emile's lesson on the origin of property is part of this broader lesson on moral arbitrariness. In this episode, Emile has planted seeds, but when he comes to harvest them, he discovers that the gardener has destroyed his garden. Thus, Emile painfully learns that labor is neither the only, nor the primordial, foundation of property. The possible natural right of property depends upon both convention and the right of first occupancy. In this instance, the gardener had already tilled the garden before Emile arrived. Finding the earth covered with “mine and thine,” Emile finds himself without any land to exercise his labor.16"
"28","Young Emile learns what it means to be poor in Book II: not to have a garden, and therefore to be alienated from ownership, no matter how hard he works. Since Emile knows that poverty is morally arbitrary, as a young adult (Book V), he will be able to withstand the public infamy associated with poverty (E 472). Moral independence is acquired by integrating the moral arbitrariness of the corrupt world, where modern man is forced to dwell.               "
"29","Self‐sufficiency in society soon reaches its limits. Emile is born in an age when the earth is already covered by private property and inhabited by other humans. Robinson Crusoe's island is an exception, not the rule, in the topography of the modern world. His skills are thus largely inapplicable. Emile will have to adapt his education unto natural independence to the artificial and social world of dependence. Here, I argue that Rousseau experiments with the apparent opposite of self‐sufficiency. By skillfully transforming harmful dependence into beneficial dependence, Emile is given the possibility of embracing interdependence. This second educational strategy aims thus to develop a capacity for adaptation to the chaotic world of commercial society."
"30","Following Rousseau's well‐known motto of finding the remedy in the evil (Neuhouser 2008; Starobinski 1976), the response to dependence in commercial society has to be found within it. If the division of labor makes us dependent and vulnerable, we should use our knowledge of commercial society to counter its detrimental effects. One central problem of economic life, which Rousseau clearly identifies, is its cyclical pattern of precariousness. Nobody is immune from suddenly becoming poor, and thus dependent on others in a way that threatens freedom (E 194). Rousseau vehemently rejects the idea of the “natural” regulation of markets (DPE 7–8; OC III.1667) and any related notion of market‐based justice. The best way to remain free in such a society is thus to acquire a timeless skill, which remains immune to fickle demands.            "
"31","Here, Crusoe's lessons prove handy. In a society divided according to tasks, I can be free from subordination if I specialize in a “useful” professional occupation that will always be in demand, which is “a trade that could serve Robinson Crusoe on his island” (E 198). We should remember that the standard is “natural” and not “social” usefulness: What matters is not what a corrupt commercial society finds useful, but what any kind of society would. All jobs associated with luxury, conspicuous consumption, or unethical behavior are thus not adequate candidates, pace Mandeville and his followers, who would argue that thieves or luxury are useful. Therefore, Emile should not sully his soul by becoming a spy or an embroiderer. He should become a shoemaker, or even better, a carpenter (E 199). Emile should choose to work with his hands because manual work does not require fawning, begging, or being introduced to the court to be exercised.17"
"32","Contrary to received opinion, Rousseau does not reject the division of labor wholesale. In order to fit into this advanced division of labor, Emile needs to learn a useful trade. But to do so, he needs first to acquire the basic understanding of the division of labor and commercial exchange. Emile's education is organized as a series of visits to workshops, where he partakes in different types of manual labor in order to understand how work is divided, and how cooperation is necessary in complex arts and industry (E III.193; OC IV.455–56). At the end of Emile's practical education, Jean‐Jacques “easily bring[s] him to feel the need for these exchanges and to put himself in a position to profit from them” (E 193).            "
"33","Ultimately embracing economic interdependence, by picking an occupation that fulfills a perennial demand, enables individuals to be free because it increases their capacity to resist domination. The artisan is the freest of all men because he does not need to accept subjection. “Of all conditions, the artisan is the most independent of fortune and men. The artisan depends only on his work” (E 195). Just like man in the state of nature, he can exit whenever someone pressures him and tries to place him under his dependence (DI 158): An artisan just takes his bags and leaves. Being free in the economic sphere, for Rousseau, thus depends on being both truly interdependent, yet keeping a capacity for exit akin to man in the state of nature.            "
"34","The consequences of this view are threefold. First, Rousseau tries to take as seriously as possible the idea emerging in the new current of political economy (Reinert 2011; Spector 2007) that freedom can exist as a pure capacity to contract and exit at will. Freedom here takes a form unknown in the Social Contract, yet reminiscent of natural freedom: a capacity to exit to avoid domination. This freedom recalls that of natural man (DI 158: “If I am tormented in one place, who will keep me from going somewhere else?”).            "
"35","The second conclusion is that Rousseau values another modern idea: that skilled labor can be a source of empowerment and that property can be a source of servitude. Being a skilled laborer means “getting a rank which [one] cannot lose” (E 196). Contrary to what we might have expected, property is not the guarantee of one's independence in commercial society. While this may be true for the ultrarich, property is a burden for the poor. This is why teaching Emile only agriculture would be unsuitable, even though agrarian life is the most desirable life. Here, we can suppose Rousseau was thinking of the difficult situation of the French peasantry, as well as the financial difficulties of the petty aristocracy bound to local domains. Because skilled labor is mobile, it fits the rapidly changing structure of French society at the end of the eighteenth century. “We are approaching a state of crisis and the age of revolutions” (E 194), Rousseau writes. In such a society, any person would be well advised to acquire only the kind of assets that a revolution cannot annihilate.            "
"36","Rousseau's vindication of skilled labor serves another purpose in Emile. In the third book, he argues that in the social state, man is placed under the necessity to work in order to become a full member of society (E 195). He thus inaugurates the French revolutionary tradition, culminating with Sieyès, according to which citizenship is based on labor, and not property, as it is in classical republicanism. By working, which is an indispensable “social duty,” individuals pay their debt to society. “In society, where [man] necessarily lives at the expense of others, he owes them the price of his keep in work. This is without exception” (E 195). I have already mentioned that for Rousseau, the “apparent mutuality” of the advanced division of labor hides the inequality of the burden shared by the rich and the poor. Here, Emile is called upon to discern the real principle of any legitimate social order: the equal participation of all in the work necessary for its functioning.            "
"37","Finally, Rousseau was aware of the specific danger of markets in commercial society: the danger of impersonal domination. Contrary to Neuhouser (2013), I believe that Rousseau is aware of this aspect of the economic market. Rousseau recognizes that my freedom to exit does not make me absolutely free in all circumstances. On the contrary, he insists that reversals of fortune are the main characteristic of life in commercial society and that I may find myself destitute through no fault of my own and no evil plot of someone else. I can be economically vulnerable without someone intentionally dominating me. He portrays Emile as a wanderer reduced to his bare skills. This is why he argues that freedom must have an internal dimension: the ability to be sovereign over one's passions and one's social position. Having practical skills to be self‐sufficient and knowing a trade that enables one to exit at will are thus crucial, yet these skills would not enable Emile to be free if he were not also epistemically and morally independent.            "
"38","I have argued so far that Emile provides a way for the individual to deal with harmful dependence, which is different from the models of the citizen (the Republic) and of man (domestic and solitary existence). I have shown that the third model, Emile’s economic model in commercial society, displays a combination of both strategies: It is in part a model of moral and epistemic displacement, akin to a withdrawal from society and in part a transformation of harmful into beneficial dependence by adapting to the necessity of markets. This model takes the point of view of the individual (instead of the legislator) but insists on the necessity of being within society.         "
"39","There is, however, one major objection to this interpretation of Emile: that this model is a failure. Ultimately, Jean‐Jacques urges Emile to retreat from commercial society and lead an agrarian life with Sophie (E 473). His whole education in society seems thus to culminate in withdrawing from it. Furthermore, even if Emile ends on a seemingly happy note (“if there is happiness on earth, it must be sought in the abode where we live” (E 480)), we know from Emile and Sophie that their marriage itself fails. In any case, the young man begs Jean‐Jacques to keep “guiding him,” as if there were finally no self‐mastery to be attained through natural education. A proper interpretation of Emile requires taking into account the frame in which its economic lessons are expressed.         "
"40","We should first note that the failure of the model of natural man in society does not mean that the model itself does not serve any purpose. All of Rousseau's theoretical models end up failing in one way or another. But this failure says less about Rousseau's philosophical shortcomings than it describes the limits of modern social forms. In the Social Contract, Rousseau notes that the Republic has a limited life and that “even the best constituted states will die” (SC III). In turn, the ideal of the tranquil household may be nothing more than an idyll, since the very existence of such places is doubtful in modernity. In the Letter to d'Alembert, Rousseau mentions the existence of such a lost paradise “around Neufchâtel” but has to admit his memory of details is failing him 30 years after he witnessed this “unique” community (OC V.55–57).         "
"41","A more serious problem would be that the model of natural man in society is not desirable at all, regardless of whether it is doomed to failure. We should recall Emile's reaction at the end of his travels, when he is supposed to pick a place to settle down. He affirms that he is able to be free anywhere on earth thanks to his education: “Rich or poor, I shall be free. I shall not be free in this or that land, in this or that region; I shall be free everywhere on earth” (E 472). Jean‐Jacques approves of these words, noting that indeed his natural education has made Emile a man capable of this feat. Living in a commercial society is hardly desirable. It is nonetheless possible to live there while remaining free and retaining one's integrity. While this does not make commercial society attractive, it carves out a space in it where freedom remains possible, granted certain conditions.         "
"42","This possibility matters to Emile’s readers because they are forced to dwell in such a commercial society. Rousseau's Emile shows how life in commercial society, though an impoverished kind of life, can be freer for those who strive to understand and follow his guidance. One could learn a real trade instead of being a fawner, one could learn to be more self‐sufficient instead of constantly needing others, and one could gain some moral control over one's passions through appropriate epistemic displacement. These are practical ways to use to one's advantage the chaos and moral arbitrariness of commercial society.         "
"43","Though hardly an absolutely desirable ideal, the third model of natural man in society thus offers a corrective to a vision of Rousseau as a utopian writer. In Book I, Rousseau insists that Emile has to be educated to sustain life in the chaotic society of his time, which he would be able to withstand as a man. We can better see now how the life of natural man in society is a real third way, different from the other stages and moments that unravel as we follow young Emile's education. Surely Emile presents the reader with a series of educative models of the good life, such as the life of epicurean enjoyment at the end of Book IV. All the phases in Emile's education finish with a clear upshot: learning how to judge (Schaeffer 2013).         "
"44","Yet life in commercial society is neither just a thought experiment (e.g., “What would I do if I were rich?”) nor a mere developmental phase (e.g., learning to control one's emotions). It is to sustain such a chaotic life that natural education was necessary. Like other scholars who have recently argued in favor of taking seriously Rousseau's realism (Putterman 2001), I take Emile's life in commercial society to offer practical guidance that could help his readers to emancipate themselves to some extent from their socioeconomic circumstances.         "
"45","It would be absolutely wrong, however, to downplay the critical potential of Emile. Rousseau is not an ambivalent friend of commercial society, and Emile clearly condemns such a society. In fact, my interpretation takes Emile to show its high cost. All forms of life have a cost for Rousseau. The life in a Spartan city is costly: It suffices to think of the mother who puts her love for her fatherland before the love of her sons who are killed on the battlefield (E 40). Life within the closed community is no less costly. In Clarens, paternalism dominates the life of the community. Yet despite these costs, individuals can experience life in such patriotic and close‐knit communities as fulfilling. By contrast, life in commercial society appears full of easy commodities and pleasures. Yet it leaves the individual internally divided, inflames his amour propre, and condemns him to harmful dependence. Thus, my argument is that the cost of living in a commercial society is much higher than the other possible ways of life. The detailed and rhetorically powerful form of the novel is supposed to lead the reader to this conclusion. The lengthy description of Emile's acquaintance with commercial society has thus to be framed with its contrary at both ends of his life: his education apart from the world, and his eventual retreat from it.         "
"46","Freedom, in Emile, is the object of a long education. Its definition evolves in the course of the novel, following the development of Emile's intellectual faculties and the mastery of his emotions. By the end of the novel, however, it is hard to recognize any kind of freedom that we would know from Rousseau's presentation in the Social Contract. Although it is possible to be free within commercial society, the freedom it provides is much thinner than any type of freedom available in a Republic, be it civil or democratic. While Emile is capable of escaping the domination of specific masters, he does so at the cost of becoming a wandering laborer. As an individual incapable of establishing laws, he is subjected to unfair ones. Settling down anywhere would amount to losing his freedom to exit: “I have found that dominion and liberty are two incompatible words; therefore, I could be a master of a cottage only in ceasing to be master of myself” (E 472). “Self‐mastery” within commercial society can be acquired only at the price of letting go of property. Whereas the citizen in a Republic finds an anchor for his citizenship in property (DPE), the wandering individual of commercial society has no such help. His freedom is bought at the price of losing any fatherland.         "
"47","While Emile defines freedom as self‐mastery, the relation of freedom to the world is different from moral freedom in the Social Contract. In the latter, individuals acquire civil and moral freedom by the contract through which they collectively become able to control the laws to which they subject themselves: They become free by an act of collective self‐ruling, that is, an act of democratic freedom. By contrast, in Emile, the individual is not in control of the external world: He is subject to the unjust laws of despotic countries and the forces of markets. Freedom thus consists in “yielding to necessity” (E 472), but “necessity” extends to the social world, beyond the natural world to which it was initially supposed to refer. Freedom in the strong sense of self‐mastery is possible. But self‐mastery is defined as an entirely internal act, which requires relinquishing the possibility of giving laws to the world:            "
"48","It seems to me that in order to make oneself free, one has to do nothing. It suffices that one not want to stop being free. It is you, my master, who have made me free in teaching me to yield to necessity. Let it come when it pleases. I let myself be carried along without constraints, and since I do not wish to fight it, I do not attach myself to anything to hold me back. (E 472)               "
"49","Emile offers an original way of understanding freedom as a purely internal phenomenon. Jean‐Jacques acknowledges that Emile's analysis is correct: “Freedom is found in no government,” he confirms, “it is in the heart of the free man. He takes it with him everywhere. The vile man takes his servitude everywhere. The latter would be a slave in Geneva, the former a free man in Paris” (E 473). The first cost of living in commercial society is thus the internalization of freedom as self‐mastery, which is an impoverished type of freedom since it foregoes the possibility for man to transform social life.         "
"50","The second cost of life within commercial society is that freedom is only possible for a very small elite. I have already mentioned how young Emile becomes acquainted with the “supernumeraries.” Those unable to adapt to mercurial social changes become their victims: They are unable to profit from the advanced division of labor. They become burdens to themselves and to others because they do not understand how to be interdependent in the mutually beneficial way praised by proponents of commercial society. In other words, commercial society creates a class of permanently dominated individuals."
"51","Rousseau's argument about the structural elitism of commercial society should not be reduced to the economic argument that commercial society creates inequality or that it is to the advantage of the bourgeois. His critique delves further into the character of freedom. Throughout Emile, Rousseau insists that commercial society is characterized by reversals of fortune. The rich can be so only momentarily. But rich or not, they are never free unless they are capable of withstanding reversals of fortune. This is crucial for Rousseau because the challenge of modernity is precisely the challenge of adapting to cyclical poverty (E 42).         "
"52","Only a very small elite, different from the bourgeois elite, will be able to be free in commercial society because “natural” adaptability can be acquired only through an extremely select education. It requires a set of demanding qualities that are unlikely to exist without the rigorous natural education given to Emile. Nothing less than a preceptor like Jean‐Jacques makes it possible to cultivate a soul with a degree of integrity sufficient to withstand the chaos and corruption of commercial society. While the proponents of commercial society argue that freedom is only the minimal possibility of signing and exiting contracts at will, Rousseau shows that freedom requires a very demanding capacity of self‐mastery acquired only by natural education."
"53","The final cost of the model of natural man in society is that ultimately even this small elite is unable to be a model for the mass, as it should for Rousseau. If Emile stayed in commercial society, he could not devote himself to the masses and would thus be unable to repay his debt to society. The third model must first be shown to be possible, and then undesirable, for Rousseau to sharpen his ongoing critique of the proponents of commercial society. The drawback of such a society is that even those who manage to attain freedom cannot guide others out of subjection. Rousseau argues that the test of freedom that Emile sets before our eyes fails because it is not generalizable beyond the exceptional case of the young hero. The ultimate failure of natural education is not a condemnation of natural education: It is the demonstration that the promises of commercial society are a pure semblance.         "
"54","The eighteenth‐century reader of Emile can thus learn from the book at two levels, which appear to be, yet are not, incompatible. On the one hand, he can learn practical ways of becoming freer by dealing with the harmful dependence pervasive in a commercial society, thanks to all the techniques described in the book. On the other hand, this hope of freedom, displayed in front of his eyes, keeps him attached to the narrative of a text that will force him to realize his utter impotence in commercial society. By calling the reader to exercise his natural judgment in and on commercial society, Emile is a practical tool of critique and emancipation.         "
