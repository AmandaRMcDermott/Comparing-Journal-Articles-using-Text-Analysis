"1","The domain‐specific approach to the study of public opinion posits that everyone holds and uses abstract principles relevant to a given policy domain to constrain their policy preferences within that domain. These principles help people figure out what goes with what within, but not across, distinct issue areas (Feldman 1988; Hurwitz and Peffley 1987). For example, in the social welfare arena people deduce preferences from general beliefs about equality, while in the foreign policy domain attitudes toward defense issues are rooted in beliefs about militarism. Furthermore, beliefs about equality will not influence defense attitudes, nor will militarism affect social welfare preferences.         "
"2","Why should everyone base his or her policy preferences on domain‐specific principles? To begin with, public discourse in a policy domain is often shaped by a few general ideas. For instance, social welfare issues frequently reflect conflict between egalitarian and individualistic values, while foreign policy debates often center on how aggressive the United States should be in international affairs. Since these ideas are easy to recognize and understand, people can acquire them from the broader political environment with little effort. As Feldman states, “[i]t should not require a high degree of political sophistication for people to absorb the political norms of society when they are so ingrained in the political and social life of the nation” (1988, 418)."
"3","Of course, possession does not guarantee use. There are two explanations as to why sophistication should not moderate the use of domain‐specific principles. First, the information processing demands of doing so are quite low. While most people do not base policy preferences on liberal‐conservative beliefs and know too little about politics to hold crystalized attitudes on most social and political issues (Converse 1964), they do adhere to a limited number of core principles from which such preferences may be readily constructed. That is, people can efficiently and effectively deduce preferences from the beliefs and values they hold. This is how cognitive misers process political information. Second, citizens are more capable of principle‐based reasoning than is typically recognized. People use general beliefs and values to evaluate nonpolitical aspects of their lives (i.e., work, school, faith, and so on), and hence, can readily use these to reason about political issues when the need arises.         "
"4","The sophistication‐interaction theory of public opinion takes a much different view of the nature of mass policy reasoning. Sophistication theories hold that people can connect values and preferences only if they already know a good deal about public affairs. Since many people lack such knowledge to begin with, large segments of the public will be unable to base issue positions on abstract principles. Thus, the sophistication‐interaction approach posits that the highly informed will rely heavily on domain‐specific principles to constrain their issue preferences and that the uninformed cannot ground their attitudes in these principles (Converse 1964; Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Luskin 2002; Zaller 1992).         "
"5","These competing theories of mass policy reasoning are plausible, but both cannot be right. Surprisingly, little direct evidence supports either perspective. First, the seminal works in the domain‐specific tradition demonstrate that general principles influence issue attitudes, but they fail to test whether sophistication moderates these relationships. It is possible that the least sophisticated third of the public fails to absorb these principles from the political environment or is unable to effectively use what they have. Whole sample estimates could easily obscure such heterogeneity. Thus, the claims of the domain‐specific approach are not empirically corroborated in its leading works."
"6","Two more recent studies address whether sophistication conditions the use of domain‐specific principles. To begin with, in his comprehensive study of mass opinion change Zaller (1992) demonstrates that sophistication promotes reliance on partisan and ideological identifications, but there is little direct evidence that sophistication enhances the use of domain‐specific principles. Zaller analyzes opinion change in periods where the NES surveys lack relevant value measures; therefore, he utilizes ideology as a proxy indicator. Since ideology correlates with domain‐specific principles only among the sophisticated, this strategy is invalid for drawing conclusions about whether the unsophisticated use domain‐specific principles (see Goren 2001, 162–63). Goren (2001) tests for sophistication effects using valid measures of domain‐specific principles in three policy domains. This work shows that sophistication promotes reliance on equal opportunity and self‐reliance when citizens render social welfare preferences; does not condition the use of these principles when citizens evaluate affirmative action; and promotes reliance on moral traditionalism, but not equal opportunity, when people think about gay rights. That is, a sophistication effect emerges in three of six tests, a real, if not terribly robust, finding. Furthermore, and contrary to the predictions of sophistication theory, the unsophisticated rely on these principles. Overall, these studies suggest that sophistication matters to some extent, but they do not, and cannot, go very far toward resolving which theory better explains mass policy reasoning.         "
"7","The first problem lies in failing to test the assumption that the survey items measure domain‐specific principles equivalently for citizens at different levels of sophistication. Conceptually, these works assume that the sophisticated and the unsophisticated hold coherently and identically structured principles. Attitude structure research shows that this assumption cannot be taken for granted (Converse 1964; Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996). Empirically, these works assume that measurement equivalence holds. Measurement equivalence exists when the relationships between positions on a psychological orientation and its corresponding indicators are the same in different populations. Conversely, measurement equivalence is absent when the relationships between positions on the latent orientation and the survey items differ across populations, or when one group translates a genuine orientation into meaningful survey responses while another lacks the orientation and responds randomly to the items designed to tap it (Drasgow and Kanfer 1985; Reise, Widaman, and Pugh 1993).         "
"8","The second problem with the extant work is the underlying assumption that the explanatory variables are equally reliable at different levels of sophistication. The ability to draw inferences about coefficient differences across groups from standard regression estimates rests on the assumption that random measurement error contaminates the independent variables to an equally modest degree within each sample. The presence of random measurement error in two or more predictors biases all of the regression coefficients in a statistical model in unknowable ways: the biases can be upward, downward, or even directional (Achen 1983). If the reliabilities of the predictors differ across groups, regression coefficients may be biased differentially within groups. Thus, inferences based on statistical tests of group differences in the magnitudes of coefficients are uncertain. If cross‐group reliability differences exist and an interaction test reveals that a regression coefficient differs significantly across the groups, it is unclear whether this reflects a genuine interaction in the population or an artificial one generated by sample bias differences. Similarly, an insignificant interaction test may indicate a lack of group differences in the population or different levels of within‐sample bias. Since variables tend to be more reliable in more sophisticated samples, structural equation modeling techniques should be employed when testing for sophistication‐interaction effects.         "
"9","To sum up, the question of which theory better explains mass policy reasoning is unsettled. Domain specific works assume that sophistication does not affect the structure and use of core principles. Sophistication works rest on a narrow empirical base, ignore whether sophistication moderates belief structure, and ignore the potentially destructive consequences that cross‐group reliability differences may have on statistical inference. Despite the empirical limits of the domain‐specific work, the argument that everyone holds and uses these principles (see above) is compelling. Therefore, I predict that (H1) domain‐specific principles will be structured equivalently in the minds of sophisticated and unsophisticated citizens, and (H2) the sophisticated and the unsophisticated will rely on these principles to the same degree to deduce their policy preferences.         "
"10","I use structural equation modeling techniques to generate the statistical estimates for two reasons. First, the confirmatory factor analysis component of the general model can be used to test for measurement equivalence. If the factor loadings for the domain‐specific principle items are statistically identical, save for sampling variation, across sophistication‐stratified samples, and the model fit statistics are substantively acceptable within and comparable across the samples, measurement equivalence very likely holds. Second, the structural component of the general model estimates relationships between latent variables after accounting for random measurement error in the observed variables. This takes care of potential problems arising from cross‐group reliability differences in the observed variables.1"
"11","Model fit is assessed as follows. I report the chi‐square test, which tests the null hypothesis that the population covariation matrix for the observed variables equals the population covariance matrix implied by the hypothesized model. Given the limits of this test (see Bollen 1989, 266), I report three additional fit indices that describe how well the model fits the data. These are the χ2/degrees of freedom ratio, in which values of five or less indicate acceptable fit (Wheaton et al. 1977), and the adjusted goodness‐of‐fit index (AGFI) and the comparative fit index (CFI), where values of .90 or higher reflect good fit (Hu and Bentler 1995).         "
"12","The first set of analyses focuses on the issue of social welfare spending using data from the 1984, 1986, and 1990 NES surveys.2 Social welfare spending is one of the most important and enduring issues on the American political agenda, and it has received extensive attention in prior work on domain‐specific reasoning (Feldman 1988; Goren 2001; Kinder and Sanders 1996). The dependent variables are latent attitudes toward government spending on social programs that benefit (1) the needy and (2) the elderly. In 1984 needy programs include “food stamps,”“government jobs for the unemployed,” and “assistance to blacks,” while elderly programs include “Medicare” and “Social Security.”3 The 1986 and 1990 measures of each latent variable are similar.4 Each factor is scaled so higher scores reflect prospending sentiment.            "
"13","Equal opportunity, self‐reliance, and limited government represent the key principles in the social welfare domain (Kinder and Sanders 1996). Equal opportunity reflects the idea that society should ensure that everyone has the same chance to get ahead in life (available all years). Strong egalitarians should favor more spending than weak egalitarians. Self‐reliance is the belief that hard work leads to economic success (available in 1984 and 1986). Limited government indicates whether people favor a weak or strong federal government in domestic affairs (available in 1990). Support for individualistic values should be associated with a preference to cut spending. Party identification and ideology serve as control variables: Democrats and liberals should favor more spending than Republicans and conservatives, respectively. All explanatory variables are scaled so higher values reflect more left‐wing responses; each should positively affect spending preferences. Finally, the models are estimated at three levels of sophistication, which I measure using political knowledge scales (see Appendix A).            "
"14","The first hypothesis maintains that each domain‐specific principle is structured equivalently in the belief systems of citizens at different levels of sophistication. It will be confirmed if the factor loadings for each principle are statistically indistinguishable and the model fit statistics are reasonable and substantively comparable across the groups. To illustrate for 1984, Table 1 shows the loadings for the second and third equal opportunity items are as follows: λlow2= 3.33, λmed2= 2.67, λhigh2= 4.27, and λlow3= 2.53, λmed3= 2.43, λhigh3= 2.05 (λ1 equals 1.00 to scale the factor).5 Are these loadings statistically comparable across the groups? This can be determined using the Lagrange multiplier test, which assesses the statistical effect adding free parameters has on a restricted model. In the restricted model the factor loadings are constrained to be equal across the samples (i.e., λlow2=λmed2=λhigh2 and λlow3=λmed3=λhigh3). The LM test can be interpreted as the approximate increase in the model χ2 that results when all of the equality constraints are freed (degrees of freedom equals the number of constraints). A statistically insignificant LM test indicates that the constraints do not harm model fit, and thus, supports the inference that measurement equivalence holds (Bentler 1995, 126–28, 219–21). In short, an insignificant LM will support the conclusion that equal opportunity is structured the same way and to the same degree in the minds of individuals at different levels of awareness.            "
"15","To return to the data at hand, Table 1 reveals that measurement equivalence holds generally, though not completely, for the domain‐specific principles. First, the LM test for equal opportunity is statistically insignificant (χ24= 6.22, p = .18), which means that model fit is not degraded when the loadings are constrained to be equal across the samples. In contrast, the LM test for self‐reliance is statistically significant (χ26= 19.63, p < .01), which shows that the loadings are not statistically equivalent across the samples (the loadings are somewhat weaker among the high sophistication group versus the medium/low groups). Lastly, model fit is adequate within each sample and differs marginally across the samples. The χ2/degrees of freedom ratios are all around the 5.00 cut point, and the AGFI and the CFI approach or surpass the .90 threshold of good fit. Overall, it appears that beliefs about equal opportunity are structured identically and beliefs about self‐reliance are structured similarly across levels of sophistication.            "
"16","The second hypothesis predicts that people rely on these principles to the same degree to construct their spending preferences. If the domain‐specific hypothesis is right, then the γ1 (equal opportunity) and γ2 (self‐reliance) coefficients should be positive and statistically significant in each group and statistically indistinguishable across the groups. If the sophistication‐interaction model is right, then γ1 and γ2 should be positive and larger in higher groups (γhigh1 > γmed1 > γlow1 and γhigh2 > γmed2 > γlow2), significant in the high group and insignificant in the low group, and the differences in the magnitudes of γi should be statistically significant. LM tests are used to determine if constraining the coefficients to be equal (γlow1=γmed1=γhigh1 and then γlow2=γmed2=γhigh2) leads to a statistically significant increase in the model χ2 (degrees of freedom equals the number of constraints). Insignificant LM tests will support the conclusion that sophistication does not condition the use of these two principles.6"
"17"," Table 2 reports the γ coefficients, robust standard errors, model‐fit statistics, and LM tests for the 1984 needy and elderly spending models. The results clearly support the domain‐specific theory of mass policy reasoning. First, in both sets of models the equal opportunity variable is correctly signed and statistically significant at each level of sophistication, and its effect does not differ significantly across the samples (needy χ22= 0.99, p = .61; elderly χ22= 0.38, p = .83). Strong egalitarians consistently favor more social spending than weak egalitarians. Second, self‐reliance has no effect, surprisingly, on spending attitudes in any sample. Third, party identification influences preferences as predicted in every sample, ideology matters only for the sophisticated in the needy models, and model fit is excellent in each sample. In sum, political sophistication does not seem to moderate policy reasoning about social spending, at least in 1984.            "
"18","For the 1986 data, the measurement model and structural equation estimates are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Table 3 shows that measurement equivalence holds for both equal opportunity and self‐reliance. More specifically, the factor loadings are statistically comparable across the sophistication‐stratified samples (equal opportunity χ24= 4.83, p = .31; self‐reliance χ26= 5.43, p = .49), and the χ2/degrees of freedom ratios and the AGFI and CFI indices reveal that model fit is good within and similar across all three samples. Thus, it appears that the process of translating beliefs about equal opportunity and self‐reliance into survey responses is the same for everyone regardless of how much or little they know about public affairs.            "
"19","Next, the structural equation estimates in Table 4, while somewhat mixed, furnish more support for the domain‐specific theory than for the sophistication‐interaction approach. First, in both the needy and the elderly models the equal opportunity variable is always positive, it is significant in five of the six samples, and its effect does not vary across the samples (needy χ22= 1.83, p = .40; elderly χ22= 0.27, p = .87). Strong egalitarians consistently favor more spending than weak egalitarians. Second, in the needy models the magnitude of the self‐reliance coefficient increases monotonically as a function of sophistication, and it attains significance in the medium and high samples. Among these groups, a weaker commitment to self‐reliance is associated with more support for spending on the needy. These differences, while impressive in substantive terms (γlow2= 0.087 vs.γhigh2= 0.274), are not statistically significant (χ22= 1.50, p = .47). However, in the elderly models self‐reliance once again has no effect on spending preferences. Third, party identification is correctly signed and statistically significant while ideology is insignificant in five of the six samples. Fourth, model fit is quite good across the board. Overall, the equal opportunity results for both issues strongly support the domain‐specific approach, while the self‐reliance effect from the needy models supports sophistication theory (but keep in mind that the differences in γ2 are not statistically significant).            "
"20","For the 1990 data, the confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation estimates appear in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. The first point to note, as Table 5 reveals, is that the LM tests for both principles are statistically insignificant (equal opportunity χ24= 8.03, p = .09; limited government χ24= 3.74, p = .44) and that the hypothesized model fits the sample data very well within and across the groups. In other words, these principles are structured rationally and equivalently in the belief systems of citizens across the awareness spectrum.            "
"21","Does political sophistication strengthen the relationship between these principles and attitudes toward social spending? The results reported in Table 6 are inconclusive. First, in the needy models equal opportunity is positive and significant in each sample, and it manifests a stronger effect in the high group versus the low/medium groups (χ22= 6.37, p = .04). However, in the elderly models equal opportunity is positive and significantly larger in the low/high samples compared to the medium sample (χ22= 6.06, p = .05). Second, in the needy models all citizens rely the same amount on limited government to constrain their spending preferences (χ22= 0.73, p = .70). Those who want strong government favor spending more so than those who want limited government. This effect is not present in the elderly models, as the limited government variable is correctly signed and statistically significant only in the least sophisticated sample. Third, neither party identification nor ideology matter much for policy reasoning about either type of social spending. Fourth, model fit is fine within and comparable across the samples for both issues. In sum, the limited government results from the needy models buttress the domain‐specific theory; the equal opportunity results in the needy models support the sophistication‐interaction theory to some extent (although the significant γ1 in the low sample and the nonmonotonic pattern of results weakens the case); and the equal opportunity effect in the elderly models supports neither theory.            "
"22","Overall, the key findings are as follows. First, the confirmatory factor‐analysis models suggest that all citizens hold genuine and comparably structured beliefs about equal opportunity, self‐reliance, and limited government. Measurement equivalence holds statistically in five of the six tests and substantively in all six. Second, the structural equation models imply that most people use these principles some of the time to guide their preferences on social spending, and that sophistication does not systematically condition these relationships. The domain‐specific theory is supported by the findings that everyone relies on equal opportunity to the same degree in the 1984 and 1986 needy and elderly models, and on limited government in the 1990 needy models. The sophistication‐interaction theory is supported by the findings that the highly aware rely more on self‐reliance in the 1986 needy models and equal opportunity in the 1990 needy models (though there is some countervailing evidence in each case). Simply put, the results support domain‐specific theory five times, sophistication‐interaction theory twice, and neither theory once (the 1990 elderly models).            "
"23","The next set of analyses focuses on foreign policy issues using NES data from the 1988 survey and the 1987 pilot. I select foreign policy as the second domain to analyze because scholars disagree sharply over whether sophistication matters in this area (Hurwitz and Peffley 1987; Zaller 1992). In addition, foreign policy issues are further removed from the lives of citizens than domestic concerns; therefore, this issue area provides a difficult test for domain‐specific theory. The dependent variables in the structural models are attitudes toward (1) defense spending (available both years), (2) aid to the contras (available both years), and (3) building more nuclear weapons (available in 1987). These variables are scaled so higher scores reflect more hawkish responses.            "
"24","The key domain‐specific principles in the foreign policy domain are militarism and anticommunism (Hurwitz and Peffley 1990, 1987). Militarism denotes whether people believe the United States should take a flexible or tough posture in dealing with foreign adversaries. Anticommunism reflects the degree of support for U.S. efforts to contain Soviet and communist influences abroad. Both variables are scaled so higher scores reflect more hawkish responses; hence, they should positively affect the policy preference variables. Party identification serves as a control variable and is scaled so that higher values reflect democratic affinities; it should negatively affect policy preferences. Estimates are generated at three levels of sophistication for 1988 and two for 1987.7"
"25","Do the politically aware and the unaware conceive of militarism and anticommunism in a similar fashion? The 1988 results suggest that, for the most part, they do. Table 7 shows that the LM tests for militarism (χ24= 1.46, p = .83) and anticommunism (χ22= 2.37, p = .31) are statistically insignificant, so we can conclude that measurement equivalence holds formally. Next, the model fit results are substantively similar, with one exception. In the low sample the χ2/degrees of freedom ratio falls below the 5.00 cut‐point for acceptable fit, and the AGFI and CFI values exceed the desired .90 threshold. In the medium and high samples the chi‐square ratios exceed 5.00, but the AGFI and CFI values are reasonable. Overall, the weight of the evidence suggests that foreign policy beliefs are structured similarly across levels of sophistication.            "
"26","Do the aware and the unaware rely on militarism and anticommunism to the same degree to construct their defense spending preferences? The estimates in Table 8 reveal that this is the case. To begin with, the militarism coefficient is positive and significant in each sample and does not differ statistically across the samples (χ22= 3.13, p = .21). Militarists want to spend more on defense than nonmilitarists, regardless of how much or little they know about politics. Second, anticommunism does not manifest the predicted effect in any sample. Third, as expected, Democratic partisanship is inversely related to spending preferences. Fourth, the descriptive fit indices show that model fit is excellent within and differs trivially across the samples. To sum up, the domain‐specific theory outperforms the sophistication‐interaction theory in explaining how citizens reason about defense spending.            "
"27","On the other hand, the sophistication approach does a better job accounting for mass policy reasoning on the issue of contra aid. To start with, the militarism effect increases at each level of sophistication and reaches significance in the medium/high groups. Although the effect does not differ statistically across the samples (χ22= 2.59, p = .27), the differences are impressive in substantive terms (γlow1= 0.086 vs. γhigh1= 0.450). The estimates suggest that militarism is positively associated with support for contra aid among highly and moderately sophisticated citizens and that it is unrelated to attitudes toward contra aid among the unsophisticated. Next, anticommunism again fails to consistently influence foreign policy preferences across the samples, while partisanship behaves as predicted in the two higher samples. Finally, model fit is fine within and across the samples.            "
"28","Shifting attention to the 1987 models, we can see that a comparable pattern of results obtains. First, the confirmatory factor analysis models in Table 9 show that the politically aware and the unaware hold equivalently structured beliefs about militarism and anticommunism. The factor loadings are statistically indistinguishable (militarism χ22= 4.21, p = .12; anticommunism χ21= 0.50, p = .48), and model fit is substantively comparable in these samples. Second, Table 10 shows that for the defense‐spending issue everyone relies equally on militarism (χ21= 0.28, p = .60), and that the sophisticated alone use it to construct preferences on contra aid (γlow1= 0.046, p = .40 vs. γhigh1= 0.444, p < .01; the coefficients do not differ significantly as the LM test shows: χ21= 2.46, p = .12). On the issue of building more nuclear arms sophistication is irrelevant: everyone uses militarism to the same extent (χ21= 0.41, p = 52). Third, anticommunism and party identification have no effect whatsoever. Finally, model fit is uniformly excellent.            "
"29","Overall, the foreign policy results yield some support for both theories, but the evidence comes down more in favor of the domain‐specific approach. First, the four LM tests and model‐fit comparisons indicate that all citizens possess genuine and similarly structured beliefs about militarism and anticommunism. Second, the structural models show that sophistication does not affect how citizens think about defense spending or nuclear arms, but that it seems to matter for contra aid. Consistent with the domain‐specific approach, people rely on militarism to the same degree when deducing attitudes toward defense spending and nuclear arms. On the more arcane issue of aiding the contra rebels, only the sophisticated use militarism, as predicted by the sophistication‐interaction theory (cf. Zaller 1992, 144–47). In short, the results support the domain‐specific theory three times and the sophistication‐interaction theory twice.            "
"30","This article posits that the domain‐specific theory of mass policy reasoning better reflects how citizens think about political issues than the sophistication‐interaction theory that currently dominates the study of public opinion. I have drawn on the works of Feldman (1988) and Hurwitz and Peffley (1987) to argue that everyone can learn the political principles that animate public discourse and rely on these to the same degree to deduce policy preferences, because the information processing demands of doing so are low and because citizens possess more ability to engage in value‐based reasoning than is usually recognized. The findings presented above, which are based on a comprehensive set of analyses of public opinion data that span two policy domains, five issues, five domain‐specific principles, and five NES surveys, support these claims.         "
"31","First, I have demonstrated that all citizens hold sensibly and comparably structured beliefs about equal opportunity, self‐reliance, and limited government in the social welfare domain and militarism and anticommunism in the foreign policy domain. These findings show that the assumption that everyone holds genuine domain‐specific principles is true and thereby corroborate the implicit claims made by Feldman (1988) and Hurwitz and Peffley (1987). While politically unsophisticated segments of the electorate are “innocent of ideology” (Converse 1964), we now know that this is not the case for core beliefs and values. Second, I have shown that the politically sophisticated do not systematically rely more on these principles to constrain their policy preferences than do the unsophisticated. Generally speaking, people rely to the same degree on equal opportunity and limited government to construct attitudes toward social spending and on militarism to guide positions on defense spending and nuclear arms. Thus, with the exception of a hard issue like contra aid, political sophistication does not matter all that much. In the 13 cases of significant principle‐preference links, the results unequivocally support domain‐specific theory eight times (equal opportunity on needy84–86 and on elderly84–86, limited government on needy90, militarism on defense88–87 and on nuclear arms87); partly support sophistication‐interaction theory four times (self‐reliance on needy86, equality on needy90, and militarism on contra aid88–87); and are inconclusive once (equality on elderly90). In addition, the unsophisticated ground their preferences in domain‐specific principles on every issue except aid to the contras.8 Collectively, these findings rehabilitate the domain‐specific theory of mass policy reasoning and suggest that the sophistication‐interaction model does not apply as broadly as the conventional wisdom presumes.         "
"32","This conclusion requires qualification on several fronts. First, the guns and butter issues covered here are among the most important in the American political system, but they do not exhaust the universe of issues. Clearly, more research is needed to see if the patterns observed above hold for issues in domains such as race (i.e., affirmative action, equal treatment), civil liberties (i.e., freedom of speech, freedom of assembly), social policy (i.e., abortion, gay rights), and so on. Second, future research should pursue whether all citizens rely equally on other principles relevant to the social welfare and foreign policy domains. Does sophistication promote the use of humanitarianism when people evaluate the welfare state (Feldman and Steenbergen 2001)? Does sophistication enhance the use of cooperative internationalism when people ponder defense spending (Wittkopf 1990)? Third, the findings reported in this article rest on supporting a null hypothesis, a less than ideal research strategy. An alternative research design could seek to demonstrate that the sophisticated and the unsophisticated can be experimentally induced to ground policy preferences in broader principles to the same extent (see Lavine, Thomsen, and Gonzales 1997 for supporting evidence).         "
"33","What implications do my findings have for evaluating democratic citizenship in the American public? An optimistic reading of the evidence would stress that all people base attitudes toward social spending on broader beliefs about equal opportunity and attitudes toward defense spending and nuclear weapons on beliefs about militarism. Citizens do evaluate critical issues of the day using relevant principles rather than making up positions on the spot and quickly forgetting them (Converse 1964) or haphazardly drawing upon whatever considerations happen to be temporarily accessible in their minds (Zaller 1992). A more pessimistic reading of the evidence would focus on the fact that when constructing preferences people sometimes ignore self‐reliance and limited government in the social welfare arena and entirely shun anticommunism in the foreign policy domain (at least in the late 1980s). Despite the prominence these principles have assumed in American political discourse and the ease with which they could be employed to construct preferences, most people do not use them. One could conclude, quite sensibly, that mass policy reasoning is rather unsophisticated in a general sense (Luskin 2002). By grounding policy preferences in domain‐specific principles the mass public meets a criterion for approximating the standards of meaningful democratic citizenship. It does not exceed this criterion by much.         "
