"1","Can politicians’ electoral incentives mitigate prejudice against underrepresented groups? Despite unprecedented diversity across electorates around the world, office holding remains an elite and exclusive affair. In established democracies and newly democratic nations alike, legislators tend to be members of the dominant racial, religious, and linguistic groups. Legislators are typically male, wealthy, and better educated than the vast majority of their constituents. This pattern not only has important implications for descriptive representation (Pitkin 1967); recent research also stresses its substantive consequences by demonstrating how legislators’ ascriptive characteristics shape their responsiveness to voters (Broockman 2013; Burden 2007; Butler 2014; Butler and Brookman 2011; Carnes 2013; Grose 2011; Kingdon 1981; Schwindt‐Bayer & Mishler 2005). At the same time, elections can create incentives for aspiring legislators to be responsive to underrepresented and marginalized groups, especially when electoral institutions facilitate the political participation of these marginalized classes. In sum, the electoral connection may motivate office‐seeking politicians to be responsive to voters they would otherwise ignore.         "
"2","We provide insights into this question by reporting the results of a pair of field experiments in Brazil. Our two field experiments involved contacting more than 7,000 politicians competing at the state and federal levels immediately before the October 2010 elections, and again about 6 months later. When contacting politicians, we used fictitious aliases and randomized their socioeconomic status, race, and gender (as well as vote intention and past voting behavior) to examine the conditions under which racial and class discrimination reveal themselves during politicians’ pursuit of elected office. We then repeated our experiment 6 months after the elections, which allows us to compare politicians’ responsiveness during election time to their behavior at a time when they are no longer seeking immediate election. As we will argue in greater detail, discrimination (either in favor of or against a particular group of voters) is plausibly strategic in nature before the elections, but not after. To the best of our knowledge, our article is the first to conduct a pair of experiments on the same set of politicians observed in very different electoral contexts, to examine how politicians’ electoral incentives and prejudices jointly affect their responsiveness to voters."
"3","Although we find evidence of class and racial prejudices among most candidates pursuing office, we also find evidence of strategic discrimination among the most privileged and competitive candidates in our sample. We partition our sample of candidates based on their electoral viability and find that while socioeconomically privileged candidates with nonviable candidacies were less responsive to lower‐class and minority voters, those with viable candidacies show no pattern of negative discrimination. What is more striking, these same socioeconomically privileged candidates who were eventually elected to office discriminated against disadvantaged voters after the elections. This pattern suggests that their attentiveness to lower‐class voters during the election campaign is caused by strategic considerations.         "
"4","Next, we review the literature on discrimination in political representation, in particular recent field experimental work. In the subsequent section, we introduce the Brazilian case and our experimental designs. Then we present the empirical results from the October 2010 and March 2011 experiments. We close with a discussion of the implications of our findings for electoral competition, political representation, and Brazilian democracy writ large."
"5","The concept of descriptive representation highlights the importance of elected representatives who reflect their constituents in politically meaningful ways (Pitkin 1967). Contributing to this literature, recent field experimental work examines whether and why politicians are less responsive to voters who are unlike themselves (Broockman 2013; Butler 2014; Butler and Broockman 2011; Carnes and Lupu 2016; McClendon 2016). Butler and Broockman (2011) show that when confronted with requests for assistance, U.S. state legislators are less responsive to outgroup voters than to voters whose race is the same as their own. Broockman (2013) finds that African American state legislators expend more effort to improve the welfare of black voters than white state legislators, irrespective of whether said voters reside in their districts. McClendon (2016) considers responsiveness of South African politicians, suggesting that politicians were more likely to respond to coethnic constituents than to outgroup constituents. Butler (2014) argues that voters’ socioeconomic status may impact representation in ways similar to race. He shows that legislators judge the opinions of constituents with higher socioeconomic status as more informed of the issues, although he finds no evidence that voters’ socioeconomic status directly impacts legislators’ responsiveness. Reviewing this literature, Grose (2014, 366) concludes that “political elites exhibit discrimination and bias when making decisions,” implying that politicians’ behavior in office is shaped by both intrinsic and electoral motivations.         "
"6","While recent experimental work has generated novel and normatively compelling findings, it suffers from several limitations. First, most of the evidence for discrimination in representation has been generated through the study of U.S. politicians. It is unclear the extent to which these findings are generalizable to other institutional contexts, where politicians face different incentives to respond to in‐ and outgroup voters."
"7","Second, while discrimination in representation and responsiveness raises serious normative concerns, empirically demonstrating the existence of intrinsic prejudice is no small task.1 The difficulty is that discriminatory behavior driven by prejudice is often observationally equivalent to strategic discrimination against outgroup members. In their neoclassical treatment of unequal labor market compensation, Becker (1971) and Arrow (1973) characterize wage discrimination as a problem of workers’ ascriptive characteristics affecting their market value, even though these traits are unrelated to worker productivity. They identify two possible explanations for this irregularity: Either prejudices lead employers to favor ingroup workers at the expense of outgroup workers, or the ascriptive characteristics are used as a screening device for some unobservable trait.2 This latter dynamic, which we call strategic discrimination, reflects the behavior of rational actors faced with incomplete information. In the context of elections, perfectly informed election‐seeking politicians would identify with certainty the universe of sympathetic voters and focus their campaign energies accordingly. Yet when faced with uncertainty and imperfect information, they rely on noisy signals such as race to predict likely voter turnout and vote choice.         "
"8","While existing work documents the existence of discrimination in political representation among U.S. politicians, it is harder to draw firm conclusions about whether discrimination is due to prejudice or electoral considerations (cf. Broockman 2013). Our panel study allows us to differentiate between strategic and prejudiced discrimination by observing the responsiveness of the same set of politicians in contexts where electoral incentives are either highly salient (shortly before the elections) or comparatively unimportant (about 6 months following the elections).         "
"9","Brazil is an excellent environment in which to explore questions of discrimination in representation. Brazil is home to the fourth most unequal income distribution in South America and is among the most unequal countries in the world (World Bank 2014). In Brazil, the wealthiest 10% make on average 40 times as much as the poorest 10%, a figure that is all the more striking in light of the size and rapid growth of the Brazilian economy until 2014.3"
"10","Moreover, 400 years of slave trade makes Brazil home to the largest diaspora of people of African descent, with an absolute majority of Brazilians self‐identifying as black or mixed race.4 Along with race, socioeconomic status is the oft‐cited explanation for persistent inequalities, faulting socioeconomic barriers for nonwhites’ exclusion from universities, high‐paying jobs, the health care system, and the public sphere (Hasenberg 2005; Machado de Castro 1993). Though compulsory voting and the introduction of electronic voting have greatly expanded the effective franchise with the aim of augmenting the influence of marginalized groups and low‐income voters (Hidalgo 2012), a cursory glance at the Brazilian representative institutions suggests that they have failed to yield significant advances in terms of descriptive representation.         "
"11","Table 1 compares the distribution of racial and socioeconomic attributes among Brazilian legislators to the national average. Several representational distortions are readily apparent. The vast majority of deputies at both the national and state levels consist of white, upper‐class, college‐educated professionals. Although nonwhite Brazilians comprise nearly 50% of the population, less than 10% of the deputies in the national assembly are nonwhite. The same is true for women. The median income for national deputies is roughly 20 times greater than the median income of the average Brazilian. A large disparity also exists with respect to education: More than 80% of deputies elected to the federal congress have a college education, though roughly 8% of Brazilians hold a college degree. In the second half of Table 1, we report the percentage of deputies and of the national public who spontaneously listed key issues as the country's “most important problem” in representative surveys of the public (LAPOP) and legislative elites (Alcántara 2008; Dufloth et al. 2013). Consistent with the claims of Carnes and Lupu (2014), these figures suggest that the disparity in descriptive representation may have substantive implications for legislative priorities and policymaking.         "
"12","In spite of these objective inequalities, several institutional features of the Brazilian system incentivize responsiveness to potential voters from across the political and socioeconomic spectrum. Voting is compulsory in Brazil for all literate citizens between the ages of 18 and 70, and voluntary for literate 16‐ and 17‐year‐olds, citizens older than 70, and illiterate voters. Average turnout since the transition to democracy (1980–2006) has been around 80%, with voluntary abstention by youth and citizens older than 70 accounting for most of the remaining 20% (Nicolau 2002; Power 2009).         "
"13","Moreover, Hidalgo (2012) reports that the adoption of electronic voting in 1996 expanded the franchise by roughly one‐third, lowering the informational barriers to electoral participation for millions of lower‐class and illiterate voters (cf. Cepaluni and Hidalgo 2016). Whereas race or class might be an informative heuristic for U.S. politicians due to noncompulsory voting and low voter turnout, Brazilian politicians can expect full participation across virtually all sociodemographic groups.         "
"14","More importantly, the electoral and party institutions of the Brazilian system are theorized to strongly incentivize candidate responsiveness (Ames 1995a, 1995b; Baker, Ames, and Rennó 2006; cf. Desposato 2006).5 The Brazilian party system is known for its lack of a clear distinction between left and right parties, oversized and ideologically heterogeneous electoral and governing coalitions, frequent legislative party switching, and weak party identity in the electorate (Ames 2001; Baker et al. 2016).         "
"15","Extreme multipartism combines with open‐list proportional representation to create an electoral environment in which legislative candidates compete against many copartisans as well as many candidates from other parties, and typically face several hundred competitors.6 This implies that not only do candidates lack an ideologically coherent party label to attract like‐minded voters, but also that candidates may only win their legislative seat by beating out many other candidates from their same party. Research shows that the most successful candidates are those who build geographically targeted bases of electoral support, who ride the coattails of executive branch candidates (Ames 1995a, 1995b; Samuels 2000, 2003), or who stand out in an extremely crowded electoral arena, based largely on personal (as opposed to party‐based) appeals (Carey and Shugart 1995; Desposato 2006).7 While candidates pursuing legislative office in the United States might use race or class to target or attract voters who are likely partisan supporters, Brazilian candidates can rarely make a similar claim: Insofar that a voter of a particular race, class, or ethnicity might affiliate with a particular party, this fact confers no natural advantage to one particular candidate over any of her copartisans who are competing for a seat.         "
"16","Though the legacies of classism and racism make Brazil an interesting case in which to study descriptive representation and politicians’ responsiveness, the institutional context in which Brazilian legislators compete for elected office ought to mitigate tendencies toward prejudiced discrimination. The electoral environment is cacaphonous and competitive, and the most successful candidates are those who stand out from the crowd. Faced with fierce intraparty competition, every marginal vote counts to improve one's ranking within the party list, thus incentivizing responsiveness to voters, irrespective of race or socioeconomic class."
"17","Based on the ongoing discussion of class, race, and candidates’ incentives in Brazil, we have the following expectations. We expect politicians of higher socioeconomic status to engage in prejudiced discrimination against lower‐class voters. Lacking information on politicians’ wealth or income, we measure politicians’ socioeconomic status by whether they have completed a college degree. College education is strongly correlated with income and social class: Brazilian youth from the top 20% income bracket are six times as likely to attend college as youth from the bottom quintile, with the socioeconomic elite heavily overrepresented at the most prestigious universities (Azevedo and Salgado 2012).         "
"18","In our sample, 54% of aspiring deputies have college degrees.8 We anticipate that candidates with a college degree will be more likely to discriminate against lower‐class voters.         "
"19","Irrespective of candidate socioeconomic status, it is widely known there is a high cost to being “nonwhite” in Latin America, and Brazil is no exception (Hooker 2005; Patrinos 2000). As such, we expect candidates to engage in prejudiced discrimination against Amerindian voters. Though we lack information about politicians’ race, less than 1% of the Brazilian population is Amerindian, and the number of Amerindian politicians in our sample is negligible.9 In spite of their distinct cultural heritage and the geographic concentration of potential voters, Amerindian ethnicity is rarely evoked as a means of electoral mobilization, which elites could reasonably exploit for their own political gain. For this reason, we anticipate all candidates will be less responsive to Amerindian voters.         "
"20","At the same time, we acknowledge that institutionalized electoral incentives may mitigate the tendencies toward prejudiced discrimination. We explore the effect of electoral incentives in two ways: first, by differentiating between candidates on the basis of their electoral competitiveness, and second, by comparing politicians’ responsiveness both during and after the elections. First, we expect that more competitive politicians will refrain from prejudiced discrimination against either lower‐class or Amerindian voters when they have electoral incentives to do so. We distinguish among candidates based on their electoral viability—the likelihood that a given candidate has a reasonable chance at winning a legislative seat.10 In practice, the vast majority of candidates competing have very little chance of being elected to office, owing to the permissive candidate entry rules, very high district magnitude, and weakened nomination and ballot control exerted by most Brazilian parties. Under open‐list proportional representation, legislative seats are allocated to pre‐electoral coalitions in proportion to the aggregated party vote to all coalitions meeting the district quota, and seats are then allocated based on candidates’ individual vote totals. In practice, only the most popular candidates from sufficiently large parties/coalitions are elected to office, excluding very popular candidates from very small parties, as well as most candidates from larger parties who fail to garner sufficient individual votes.11 We anticipate that those with viable candidacies were those who were sensitive to the institutional incentives that motivate responsiveness in the electoral context, and possible electoral costs of prejudiced discrimination, such that we may observe prejudiced discrimination after the elections, though not before. For nonviable candidates, by contrast, we expect prejudiced discrimination to be evident both before and after the elections.         "
"21","Given these considerations, we expect prejudiced discrimination against Amerindian voters irrespective of candidates’ social status, though this effect should be pronounced among those candidates who are not electorally competitive. We expect prejudiced discrimination against lower‐class voters to be more common among higher‐status politicians than among politicians who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Yet for politicians with viable candidacies, we expect prejudiced discrimination to be prevalent after the elections, though largely absent before them."
"22","Approximately 2 weeks before the elections, we sent more than 7,000 personalized emails to candidates competing in the October 3, 2010, federal or state legislative elections. Besides requesting information about candidates’ platforms, our emails contained randomly assigned signals about the socioeconomic and partisan characteristics of the fictitious senders, allowing us to test whether candidates’ responsiveness was affected by these signals. We then observed whether each candidate sent at least one reply email. In order to better distinguish between prejudiced and strategic discrimination, we repeated our experiment (with some modifications, discussed below) after the elections, in March 2011, when electoral incentives to reply to our emails were largely absent. We now describe our experimental designs in more detail."
"23","We obtained candidate information through Brazil's Superior Electoral Court (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, or TSE), which supervises federal and state elections. Of the more than 22,000 candidates competing in the 2010 state and federal elections, slightly more than half provided valid, unique email addresses. In addition to candidates’ email addresses, first and last names, and ballot names, we know the state and type of election in which each candidate competed, as well as candidates’ gender, age, marital status, level of education, party label, and incumbency status. Following the election, we collected information on each candidate's vote totals. Retaining all politicians pursuing state and federal lower house positions with complete covariate profiles left us with a sample of 7,687 politicians. Unsurprisingly, the lion's share of our sample consists of candidates for the state assemblies (5,214 candidates), with the remaining 32% accounting for aspirants to the national Chamber of Deputies (2,473 candidates).            "
"24","The first design factor varies the social class and race of the fictitious voter. We manipulated social class by exploiting the fact that in Brazil, certain first names, especially names borrowed from American pop culture such as Britney or Chardley (Charles), are generally considered lower‐class names (Barbosa 1984; Laham, Koval, and Alter 2012). Moreover, since descendants of slaves are still among the poorest segments of Brazilian society, lower‐class first names were paired with last names that were historically given to slaves. We created fictitious Amerindian voters by using names that are easily recognizable as native Brazilian.12 Finally, we used names that are common in Brazil without being associated with any specific class or race to simulate constituents whose names offer no clear information about class or race.13 The second design factor varies the gender of the voter, as revealed by his or her first name. We used a total of 24 names, 12 male and 12 female (see Table A2 in the supporting information).14 We used block randomization to improve both efficiency and balance of observed and unobserved covariates across treatment conditions, blocking on party label, incumbency status, the type of election, and state gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.15"
"25","It is important to note from the outset that our experimental treatments cannot decisively disentangle politicians’ class‐based and race‐based prejudiced motivations, owing to the high correlation between race and class in Brazil. Though we keep with standard Brazilian social convention and interpret our effects in terms of class‐based prejudice, it is also likely candidates’ responses were driven by their assumption about our putative voters’ racial profile: Indeed, nearly 60% of our university student test subjects classified our “lower‐class” names as belonging to someone of Afro‐Brazilian descent. Though our Amerindian treatment gives a much clearer signal of ethnicity, Amerindians are more likely to be of lower socioeconomic status that the average nonindigenous Brazilian, a fact our university test subjects also inferred (Brazilian IBGE 2009; Patrinos 2000). As such, we cannot rule out the possibility that candidates’ discriminatory behavior is motivated by racial, as opposed to class‐based, prejudices.            "
"26","Our October 2010 experiment was a full factorial experiment, with 3 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 72 distinct treatment combinations. Each candidate in our sample was sent one email, with no follow‐up in case of nonresponse. All emails contained a question about the candidate's platform with respect to unemployment.16 We chose this question because we assumed that candidates would find it relatively easy to respond to given the high unemployment rates that Brazil had experienced throughout the 2000s.17 The emails also contained randomly assigned signals about the voter's sociodemographic characteristics, vote intentions, and previous voting behavior (see Table 2).18"
"27","Several methodological issues regarding the external and internal validity of our study warrant mention. First, if candidates who reported their email to the TSE are unrepresentative of the universe of Brazilian legislative candidates, our experimental sample may be of limited external validity. We acknowledge the dimensions along which this is true: Candidates reporting their email were more often male, college educated, ideologically liberal, and more commonly from the South or Southeastern regions. Yet, as we show in the supporting information (Table A8), these same covariates were associated with lower than average responsiveness to our email. A second threat to validity would be if either candidates’ social status or electoral viability were highly correlated with candidates’ campaign resources, such that our measures were simply instrumenting for candidates’ ability to hire staff or purchase technologies that would facilitate responsiveness. Again, we show in the supporting information (Table A9) that candidates’ campaign resources are inversely related to responsiveness to our emails. Though these two facts imply we cannot generalize our experimental results to the universe of Brazilian candidates without caveat, we can be confident that our email‐based approach did not inadvertently target only the most responsive or resource‐rich politicians. Third, the email addresses of candidates are readily found on parties’ websites and candidates’ personal websites, and state and national electoral courts also commonly provide lists of candidates and their email addresses.19 As such, it would not be difficult for the average Internet user to obtain the information we employed in this study.            "
"28","As to internal validity, several features of the electoral system and demographic geography lend credibility to our design. First, all of our candidates compete in statewide districts, meaning they can woo voters from anywhere in the state. The average Brazilian state is roughly the size of New Mexico or Poland, with an average population of approximately 7 million people, making it realistic that our putative voters might have resided anywhere within those statewide territorial limits. Second, voting is compulsory and turnout high across the socioeconomic spectrum, such that an email from an average candidate would not confer a meaningful signal about our putative voters’ turnout intention unless the voters’ intended abstention was explicitly stated. Third, the 2010 census revealed that 85% of Brazilians now reside in urban environments, where access to the Internet is much more common (Brazilian IBGE 2010; Brazilian Internet Steering Committee [ICT] 2012). Fourth, the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee, which annually fields an nationally representative household survey on Internet penetration, reported that 48% of Brazilians had accessed the Internet as of 2010, a figure that rose to 51% in 2011 (Brazilian ICT 2012). Though the ownership of a personal computer remains a marker of social privilege, the largest gains in Internet access were among those from the lowest socioeconomic strata, in large part due to the proliferation of Internet cafés and smartphone technology that allows inexpensive access to the Internet (Brazilian ICT 2010, 2012). The engagement of millions of Brazilians in the World Wide Web has quickly transformed electoral campaigning, with email and social media serving as a critical medium through which candidates recruit and mobilize supporters, and through which voters gather information on candidates and elected officials.20 This widespread use of the Internet and email by both candidates and constituents gives us confidence that our emails would not have been seen as atypical or caused our candidates undue alarm.            "
"29","These facts aside, we acknowledge that the very fact that our fictitious voters contacted candidates via email revealed some information about their socioeconomic status, and candidates likely inferred that the voter did not belong to the most disadvantaged or illiterate segments of Brazilian society. In the supporting information (Table A6), we use Bayes’ rule to quantify candidates’ inferences about the likely identity of our email senders, based on the distribution of social classes in Brazil and their relative frequency of Internet access, per the ICT (2012) households survey. This analysis suggests that candidates would have ascribed about a 50/50 chance that our emails from putatively lower‐class voters came from someone at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum: Though Internet usage is less common among the poor, lower‐class Brazilians outnumber the upper class by such a large margin that the posterior probability of having received an email from either group is roughly the same. When we account for subnational variation in the distribution of lower‐class Brazilians, this probability ranges from 72% in the North and Northeast to 52% in the South. Please see the supporting information for additional information and analyses. Though our emails may seem unrealistically correct to have been drafted by a voter with very little formal education, the text of our emails was simple, informal, and short, and could easily have been drafted by a voter with basic education. We decided against incorporating slang or grammatical mistakes, due to the wide regional variation in grammar structure and colloquialisms, though the fact that our putative voter contacted the candidate with a public policy question revealed some interest in public affairs. All told, these limitations would make it harder for our study to detect evidence of class discrimination, which makes our findings all the more striking.            "
"30","In order to better distinguish between prejudiced and strategic discrimination, we repeated our experiment approximately 6 months after the 2010 elections and 2 months after elected candidates had taken office (in March 2011), when incentives to be responsive to voters were muted in comparison to the election campaign. This approach is a distinct advantage of our study, as other recent field experimental research on representation considers either responsiveness before (Butler and Broockman 2011) or after an election (Broockman 2013), but not both.            "
"31","To evaluate the presence of strategic discrimination based on relative candidate competitiveness, we partition our sample based on candidate viability. Here, we classified candidates as “viable” based on their relative rank within the electoral coalition in which they competed. Following the elections, we collected candidates’ individual vote totals from the 2010 elections, allowing us to identify those candidates who were elected to office based on their individual‐level vote totals, as well as the relative ranking of all unelected alternate candidates within each district‐specific electoral coalition.21 We classify a candidate as viable if he or she was elected or was one of the top 10 ranked vote‐getters within his or her electoral coalition.22 With this classification, approximately one‐third of the candidates (2,816) were classified as viable.            "
"32","In the second experiment, we sent another round of emails to the 7,687 elected and unelected politicians from our sample.23 These emails informed politicians that the sender had voted for them back in October and once again asked them about their views on unemployment.24 In this second experiment, the only randomly assigned treatment was the fictitious voter's name, which we used to signal race, class, and gender.25"
"33","We start by presenting the results of the October 2010 experiment, before turning to the results of the March 2011 experiment."
"34","Our outcome of interest is whether a candidate had sent at least one reply email by Election Day.26 Of the 7,687 candidates in our sample, 1,510 (or 19.6%) sent at least one reply.27"
"35","Based on the expectations formulated earlier, we allow treatment effects to vary between viable and nonviable candidates and candidates with and without college degrees, our measure of candidates’ social class. Table 3 reports simulated treatment effect estimates from a probit model containing three‐way interactions between the treatment indicators, an indicator for candidate Viability, and an indicator for College degree.28 The outcome variable takes the value 1 if a candidate sent at least one reply email. The model controls for state dummies, party dummies, intraparty competition, and candidates’ age, marital status, gender, and incumbency (before the 2010 elections).29 Standard errors are shown in parentheses. The third column of Table 3 shows second differences for the impact estimates in columns 1 and 2. The sixth column of Table 3 shows second differences for the impact estimates in columns 4 and 5. Column 7 shows third differences for columns 3 and 6.            "
"36","Several results are noteworthy. First, candidates from privileged socioeconomic backgrounds evinced strong responses to our treatment for both lower‐class and Amerindian voters, but the direction of the effect is conditioned by viability.30 Compared to the “no signal” condition, responsiveness among nonviable candidates coming from a privileged social class is about 5.6 and 7.6 percentage points lower for lower‐class and Amerindian voters, respectively (column 2 of Table 3). To put the magnitude of these estimates into context, we can compare them to the baseline response rate of nonviable candidates with college degrees (26.4%). The treatment effect for lower‐class names, −5.6 percentage points, then translates into a −5.6 ÷ 26.4 ≈ −21% change in responsiveness. For Amerindian names, the change corresponds to a −28.7% decline in responsiveness.            "
"37","Yet the patterns of treatment effect heterogeneity is starkly different among viable candidates. Recall that we hypothesized electoral incentives would mitigate candidates’ prejudiced behaviors. Among viable candidates—those who would go on to either win a legislative seat or be in a reasonable position to do so—candidates from relatively privileged social positions were not only indifferent to racial and class‐based cues, but also appeared to be somewhat more responsive to lower‐class voters (compared to the “no signal” condition), with an estimated difference in effect sizes of about 4.0 percentage points. This represents a roughly 26% increase in responsiveness, taking into account the average response rate for viable, college‐educated candidates (15.8%). Viable candidates from higher social classes appear more responsive to voters from Amerindian descent, though this treatment effect does not approximate conventional levels of statistical significance. Column 7 of Table 3 contrasts the estimated second differences (columns 3 and 6). Both of the estimated third differences are substantively large and the difference for Amerindian treatments is statistically significant, suggesting that social class of the candidate moderates the impact of the class and race treatments in opposite ways for viable and nonviable candidates. In sum, electoral viability, as classified by relative success within their electoral coalition, is correlated with candidates’ responsiveness to voters from different racial or socioeconomic backgrounds.            "
"38","By contrast, nonviable candidates from lower socioeconomic background were generally unaffected by our treatments, responding equally to all voter types, irrespective of race or class. Though we hypothesized that all candidates would discriminate against Amerindian voters, irrespective of candidate social class, we find little evidence of discrimination by candidates of lower socioeconomic status. All statistically discernible discriminatory effects with respect to the Amerindian treatment stemmed from candidates from higher socioeconomic status, a finding that ran counter to our hypotheses but is consistent with the classist dynamics widely thought to exist in Brazil. Finally, we have no systemic evidence that candidates of any type were more or less responsive to voters of different genders.31"
"39","We now turn to the results of our second experiment."
"40","Of the 7,687 politicians in our sample, 1,024 (or 13.3%) sent at least one reply email in the March 2011 experiment. This reply rate is substantially lower than the rate for the October 2010 experiment (p < .001), strongly suggesting that electoral incentives had been an important motivation for candidates to reply to our pre‐election emails.32"
"41","In Table 4, we report the results of our analysis for the second experiment based on the responses from the full pool of former candidates.33 As would be expected, candidates who were not considered viable (defined as being one of the top 10 nominal vote earners in their electoral coalition or party) were generally unresponsive to our requests for information in the post‐electoral period. This came as no surprise, as they lacked both the electoral or representational incentives to respond. For what it is worth, among those former candidates who did reply to our email, we find evidence of discrimination against lower‐class and Amerindian voters by all candidates, irrespective of viability or social class. Among those with viable candidacies, the negative coefficients might suggest these general patterns of discrimination hold, but we lack statistical precision to make a more general claim. This lack of precision is likely due to the fact that among the 2,816 we classified as viable, only a third (n = 874) were eventually elected to office. As such, nearly 70% lacked incentives to respond at all.            "
"42","To account for the possible confounding effects introduced by the inclusion of nonelected candidates, Table 5 reports the results from the second experiment, partitioning the candidates on their eventual election. As before, we allow treatment effects to vary as a function of candidates’ social class, but we now report the treatment effects for only those candidates we identified as viable, partitioned on election. In so doing, we can isolate the effect of our treatments before and after the elections on the subpopulation of candidates of most interest: those candidates who were the most electorally competitive in the election, and those who were eventually elected to office. We control for the same set of covariates as before.            "
"43","Columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 show that in March 2011, when electoral considerations were absent for those viable but nonelected candidates, socially privileged aspiring politicians still discriminated against Amerindian voters. The post‐election treatment effect estimates are of smaller size than the pre‐election treatment effect estimates, and this effect is only statistically different from no signal in the case of the Amerindian treatment. However, given that these former candidates lack incentives to respond at all, it is perhaps unsurprising that they were, on the whole, unresponsive to our fictitious voters, irrespective of class or race.            "
"44","However, a more interesting pattern emerges among those candidates elected to office.34 For socioeconomically privileged representatives, we find evidence of discrimination on the basis of both class and race. College‐educated candidates who were elected to office were about 7.5% less responsive to voters from lower‐class backgrounds as compared to the “no treatment” category, and 6.1 percentage points less responsive to voters of Amerindian descent. Taking into account the baseline response rate among socioeconomically privileged representatives (15.5%), this translates to a 48.4% and 39.4% decline in responsiveness to lower‐class and Amerindian constituents, respectively. Recall that in our first experiment, these two voting constituencies were the object of increased responsiveness when these candidates were pursuing office, a trend that ostensibly reverses absent immediate electoral incentives.35 We acknowledge that these results are best interpreted with caution, as we lack sufficient information to statistically discriminate between subgroups. Nevertheless, the general unresponsiveness by all former candidates and elected officials to putatively lower‐class and Amerindian voters suggests that, absent electoral incentives to respond, classism and racism inform the behavior of the Brazilian political elite.

"45","Few governments constitute a descriptively representative reflection of the national population. On the whole, legislative representatives tend to be wealthier, more educated, and whiter than the average voter or constituent, in spite of the fact that impoverished and disadvantaged voters far outnumber elites in democracies the world over. The persistent underrepresentation of the socioeconomically disadvantaged represents a potent electoral opportunity for populist political entrepreneurs, who ascend to power on the promise to upend structural inequities and to reverse entrenched patterns of exclusion. All too often, these politicians fall short on their campaign commitments, enacting the very same policies they once campaigned against (Johnson & Crisp 2003; Stokes 2001). Recent experimental research identifies one causal mechanism to explain these ostensible changes of heart, highlighting how representatives’ unconscious prejudices might inform their responsiveness, constituent outreach, or broader priorities while in office (Broockman 2013; Butler and Broockman 2011; Carnes and Lupu 2014, 2016).         "
"46","We sought to understand the bias in legislators’ responsiveness in a system that is highly unequal and racially heterogeneous, but whose electoral institutions ought to mitigate politicians’ prejudices in responsiveness. In so doing, we are among the first to experimentally document discrimination in representation among Brazilian politicians, and among the first to study discrimination in voter representation beyond the U.S. case. Our panel study design allows us to test the hypothesis that electoral incentives temper prejudiced discrimination: Discrimination may reflect prejudice—a deeply held antipathy toward certain groups—or may simply be the result of strategic electoral behavior in the face of incomplete information. Our pair of field experiments, conducted on the same set of politicians observed in very different electoral contexts, allows us to differentiate between these very different motivations for discriminatory behavior. To the best of our knowledge, our article is the first to experimentally examine the intricate interplay between politicians’ electoral incentives and prejudices."
"47","We find evidence of prejudiced discrimination among the majority of politicians pursuing legislative office, who discriminate against lower‐class and Amerindian voters both before and after the elections. This effect is pronounced among the most privileged political elites: We found little evidence of discrimination by lower‐class candidates, irrespective of electoral viability. Instead, we found evidence of prejudiced discrimination against lower‐class and Amerindian voters by candidates of relatively high social class."
"48","Even more importantly for Brazilian democracy and the representation of voters from marginalized groups, we find that the most competitive candidates—those who are socioeconomically privileged with a viable chance of winning—appear to shelve their prejudice when seeking office, but discriminate against these same constituents once elected. These results are sobering. Latin America holds the distinction of being one of the most unequal regions of the world, where inequality and systemic poverty are both ubiquitous and persistent. Brazil is the largest Latin American country in terms of population, land mass, and size of the economy, and it is no exception to these general trends. Although democracy is now the norm and recent reforms have expanded the electoral potency of voters from the lowest socioeconomic strata (Hidalgo 2012), our results suggest that increased electoral participation of underprivileged voters has not necessarily translated into increased legislative responsiveness to constituents of lower‐class backgrounds. Instead, it would seem that Brazil's representative institutions remain a largely elite, and possibly elitist, affair.         "
"49","At the same time, we are encouraged that the electoral connection democracy implies— that which induces attentiveness to voters out of electoral necessity—appear to have muted politicians’ prejudices in the pre‐electoral period. This would seem to suggest that the electoral connection is minimally operating as we hope that it would. Our finding that the most privileged and competitive candidates were responsive to lower‐class voters in advance of the election is consistent with strategic behavior, wherein their short‐term electoral ambitions trumped their prejudice against lower‐class and Amerindian voters. Though reforms that extend the effective franchise are an important first step, institutional changes that may reorient legislators’ behavior toward a longer time horizon, or to bring legislators closer to their constituents, may be a critical way forward. Extending the shadow of the electoral connection to induce elite responsiveness may have broad implications for the underrepresentation of the lower class and be a transformative force in Brazilian democracy for many years to come."
