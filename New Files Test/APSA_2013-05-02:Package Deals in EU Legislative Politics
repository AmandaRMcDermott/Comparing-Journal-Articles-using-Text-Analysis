"1","Package deals are fragile informal bargains agreed upon between representatives of the European Parliament (EP) and the Council that allow the linkage of issues and proposals. Usually agreed upon simultaneously through informal negotiations, these compromises serve as binding commitments for the legislative chambers and are passed without amendment. The standard logrolling hypothesis concerns committee decision making, and it is often described as an exchange between three legislators (Buchanan and Tullock 1962; Stratmann 1992). The argument presented here concerns the two EU chambers, which are assumed to participate repeatedly in lawmaking, to commit to and enforce informal intercameral deals. The availability of only two actors partially overcomes the problem of “cycling” (Tullock 1981). The choices made in the present are assumed to influence legislative outcomes in the future. This is why actors may choose to give up their ideal preferences and cooperate (Axelrod 1984). Bargaining in one legislative procedure can be linked to negotiations in another procedure. The formal separation between codecision and consultation matters can be overcome through the packaging of issues and proposals. Factors such as the existence of previous legislation in the area and the opportunity of deciding under different procedural rules influence legislative behavior.         "
"2","One way of concluding a package deal in the EU legislature is through a logroll on a single “omnibus” proposal, which contains multiple issues (Krutz 2001). Alternatively, a package deal can occur through a “multiproposal” logroll where several legislative acts are bundled together (Stratmann 1992). The Parliament and the Council attach different saliencies to the multiple issues involved in legislative acts, but an agreement is only possible if proposals are passed together. Whether interchamber logrolling takes place within or across proposals, package deals require simultaneous agreement. Informal deals are vulnerable if agreed upon sequentially. Even if the bargaining agents commit to enforcing an informal agreement over time, the parent chambers may feel differently in future situations. Intrachamber politics may interfere with the enforcement of informal commitments over time. Therefore, package deals are likely to break if promises are made sequentially or across policy areas (Parisi 2002; Shepsle and Weingast 1994).         "
"3","The EU legislative process starts with intrachamber decision making following a proposal submitted by the Commission. Discussions are held according to the internal procedural rules of each chamber. Any internal conflicts are resolved prior to arriving at a common position. The EP and the Council, through their representatives, enter the interchamber bargaining stage in the search for a compromise. Given the possibility to commit to restrictive rules (Diermeier and Myerson 1999; Gilligan and Krehbiel 1994), the representatives of each chamber are assumed to have the authority and credibility to agree to package deals at the intercameral level. Any commitments undertaken during the informal negotiations are later enforced within each chamber through voting. When negotiating a package deal, the EP can be represented by the committee rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs, committee chairs, as well as political group leaders who can exercise party discipline in plenary. The Council operates a stricter procedure in its nomination of representatives to intercameral negotiations. To start informal contacts with the EP, the Council Presidency requires a mandate from Coreper, and it is obliged to report in writing the results of informal meetings.         "
"4","Legislators face the problem inherent in all informal agreements—their instability (Mueller 1989; Parisi 2002; Shepsle and Weingast 1994; Stratmann 1992). In the EU context, as legislative exchange is only bilateral, informal commitments are much easier to enforce. The problem of nonenforceability between the legislative actors is overcome with the establishment of an institutional structure for political exchange. While the committee system in the U.S. Congress serves as an enforcement mechanism (Weingast and Marshall 1988), trilogues are institutionalized at the EU level in order to capture gains from trade. Their informal nature allows EU legislators to exchange information and reach agreements early. Consensus is sustained through increased communication and through the establishment of a stable cooperative relationship between the legislative branches. The deals struck between the representatives of the Parliament and the Council have to be voted in favor, without amendment, by the members of each institution. This way, the enforcement of logrolls in the EU legislature resembles Baron and Ferejohn's (1989) closed rules where texts are voted up or down as a whole by the legislative chambers.         "
"5","Two key conditions for the use of package deals in the EU can be derived from the logrolling literature: the distributive nature of legislative proposals and their urgency. The majority of the existing theories of logrolling concern exchange in distributive politics and budget legislation (Baron 1991; Haggard and McCubbins 2001; Heller 2001; Weingast 1994). They suggest that evidence of logrolling is most easily found in spending negotiations, where differences are resolved through large intercameral deals. The origins of the package deal in the EU can be traced back to the development of the budgetary procedure and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This is not surprising as the EU budget is negotiated repeatedly, and similar constellations of issues arise over time. Cooperation on deals like these indicates repeated play among legislators. This is not implausible, given that the annual budgetary process must be repeated each year and that the Parliament and the Council communicate through channels other than the formal proposal and amendment processes outlined by the treaties. Therefore, proposals that involve budget‐allocation issues are more likely to be negotiated through logrolls. The distributional aspect of such proposals leads the EP and the Council to use informal methods of negotiation where each institution can bid for the issues it values the most. Furthermore, budget‐allocation proposals have direct consequences for Member States, and the Council has greater incentives to negotiate compromise package deals with Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Therefore,            "
"6","Secondly, timing is crucial in bicameral decision making (Binder 1999), and delay is a prominent factor in legislative bargaining (Alesina and Drazen 1991; Hiroi 2008). Impatient Member States therefore are more likely to cooperate with the EP in return for a fast‐track decision. Timing matters, and the relative impatience of a chamber will have an effect on its influence over policy outcomes. Legislators care not only about their influence on policy outcomes but also about avoiding delays in the decision‐making process. Impatient legislators are also more likely to grant concessions to each other in order to avoid unnecessary delay. Urgent situations induce the use of logrolling, and package deals serve as a practical solution to time pressure. Thus, package deals in the EU are more likely to take place on proposals that require urgent adoption. When time is limited, issues and proposals are more likely to be bundled together so that overall compromise is reached. Package deals will speed up decision making and make it possible for legislative decisions to be fast‐tracked. Therefore,            "
"7","The principal argument is that package deals increase the legislative influence of the European Parliament in distributive policy areas. Through the increasing use of logrolls, the Parliament successfully influences more important and expensive legislation. Contrary to the conventional understanding that the EP's legislative influence is confined within regulatory policies (Judge, Earnshaw, and Cowan 1994), logrolling allows the EP gains in the EU's distributive policies. Governments are assumed to be more concerned about the financial matters of EU legislation. The possibility of controlling the extent to which proposals affect governments’ budgets motivates the Council to engage in legislative trade with the EP. On the other hand, the Parliament, as the “voice of the people,” is assumed to attach higher priorities to issues of human rights, transparency, privacy, and data protection. In exchange for allowing Member States to realize their budgetary preferences, the Parliament gains additional institutional powers. Package deals reduce the ability of individual MEPs to participate fully in intercameral bargaining. They also make the legislative process less transparent, as they are usually agreed upon informally between a select group of representatives. While logrolling might undermine the direct participation of regular MEPs in intercameral negotiations, overall, the Parliament benefits as a legislative institution. Through package deals, the EP gains legislative presence in some of the EU's most expensive policy areas. Therefore,            "
"8","The argument presented here is applied to all EU legislation proposed and adopted in the period 1 May 1999 to 30 April 2007. This includes 1,465 legislative proposals (540 codecision and 925 consultation proposals consisting of 309 directives, 621 regulations, and 535 decisions). The data were collected manually from the publicly available EU databases: the Parliament's Legislative Observatory (including the EP plenary debates and summaries of sittings), the Council's Document Register, and the Commission's Pre‐Lex Legislative Database. The dataset is structured hierarchically across four levels: time, policy areas, proposals, and issues. The complete dataset consists of 2,369 issues i, identified in 1,465 legislative proposals j, found in 19 policy areas k, and eight legislative years l (see the online supporting information for full coding, sources, descriptive statistics, and policy examples). On each piece of legislation, the decision‐making process was traced from the initial Commission proposal, the debates in EP committees and plenary, decision making within the Council, any informal Council‐EP negotiations, the formal positions of each legislative institution, and the final legislative act. While all 1,465 legislative proposals have been used in the analysis of the use of package deals in the EU legislature, the study of the EP's influence on policy outcomes concentrates on those 973 legislative dossiers to which the Parliament proposed amendments. This way the contentious issues can be identified, the different policy positions of the EP and the Council can be extracted, and the terms of any resulting package deals can be determined.         "
"9","If package deals are informal, how could one find evidence of their existence? A key feature of legislative package deals in the EU is that despite their informal character, they have to be officially approved through voting by the chambers. Any informal agreements made between the representatives of the EP and the Council have to go through the formal legislative process without further amendments in order to become law. This feature of EU lawmaking requires that packages are clearly identified within the legislative process so that they can be passed as block votes, subject to no amendments. Each of the legislative institutions keeps records of interchamber negotiations and the progress on them. The working documents of the Council indicate the frequency and scope of informal meetings with the EP where contentious issues are identified, as well as the terms of possible compromises. Around 25% of all EU legislation completed in the period May 1999 to April 2007 was decided through a package deal (Table 1). Of the total 1,465 legislative proposals, 973 proposals were amended by the Parliament, and 244 proposals involved logrolls. Of all package deals, 72% fell under the codecision procedure (176 proposals), and around 28% took place under the consultation procedure (68 proposals). While under consultation, the Council can decide on legislation without having to incorporate the EP's amendments, and the Parliament linked its opinions to proposals in codecision and threatened to block progress on codecision legislation. By linking proposals from the two legislative procedures and requiring their simultaneous decision, the EP negotiated package deals with the Council even under the consultation procedure.         "
"10","It seems that in the European Union, single “omnibus” proposals are less popular than simultaneously agreed upon multiproposal packages. “Omnibus” packaging1 occurred in 32% of the cases only under the codecision procedure (78 package proposals), while evidence of multiple proposal bundling2 was found in 68% of the cases under codecision and consultation (166 proposals). In line with the consensus in the literature that informal promises are likely to break if agreed upon sequentially, multiproposal packages in the EU were agreed upon simultaneously and within the same policy area. The general nonenforceability of informal political bargains limits the deals that can be struck across time or policy area.3"
"11","In line with existing studies that find evidence of logrolling in distributive legislation, a high percentage of package deals in the EU took place in distributive policies such as the Budget, Research, and Energy and Transport. However, interchamber logrolling also occurred in the policy areas of Information Society, Environment, and Health and Consumer Protection. This is in line with the findings of Stratmann (1995) and Evans (2004), who establish empirically that logrolling occurs in different types of policy areas, not just distributive legislation. Package deals in the EU are increasingly voted as block votes and are not open to amendments. Compromise packages can also be presented as a single amendment, which incorporates the complete legislative act. In plenary, MEPs cannot change the content of such package compromises, as a single amendment can be voted either up or down. Similarly, the Council Presidency offers package texts to Member States emphasizing the impossibility of amending preagreed intercameral agreements.         "
"12","Several variables were used to test Hypotheses 1 and 2 on the use of package deals in the EU legislature. The dependent variable is whether a legislative proposal was decided through a package deal (Package Deal). This is a dichotomous measure where 1 equals a package deal on a proposal and 0 a no‐package deal. A proposal was counted as a package deal only if there were written evidence in either the Council's Document Register or the EP's Plenary Debates and Summaries of Sittings of the bundling of issues and proposals in a compromise deal between the EP and the Council. The first hypothesis that package deals are more likely to occur on distributive proposals is tested with the categorical Legislative Cost Type variable. Regulatory proposal equals 1 if the text of a legislative act involves costs to be covered by private actors (and no direct costs for Member States or the EU budget). Distributive (EU budget) proposal equals 2 if the text involves the allocation of EU funding and contains a direct reference to the EU financial framework. Distributive (Member States budgets) proposal equals 3 if the text involves costs to be covered by the Member States’ own budgets. Administrative proposal equals 4 if the text involves no or minor costs. The second hypothesis that package deals are more likely to occur on urgent proposals is tested with two variables. The dichotomous Urgent variable equals 1 if there was a specific deadline for the legislative proposal to come into effect and 0 otherwise. The dichotomous Council Impatience equals 1 if the Council had started discussions and prepared a draft text of the legislation before the EP had done so and 0 if the Parliament had started discussions and prepared a draft text earlier than the Council. This variable was measured by comparing the dates of the first draft texts on a legislative proposal held in the EP and the Council's document registers. As the Council starts discussions on legislation after the Presidency has identified the issue to be of urgency, the variable captures intended urgency rather than random consideration of cases.         "
"13","Several control variables were used to test for propositions derived from the existing literature on logrolling. Two variables account for the intensity of preferences of actors (Stratmann 1995), assuming that package deals are more likely to occur when the EP and the Council attach different preference intensities to proposals.4 The dichotomous Council – EP Salience Tie variable = 1 when the EP and the Council attached equal importance to a proposal and 0 if otherwise. The Absolute Salience Distance variable tests whether the size of the absolute distance between the chambers’ preference intensities increases the likelihood of a package deal. The dichotomous Party Leaders variable controls for the involvement of political group leadership in logrolling. It accounts for the fact that package deals are dependent on the ability of party leaders to ensure the legislature's vote in favor of informal deals (Huber 1996). It equals 1 if in addition to the committee rapporteur, the political group leaders in the EP participated in the writing of the proposal and the informal negotiations with the representatives of the Council, and it equals 0 if the committee rapporteur was solely responsible for negotiations over a proposal. The policy area issue complexity also creates opportunities for logrolling (Enelow 1986; Krutz 2001). To control for this effect, the continuous Policy Area Issue Complexity variable measures the proportion of multi‐issue legislation (proposals containing two or more issues) in a policy area.         "
"14","As the dependent Package Deal variable is dichotomous, simple logistic regressions are used to test for the probability of logrolling in the EU. Three empty multilevel models are estimated to examine whether the variance of the probability of a package deal is due to the contextual effects of policy area and time. Accounting for the effects of the policy area and time levels, Models 4–8 test for the effects of the independent variables discussed above. Table 2 presents the results. The coefficients of the variables, their standard errors, and the odds ratios are reported.         "
"15","To test Hypothesis 3 on the influence of the European Parliament in EU lawmaking, the analysis examines 2,369 issues. Parliament's influence is traced through the issues the EP contested on each legislative proposal, as EP influence may differ across issues and their salience (Thomson et al. 2006). Both the EP and the Council provide summaries of the main issues discussed during the course of the negotiations. Therefore, it is possible to identify the issues the Parliament contests in each proposal and to trace whether the EP's demands on these issues are included in the final text. The issues were classified in four categories: (1) budgetary issues, (2) policy substance issues, (3) fundamental rights issues, and (4) institutional powers issues.         "
"16","The dependent variable EP Success measures the Parliament's ability to see its demands incorporated in the final legislative text. To provide a more nuanced understanding of EP influence, the variable is measured as a dichotomous, ordinal, and categorical outcome. EP Success was coded as a variable with four degrees of success. An issue was allocated to category 3 (high) if the EP's demand was inserted in the legislative text exactly as it was proposed. An issue was allocated to category 2 (average) if the EP's preference was inserted in the final text, but it was modified by the Council and did not satisfy the EP's demand in full. An issue was allocated to category 1 (low) if the EP's demand was modified significantly by the Council, but it was still included in the legislative text. An issue was allocated to category 0 (failure) if the EP's demand was completely ignored by the Council or it simply aimed at correcting spelling or technical improvements. As only 10.1% of all issues fell into categories 1 and 2, the variable was also recoded as a binary measure where 1 = success (including the three degrees of success) and 0 = failure. EP Success was treated as a dichotomous variable in the simple logistic regressions and as an ordinal and categorical variable in the ordinal and multinomial tests. By including the degree of EP success in the analysis, the results provide a clearer picture of the extent to which the Parliament influences EU legislative outcomes. Overall, the EP succeeded in 51.9% of all issues it contested in the period. The average EP success rate in the consultation procedure was 25.9%, whereas it was 65.2% in codecision.         "
"17","To test the key argument that package deals increase the likelihood of EP success in distributive policies, two independent variables and their interaction term are of central importance for the analysis. The individual‐level Package Deal variable, which was the dependent variable in the previous section, is now used as an independent variable. To capture the effect of the policy area on EP success, the macrolevel continuous Distributive Policy Area variable is included. It measures the difference between the percentage of distributive and regulatory proposals in a policy area.5 The EU policies with a relatively higher proportion of distributive legislation were the Budget, Research, and Economic and Financial Affairs, whereas the policy areas with a relatively higher percentage of regulatory proposals were Internal Market, Enterprise, and Industry. Finally, the analysis includes the cross‐level interaction term Package Deal x Distributive Policy Area, which is expected to be statistically significant and positively correlated with EP Success.         "
"18","Several control variables are also included in the models. The dichotomous Codecision variable accounts for the effect of the legislative procedure and equals 1 for codecision proposals and 0 for consultation proposals. The categorical Issue Type variable captures the effect of the different issues of the EP contests and their probability of success and equals 1 for budgetary issues, 2 for policy substance issues, 3 for fundamental rights issues, and 4 for institutional powers issues. The dichotomous Council Impatience accounts for the effect of institutional impatience on policy outcomes. Two variables control for the internal cohesion of the Parliament. The continuous EP Cohesion variable relates to the EP drafting‐committee level. It measures the size of the majority in the EP committee in favor of a report, as a percentage of those voting. The dichotomous EP Plenary Support variable measures cohesion at the plenary level and equals 1 if the EP plenary supports the committee report in its entirety subject to no further amendments and 0 if the EP plenary amends or rejects the committee proposal. Two variables account for the impact of the preference intensities of the chambers on EP success. The Council – EP Salience Tie and the Relative EP Salience variables capture the distance, the size, and the direction of the relative preference intensities. Finally, the Commission Support variable equals 1 if the Commission expresses its support for an EP demand in front of the plenary or in its opinion on the EP position, and it equals 0 if the Commission does not support the EP on a given issue.         "
"19","The 2,369 issues are part of 973 legislative proposals, nested in 19 policy areas and decided over a period of eight years. Individual issues cannot be treated as independent observations, as some issues that are part of the same proposal, policy area, and year may share a similar probability of success. After estimating several empty multilevel models to explore the hierarchical nature of the data, the policy area and the proposal levels appear to have important contextual effects. Therefore, these two levels are included in the models in addition to the independent variables. Models 1–3 are estimated with the individual‐level Package Deal and the macrolevel Distributive Policy Area variables. Models 4–6 include their cross‐level interaction Package Deal x Distributive Policy Area, while accounting for the proposal and policy contexts. Models 7–11 add the control variables outlined above. The standard errors are clustered around the 19 policy areas to capture the conditioning effect of policy type on the probability of EP success. Exactly the same independent variables and interaction terms are used in the binary (Table 3), ordinal (Table 4), and multinomial (Table 5) logit tests. Each of the models reports the coefficients and the standard errors, and the full models present the odds ratios of the independent variables.         "
"20","The results (Table 2, Model 8) confirm that the probability of a package deal in the EU legislature increases when proposals are distributive and urgent. In addition, the probability of package deals increases when the EP‐Council preference intensities vary, the party leaders are involved in the negotiations, and the policy‐area complexity increases. Distributive proposals that allocate EU funding are most likely to go through a logroll as this allows the Council to secure its preferences on budgetary matters and support the EP's preferred issues in exchange. Figure 1 plots the predicted probability of the use of package deals in EU lawmaking, according to the distributive nature of legislation and the complexity of the policy area. The plot illustrates the probability of logrolls according to the costs associated with legislation. EU‐funding legislation is followed by proposals that involve costs covered by Member States’ budgets, regulatory proposals that involve costs to be covered by private actors, and administrative proposals.            "
"21","Effect of Distributive Proposals and Policy Area Issue Complexity on the Probability of Logrolling in the EU"
"22","Note: Predicted probabilities based on Model 8 in Table 2.                        "
"23","In addition, the positive and statistically significant coefficient of the Council Impatience variable indicates that package deals are more likely to take place when time is limited and the Member States are impatient about the adoption of legislation. Overall, the Council started discussions on proposals before the EP had done so in 33% of the cases. Given time pressures, the Council started discussions earlier than the EP only after the Presidency had identified the issue to be of urgency. When there is a tie between the intensity of preferences of the legislative chambers, package deals are less likely to occur. As a result, the probability of a package deal increases when the preference intensities between the Council and the EP differ. The availability of multiple issues in proposals presents greater opportunities for intercameral exchange. This is especially the case when the same constellations of multiple issues reoccur in different legislative proposals.6 Finally, the likelihood of package deals increases with the involvement of party leaders, who ensure that the EP plenary supports the essential elements of the deal. While in 69% of the package deals the rapporteurs were members of either the European People's Party–European Democrats or the Party of European Socialists, in 90% of the cases, the political‐group leaders participated in logrolling alongside the committee rapporteurs.            "
"24","The estimated models (Table 3) confirmed that package deals increase the probability of EP success in EU legislative outcomes. EP success is also conditional on institutional impatience, different preference intensities of the chambers, EP cohesion, and Commission support. The Package Deal x Distributive Policy Area interaction term is significant and positively correlated with EP success. Even when the control variables are added to the model (Models 7–11), the coefficient of the cross‐level interaction remains significant. Contrary to the traditional view of the European Parliament as a relatively weak legislative chamber in distributive policies, through logrolling, the EP manages to influence expensive legislation.            "
"25","Figure 2 plots the predicted probability of EP success according to the use of package deals and the concentration of distributive proposals in policy areas. The plot confirms that the legislative influence of the EP is much greater in regulatory policies. The probability of EP success significantly decreases with the increase in distributive legislation. In the absence of a package deal, EP success is most likely in areas such as Internal Market and Enterprise and Industry and least likely in areas such as the Budget and Economic and Financial Affairs. Although the EP enjoys very little legislative influence in distributive policies, when package deals are negotiated, this is not the case. Package deals ensure a greater than 60% probability of EP success in all EU policy areas. While such deals are fast‐tracked and reduce the ability of ordinary legislators to participate in decision making, the Parliament benefits as an institution from political exchange with the Council.            "
"26","Effect of Package Deals and Distributive Policies on EP Legislative Influence"
"27","Note: Probabilities predicted based on Model 11 in Table 3.                        "
"28","Not surprisingly, the legislative procedure is a defining factor in the probability of EP influence. Codecision allows the Parliament an equal status with the Council, and this translates in the EP significantly influencing codecision acts. Nevertheless, as Figure 3 illustrates, package deals allow the EP to negotiate consultation proposals on “codecision” terms with the Council. Despite the formally limited role of the Parliament in the consultation procedure, the linkage of consultation proposals to codecision acts and treating them as packages allows the EP greater legislative influence.7 Assuming the other variables are at their mean, the probability of EP success when a package deal is negotiated in distributive policies increases from 60% to 82% in codecision and from 25% to 55% in the consultation procedure. Therefore, the use of package deals in the EU legislature increases the likelihood of EP influence regardless of the decision‐making procedure.            "
"29","Effect of Package Deals and Legislative Procedures on EP Legislative Influence"
"30","Note: Probabilities predicted based on Model 11 in Table 3.                        "
"31","The full binary logit models of EP success across all policy areas (Models 10–11) include interaction terms for Package Deals and Issue Types. The Package Deal x Institutional Power Issues interaction is statistically significant and positively correlated with EP success. Therefore, the EP is more likely to gain institutional powers when package deals are negotiated. Member States’ preferences are much more intense about issues such as spending, cofinancing, funding for programs, and community actions than they are about institutional issues such as the EP's ability to monitor and control the establishment of new bodies, parliamentary scrutiny, and accountability.            "
"32","The results of the ordered logit regressions (Table 4) confirm that the presence of package deals increases the probability of EP success in distributive legislation. However, when the degree of EP success is taken into account, the cross‐level interaction term Package Deal x Distributive Policy has a weaker effect.8 This implies that package deals allow the EP to influence legislation much more than it would in the absence of logrolls. However, while package deals allow the EP to insert its preferences in legislation (to achieve outcomes different from 0 = failure), they do not guarantee that these will be accommodated in full (to achieve outcomes in category 3 = high success). While Member States engage in trade with the Parliament in distributive policy areas, the extent of EP influence gained from logrolling is limited. These results are also supported by the multinomial logit regressions (Table 5). The effect of package deals differs between the success categories. As is evident in Model 4, the effect of the cross‐level interaction term Package Deal x Distributive Policy is strongest in the Success 1 category, followed by Success 2, and then Success 3.9 These results indicate that through logrolls, the EP is most likely to influence institutional issues in distributive policies, but these gains are most likely to be limited (within the Success 1 category).            "
"33","In addition, the empirical results identified several significant findings for the EU legislative‐politics literature. Council impatience matters across EU policy areas. The positively correlated Council Impatience variable indicates that the Member States are more likely to grant concessions to the EP in return for a fast‐track decision. When the EP is relatively more impatient about the conclusion of a legislative deal, it is in a weaker bargaining position. The negatively correlated Council – EP Salience Tie indicates that the EP is less likely to influence legislative outcomes when the chambers hold similar intensities of preferences over proposals. EP Cohesion is also a significant predictor of EP success across all policy areas. Although cohesion at the committee level seems to be slightly less important than cohesion at the plenary level, the coefficients of both the EP Cohesion and EP Plenary Support variables suggest that Parliament's influence depends on its institutional unity. Finally, support from the European Commission is also important, as the EP benefits from the Commission's endorsement of EP proposals. The Commission's agenda‐setting and implementation powers give it a strong voice in lawmaking. Member States are more likely to reconsider their positions when the Parliament has the support of the Commission.            "
"34","The main objective of the article was to explore why EU legislators increasingly engage in interchamber package deals and what the effects of these practices are for policy outcomes. The results suggest that the likelihood of using package deals in the EU legislature increases when proposals are distributive and urgent, when the chambers’ preference intensities differ, when the EP party leaders are involved in negotiations, and when the policy area is defined by multi‐issue legislation. The results demonstrate that the Parliament influences legislation beyond regulatory policies and that through logrolling, it gains presence in the EU's distributive policy areas. Without exaggerating the effect of package deals on EU bicameral politics, the article identified that in exchange for supporting Member States’ budgetary preferences, the EP secures greater institutional powers."
"35","The organization of intercameral procedures is crucial to the effectiveness of legislative outcomes under bicameralism. EU legislators find it profitable to cooperate through package deals due to their interdependence, different preference intensities, repeated interactions, and ability to enforce informal commitments. This has important implications for bicameral systems, given that approximately one‐third of the world's legislatures are bicameral (Tsebelis and Money 1997). So long as package deals facilitate the ability of the EU legislature to resolve conflict without sacrificing the quality of legislation, they perform a highly necessary function. Both the EP and the Council gain utility through such cooperation. The EU legislative institutions, like any other organization, function within set deadlines, and logrolling adds flexibility to decision making. Therefore, the move to package lawmaking in the European Union is the result of the natural and successful adaptation of the legislature to its changing political and institutional environments.         "
