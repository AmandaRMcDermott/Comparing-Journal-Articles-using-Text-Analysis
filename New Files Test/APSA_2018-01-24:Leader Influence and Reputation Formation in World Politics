"1","The study of reputation—beliefs about a trait or tendency of an actor, informed by observation of the actor's past behavior (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014, 372)—is one of the foundational topics of modern international relations (IR). Despite a recent resurgence in interest in reputations, a foundational question remains unanswered: Do reputations adhere to leaders to states, or to other actors? As articulated by Jervis (1982, 9), “If one president acts boldly, will other states' leaders draw inferences only about him or will they expect his successors to display similar resolve?…On these points we have neither theoretically grounded expectations nor solid evidence.” If anything, this understates the importance of the question, as it focuses exclusively on the inferences of leaders, whereas the growing literature on audience costs and the constraining role of public opinion has demonstrated the import of citizens' judgments about reputational issues. Moreover, two reviews make clear that this question has yet to be adequately addressed (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014, 385; Huth 1997, 78).         "
"2","The agent specificity of reputations is critical for both the policies of leaders and the utility of our theories in IR. From a policy perspective, such a question addresses the concerns of elites who wonder whether and how much their country's behavior will benefit or harm their country in the future. If reputations adhere mostly to the leader, then the reputational consequences of a leader's actions will dissipate with her removal, dampening the incentives to build or protect reputation since anytime the leader incurs a “bad” reputation (e.g., by backing down in a dispute) the selectorate can replace her and erase the reputation. By contrast, if reputations adhere mostly to the country, then the reputational consequences of a country's actions will echo long after the removal of the leader.         "
"3","How agents—whether leaders or citizens—make inferences about reputation is also critical to a number of theories of IR. Recent debates about how to find evidence of audience costs may be misguided, not just because of strategic selection (Schultz 2001), but also because those theories assume that reputations adhere entirely to leaders. Our results strongly suggest the need to account for situations when reputations stick to the country and the leader differentially. Our puzzle—in effect, how reputations are affected by a “break with the past”—is also critical to resolving the well‐known theoretical puzzle of whether reputations “matter” since it gives scholars insight as to where to look for the effects of reputation, as well as where they are likely to find null results even when reputations do, in fact, matter.         "
"4","A brief survey of diplomatic history suggests that reputational inferences adhere to both leaders and states: Leaders puzzle over how to interpret the actions of new leaders in light of previous leaders, whereas new leaders attempt to manipulate estimates of resolve by emphasizing continuity or change from previous leaders. We find that when the USSR launched a campaign to discredit Stalin following his death, U.S. officials wondered whether the reason was “the hope of Soviet leaders to gain respectability abroad by virtue of a complete break with the past” (Office of the Historian, United States Department of State 1956). A survey of declassified U.S. diplomatic records finds U.S. leaders struggling to estimate the balance between the impact of Stalin's and Khrushchev's forceful personalities and the strong system of Communist party leadership in which they were enmeshed, as well as how those factors shifted over time as the Soviet political system gradually opened up.1"
"5","Reputations may adhere to any kind of agent: a leader, a ruling group, an organization, a clan, an army, a country, a people, institutions, or any other factor that shapes a country's behavior, such as organizational cultures. The vast majority of work on reputations in international relations has focused on what we term country‐specific reputations (CSR): viewing reputations as (approximately) adhering to the country as a whole. Some more recent work (e.g., Guisinger and Smith 2002; McGillivray and Smith 2008; Wolford 2007) has theorized reputation as adhering to individual leaders, what we term leader‐specific reputations (LSR).         "
"6","While previous research has largely divided itself into the opposing CSR and LSR camps, there is both little middle ground and no general theory of when reputations are likely to adhere to any particular entity; that is, when are reputations more likely to be state or leader specific? Additionally, over 30 years after the question was posed by Jervis (1982, 9), we still lack empirical research that provides a systematic evaluation of the agent specificity of reputation. We address these lacuna by introducing a general theory of influence‐specific reputation (ISR), formally deriving testable hypotheses, and examining these hypotheses in an experimental setting.         "
"7","Our theory posits that reputations attach most to those actors most influential in the relevant decision‐making process. Underpinning this is the logic that inferences are most useful when they are accurate and most accurate when they correspond most closely to the decision‐making process in question. In regimes where a single leader exerts dominant control, it would be sensible for observers to draw leader‐specific reputational inferences; in cases where the leader's influence is constrained by institutions or long‐lived groups, country‐specific inferences would be more accurate and useful.2 This analytic distinction extends to issue areas as well; in domains where leaders of democracies tend to be relatively less constrained, such as national security, reputational inferences are likely to be more leader specific than in other domains, such as monetary policy. Our theory is rationalist at heart and makes no assumptions about whose inferences matter. Our predictions are identical for citizens and leaders alike, with the caveat that if elites do, indeed, adhere more closely to rationalist ideals when the stakes are high (Press 2005, 158), the results we find for samples of the general population are apt to be underestimates of their true effect among world leaders.         "
"8","We use two scenario‐based survey experiments to demonstrate the existence of country and leader reputations, as well as tease apart their relative importance. The experiments provide a direct test of our theory by evaluating whether country‐ and leader‐specific reputations vary in importance depending on the decision‐making influence of the leader. The first experiment is an abstract scenario about a conflict between countries A and B, whereas the second study represents a more unusual and difficult test for our theory: a realistic and detailed scenario about a conflict between the United States and Iran, based on a Brookings Institute war game. We find nearly identical results across these two designs and samples."
"9","In both, we find that respondents draw very large reputational inferences. Further, we find evidence of both country‐ and leader‐specific reputations: Respondents draw (large) reputational inferences when the past crisis behavior occurred under a different leader—providing evidence of country‐specific reputation—and those inferences are even stronger when the past behavior occurred under the current leader, providing evidence of leader‐specific reputation. This leader‐specific reputation is about half the size of the country‐specific reputation. Finally, we find that leader‐specific reputation is more important when the leader is more influential in foreign policy, providing evidence of our unifying theory of influence‐specific reputation."
"10","A reputation is a belief based on an actor's past behavior that informs predictions about his or her future behavior. Because observers have varying information and might interpret or weight the same information differently, any actor may hold multiple reputations, though the term usually refers to beliefs about an actor that are common to most observers. Because there are many traits and behaviors about which others can have beliefs, many kinds of reputation are possible (Downs and Jones 2002). These reputational inferences might concern behavioral tendencies—such as for fulfilling one's threats (Sartori 2005), for being reliable allies (Crescenzi et al. 2012), or for retaliation (Solnick 1996)—or traits, such as toughness (Drezner 1999, 77) or honesty in communication (Guisinger and Smith 2002). In some cases, the observers making the inferences are elites (e.g., Mercer 1996), whereas in other cases, they are citizens (e.g., Kertzer, Renshon, and Yarhi‐Milo 2015).         "
"11","By a large margin, the majority of attention of scholars and policy makers has focused, as we do here, on reputations for resolve (Huth 1997; Mercer 1996; Miller 2012; Tang 2005; Wolford 2007). A central proposition of theories of deterrence is that building and maintaining a reputation for resolve can deter adversaries (Powell 1990, chap. 3) and make compellent threats more credible (Schelling 1966).3 There is also a great deal of evidence that policy makers are immensely concerned about their reputations for resolve. In a recent review of reputation in IR, Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth (2014, 381) summarized the literature by noting: “If there is one feature of reputation...on which scholars agree, it is that leaders, policy elites, and national populations are often concerned, even obsessed, with their...reputation.” The roots of that obsession are easy to understand: A reputation for resolve in the eyes of other leaders might deter predation while the same reputation in the eyes of one's citizens might prolong a leader's time in office.         "
"12","Despite the confident theoretical beliefs of IR scholars and the fervent declarations of statesmen, the record for finding evidence of reputational inferences is mixed. Mercer (1996) used attribution theory to argue that reputations only form when dispositional attributions are made. And despite finding “massive evidence” that leaders think reputational inferences are being drawn about them, Snyder and Diesing (1977, 187) found “little evidence that statesmen do infer an opponent's resolve from his behavior in previous cases.” Echoing this, Press (2005) found that while perceptions of interest and power informed assessments of resolve, “past actions” did not (see also Tang 2005). In the literature on audience costs, a prolonged debate has found mixed evidence of leaders' paying at the polls for backing down (see, e.g., Trachtenberg 2012).         "
"13","However, there is a growing sense that—as a result of potential methodological biases—these null findings should not be regarded as dispositive. These biases include (a) that common knowledge and unspoken assumptions are less likely to appear in the historical record (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014, 384–385; Weisiger and Yarhi‐Milo 2015); (b) that past actions operate in part through beliefs about interest (Weisiger and Yarhi‐Milo 2015); and (c) that strategic selection will, in general, lead observed adverse reputational effects to be biased toward zero (Schultz 2001). Our studies contribute by directly evaluating whether observers draw reputational inferences about the resolve of states, and whether these inferences apply more to leaders or to the country.         "
"14","While scholars have debated the degree to which past actions matter, a related puzzle has gone mostly unscrutinized: Do reputations attach to the leader, the state, or some other entity? This is critical, not just because it is a crucial missing component in theories of reputation, but because it has implications for where we look for evidence of reputations in the first place."
"15","What do we know about the agent specificity of reputation? Most IR research—69% by our estimate4—has discussed reputations in the context of what we term country‐specific reputations (prominent examples include Crescenzi, Kathman, and Long 2007; Miller 2012; Sartori 2005; Tomz 2007b; Walter 2006). Country‐specific reputations are informed primarily by the country's past actions and adhere to the country as a whole; they are not impacted by leader turnover or other minor changes in decision‐making structures, and the past behavior of individual decision makers is not of primary relevance.            "
"16","A number of recent works have advanced the idea that reputations might be specific to leaders (for examples, see Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009; Guisinger and Smith 2002; McGillivray and Smith 2008; McGillivray and Stam 2004; Wolford 2007). Leader‐specific reputations are reputations informed by the past actions of the leader and adhere just to the leader. Under this version of reputations, leader turnover should lead to a sudden change in reputational beliefs, updated to correspond to background expectations and specific beliefs about the new leader. Folding theories of leader‐specific reputations into theories of reputation in IR is necessary to integrate the observation that resolve is likely to vary with individual‐level characteristics (Dafoe and Caughey 2016; Kertzer 2015), and it helps make sense of why new leaders are more resolute in their disputes (Dafoe 2012, chap. 5) and are more likely to be “tested” by rivals (Wolford 2007), and why cooperation often resets after leader turnover (McGillivray and Smith 2008). Moreover, there is evidence from other contexts that individuals presented with a decision made by a collective use heuristics to punish actors with the most responsibility for a given decision, implying the existence of individual‐level reputations in laboratory experiments (Duch, Przepiorka, and Stevenson 2015). Publics are also able to make these judgments, punishing leaders responsible for bad war outcomes but sparing those who were not in charge initially (Croco 2011).            "
"17","What are the observable implications of these different kinds of reputation? Leader‐specific reputations will suddenly and dramatically change with leader turnover, whereas country‐specific reputation will be unaffected by leader turnover. Putting these together, we can identify country‐specific reputation by looking in settings where there is leader turnover, and we can identify both country‐ and leader‐specific reputation by looking at settings where there is no leader turnover. Our experimental design does this."
"18","Our theory and analysis build from a simple dichotomy between the leader and the country. Of course, reputations could, in principle, adhere to any kind of agent (e.g., a ruling group, a political party, an organization, a clan, or an army) or institutional characteristic (e.g., a component of a constitution, an organizational culture, an electoral system, or even a religion). We regard our operationalization as a productive first approximation that reflects the main approaches in the IR literature. However, it is worth remembering that “the country” here is actually a bundle of agents, institutions, and temporally correlated factors, each of which could be the target of a reputational inference. Our approach collapses the reputations of all entities that tend not to change with leader turnover into country‐specific reputation. Future research should further theorize and empirically distinguish the many possible bearers of reputation.            "
"19","The logic of our theory is that inferences are most useful when they are most accurate, and most accurate when they correspond most closely to the decision‐making process in question. Leaders and citizens who wish to draw the most useful inferences about others will strive to understand the decision‐making influence of actors and use that information to formulate their inferences about reputations. In regimes where a single leader holds most of the decision‐making power, it would be most sensible for observers to draw leader‐specific reputational inferences; in regimes where the leader's influence is heavily constrained by elites, electoral incentives, a political party, a parliament, or other country‐specific institutions, country‐specific reputational inferences would be relatively more useful. This analytical distinction can also be made conditional on the issue area; for example, reputational inferences about democracies should be more leader specific in domains where democratic leaders are less constrained, such as national security, compared to other domains, such as monetary policy.5"
"20","We formalize our main theoretical predictions using a canonical mathematical model of reputation (summarized here; Appendix B in the supporting information [SI] provides more details). We begin with a two‐period game of sequential move chicken, also known as the chain store game (Kreps and Wilson 1982; Milgrom and Roberts 1982; Selten 1978). The defender can have the usual chicken payoffs, in which case the defender prefers to back down rather than resist a challenge, but most prefers for the other side not to challenge in the first place. Alternatively, the defender can be intrinsically honorable, in which case the defender prefers to resist any challenge rather than back down, but again he or she most prefers for the other side not to challenge in the first place. The literature often refers to our “intrinsically honorable” type as “tough,” “crazy,” or “extreme.” We use the term intrinsically honorable because we believe the concept of honor better represents the logic of resistance to coercion.            "
"21","The central result from this literature (Mailath and Samuelson 2006) is that when agents engage each other multiple times, they are sufficiently patient, and there is some sufficient probability of intrinsically honorable types,6 then some agents will act as if, and thereby develop a reputation for being, intrinsically honorable. Rational observers will draw reputational inferences, and some potential challengers will avoid challenging honorable agents (agents who behave as if they are intrinsically honorable), though they will challenge agents who have revealed themselves to not be honorable.            "
"22","We denote the reputational inference as θ. Formally, θ is the change in the conditional probability that an agent will resist a challenge (will be resolved), depending on whether the agent backed down in the previous round or stood firm:               "
"23","Following the observable implications we outlined above, the country‐specific reputation can be identified by looking at the effect of past actions when there is leader turnover. To the extent that the reputation attaches to the country, observers should draw inferences from past behavior even when there is leadership turnover. We denote the country‐specific effect of past actions, for a given level of leader influence X, as , which is equal to the effect of past actions when there is a different leader (DL): .               "
"24",": Even when there is leader turnover, observers will draw reputational inferences across periods. .                  "
"25","If reputations adhere somewhat to leaders, then the effect of a state's past actions (θ) should be weaker when there is leader turnover, compared to no leader turnover. Formally, for a given level X of leader influence, we would find support for leader‐specific reputation if , where SL denotes that the same leader is in power across periods. If reputation only adheres to leaders, then , so .               "
"26","“: At least when leader influence is high, observers will draw stronger reputational inferences across periods when the leader is the same, compared to when the leader is different. .”                  "
"27","Finally, influence‐specific reputation can be defined as the proposition that leader‐specific reputation will be greater for leaders with high influence (denoted HI), compared to those with low influence (denoted LI): . We summarize these hypotheses about country‐specific reputation (), leader‐specific reputation (), and influence‐specific reputation () in Table 1. These hypotheses follow from the formal model in Appendix B in the SI.               "
"28","“: Leader‐specific reputation will be greater for high values of leader influence. .”                  "
"29","The overwhelming majority of recent work on reputation uses observational data, either in case studies that examine decision makers' deliberations in crises or in large‐N studies that look for the effects of reputations using Correlates of War (COW)/Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID) data. Each approach requires significant trade‐offs, and we see the experimental approach as one part of a larger attempt to triangulate research on reputations using a combination of methods that build upon one another.7 We also note that—contrary to a prevailing perception—even scenario‐based survey experiments can suffer from problems of internal validity similar to the confounding problems that plague observational studies (Dafoe, Zhang, and Caughey 2015). We explain our approach to addressing these issues in Appendix C in the SI.         "
"30","The experiments described below were conducted on samples of subjects drawn from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) labor marketplace, an increasingly popular resource for experimental social science, particularly when the study design does not require a physical presence in the laboratory. Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz (2012, 366) show that MTurk samples are “often more representative of the general population and substantially less expensive to recruit” than the “convenience samples” typically used in political science.8 They also demonstrate the ability to replicate results from nationally representative samples (e.g., Tversky and Kahneman's 1981 classic “Asian disease problem”) using MTurk workers.9 In keeping with “best practices,” we limited participation in the study to MTurk workers who were located in the United States, who had completed 50 or more stands for Human Intelligence Task (HITs), and whose HIT approval rate was greater than 95%; we refielded the survey each morning of the days it was active, giving us several successive “waves.”10"
"31","Study 1 was fielded over the course of 4 days in August 2014. Subjects (N = 1,804) were recruited via MTurk, and the study was administered on the Qualtrics survey platform. This sample was highly educated (49% had at least a 4‐year college degree), was well balanced on gender (41% female), contained far more Republicans (30%) than one would find in a student sample, and had a mean age of 32.11"
"32","Subjects were allowed to participate only once and were paid a base rate of $0.60. We incentivized attention and effort through bonus payments of $0.40, which subjects could earn by answering several “memory check” questions at the end of the study correctly.12 We included these incentives because the empirical literature is very clear that small to moderate incentives can make a large difference in attention and effort (Hertwig and Ortmann 2003).13"
"33","In the introduction to the study, subjects were notified about the memory check and then told that they would be asked to read text describing a scenario about two countries engaged in a territorial dispute (labeled Country A and Country B for purposes of generality). The survey vignette is contained in Appendix E in the SI. In the survey, subjects were randomly assigned to conditions relating to the following:            "
"34","This resulted in a 2 (past actions) × 2 (leadership) × 2 (influence) × 3 (power) fully crossed‐over experimental design, illustrated in Figure 1.         "
"35","After the initial survey vignette, subjects were given a reminder/summary of the salient aspects of the crisis and asked to rate the likelihood that Country A would back down: “What is your best estimate, given the information available, about whether Country A will back down in this dispute?” Answers were scaled from 1 (“Country A is very likely to back down [80% to 100% chance]”) to 5 (“Country A is very unlikely to back down [0% to 20% chance]”), where 5 represented the greatest estimate of A's resolve in the current crisis.         "
"36","After our outcome question, we asked a placebo question focused on the democraticness of the countries in the scenario. In particular, we asked how democratic subjects estimated Country A to be, on a scale ranging from −10 (fully autocratic) to 10 (fully democratic). Finally, subjects were asked four manipulation/memory check questions (one for each of the randomized treatments) to assess their attention level, as well as administered a battery of demographic questions and dispositional/ideology scales.14 Our manipulation and memory check questions confirm that the respondents noticed and remembered our treatments: The overwhelming majority (82%) were able to reproduce all four experimental treatments correctly, and 95% were able to remember at least three out of four treatments correctly.15"
"37","Do reputations based on past behavior exist at all, or are estimates of resolve based entirely on the current balance of capabilities and interests (à la Press 2005)? Our results, both with and without individual‐level controls, show a large, statistically significant effect of Stood Firm: Standing firm in the past increases estimates of A's resolve by 45 percentage points, more than doubling, from 35% to 80%.16 This quantity is θ and represents the difference in subjects' estimates of A's resolve in the Stood Firm and Backed Down conditions.            "
"38","Figure 2 displays the distributions and means (vertical lines) by Stood Firm treatment condition.17 Subjects exposed to our Stood Firm treatment gave far higher estimates of A's resolve in the current crisis, , p < .001. This sizable difference is, if anything, biased downward by ceiling effects, as the distribution under Stood Firm is heavily weighted on the highest category of resolve.            "
"39","The Effect of Past Actions on Reputations for Resolve (θ)"
"40","Treatment conditions: A either backed down in the last 2 disputes (N=906) or stood firm in last two disputes (N = 898).                        "
"41","The balance of power between A and B in the scenario did not affect the development of A's reputation. Whether A was more, less, or equally as powerful as B in the present, A's past behavior significantly impacted subjects' estimates of their resolve in the present.18"
"42","Next, we begin to “unpack” reputations by asking how much of subjects' reputational inferences adhered to (a) the country itself or (b) the country's leader. We first estimate  (from Equation 2 in SI Appendix B), which is the effect of past actions when there is a leadership change. Given the leadership change, any effect of past actions on perceptions of current resolve cannot be attributed to leader‐specific reputation. We find large positive effects of past actions: .19"
"43","Having found support that reputations adhere to countries (or to be precise, do not completely disappear with leader turnover), we turn to evaluating whether some reputation also adheres to the leader. Leader‐specific reputation can be estimated by looking at how the effect of past actions increases when the leader is the same, as compared with when the leader is different (and for an easy test of LSR, we set leader influence to high): .20"
"44","Figure 3 presents our results of leader‐specific reputation. This plot depicts  (the effect of past actions) by Same Leader condition (when High Influence = 1), along with 95% confidence intervals. It is generated by estimating the regression in columns 2a and 2b of Table 3 in SI Appendix I and then using CLARIFY to generate “first differences,” by holding covariates at their mean or median and switching Past Actions from “backed down” to “stood firm” in both leader treatments. The y‐axis represents the increase in subjects' estimates of A's resolve. The first (left) estimate is the effect of past actions under a different leader and is the country‐specific reputation we just analyzed.21 The effect of past actions when Same Leader = 1 is on the right and is estimated to be 51%, a significant increase over the CSR at 28%. The difference between these two quantities is estimated to be a full 23 percentage points on the y‐axis. We thus find strong support for the notion that reputations can adhere to individual leaders as well as to states. In fact, if we make the test harder, by including only conditions in which the leader is described as having “very little” influence over policy, we still find statistically significant evidence in favor of leader‐specific reputations. In effect, reputations adhere to leaders even when there is common knowledge that they had very little influence; far from struggling to gain reputations, leaders cannot escape them.            "
"45","Thus far, we have shown that reputations adhere to both states and to leaders, providing estimates of the extent to which each contributes to observers' overall reputational inferences. We turn now to evaluating our theory of influence‐specific reputation, which provides a parsimonious unifying framework for understanding when leader‐specific and country‐specific reputations will be relatively more or less important. To do so, we extend the previous analysis by considering how the magnitude of leader‐specific reputations changes depending upon the influence the leader is perceived to have. Recall that our theory of influence‐specific reputation predicts that leader‐specific reputation will be greater when the leader has high, rather than low, influence: . Accordingly, Figure 4 compares the effect of LSR for high and low influence.22 Figure 4 shows evidence consistent with our theory of influence‐specific reputation: Leader‐specific reputation increases from 16% under low influence to 24% under high influence, increasing the size of leader‐specific reputation by a striking 50% (or 8 percentage points, ±6%, p < .05).23"
"46","Influence‐Specific Reputations"
"47","Note: Results show (a) the effect of Past Actions on estimates of Iran's resolve; (b) and (c) show the magnitude of the leader‐specific reputation under conditions of low and high leader influence.                        "
"48","Our abstract, scenario‐based survey experiment provided several important results. Countries acquire reputations that persist across leaders, but those same leaders also acquire reputations that are more important when they are influential. All of these reputational inferences are substantively large. However, this study is based on a highly abstract scenario (Country A vs. B) with little context and information. It may be that reputational inferences form in such an informationally impoverished setting, but not in richer, more realistic settings. To address this possibility, we turn now to our second study."
"49","Study 2 presented respondents with a realistic conflict between the United States and Iran.24 Fielding this realistic follow‐up study offers several advantages. First, replicating any study on a new and different sample (subjects from Study 1 were excluded from Study 2) should increase our confidence in the results. Doing so in a study that is conceptually similar but differs on important details does so further since it is correspondingly less likely that the results are being driven by an idiosyncratic feature of our design. In addition, the fact that our same predictions are found in a second study, employing the same conceptual design and analysis strategy, reduces the risk (to the reader) that our predictions were formulated after seeing the results.         "
"50","Second, a rich, realistic scenario provides a harder test for theories of reputation. In the abstract scenario, little information was provided, so it is less surprising if respondents cue off of the information from our treatments. By contrast, the U.S.‐Iran scenario is detailed and realistic, and it should hold fixed respondents' beliefs about other features of the scenario since either the details will be specified or the respondents can call upon their preexisting beliefs about these countries to inform their understanding of the scenario. The results from our placebo test, discussed later, are consistent with this. This greater detail and realism mean that respondents will have firmer beliefs about power, interest, and other factors that influence observers' judgment about resolve in the real world, but that are absent in an abstract scenario. In particular, our realistic scenario provides more opportunity for partisan or other ideological beliefs about a crisis involving Iran (which might be dominant in the real world) to express themselves and overpower the informative effects of past actions. In summary, in addition to offering a replication on a new sample and design, Study 2 should provide a harder test of our hypotheses and yield more realistic, externally valid results."
"51","The scenario itself was inspired by a real war game led by the Brookings Institution (Pollack 2012) involving a scenario in which (a) the United States and Iran are engaged in negotiations focused on the latter's nuclear program; (b) Iran has withdrawn from nuclear talks and blamed the United States for covert activities, including a bombing at a nuclear facility; (c) Iran‐backed terrorists retaliated by setting off a bomb that killed U.S. tourists and nuclear scientists in another country; and (d) the United States has blockaded the Straits of Hormuz.         "
"52","As before, subjects were drawn from an MTurk sample and randomly assigned to conditions relating to past actions, leadership, influence, and power.25 One minor change from Study 1 is that we revised the power conditions to more plausible levels for the U.S.‐Iran dyad; We now assign subjects in Study 2 to conditions in which Iran either has “significantly less” or “slightly inferior” capabilities relative to the United States. The necessity of changing the study, even in this minor way, highlights the difficulty with using more realistic scenarios: Subjects are likely to have strong priors concerning the state of the world, making some manipulations implausible. All treatments were manipulated independently, and the order in which they were displayed to subjects was randomized.26"
"53","In Study 1, standing firm in the past increased estimates of A's resolve by 45 percentage points (from 35% to 80%). Here, in the context of a real conflict between the United States and Iran, our Past Actions treatment increased respondents' beliefs that Iran would stand firm by 34 percentage points (from 32% to 66%; see top panel of Figure 5). As before, this was statistically significant with or without demographic controls.27"
"54","Iran Scenario Results"
"55","Note: Results show (a) the effect of Past Actions on estimates of Iran's resolve and (b) leader‐ and country‐specific reputations for Iran. Panels (c) and (d) show the magnitude of the leader‐specific reputation under conditions of low and high influence.                        "
"56","In Study 1, the country‐specific reputation—the effect of standing firm (θ) when the leader was different—was positive and statistically significant, indicating that reputations can and do accrue to countries (as distinct from leaders). There, we estimated past resolute behavior to increase estimates of resolve by 35% when the leader was different. In Study 2, our estimate of the CSR was nearly identical: The effect of standing firm when there was leadership turnover was an increase in perceptions of resolve of 38%."
"57","In Study 1, we also found evidence for leader‐specific reputation, which is defined as the difference between θ when the leader is the same versus when it is different. In Study 2, we again found strong evidence for LSR, depicted in the bottom right panel of Figure 5 where Leader Influence is set to high. The effect of past actions is estimated to be 10% greater when there is no leader turnover, providing evidence of leader‐specific reputation.28"
"58","Lastly, we evaluate our unifying theory of influence‐specific reputation. Our theory of influence‐specific reputation states that LSR will be larger when the leader has greater influence over the policy in question than when he or she does not: . Again, we find strong support for our theory of influence‐specific reputation in Study 2, which reveals that changing leader influence more than doubles the effect of leader‐specific reputation (an increase of 6 percentage points, from 5% to 11%, p < .05).            "
"59","We consider here several possible issues in the interpretation of our results: Could our simplified scenarios pose a threat to external validity (for a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Appendix A.1 in the SI)? Might our experiments present the causal factor of interest (the treatment) in an implausibly salient manner, thus leading us to overestimate the effect? Or could it be that our experiment presented the treatment in an overly abstract and digested format, or in a manner that permitted the respondent to guess about our purpose, thus potentially cueing the respondent to draw the reputational inference that we sought?"
"60","Such concerns about the mapping between experimental effects and real‐world effects are important, but despite these concerns we believe that our results remain informative. First, given the difficulty of causal inference in IR, scholars should be primarily concerned with estimating the existence and sign of effects, rather than their magnitude. Concerns about overestimating the size of our effect are thus far less pressing than the question of whether we have identified an effect in the first place, given the state of our collective knowledge. Second, there are other reasons (low stakes, an inattentive and nonexpert audience) for believing that our estimates are actually smaller than their real‐world counterparts. Third, our U.S.‐Iran scenario was included precisely to add crucial realism; strikingly, we found similar results even though the treatment text was a small portion of the vignette (e.g., the influence treatment involved a mere 5% of the words in the vignette). Finally, it is implausible that respondents would have inferred the ISR theory that we were studying in both scenarios given that ISR involves second‐order interactions and the U.S.‐Iran scenario was richly detailed.            "
"61","Future research should try to pin down plausible estimates of the magnitude of real‐world effects, perhaps by designing more realistic and subtle ways of communicating the influence of the foreign decision maker. Similarly, we should keep in mind a crucial scope condition: Our theory only predicts that reputations should be influence specific in domains where the observers can perceive the level of influence of the decision maker with sufficient precision. Nevertheless, we are able to learn much from reliably estimating the sign and existence of an effect, as we have done here."
"62","We consider here questions concerning how our sample influences the inferences that we can draw. Specifically, (a) does our sample of the public allow us to make plausible inferences about elites? (b) Is our ISR theory, which is based on rationalist observers, plausible for members of the general public? For more detailed discussion, see Appendix A.2 in the SI."
"63","Do our findings generalize to elites? While an ideal study would have also surveyed the perception of elites and leaders, such samples are extremely costly; large‐N samples of actual leaders are nearly impossible to acquire. For this reason, research programs should not begin on elite samples, but rather progress to them over time and after replications have corroborated preliminary findings (McDermott 2002).            "
"64","The primary issue here is the extent to which the causal processes that generate the effect are likely to vary across populations, and if so, in what ways. Several recent studies that have examined differences between elites and the general population have found little to distinguish them (for references, see A.2 in the SI), providing evidence that at least some causal processes do not vary much across these populations. The key difference we envision is that elite observers should be more rational in their assessments compared to the public; they are more informed, have been selected for and highly trained in rational reasoning, and are closer to cultures that encourage rational assessment of foreign policy threats relative to members of the public. These differences suggest that the public should be less likely to exhibit the subtle rationality of our ISR predictions and that any effects we see are likely attenuated relative to the effects that would arise with an elite sample."
"65","Is it reasonable to expect the public to draw rational inferences? There is certainly abundant evidence of members of the public exhibiting deviations from rationality and having only limited information about foreign affairs. However, in many domains, humans also appear to learn in an approximately rational way (Holyoak and Cheng 2010) given their bounded information. In particular, inferences about the resolve of individuals and groups are something that is valuable in our daily lives and were valuable in our ancestral environment. Thus, it is plausible that society and evolution have endowed us with faculties sufficiently effective at drawing reasonable inferences about reputation in intergroup conflict. Future work should examine how imperfect information, or particular heuristics and biases, could lead to deviations from ISR.            "
"66","Despite the prominence of reputations in IR research, one important question has yet to be addressed: whether reputations adhere to leaders, states, or other entities. We innovated by offering a unifying theory of influence‐specific reputation that explains when reputations are most likely to adhere to a specific entity. Our theory also makes systematic predictions about how the agent specificity of reputation will vary by regime type, policy domain, and any other feature of the country or dispute. This theory was based on the simple premise that observers are approximately rational and thus draw reputational inferences that are most useful to them, using their knowledge about decision‐making influence. These predictions, as well as the core concepts of CSR, LSR, and ISR, were shown to emerge from a mathematical model of reputation."
"67","Because of the severe inferential difficulties associated with observational data, we designed two scenario‐based survey experiments to tease apart the agent specificity of reputations. In the first scenario, we manipulated the past actions of A (whether they “stood firm” in past disputes), whether a leadership turnover had occurred, and the level of the leader's influence over policy, along with the power differential in the current dispute. We then asked subjects to estimate A's resolve in the current crisis. The second study was similar in structure, but centered on a detail‐rich and realistic scenario of a conflict between the United States and Iran. Across both studies, we found evidence that reputations develop based on past resolved behavior, and that reputations adhere to both states and leaders. We also found support for our theory of influence‐specific reputations: Leader‐specific reputations were stronger when the leader was more influential in foreign policy."
"68","One issue that could be explored in the future is the correlation in preferences across leaders; in systems where leaders are more like each other in their preferences, rational reputational inferences should increasingly adhere to that common unobserved factor of leader preferences and thus look like CSR. At the limit, if leader preferences are close to perfectly correlated, then LSR should become small or even vanish.29 Future work could also investigate the extent to which these results generalize to other populations, such as elites or the public in other countries. We expect that elites would exhibit even stronger ISR effects, given that their beliefs and reasoning processes are likely closer to rational; however, there are other possibilities, such as if elite knowledge crowds out reputational inferences or if elites believe that crises are less correlated in their preference structure across time than the public does. Future work could also investigate publics from other countries, which may have different beliefs about reputation or decision‐making influence, as would arise if publics erroneously attributed to other countries similar domestic political processes as their own.         "
"69","Our findings regarding the presence and complexity of reputational inferences offer important contributions to at least three larger scholarly literatures. First, our results shed light on the debate within deterrence theory on the role of reputations in assessments of credibility. Our experimental findings on the presence and substantively large size of both country‐ and leader‐specific reputations provide new and compelling evidence in support of the position that reputational inferences are likely to be central factors shaping the credibility of deterrent threats. And by providing microlevel evidence of reputational inferences being drawn by individuals in a variety of situations, our findings complement recent large‐N statistical studies (e.g., Weisiger and Yarhi‐Milo 2015) that find empirical patterns consistent with reputations forming on the basis of past behavior. Our theory also provides an explanation for some patterns in IR. Three studies providing evidence of leader‐specific reputation (Dafoe 2012, chap. 5; McGillivray and Smith 2004; McGillivray and Stam 2004) found that the results were stronger for countries with more authoritarian governments. These findings are consistent with our theory of ISR.         "
"70","Finally, our theory and findings regarding leader‐ and influence‐specific reputations point toward the utility of a focus on individual leaders as central units of analysis. More broadly, they are suggestive of a need for scholars to think about and pursue more contingent theories of deterrence and international conflict in which different levels of analysis are called for depending upon how much control high‐level decision makers exert over security decisions. While we focus on reputations for specific leaders, we can extend the underlying logic to argue that when decision makers exert strong control over policy choices, we must place that individual at the center of theory‐building efforts. We would expect other actors to not only draw reputational inferences about that leader but to also be sensitive to his or her other traits or characteristics. This does not inherently require a psychological/cognitive approach, but it does suggest that this central decision maker becomes the theoretical focal point around which the larger strategic environment should be situated."
