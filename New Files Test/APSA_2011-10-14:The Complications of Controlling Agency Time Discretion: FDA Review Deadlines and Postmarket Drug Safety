"1","For decades, scholarship has built on the insight that elected officials exercise control over government agencies through procedures that constrain agency discretion and incentivize agencies to craft policies beneficial to politically privileged interests (McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1989, 444). Classic examples include “making an agency rely on private interests for information, imposing tight deadlines … making certain types of decisions difficult to promulgate” and preventing agencies from collecting “information about the consequences of the policy decisions” (Bawn 1995, 63; McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987, 1989; Moe 1985). Among these forms of prospective political control, deadlines represent “the most powerful, and arguably the most predictable, indirect mechanism of accountability at the disposal of Congress” (Kerwin 2003, 215–16).6"
"2","Deadlines share common features with other prospective procedural controls. Like other procedures, deadlines may shape the flow of information in and out of agencies in ways that bear on ultimate policy outcomes (Abbott 1987). Structuring the flow of information may constrain an agency's ability to apply its expertise and make bureaucrats responsive to certain interest groups (Balla and Wright 2001; McCubbins, Noll and Weingast 1987, 675). Deadlines may also impose penalties for failure while varying in their restrictiveness.         "
"3","Deadlines differ from other tools of control in that they target a source of agency leeway—discretion on the time domain—for which other political control tools may be poorly equipped. A deadline can be shorter or longer; it can demand a decision or the completion of a task in three days or three years. The length of a deadline—the amount of elapsed time that it permits before the assignment of a penalty associated with being “late” or having “missed” the deadline—is associated with the discretion that it allows. From an organizational perspective, longer deadlines translate into greater agency discretion, as agency policy makers can engage in additional task search activities (e.g., information search, application of new or different technologies or heuristics to the task or decision). The longer time horizons embedded in longer deadlines may also protect slack resources from being inefficiently utilized when the agency is required to hurry to complete a large number of tasks in a short period of time. These slack resources may reduce the risk of committing decision errors (theoretically, for both the Type I and Type II varieties) attributable to politically induced time constraints on task performance."
"4","Deadlines are widely prevalent in political and administrative settings. Statutory deadlines appear for a range of policy domains, ranging from environmental regulation (Morgenstern 1993) to traffic safety (Mashaw and Harfst 1990, 69–83). The 1988 amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, for example, required the Environmental Protection Agency to reregister 700 substances within a period of 10 years (Morgenstern 1993, 245).7 In the field of pharmaceutical regulation, the FDA faces six‐month deadlines for the review of therapeutically vital “priority” drugs and (since 1997) 10 months for most other drug reviews. Other health regulators worldwide, including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA), have adopted similar regulatory review deadlines.8 Moreover, a wide variety of administrative decisions are characterized by timing phenomena, including licensing (Kosnik 2006) and rulemaking (Kerwin 2003).         "
"5","Scholarship has had less to say about how deadlines may impair the quality of agency decisions, potentially at the expense of the interests that political control intended to benefit. Some surveys suggest bureaucrats consider deadlines a weak form of congressional oversight (Furlong 1998). Other studies report concern that deadlines limit bureaucrats’ abilities to apply their expertise to policy decisions (HHS OIG 2003). With the exception of Gersen and O’Connell's (2008) hypotheses on the benefits and risks of congressionally imposed deadlines on agency behavior, we are unaware of any literature that tests how deadlines influence policy outcomes, or that empirically demonstrates when deadlines benefit intended constituents, as extant theory expects.9"
"6","Institutions based on deadlines shape agency behavior by attaching direct and indirect costs to agency decision making. The most direct form of deadline institution imposes a penalty (explicit or implicit) when a decision or administrative process runs beyond a specified point in time (the “deadline”). Where the deadline is absolute, this penalty may be conceived as “infinite” or large enough to outweigh all other factors in the regulator's decision, including factors ranging from the agency's possible risk aversion to the agency's reputation for decision quality and safety. In other cases, the deadline penalty may be smaller and one of plural factors to influence the timing of regulatory behavior."
"7","Depending on those penalties, deadlines can affix costs to collecting and distributing information in the process of agency decision making, potentially affecting regulatory choice in at least two ways. They can influence the duration of decisions by preventing regulatory processes from elapsing beyond a certain time (the “timing effect”), and they can influence the quality of resulting decisions.10 By quality we mean both procedural quality (how well due diligence was exercised) and outcome quality (whether actual errors or harms resulted). This article empirically focuses on the latter, but also offers some suggestive evidence on the former. Deadlines may bear on outcome quality by limiting the time and resources a decision maker can apply to a policy decision. Of course, they cap the time that an agency has available to collect information and deliberate. In the process, deadlines may impair the amount of expertise an agency can mobilize or apply to a policy problem. Deadlines may also truncate agencies’ efforts to communicate with external stakeholders and those implementing the agencies’ decision. As implementers outside of the agency respond to this truncated communication, outcome quality changes in response.         "
"8","Agencies face a dilemma balancing the costs of deadline violations against the information constraints, in part because different errors are differentially observable, and short‐run considerations may conflict with long‐run considerations. Consider the possibility of a legislative deadline penalty that conditions agencies’ future resource streams on meeting those deadlines. Deadlines, thus, may pit an agency's interest in using its expertise to produce accurate, valid decisions—and in protecting its long‐run reputation for reliable expertise—against its interest in sufficient staff and funding and its short‐run reputation for prompt action. Resource cuts are a certain, measurable, and quickly enforced punishment for agency failure to meet a deadline. And the failure to meet a deadline itself is easily observed. In contrast, the reputational and power costs resulting from lower‐quality agency decisions are uncertain, are poorly measured, and develop only over the long run, if at all."
"9","Terms and Hypotheses. We use two novel terms in our analysis of deadlines’ policy effects. A deadline regime is a policy that imposes decision time goals or rules upon an agency, with penalties for failing to meet the deadlines. It refers to years governed by a given piece of legislation. In contrast, deadline time[tdead] refers to the elapsed decision time after which the decision is regarded as late in a given regime. For a 90‐day deadline, the deadline time is the 90th day; for a nine‐month deadline, the deadline time is the end of the ninth month.         "
"10","In the presence of substantive penalties, we expect deadlines to alter both the timing and quality of agency decisions. Specifically, we expect that the introduction of a deadline regime will yield a greater likelihood of decision at the deadline time, tdead, relative to:         "
"11","            "
"12","the predeadline time interval (time intervals before the deadline; tdead− 1, tdead− 2, and so on).                  "
"13","the postdeadline time interval (immediately following the deadline; tdead+ 1, tdead+ 2, and so on).                  "
"14","the preregime deadline time (the deadline time intervals [tdead], but before a deadline regime was in place, or before there was a penalty associated with a decision after tdead).                  "
"15","Moreover, we expect the shift in the distribution of decisions will yield changes in outcomes. Specifically, we expect approvals that are completed at or just before a deadline to coincide with higher rates of revisitation (the agency correcting possible mistakes), error, and harm.11"
"16","The FDA deadline regimes offer an exemplary venue for testing our predictions and for laying the foundation for systematic understanding of deadline effects across government agencies and for ascertaining whether, in the process, deadline regimes benefit the intended interests. Unlike other policy domains where Congress may “hide its intentions” (Kerwin 2003, 214), the intended beneficiaries of FDA deadlines were clear: disease sufferers (especially the politically organized; Carpenter 2002) and pharmaceutical firms (Hilts 2003, chaps. 16–18). Moreover, unlike other policy domains, drug approval provides reliable measures of decision quality. First, the FDA case offers important variation on our primary explanatory variable: deadlines. In the two decades before Congress passed the first FDA deadline regime, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992 (which was subsequently reauthorized in 1997, 2002, and 2007), the FDA faced no time constraints on new drug application reviews.12 Intended to speed drug approval times, PDUFA represented a bargain struck between the FDA, Congress, and interest groups: user fees associated with PDUFA would augment FDA staffing resources while the pharmaceutical industry and concerned disease advocates would, in principle, receive quicker approvals and quicker access to new therapies.13 The deadline regime that PDUFA introduced is called a “review clock”: upon a New Molecular Entity's (NME) initial submission date, a countdown timer begins ticking. The time on the clock (6 months, 10 months, or 12 months) differed according to whether the new drug application was designated “priority” or “standard.”14"
"17","Among the features of the user‐fee program relevant to FDA's approval behavior is the absoluteness of the review‐clock deadline. Once the deadline has elapsed, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has far less incentive to hurry a drug, as it no longer can count towards annual review‐time goals. The provision that nine of ten drugs must be reviewed by the deadlines means that the PDUFA clock uniformly governs most all of FDA's drug review behavior.15 By imposing specific deadlines and linking agency compliance to the agency revenue source—the penalty for not meeting the deadline was not simply embarrassment and congressional pressure, but also the possibility that tens of millions of dollars in user fees would no longer be available for personnel costs—PDUFA represented a significant effort to influence FDA actions.         "
"18","Applying our predictions to the FDA case, we expect that the deadline regime (PDUFA) will impose a meaningful constraint on drug review, prompting FDA to rush approvals in the months just before the deadline. Specifically, we expect the hazard of drug approval to be higher at tdead than in the months before tdead or the months after tdead. Consider the 12‐month review clock for standard drugs, and suppose we focus attention on the agency's incentives to approve a drug in the next two months, however long the review has lasted to date. When the eleventh month of the review cycle starts, the incentives for completing NDA review in the next two months are high since near‐term completion will allow the agency to meet the review clock for this drug. However, if the agency fails to meet the review‐time goal, there should be less incentive to approve the drug in months 13 or 14. Hence we should observe a high proportion of approvals concentrated or “piled up” in the months just before the deadline, and relatively few concentrated just after. The same logic should obtain regardless of the review clock length.         "
"19","Moreover, we expect that drug approval decisions occurring just before the deadline time will be associated with safety problems in the postmarket period. Specifically, we hypothesize that drugs approved in the two‐month window just before the deadline will express more markers of rushed decisions in the form of postmarket regulatory corrections and changes.16 While most drugs undergo some degree of regulatory modification in the postmarket period as they are prescribed to new patient groups, postmarketing regulatory events (PMREs) are a reliable measure of postmarket safety problems that might have been addressed at the drug‐evaluation stage. PMREs include black‐box (i.e., safety label) warnings, firm‐ and FDA‐issued safety alerts, safety‐based withdrawals, and market discontinuations of a (molecular) drug form.         "
"20","To test our first set of hypotheses, that deadlines impose constraints by altering the timing of agency decisions such that the hazard of drug approval increases in the month the deadline elapses, we retrieve estimates of the conditional probability of approval at each point of the regulatory review cycle. At each month of the review cycle, what is the relative hazard rate of approval in the month, given that the drug has not yet been approved?17 We conduct likelihood‐based hazard analyses of review times and retrieve month‐specific hazard estimates that allow us to follow the pace of approvals during the FDA review cycle (Therneau and Gramsch 2000). To minimize dependence upon parametric statistical assumptions, we employ Cox proportional hazard models with time‐varying covariates, including indicators for each month on the FDA review clock. Each model controls for staffing levels in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and includes indicators for the 50 largest firms. We estimate separate models for priority and standard drugs18 and use the Efron method for handling ties.19 (We reserve formal elaboration of our statistical models for the online appendix.) These models are applied to our sample consisting of New Molecular Entities (NMEs) approved between 1950 and 2008, for a total of 1,034 drugs.            "
"21","We hypothesized that deadlines induce drug approval “piling” in the months just before a deadline. We expected to find higher hazards in the month leading up to drug review deadlines. For standard drugs, the original PDUFA deadline was 12 months, changed to a 10‐month deadline after 1997 under the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA). The post‐PDUFA deadline for priority drugs is six months."
"22","Our analyses suggest that deadlines have altered the timing of FDA decisions. Table 1 displays the hazard ratios for priority drugs submitted before and after the adoption of the six‐month deadline regime. (These ratios are relative to the baseline condition when all covariates and indicators are set to zero. The baseline hazard encompasses all months for which month‐regime dummies were not included.) For priority drugs submitted after the introduction of six‐month PDUFA deadlines, we observe a sizable increase in approval hazards in the sixth month of the review: an eightfold increase in the hazard over the fourth month (= 11.88; p = 0.0006). The hazard ratio drops nearly twelvefold in the eighth month, after the deadline has passed (= 13.18; p = 0.0003). In contrast, in the period before the introduction of deadlines, the hazard ratio in the sixth month is significantly lower than in either the fourth or eighth months (= 13.18; p = 0.0003). Figure 1 illustrates the monthly approval hazard ratios and accompanying 95% confidence intervals seen in Table 1, for the pre‐ and post‐PDUFA periods.20 The confidence interval estimate of the deadline month in the post‐PDUFA era appears in bold.            "
"23","                Approval Hazard Ratios for Predeadline and Postdeadline Regimes (Priority Drugs)"
"24","These patterns generally apply to standard drugs as well. Table 2 contains the monthly approval hazard ratios retrieved from dynamic Cox estimation for the first 24 months of the review cycle for standard drugs.21Figure 2 illustrates the monthly approval hazard ratios and accompanying 95% confidence intervals seen in Table 2, for the pre‐PDUFA, PDUFA, and FDAMA periods, with the confidence intervals of deadline‐month estimates appearing in bold. For drugs submitted before 1993, no piling is observed around the tenth or twelfth months on the review clock. That is, for NMEs submitted before PDUFA, the approval hazard ratio for drugs in the tenth month was not statistically differentiable from that in the twelfth month (= 0.05; p = 0.83). Nor is the hazard for drugs approved in the twelfth month statistically differentiable from that in the fourteenth month (= 2.37; p = 0.12). The hazard for drugs approved in the tenth month is statistically differentiable from that in the eighth month (= 6.68; p = 0.01), but in the opposite direction: the hazard ratio is lower in the tenth month than in the eighth.            "
"25","                Approval Hazard Ratios for Predeadline and Postdeadline Regimes (Nonpriority Drugs)"
"26","For standard drugs submitted from 1993 to 1997 and thus falling under the provisions of PDUFA 1992, however, we observe a sizable increase in approval hazards for the twelfth month of review compared to the same month in the FDAMA regime (effective starting in 1997), when the deadline changed to 10 months (= 5.73; p = 0.02). Moreover, as hypothesized, approval hazards fall off appreciably for the month after the review clock deadline, comparing the twelfth month with the fourteenth (= 6.69; p = 0.01).            "
"27","For the period since 1997, when the relevant deadline for standard NMEs has been 10 months, we indeed observe a large increase in approval hazards in the tenth month of the review cycle, compared with the tenth month under the previous 12‐month deadline regime (= 8.22; p = 0.004). Moreover, the approval hazard in the month before the 10‐month FDAMA clock deadline elapses is two times greater than the approval hazard in the month after that review deadline elapses, though this increase does not approach standard levels of significance relative to the eleventh or twelfth month.            "
"28","Our results above suggest that the introduction of deadlines has altered the timing of drug approvals. We now investigate whether the review clock institutions have influenced not just the timing, but also the quality of the FDA's decisions, particularly around drug safety and postmarketing regulatory issues. While some analysts have examined whether the overall rate of drug safety problems has changed since the introduction of deadlines,22 we compare the postmarketing experiences of drugs approved immediately before the deadline to those approved at other times in the review cycle, for NMEs approved after 1992.23"
"29","We examine four measures of postmarketing regulatory events.24 One is a dichotomous indicator of whether the approved drug later received a new postmarket black‐box warning on its label for a significant new adverse drug reaction (ADR; Lasser et al. 2002). A second is a dichotomous indicator of whether an NME faced a safety‐based withdrawal. A third measures FDA drug‐specific safety alerts. These alerts include all safety‐related letters, press releases, and health advisories circulated by the FDA and by pharmaceutical firms from 1996 through 2008, for all NMEs approved since 1996. We also examine a variable that is indirectly safety related: whether dosage‐forms of the drug have been discontinued from the marketplace. Though discontinuation sometimes “indicates drugs that have been discontinued from marketing or that have had their approvals withdrawn for other than safety or efficacy reasons,” that dosage withdrawal may be indirectly related to safety. When healthcare providers notice safety problems, clinical demand for a drug may decline.25 We report summary statistics in our online appendix.            "
"30","We use generalized linear models to estimate the implications of review deadlines on drug postmarketing experiences. For the sample of NMEs, we introduce one vector of parameters for estimation—a set of terms for each primary indication, or disease category (modeled as a random effect). Dozens (sometimes hundreds) of separate error terms or parameters are added to the models we estimate. This approach emulates some prior work on pharmaceutical policy (e.g., Carpenter 2002; Lasser 2002; Olson 1997, 2004), but our analysis includes a revised indexation of primary indications that accounts for substantively important distinctions between diseases. Other analysts control for generic therapeutic category terms (for example, for all cancer or central nervous system [CNS] drugs), but not for particular primary indications. Because primary indication largely governs drugs’ assignments to CDER reviewing division, static factors associated with the division‐level review organization are captured by this set of hundreds of terms.            "
"31","We employ the generalized linear model (GLM) framework (McCullagh and Nelder 1989) for panel data and mixed effects models. (The online appendix contains more model details.) For each of the four postmarket event variables (black‐box warning, safety‐based withdrawal, safety alerts, and dosage discontinuation), we regress the regulatory event variable on the submission year (to capture the time trend), an indicator of whether the drug received approval within the two months before the deadline time (the key explanatory variable of interest), and selected other measures. We thus create the following variables:            "
"32","               "
"33","Agency Decision Criteria: Predeadline Approval. We hypothesized that the piling of approvals near the deadline is associated with changes in drugs’ postmarketing outcomes. Thus, for any deadline month and its preceding month (tdead, tdead– 1), we construct a “predeadline” approval indicator ZPRE scored 1 if the drug in question was approved in tdead or tdead– 1, and 0 otherwise. This represents our primary explanatory variable. Where the deadline is 12 months, for instance, approvals in the eleventh and twelfth month after submission are coded as 1. This variable appears in Table 3 and Table A3 in the online appendix as “approved within two months of deadline.”                     "
"34","Agency Uncertainty: Drug Priority and Novelty (Log Order of Drug Entry). To assess claims that lower‐quality policy outcomes may arise from inherent drug uncertainty, we include two measures to capture agency uncertainty. One is an indicator of whether the FDA designated the drug for priority review, a designation reserved for drugs that represent significant innovation over existing therapies. Such innovation holds potential for greater drug safety and efficacy but greater uncertainty as new formulations are introduced into the market for the first time. The second measure accounts for drug novelty by taking the log of the number of drugs previously approved to treat the drug's primary indication. The more drugs to treat a particular disease, the greater experience the FDA may have with disease‐specific therapies and the drug's performance in a well‐known target population, while the FDA will have less prior information and more uncertainty around drugs targeting novel populations outside of the drug‐trial setting.26"
"35","Count of Previous Firm NME Approvals. To assess firm effects on drugs’ postmarketing experiences and to test claims that postmarketing problems arise from established firms’ relationship with regulators, we include a measure of firms’ regulatory experience consisting of a count of the firm's previously approved NMEs at the time of submission.                     "
"36","We report generalized linear model results for all NMEs approved between 1993 and 2007 in Table 3. Our measure of the deadline‐induced change in FDA approval behavior—approval within two months of the deadline time—is positively and significantly related to new black‐box warnings, safety‐based withdrawals, and safety alerts, and positively though not significantly related to dosage‐form discontinuations.27"
"37","The results in the first columns for black‐box warnings, safety‐based withdrawals, and dosage discontinuations are logistic regression coefficients rather than readily interpreted quantities of interest. For this reason, the second column of results for these dependent variables reports the odds ratio for each covariate. We find that the probability of a drug approved in the two months before the deadline receiving a new black‐box warning is 3.27 times greater than a drug approved at some other time, according to the model specified for the NMEs approved between 1993 and 2007. For NMEs approved between 1993 and 2007, safety‐based withdrawal is 6.92 times greater for a drug approved in the two months leading up to its approval deadline than for comparable drugs approved at other times. Drugs approved in the two months before a deadline were 1.54 times more likely to incur a dosage‐form discontinuation, though again, this particular relationship is not significant at conventional levels. We also see a positive, significant relationship between approval within two months of deadline and safety alerts. There appears to be no stratification in the deadline effect across priority and nonpriority reviews, save for dosage‐form discontinuations, where there is a deadline effect among standard drugs but not among priority drugs (see the online appendix, Tables A13a, b). The stratification of the deadline effect for dosage‐form discontinuations suggests that we are not necessarily seeing a null result for this outcome variable as much as a conditioned result. That said, we have no a priori reason for having expected to see the difference observed here—though it may be due to the fact that voluntary dosage‐form discontinuations are less likely for more profitable drugs. We believe that this is amenable to further investigation. On the whole, these results lend support to our argument that changes in the timing of FDA decisions—resulting in drug approval piling before the specified deadline—are associated with greater postmarketing regulatory events."
"38","We also seek to minimize the possibility that our results are dependent on modeling assumptions as a consequence of large differences between our implied treatment group (approval in the two months before a looming deadline) and our implied control group (drugs approved at other times). For a variety of reasons related to nonrandom assignment, these groups may not be equivalent in all relevant aspects except for the just‐before‐deadline approval. There is, to be sure, no way of eliminating omitted variables and other sources of bias as explanations for our results, which are generated from an observational research design. To at least reduce the likelihood that our results are due to baseline differences between the treatment and control groups, we match observations from the treatment and control groups on observables to construct a sample that allows estimation of the causal effect of the predeadline approval on the treated units that appear in the matched sample. Using two matching methods, optimal matching (Hansen 2004) and coarsened exact matching (Iacus, King, and Porro 2011),28 we match on a range of covariates widely believed to predict predeadline approval. We then apply general linear models (without mixed effects) to account for any imbalance that may remain after matching (Ho et al. 2007). We examine issues of covariate balance and present results in the online appendix (Tables A1, A2, A3).            "
"39","Although we have not tested the hypothesis here, drugs approved in the window just before the deadline may be less likely to receive sufficient time and expertise applied to their reviews (Huber and Kunz 2007), perhaps through curtailed advisory committee consultations or rushed drug labeling decisions, which typically occur at the end of the review process. Given the certain publicity that accompanies tardiness in drug approval, relative to the uncertainty over whether rushed approvals will yield reputational damage, we suspect that incentives to meet the deadlines may outweigh reputational and other considerations that contribute to decision quality (see also Krause and Corder 2007).         "
"40","From the perspective of some anonymous FDA staffers, this is what happened after the introduction of deadlines. A 2003 Office of the Inspector General (OIG) survey reported agency concerns about insufficient time to review and debate drug applications. Staffers’ concerns focused on the end of the review cycle, when the agency convenes with its public advisors about challenging applications and labeling decisions. FDA staffers and OIG inspectors both expressed concern that deadlines impaired the agency's ability to consult with advisors and encouraged the agency to “rush to finalize drug labels at the end of the process” (HHS OIG 2003, 6).29 Drug labels contain “key information concerning … safe and effective use,” including drug warnings and contraindications (HHS OIG 2003, 27). Advisory committees provide the FDA with expertise for drug approval and labeling decisions, and they represent important venues for communicating potential drug risks to broader audiences (Moffitt 2010).30 In its “rush,” the agency may have lost key methods to improve drug safety messages and their conveyance.         "
"41","We find preliminary descriptive evidence that activities such as advisory committee reviews received less attention after the introduction of deadlines. (Our results appear in Table A4 in our online appendix.) Using a sample of drugs approved between 1986 and 2006, we found that deadline regime drugs were significantly less likely to experience advisory committee reviews prior to the drugs’ approval compared with drugs that did not face deadlines.31 Our results also suggest that drugs approved in the deadline window were less likely to receive an advisory committee review compared with drugs approved at all other points in the process, though there is more uncertainty associated with this estimate. The relationship between looming deadlines and advisory committee reviews achieves standard levels of statistical significance in only one of our two models.         "
"42","We have adduced evidence for the hypothesis that at‐deadline approvals are more likely to be withdrawn from the marketplace, are more likely to receive safety alerts, and are associated with a higher rate of postapproval black‐box warnings. Whether these regulatory indicators are indicative of real human and economic costs is another question. This question is one whose ultimate scope demands a separate article. In the interest of demonstrating that serious, unanticipated consequences to deadlines may have exacted tangible costs on some of the supporters of the deadline regime (e.g., patient advocates), we offer a brief overview of the plausible human health correlates of postmarket safety problems. If the average drug withdrawal is associated with 50,000 deaths, say, then a small increase in the probability of a drug withdrawal may be expressive of an appreciable number of lives lost or damaged. Using a supplemental database of all reported adverse drug reactions from 1996 to 2006, we estimate the average change in reported adverse drug events associated with two of our postmarket regulatory outcomes—drug withdrawals and safety alerts."
"43","This database, collected from the FDA's MEDWATCH system,32 classifies drug adverse events into a number of categories, but three are of interest here: (1) adverse events associated with a patient's subsequent death, (2) adverse events associated with a patient's subsequent hospitalization, and (3) adverse events associated with a patient's subsequent disability. Each safety‐based drug withdrawal is associated with 29,741 additional adverse events associated with death, 160,993 additional adverse drug events associated with hospitalization, and 14,217 additional adverse events associated with a reported disability. If we take a one‐unit shift in the natural logarithm of safety alerts as a predictor, such a change predicts 13,321 more death‐related adverse events, 44,306 hospitalization‐related adverse events, and 6,953 disability‐related adverse drug reactions.            "
"44","For a number of reasons, these numbers must be taken as suggestive only of possibly correlated effects of safety‐based withdrawals and safety alerts. One problem is that there is massive underreporting of adverse events, such that many pharmacologists and drug safety experts see them as only indicative of drug safety problems. Another problem is that one can never be certain that a drug caused a death or hospitalization in a given case; the MEDWATCH system is based upon reporting of physicians’ and manufacturers’suspected associations of an adverse event with use of a particular drug. For this reason, we do not attempt here to causally tie at‐deadline approvals to higher rates of adverse events. These correlates, however, do suggest that postmarketing regulatory events such as drug withdrawals and safety alerts reflect tangible and appreciable human costs; they are correlated with induced hospitalizations, induced disabilities, and deaths.            "
"45","Agencies have significant time discretion in their operations and decisions. For this reason, deadlines embedded in rules and legislation represent a potent form of political control. Our empirical results suggest that in the area of U.S. pharmaceutical regulation, deadlines influence the timing of agency decisions, resulting in the piling of drug approvals right before the deadline. Moreover, drugs approved right before the deadline are associated with more safety problems when reaching the market. Rushing approvals at the end of the review cycle may, we argue, be the mechanism behind this association, compromising the agency's ability to gather and distribute information through public advisory committees and through careful drug labels, information that is vital to safe and effective drug use on the market."
"46","Our argument departs from traditional theories of political control in several ways. First and foremost, we focus on the time domain of agency discretion, and not (as much) on the kind of ideological or nontime performance metrics examined in previous literature. Our arguments are not about the overall quality of the products being regulated, an argument that might fit more neatly into existing research in the political control literature. We instead argue that the specific behavior change induced by the deadline—approval piling right before the deadline—is associated with specific changes in the quality of policy outcomes as captured by postmarketing regulatory events for drugs approved right before the deadline. The trade‐off between political control and expertise must account for potential damage to the interests that political control intended to benefit: damage that arises when agency expertise is impaired through political control."
"47","Our results are not uniform, as they vary slightly depending on model specification (hence our reporting of multiple specifications of the GLMs and robustness checks reported in the online appendix including different matching specifications). However, we observed no statistically significant negative relationships between deadline approvals and postmarketing regulatory events (PMREs) across all of the robustness checks done on the results reported here. Moreover, we do observe a large number of positive relationships statistically significant at the 5% level between deadline approvals and PMREs that hold across statistical specifications. While detection methods for adverse postmarket events and other safety issues have improved in the past two decades, the starkness of the deadline effects observed here suggests that broader trends in pharmacoepidemiology are unlikely to have contributed to the positive association between approval under a looming deadline and adverse postmarket events.         "
"48","Our model estimates offer appreciable evidence that political control through regulatory deadlines affects the timing and quality of agency decisions. We thus offer important theoretical and empirical extensions to political control scholarship that predicts a trade‐off between political control and agency expertise. Procedural controls that constrain expertise can produce outcomes that adversely affect intended beneficiaries. While we agree that Congress’s motive in promulgating controls is often specifically to “enfranchise some groups and exclude others” or to delimit “who has access to the agency” (Bawn 1995, 62), the winners and losers in the story we present are not as straightforward as a stylized model might imply. Though disease sufferers were the intended beneficiaries of the FDA deadline regime, they may bear the unintended costs of rushed approval in the form of unanticipated safety problems. One AIDS advocate, looking back on the FDA's acceleration, lamented, “We have arrived in hell. … AIDS activists and government regulators have worked together, with the best intentions, over the years to speed access to drugs. What we have done, however, is to unleash drugs with well‐documented toxicities onto the market, without obtaining rigorous data on their clinical efficacy” (Hilts 2003, 251). While the disappointed AIDS activist does not mention deadlines directly, it is clear from our estimates that these deadlines have been part of the acceleration. The activist points clearly, moreover, to the foregone informational benefits of quicker FDA decisions. So too, it is quite possible that drug firms whose safety problems have been resulting in lower sales and increased public distrust might question the gains they have received from deadlines (Berenson 2005). The net benefits of deadlines may still have been positive, but it is clear that not all of the costs would have been anticipatable, as current theories of administrative procedures assume.         "
"49","The mechanisms through which deadlines impair decision making—limiting the amount of time and information an agency may bring to bear on decisions, limiting conveyance of political information to the agency, restructuring agency decision criteria—manifest in other forms of political control. Appointments, for instance, can change the information an agency has at its disposal as well as alter the agency's criteria and culture. Budgets, for their part, embody concrete resources and political symbols. The fundamental similarity in the mechanisms that enable instruments of political control gives us confidence that our deadline results apply broadly to other institutions designed to shape and constrain bureaucratic behavior."
"50","Our findings also offer useful implications for the study of drugs and other regulators. We have focused the present analysis upon new molecular drug approval in the United States, but drug reviews at the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) are also governed by a system of review‐time deadlines, as are thousands of other FDA reviews not analyzed here (of medical devices, biologic drugs and generic drugs, among others). There are, furthermore, many administrative and regulatory decisions outside drug regulation characterized by timing phenomena (O’Connell and Gerson 2008; Yackee and Yackee 2010). Wherever deadlines apply to administrative timing processes, our models will be of potential analytic value.         "
"51","Though we find consistent results under the FDA deadline regime, future research should consider two additional aspects of agency learning. First, when agencies develop a reputation for meeting the “spirit” of the deadline (i.e., getting therapies on the market more quickly), are they better able to violate the specific terms of the deadline without political consequence? As agencies and political overseers demonstrate timeliness, in other words, do deadlines become less “absolute”? Second, as agencies adapt to deadline regimes, do they learn how to adjust their work processes to afford both quality and timeliness? If so, how and by what procedural and organizational mechanisms? These future lines of inquiry will help illuminate the durability of deadline institutions and their consequences.         "
"52","Considerable scholarship over the past 30 years has explored the range of tools elected officials have applied to shape bureaucratic behavior and constrain discretion, but it has largely ignored the time dimension of discretion and has attended much less systematically to the consequences of such political control. Our study offers an important contribution to this ongoing discussion by demonstrating how deadlines influence the quality of agency decisions by constraining an agency's time discretion."
