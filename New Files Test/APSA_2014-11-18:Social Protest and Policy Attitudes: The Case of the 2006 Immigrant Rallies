"1","Giugni (2004) argues protests generate a two‐way information flow, one to power brokers in the government and the other to the general public. The information intended to pressure government officials to address critical social problems is also important for making the public more aware of these problems. While we acknowledge the role of social protest in shaping elite behavior, here we are concerned with the influence of social protest on mass public opinion. Using the case of the 2006 immigration protests, we argue exposure to protests influences policy preferences.5"
"2","In December 2005, the U.S. House passed H.R. 4437. The key provisions of the bill were to (1) increase penalties for undocumented immigrants and (2) make it a felony to assist an undocumented person in entering or staying in the United States. If signed into law, the punitive implications of the bill would be felt by multiple constituencies: undocumented, documented, and even U.S. citizens. Barreto et al. (2009) contend the bill served as a “powerful external threat” to Latinos, as a majority of undocumented immigrants are from Latin American countries. Across the country, civic/community organizations and Catholic churches worked to mobilize opposition to H.R. 4437 (Barreto et al. 2009; Benjamin‐Alvarado, DeSipio, and Montoya 2009; Félix, González, and Ramírez 2008; Silber Mohamed 2013).         "
"3","Over a span of four months in the spring of 2006, an estimated 3.5 to 5.1 million people, largely of Latino descent, took to the streets of over 160 cities across 43 states (Bada et al. 2006). The primary purpose of the protests was to convey opposition to H.R. 4437 and support for a policy with an earned pathway to citizenship (Barreto et al. 2009).         "
"4","We argue exposure to the protest period (temporal exposure) served to increase Latinos’ awareness of immigration issues (see Carey et al. 2014) and influence policy preferences. During the protest period, information about punitive immigration policies and the more general anti‐immigrant context was prevalent. The debate over immigration was often tethered to Latinos (Brader, Valentino, and Suhay 2008; Branton et al. 2011). As such, we contend that for many Latinos, the protests conveyed the threat posed by restrictive immigration reforms and made the issue of immigration more salient. In essence, when made aware of the threat posed by punitive immigration reforms, Latinos would become more likely to support less restrictive immigration policy options. Explicitly stated:            "
"5","Nevertheless, we anticipate that the impact of the protest environment is not uniform across Latinos. We argue the effect of protest on policy attitudes is conditioned by the level of direct threat posed by punitive immigration reforms. Specifically, we propose that the effect of exposure to protests on immigration attitudes is conditioned on one's generational status."
"6","Previous work suggests threatening conditions motivate greater political awareness. These threats may concern one's material self‐interests, one's well‐being, or one's political interests. Within the political domain, threat is believed to heighten anxiety, which encourages citizens to seek information within their political environment (Pantoja and Segura 2003). Furthermore, the social psychological literature shows that external threats make group identities more salient and increase in‐group solidarity (Flippen et al. 1996; Grant and Brown 1995). Additionally, threatening conditions serve as a motivator for political activism (Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000; Miller and Krosnick 2004). Ultimately, Barreto et al. (2009) find the political threat of restrictive immigration reforms motivated many Latinos to evaluate information from their political context and coalesce as a group.         "
"7","Yet, some groups of Latinos should feel more threatened than others. From a purely self‐interested perspective, we would expect first‐generation Latinos were more likely to respond to the threat conveyed by the protests than later‐generation Latinos. Thus, we employ generational status as a proxy measure of threat and expect first‐generation immigrants to be least supportive of punitive immigration reforms. Further, we propose generational status conditions the effect of exposure to the protest context such that the impact of exposure to protest should be more amplified for first‐generation Latinos than for second‐plus‐generation Latinos. It seems reasonable to expect the threat conveyed by the protests would be most immediate for first‐generation Latinos. Although H.R. 4437 included a provision that could have potentially distributed costs to those who assist undocumented individuals, we argue that the threat conveyed by the protests is not as direct for second‐plus‐generation Latinos.6 As such, we propose the following:            "
"8","We now consider how spatial exposure to the 2006 protest affected Latino immigration policy preferences. Spatial exposure is captured by determining whether respondents resided in a locale with protest activities. It seems reasonable to expect that in areas with a protest event, the amount of information about the threat to the Latino community posed by restrictive immigration reforms may be heightened."
"9","To motivate our argument regarding the impact of spatial exposure to local protest on Latino policy preferences, we rely on the theory of modified sociotropism (Gartner and Segura 2000; Gartner, Segura, and Wilkening 1997). Importantly, this modification of the theory of sociotropism recognizes variability in the dispersion of information. Gartner and Segura (2000, 117) argue that “individuals are affected by societal experience with an issue, but their perceptions of that experience are shaped by available proximate information—salient information about how the issue affects those one knows and cares about the most.” They also contend opinion formation is not simply driven by the saliency of information, but also by how readily accessible the information is to an individual. When individuals have a social connection with an issue, it can affect one's opinion on that issue. Further, these social connections make abstractions about an issue much more prevalent.         "
"10","Accordingly, we propose Latino attitudes toward immigration policy may be influenced by spatial exposure to protest activity. Although the protests occurred across the nation, it is not the case that every locale experienced immigration rallies. As such, information about the threat is not evenly distributed. We argue individuals residing in areas with protest activity have greater exposure to information conveyed by the rallies than individuals residing in areas with no protest activity. The modified sociotropism perspective suggests the “proximate experience” of exposure to local protest(s) will weigh more heavily in the formation of attitudes toward immigration. Given that the protests focused on the threat posed by restrictive immigration reforms and on promoting a policy with a path to legalization (Barreto et al. 2009; Benjamin‐Alvarado et al. 2009), it is reasonable to expect exposure to local protests is associated with immigration policy preferences. We propose that support for less restrictive forms of immigration will be amplified among respondents residing in areas with protest activities.            "
"11","On a related point, we propose that for those who reside in communities with protest activities, support for immigration will vary as a function of the number of protests. Again, modified sociotropism would lend theoretical support for the expectation that heightened local protest activity can lead to amplified support for less restrictive immigration policy. The “proximate experience” of the protests and the message being forwarded by the protests should lead to greater support for an immigration policy that is more beneficial to the Latino community. Explicitly stated:            "
"12","Finally, consistent with the temporal exposure hypotheses, we propose the impact of exposure to local protest activities is conditioned on one's generational status."
"13","To test the hypotheses, we utilize the 2006 LNS. As noted, the LNS is unique in that it serves as a “natural experiment.”7 Several months after the LNS went into the field, millions of people nationwide participated in protests and rallies in response to H.R. 4437. These unanticipated events provide the opportunity to examine whether and how protest influences public opinion toward the issue of contention: immigration policy. Latinos surveyed prior to the protests serve as our control group, and those surveyed after the protests began serve as our treatment group. Our dependent variable measures attitudes toward U.S. immigration policy. The respondents are asked: “What is your preferred policy on undocumented or illegal immigration?”: (1) immediate legalization of current undocumented immigrants, (2) a guest worker program leading to legalization eventually, (3) a guest worker program permitting immigrants to be in the country, but only temporarily, (4) an effort to seal or close off the border to stop illegal immigration, and (5) none of the above.8"
"14","The independent variables of primary interest reflect the temporal and spatial exposure to protest. Temporal exposure to Protest is measured by a binary variable coded 1 if the respondent is surveyed after the protests began and 0 otherwise.9 This variable is included to tease out the difference between the control group and treatment group.10 Spatial exposure to protest is measured by two variables: Local Protest and Number of Protests. To generate the spatial exposure measures, we use data compiled by Bada et al. (2006) that denote the city in which each protest occurred and the date of the protest. Using geographic information systems, we identified the county location of each protest denoted in Bada et al. (2006). Next, we aggregated the protest data to the “core‐based statistical area,” which is composed of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas.11 This more aggregated geographic unit recognizes that in densely populated areas, multiple counties are socially or economically connected. For instance, counties in densely populated areas typically share the same media market. Thus, if a protest is occurring in the area, but not in the specific county in which a respondent resides, this approach accounts for exposure to the activity. For rural areas, areas not located in a metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area, we utilize the county‐level data. We then merged the protest data with the LNS survey data. Local Protest is a dichotomous variable coded 1 if the respondent resided in an area with a prior protest event and 0 if the respondent resided in an area with no prior protest event. This variable allows us to compare immigration attitudes between the two groups (local protest event versus no local protest event). Number of Protests is a count of the number of local protests that occurred before the respondent was surveyed.12 This variable allows us to compare immigration attitudes as a function of the number of protest events to which one was exposed.         "
"15","The other key independent variable of interest is generational status. Generation ranges from 0 to 4, where 0 reflects noncitizen, 1 reflects foreign‐born citizen, 2 reflects second generation, 3 reflects third generation, and 4 reflects fourth‐plus generation. We split the foreign‐born respondents into two categories—noncitizen and citizen—as noncitizens may perceive a heightened level of threat as a result of their lack of citizenship. In general, extant research indicates first‐generation Latinos are less supportive of restrictive immigration policies than later‐generation Latinos (Branton 2007; Garcia Bedolla 2005; Hood, Morris, and Shirkey 1997). As such, we expect greater support for more beneficial immigration policy options among first‐generation Latinos than later‐generation Latinos.         "
"16","In addition to the above variables of interest, the models include five sets of variables that measure respondents’ socioeconomic status, perceived commonalities with Latinos, group identification, religious indicators, political knowledge, basic demographics, and contextual indicators.13 Extant research commonly notes Latino immigration attitudes are associated with these factors (Binder, Polinard, and Wrinkle 1997; Branton 2007; Carey, Branton, and Martinez‐Ebers 2013; Citrin et al. 1997; Hood et al. 1997; Rocha et al. 2011; Sanchez 2006). These variables are important in controlling the demographic and political differences of respondents between the treatment and control groups. The assignment of the respondents to the treatment and control groups was almost random, yet the respondents’ decision to participate in the survey might be influenced by their personal characteristics and exposure to the rallies. Indeed, we find significant differences in the demographic and political features of the respondents in the treatment and control groups.14 Accordingly, these control variables play an important role in isolating the effects of the rallies on the outcome variable.15"
"17","Respondents’ socioeconomic status is measured by their educational background, income level, and personal financial situation. Education is measured by an 8‐point scale ranging from 0 to 7. Respondents’ income is measured by four variables that equal 1 if respondents belong to one of the quartiles on the scale of income and 0 otherwise. The lowest quartile serves as the baseline category. Additionally, we include an indicator variable that equals 1 if respondents refused to report their income status and 0 otherwise. Respondents’ assessment of their personal financial situation is measured by a 3‐point scale ranging from (1) gotten worse, (2) stays about the same, and (3) gotten better."
"18","Respondents’ perceived commonalities with other Latinos is measured by an item asking, “Thinking about issues like job opportunities, education or income, how much do [ethnic subgroup] have in common with other Latinos or Hispanics? Would you say [ethnic subgroup] share a lot in common, some things in common, little in common, or nothing in common with other Latinos?” The measure is coded (1) nothing, (2) little, (3) some, and (4) lot."
"19","To measure group identity, we use a survey item that asks respondents to choose the category that best describes them: Latino/Hispanic, American, their national‐origin group, and none of these. We created two measures to capture their primary group identity. For the first measure, a value of 1 was assigned to respondents who chose their national‐origin group and 0 otherwise. The second measure assigns a value of 1 to respondents who identified more strongly with their American identity and 0 otherwise. The baseline category reflects a Latino/Hispanic primary identification."
"20","To measure a respondent's political knowledge, we rely on an additive measure based on responses to three survey items. Respondents were asked to identify the party that had a majority in the House of Representatives, the presidential candidate who won the 2004 election in their state, and the political party that is more conservative than the other. The responses were coded 1 if a response was correct and 0 otherwise. Scores range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of political knowledge."
"21","To account for the impact of religion and civic participation, the models include three measures: Catholic, Attend Church, and Civic Participation. Catholic is a dichotomous measure that indicates whether a respondent is Catholic. Attend Church represents regular church attendance, which is a dichotomous variable coded 1 if a respondent indicates she attends religious services once a week or more. Civic Participation is a dichotomous measure that indicates whether a respondent is involved in a civic organization. Given the importance of the Catholic Church and civic organizations in activist efforts—not only with regard to the 2006 rallies but also more generally (Schmidt et al. 2008)—we include this to account for the potential influence of involvement in the church and civic organizations on immigration attitudes.         "
"22","We control for differences in national origin using dummy variables for country or region of origin/descent. The dummy variables equal 1 if respondents descend from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Central America, and South America.16 Mexican respondents serve as the baseline category. Further, we control for differences in age measured by years and gender, which equals 1 if the respondent is female and 0 otherwise. Finally, our model includes aggregate‐level measures of the socioeconomic and ethnic context. Socioeconomic context is measured by tract‐level percent high school educated. Ethnic context is measured by the percentage of Latinos at the tract level. These measures are included to account for variance in immigration attitudes attributable to the context in which one resides.         "
"23","First, we estimate a “main effect” model that compares Latino attitudes on immigration before and after the rallies began. The dependent variable is a nominal measure; thus, we estimate multinomial logit models.17 The baseline category indicates support for immediate legalization. Given that it is difficult to directly interpret multinomial logit results, we present predicted probabilities in Table 1 (the full set of results appears in Table B of the SI). The predicted probabilities indicate the effect of temporal exposure to the protest environment is significant across two of the three policy options.18 Respondents surveyed prior to the protests had a .10 lower probability of supporting amnesty compared to those surveyed in the protest context. Further, the probability of supporting a guest worker program with a temporary residency requirement is .04 lower among Latinos surveyed after the protests began compared to those surveyed before the protests began. These results imply there is a strong, uniform effect of exposure to protest, such that those surveyed after the protests began were more likely to support the less restrictive policy option—amnesty—compared to respondents surveyed before the protest began (Hypothesis 1).            "
"24","Next, we consider whether the effect of temporal exposure to the protest period is conditioned on generational status. The model presented below includes an interaction between the protest measure and generation. The parameter estimates and standard errors on the interactions are conditional; thus, the size and significance of the conditional effect cannot be determined based on the parameter estimates and standard errors presented in the results tables (Brambor, Clark, and Golder 2006). As such, we estimate the marginal effect of exposure to protest conditioned on generational status and the associated standard errors as outlined by Brambor, Clark, and Golder (2006).            "
"25","Again, to facilitate the interpretation of the results, we present the predicted probabilities in Table 2 (see Table C in the SI for the results). The predicted probabilities highlight the conditional nature of the relationship between temporal exposure to the protests and immigration attitudes, specifically the conditioning effect of generational status.            "
"26","First, foreign‐born noncitizens surveyed after the protests began have a .11 higher probability of supporting amnesty than those surveyed before the protests began. Further, the probability of supporting a guest worker program with a temporary residency requirement is .06 lower among noncitizens surveyed after the protests began compared to those surveyed before the protests began. Among respondents who have the most to lose (or gain) from immigration reform, temporal exposure to the protest period elicited an expected response: heightened support for the most favorable policy and muted support for the more punitive option."
"27","Second, a similar pattern emerges among foreign‐born citizens and second‐generation Latinos. The probability of a foreign‐born citizen supporting amnesty increases by .09 when comparing those surveyed prior to the protests and those surveyed in the protest period. Yet, there is a significant decrease in support among foreign‐born citizens for immigration reform that includes a guest worker program (–.06). For a second‐generation Latino surveyed prior to the protest, the probability of supporting amnesty is .08 lower compared to a second‐generation Latino surveyed after the protests began. Finally, there is no significant difference in support for amnesty as a function of temporal exposure to protest among third‐plus‐generation Latinos."
"28","Together, these results lend evidence that temporal exposure to the protest period impacts immigration attitudes (Hypothesis 1). Furthermore, the effect of protest is most demonstrable among more recent‐generation Latinos (Hypothesis 2). For first‐generation respondents, immigration is likely an issue that has directly impacted either their lives or the lives of those close to them. Further, these results suggest temporal exposure to protest exerts some level of influence even among those less likely to personally lose (or gain) from H.R. 4437 due to their citizenship status. The results demonstrate the conditional nature of the impact of exposure to protest. Failing to account for the moderating effect of one's generational status, one would conclude there is a uniform effect of exposure to protest on Latino immigration attitudes (see Table 1).            "
"29","Next, we consider how spatial exposure to local protest activity affects immigration policy preferences. The predicted probabilities presented in Table 3 are based on a model (see Table D in the SI for results) that includes only those respondents surveyed after the start of the social protests (i.e., the treatment groups).19"
"30","First, among first‐generation noncitizens, exposure to a local protest event serves to increase the probability of supporting amnesty and decreases the probability of supporting both guest worker options. The probability of a noncitizen who resides in an area with no protest event supporting amnesty is .39, whereas the probability for a noncitizen residing in an area with a protest event increases to .50. Further, the results indicate the probability of supporting a guest worker program with a path to legalization is lower among first‐generation noncitizens residing in areas with a protest event compared to their counterparts residing in areas with no protest event. Finally, the probability of a first‐generation noncitizen supporting a guest worker program with a temporary residency requirement is .05 lower among those residing in areas with a protest event compared to those residing in areas with no protest event. Again, we find evidence that among those for whom H.R. 4437 poses the most direct threat, exposure to local protest elicited an expected response: heightened support for the most favorable policy position and muted support for the more punitive option."
"31","Second, we see a similar pattern among foreign‐born citizens. The probability of supporting amnesty increases by .11 when comparing those residing in areas with local protests and those residing in areas with no prior protests. Further, the probability of supporting a guest worker program with a path to legalization is .07 lower among those residing in areas with protest activity compared to those residing in areas with no protest activity. Finally, the probability of a foreign‐born citizen supporting a guest worker program with a temporary residency requirement is .04 lower among those residing in areas with protest activity compared to those residing in areas with no protest activity. Together, these results suggest that for foreign‐born citizens living in areas with protest activities, there is a shift from supporting the guest worker options to supporting amnesty."
"32","Third, the results indicate there is also a significant difference in immigration policy preferences among second‐ and third‐generation Latinos as a function of exposure to local protest events. This suggests that for second‐ and third‐generation Latinos surveyed in the protest period, proximate exposure to protest events served to attenuate support for a guest worker program with a path to legalization and heighten support for reform that promotes amnesty. For example, for a second‐generation Latino who resides in an area with a protest event, the probability of supporting amnesty is .10 higher and the probability of supporting a guest worker program with a path to citizenship is .07 lower compared to a second‐generation Latino who resides in an area with no protest events. Finally, the impact of exposure to local protest does not reach a conventional level of statistical significance among fourth‐plus‐generation Latinos, suggesting the conditioning effect diminishes among more assimilated Latinos."
"33","Together, these results lend evidence to support our expectation that exposure to local protest activity should impact immigration attitudes (Hypothesis 3). Again, we see the effect of exposure to protest is conditioned on one's generational status (Hypothesis 2)."
"34","Now we examine whether and how the number of local protest events affects immigration preferences.20 The predicted probabilities presented in Table 4 are based on a model that includes a measure of the number of local protests that occurred before the respondent was surveyed, which ranges from 1 to 13 (see Table E in the SI for the results). Again, the analysis presented here includes only those respondents who resided in an area with a prior protest event.            "
"35","First, the predicted probabilities indicate the immigration preferences among first‐generation noncitizen Latinos do not vary as a function of the number of prior local protests. Among this subgroup, support for amnesty is obviously high, and increasing the number of protests does not result in greater support for this policy position or movement on the other policy options. In the protest period, first‐generation noncitizens’ proximate exposure to one protest or 13 protests makes little difference. For this group, the threat of restrictive immigration policy reform for themselves and their community is likely already salient."
"36","Second, there are significant differences in immigration attitudes as a function of the number of local protests among first‐generation citizens and second‐plus‐generation Latinos. The starkest findings emerge on the amnesty option. Here we see among Latinos who are citizens—by naturalization or birth—that there is a sizable shift in support for amnesty as the number of local protests increases from the minimum to the maximum, thus lending support for Hypothesis 4. Among first‐generation citizens, the probability of supporting amnesty increases by .16 as the number of protests increases from the minimum to the maximum, whereas among second‐generation Latinos, the probability increases by .24 as the number increases from the minimum to the maximum. A consistent trend emerges among third‐ and fourth‐plus‐generation Latinos."
"37","Third, the results also highlight shifts in support for the guest worker program options. Among Latinos who are citizens—by naturalization or birth—there is a sizable shift in support for reform involving a guest worker option as the number of local protests increases from the minimum to the maximum As the number of local protests increases from one to 13, the probability of a first‐generation Latino citizen supporting a guest worker program with an eventual path to legalization decreases from .40 to .30. Further, among first‐generation Latino citizens, as the number of local protests increases from one to 13, the probability of supporting a guest worker program with a provision for temporary residency decreases from .15 to .06. Similar trends emerge for second‐plus‐generation Latinos. This suggests that in areas with higher volumes of protest activities, attitudes among more assimilated Latinos reveal a sizable decline in support for immigration reform that involves a guest worker program—with a path to legalization or with a provision for temporary residency."
"38","Finally, the results demonstrate the conditional nature of the relationship between exposure to protest events and immigration attitudes. As the number of local protests increases, we see no significant difference in immigration attitudes among first‐generation noncitizens, yet marked differences across the categories of generational status. Indeed, there is a significant difference in support for amnesty (.18) between first‐generation noncitizens and second‐generation Latinos in areas with a single protest; yet this difference disappears as the number of protests increases. This suggests that as the number of protests increases, a second‐generation Latino is as likely to support amnesty as a first‐generation noncitizen. In the protest context, the proximate experience of local protest events has the greatest impact on those who are least directly threatened by restrictive immigration reform. We suspect increased protest activity diffused information about the threat of the policy and the anti‐immigrant undertones, thus swaying support for less restrictive immigration policy."
"39","Before considering the implications of these findings, we would like to offer a general discussion of the other covariates. The results for the country of origin/descent variables indicate a consistently significant difference in immigration preferences between Mexican and Puerto Rican respondents, as well as between Cuban and Puerto Rican respondents. For instance, in the model testing the difference in support pre‐ and postprotest (Table C in the SI), on average Mexican respondents have a .41 likelihood of supporting amnesty and Cubans have a .43 probability, whereas Puerto Ricans have a .31 probability. This is reflective of the differential citizenship status of Puerto Ricans when compared to these other Latino subgroups."
"40","Additionally, the results indicate Catholic identification has no consistent impact on immigration preferences; however, Latinos who regularly attend church are significantly more likely to support amnesty than a guest worker program with a path to legalization. The results also suggest a consistent and positive relationship between language skills and support for amnesty. Substantively, the results indicate linguistically incorporated Latinos are more likely to support more restrictive immigration reform than less linguistically incorporated Latinos. Furthermore, heightened political knowledge is associated with increased likelihood of supporting a guest worker program with a path to legalization rather than a policy promoting amnesty. Finally, civic participation appears to have no consistent relationship with Latino immigration policy preferences. Together, the findings suggest linguistic acculturation, church attendance, and political knowledge influence the structure of Latino attitudes toward immigration."
"41","Here, we examine the impact of the 2006 immigration protests on immigration policy preferences. Fortuitously, the LNS was in the field before and after the protests began, creating a natural experiment. Utilizing these data, we find respondents surveyed after the protests began were, generally speaking, more likely to support amnesty than those surveyed before the protests began. We also find evidence among respondents interviewed after the protests began that those residing in areas where protest activities occurred are more likely to support amnesty than those living in areas with no protests. Additionally, the effect of temporal and spatial exposure to protest is conditioned on whether the focus of the protest, in this case H.R. 4437, represents a threat to the respondent. Perhaps not surprisingly, after exposure to a single local protest, the most threatened respondents (first‐generation noncitizens) have the greatest likelihood of supporting the most lenient policy option, amnesty. However, as the number of local protests increased, those less directly affected by the proposed law also become more likely to support amnesty.         "
"42","This research, we think, advances the literature focused on social protest in at least three ways. First, it demonstrates that temporal exposure and spatial exposure to protest influence policy preferences. It is important to recognize that differences in the distribution of information about an issue as a function of exposure to protest have consequences for public opinion. Second, it illustrates that the impact of temporal and spatial exposure to protest is conditioned on individual‐level characteristics. The results presented in Table 1 offer a very different view of the impact of protest than the interactive results presented thereafter. When examining how protest may influence opinion, it is important to consider individual‐level characteristics that may moderate the effect of the protest. Third, the analysis suggests a more nuanced idea of how protest influences attitudes among individuals within the group or groups tethered to the protest issue. The findings in this case suggest that social protest had a coalescing effect among Latinos exposed, temporally and spatially, to the protest events.         "
"43","If data are available, it would be fruitful to see whether the arguments developed about the influence of protest in this particular policy example can be generalized to other instances of protest—for example, what effect student demonstrations against college tuition increases and youth unemployment in the United Kingdom or Quebec had on the opinion of students who continue to attend classes or who have jobs. It would be reasonable to hypothesize that students in London and Montreal, cities at the center of the protest movements, are more aware of and affected by the protest events. Rising tuition costs would also threaten low‐income families with aspirations for their children to attend college. These families may not be knowledgeable of the tuition hikes until they are made aware through the protests. Thus, a similar case study could be conducted using the theoretical framework we have laid out. Obtaining a more systematic understanding of the impact of protest on public opinion will ultimately provide greater insight into the success (or not) of social movements for policy change."
