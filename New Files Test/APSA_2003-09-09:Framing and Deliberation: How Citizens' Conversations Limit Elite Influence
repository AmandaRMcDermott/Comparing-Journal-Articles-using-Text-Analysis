"1","Framing effects constitute one of the primary means by which elites influence citizens' opinions; Chong describes framing as the “essence of public opinion formation” (1993, 870). A framing effect occurs when in the course of describing an issue or event, a speaker's emphasis on a subset of potentially relevant considerations causes individuals to focus on these considerations when constructing their opinions (Druckman 2001c, 226–31). For example, if a speaker describes a hate‐group rally in terms of free speech, then the audience will subsequently base their opinions about the rally on free‐speech considerations and, perhaps, support the right to rally. In contrast, if the speaker uses a public‐safety frame, the audience will base their opinions on public‐safety considerations and oppose the rally (Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997).         "
"2","Analysts have documented framing effects for numerous issues in various contexts (e.g., Jacoby 2000). Nearly all of this work uses surveys or laboratory experiments where individuals receive a single frame and then report their opinions, without any social interaction or access to alternative sources of information (however, see Sniderman and Theriault n.d.). Study participants thus find themselves in a social vacuum, receiving frames and reporting their opinions with no possibility to discuss the issue at hand.         "
"3","We see this as a substantial limitation of previous studies, since in many political settings people have access to various forms of political information including conversations with others. Huckfeldt and Sprague explain, “[p]olitics is a social activity imbedded within structured patterns of social interaction. Political information is conveyed not only through speeches and media reports but also through a variety of informal social mechanisms—political discussions on the job or on the street… even casual remarks” (1987, 1197; see also, e.g., Gamson 1992, 179; Just et al. 1996; Mutz and Martin 2001; Beck et al. 2002, 61; Walsh 2003). Is elite influence via framing robust to the introduction of other common sources of political information such as interpersonal conversations? How might elite framing effects be affected by subsequent conversations between citizens?         "
"4","In addressing these questions, we add to the recent trend in framing work that, in contrast to earlier research, documents various moderators to the effects (e.g., Brewer 2001; Druckman 2001b, 2001c; Haider‐Markel and Joslyn 2001; Gross and Brewer 2002; Sniderman and Theriault n.d.; however, none of this work explores the impact of interpersonal conversations). We focus on the situation where conversations follow an elite framing effect—that is the initial frame comes from elites. This strikes us as an important scenario since elites play a substantial role in setting the agenda for subsequent conversations between citizens.2"
"5","We derive our hypotheses from two distinct, albeit related, research programs: psychologically oriented scholarship on interpersonal conversations, and framing and theoretical work on deliberation. We begin with the former by drawing on three empirical findings. First, we build on research demonstrating that framing effects can occur via interpersonal discussions (Gamson 1992; Simon and Xenos 2000; Walsh 2001, 2003). For example, Walsh (2001, 2003) shows that people embedded in discussion networks (e.g., in voluntary associations) base various policy attitudes on their social characteristics (e.g., race, income) to a greater extent than those not in the networks. The critical point is that the frames or considerations on which people base their political opinions need not come from elites, but can in fact come from conversations with others.         "
"6","Second, research on interpersonal communication shows that the composition of the discussion group affects the group's impact; of particular importance is the extent to which the group includes people with opposing views (i.e., a cross‐cutting group) (see, e.g., Mutz and Martin 2001; Mutz 2002a, 2002b). For example, Mutz (2002a) finds that exposure to different viewpoints in cross‐cutting groups causes individuals to have greater awareness of rationales for alternative perspectives (also see Huckfeldt, Morehouse, and Osborn n.d.).2 This can result in changed attitudes or in the strengthening of existing attitudes depending on how one cognitively responds to the contrary information (Sieck and Yates 1997; Petty and Wegener 1998, 332–3). In contrast, relatively homogenous groups lead to group polarization where “an initial tendency of individual group members toward a given direction is enhanced following group discussion” (Isenberg 1986, 1141; also see Paese, Bieser, and Tubbs 1993; Mendelberg 2002, 159).         "
"7","Third, as mentioned, how people treat contrary information they receive from relatively cross‐cutting groups depends on how they cognitively respond. Sniderman and Theriault (n.d.) provide insight into how people respond in the context of framing effects. Sniderman and Theriault exposed survey respondents either to one of two frames (e.g., a free‐speech or public‐safety frame for a hate‐group rally) or to both frames. They find a classic framing effect for participants exposed to just one frame (e.g., the free‐speech frame causes increased support for the rally). However, they also find that the elite framing effect disappears among participants exposed to both frames; these individuals return to their original (unframed) opinions. This implies that relatively cross‐cutting conversations, that provide people with rationales for both frames, will result in the muting of the initial elite frame. Similarly, Vinokur and Burnstein (1978) find that when two equal‐sized groups with conflicting opinions interact, the groups' opinions converge toward one another (i.e., their initial conflicting opinions disappear; also see Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954, 120; Cohen 1997; Huckfeldt, Morehouse, and Osborn n.d.). This is depolarization.         "
"8","In sum, the frames on which people base their political opinions not only come from elites but also from interpersonal conversations. When these conversations include mostly common perspectives, we expect polarization—a strengthening of the initial elite frames and thus more extreme opinions. Alternatively, relatively cross‐cutting conversations that include a wider variety of views will provide individuals with an understanding of alternative frames resulting in a vitiation of the initial frames, rendering them ineffectual (i.e., depolarization)."
"9","Importantly, these hypotheses echo arguments in deliberative theory that focus on the implications of citizens' conversations for democratic governance. Mendelberg explains that a “variety of recent developments, political and academic, have sparked [an] interest in democratic deliberation…[and while] there is no single definition [of deliberation] on which all theorists of deliberation agree… deliberation is expected to produce a variety of positive democratic outcomes” (2002, 151, 153). One focus concerns the consequences of deliberation among conflicting individuals. As Mill argues, “since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied” (1859, 53; also see Habermas 1989; Benhabib 1992; Kinder and Herzog 1993, 349).2"
"10","This highlights our critical distinction between cross‐cutting and noncross‐cutting conversations; it also raises an intriguing question about what constitutes the “truth” supposedly produced by cross‐cutting conversations. Insofar as elite framing effects suggest manipulation (e.g., Zaller 1992, 45; Farr 1993, 386; Parenti 1999; however, see Druckman 2001c), then cross‐cutting conversations might attenuate the effects, reconstituting relative truth. While this mimics our cross‐cutting hypothesis, it also raises a host of questions, which we will address, about the quality of framed versus unframed opinions and the role of deliberation in producing quality opinions. Indeed, as will become clear, our study has intriguing implications for the burgeoning literature on democratic deliberation.         "
"11","In addition to exploring the effects of interpersonal discussion on framing, we build on prior conflicting results to clarify which individuals exhibit more susceptibility to elite framing effects (see Druckman 2001c, 241–5). We begin by noting that framing effects, like other media effects such as priming, tend to work through memory‐based processes (Nelson and Willey 2001, 255). In expressing their opinions, individuals draw on the information that comes to mind, including the frames to which they were recently exposed. For example, when asked for their opinions about the Ku Klux Klan's right to rally, individuals who just received a news‐story framing the rally in terms of free speech will recall and rely on the frame, thereby attaching increased importance to free‐speech considerations (Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997; Nelson and Willey 2001).2"
"12","This contrasts with an on‐line process where individuals access and report a previously formed opinion based on a steady stream of information over‐time (instead of constructing the opinion on information in memory at the time of expression). Frames could affect such an on‐line process; yet, most studies, at least implicitly, presume that the frame individuals just received affects them to the extent that it does because there is not a prior on‐line opinion waiting to be expressed. Attitudes formed on‐line “have a great deal of inertia… so new pieces of information [e.g., a recent frame] have only a small impact on them. Therefore, recent news media content [e.g., a frame] would be expected to have relatively little effect…[if attitudes were formed on‐line instead of memory‐based]” (Krosnick and Brannon 1993, 965).         "
"13","Based largely on the memory‐based model, Nelson, Oxley, and Clawson (1997) argue that media frames will have a greater effect on more knowledgeable people because only these individuals can connect the considerations put forth in the frame with their overall opinions and also weigh the importance of these considerations. Making an analogous argument about media priming, Krosnick and Brannon explain that “the more knowledge one has about politics, the more quickly and easily one can make sense of a news story and the more efficiently one can store it in, and retrieve it from, an elaborate and organized mental filing system” (1993, 966; also see Miller and Krosnick 2000, 303–4). As McGraw and Ling state, “knowledge… facilitates the learning and use of new information…” (n.d., 5).         "
"14","The potential problem with this theory, however, is that some studies find the opposite—that frames have a greater impact on the less knowledgeable (e.g., Kinder and Sanders 1990; Haider‐Markel and Joslyn 2001; also Jacoby 2000, 758, finds no effect). These authors argue that less knowledgeable people possess fewer strongly held prior opinions (and frames) and thus exhibit increased susceptibility (e.g., Kinder and Sanders 1990, 90).         "
"15","We believe both arguments are correct—knowledge facilitates the use of new frames, and individuals who possess prior opinions will exhibit less susceptibility to new frames. The problem with past work is that while individuals with prior opinions may be more knowledgeable, it is not the knowledge per se that is at work; rather, it is the existence of prior opinions based on other information that vitiates the impact of a new frame. Thus, we assert that elite frames will exhibit a greater impact on more knowledgeable individuals, and a smaller impact on individuals more likely to have prior opinions. We suspect that previous conflicting results come from a failure to control for both these moderators (Krosnick and Brannon 1993).         "
"16","How can we measure a tendency to have prior opinions? We have a strong theoretical basis that the construct “need to evaluate” (NE) captures this process (Jarvis and Petty 1996). High‐NE individuals “more chronically [evaluate] various aspects of their lives and environments” (Bizer et al. 2000, 7). Relative to low‐NE processors, high‐NE processors form more opinions and base their opinions on a steady flow of information over time rather than recent salient information (Bizer et al. 2000, 21). This is analogous to the aforementioned discussion of on‐line processing. Tormala and Petty explain that low‐NE individuals “are relatively more dependent on the information they can recall at the time the judgment is required [e.g., information just seen in a frame]” (2001, 1609).         "
"17","In short, we hypothesize that, regardless of political‐knowledge levels, high‐NE individuals will be more likely to possess prior opinions (and frames) based on information over time. As a result, high‐NE individuals will be less affected by new, recent information from elite frames. By incorporating NE as an individual‐level moderator, we not only expect to provide clarity to the framing literature, but we also will demonstrate the importance of a nonpolitical construct to political processing (see Bizer et al. 2000). Additionally, we introduce what we suspect to be a fundamental but never before directly examined moderator of political communication.         "
"18","A final issue concerns the longevity of framing effects. Many studies demonstrate that elite frames can have substantial immediate effects on opinions; however, we have no idea how long these effects last (Kuklinski et al. 2000, 811).2 Do these effects reflect anything more than temporary changes in reported opinions? Overall, understanding individual‐level moderators and the longevity of framing effects will further inform us about the robustness of the effects.         "
"19","We study framing effects by examining opinions about campaign finance reform. We do so because it is politically relevant, has received scant academic attention, involves fundamental democratic values, and is representative of a host of issues."
"20","Campaign finance reform persists as a major political issue due in large part to the efforts of Senators McCain and Feingold. In March, 2002, Congress passed the McCain‐Feingold reform bill; the law prohibits national parties from collecting or using soft money which is the unrestricted contributions by corporations, unions, and individuals. Despite the new law, debates about campaign finance will undoubtedly continue with a focus on implementation and other related regulations (Oppel 2002). While descriptive polls consistently show that the majority of Americans support campaign finance reform (72% in a February 2002 Gallup poll), there continues to be little scholarship on the origins and nature of campaign finance reform opinions (however see Gross and Brewer 2002; Grant and Rudolph 2003).         "
"21","Aside from political relevance and the need for more research, we have an interest in campaign finance reform opinions because the issue pits two basic values against one another. Since court rulings in the 1970s, reform advocates frame the issue in terms of limiting the power of special interests (i.e., democratic equality). Opponents of reform argue that finance laws unconstitutionally restrict free speech (Grant and Rudolph 2003).2 How citizens settle the clash between values is a fundamental question for public opinion scholars (Sniderman et al. 1996), and framing can be a large part of that process (Sniderman and Theriault n.d.). Moreover, from a framing perspective, campaign finance reform opinions resemble many other issues that pit basic values/considerations against one another (Nelson and Kinder 1996, 1058; Jacoby 2000, 764). We thus expect that our results generalize beyond campaign finance reform.         "
"22","To investigate framing and interpersonal conversations in the context of campaign finance reform, we implemented a laboratory experiment—one of the central modes of inquiry in the framing literature. We next describe our experimental design and hypotheses. We then present the results."
"23","A total of 261 individuals participated in the experiment in exchange for a cash payment. We recruited participants from a large public university, inviting them to take part in a study on learning from the news at the university's Political Psychology Laboratory, during the spring of 2001.2 We randomly assigned participants to one of seven conditions. Those assigned to the control condition neither read an article nor engaged in any discussion; they simply completed the questionnaire, described below. The treatment participants received either a “free‐speech” framed article or a “special‐interests” framed article.            "
"24","The articles, which appear in the Appendix, both describe the McCain‐Feingold reform bill and state that the bill is pending in the U.S. Senate. They explain that reform supporters argue that the bill will limit special‐interest influence while opponents worry about free‐speech violations. The articles differ from one another in two ways. Specifically, the free‐speech article uses a title that emphasizes free‐speech considerations and includes a quote from a Harvard law professor who argues for the precedence of free‐speech considerations (citing the Supreme Court's Buckley v. Valeo opinion). The special‐interests article has an analogous title and quote but instead of free speech, it focuses on limiting special interests (citing Supreme Court Justice White's opinion).            "
"25","We went to great lengths to make these articles appear realistic. First, in writing the articles, we drew extensively on recent similar reports. Second, we presented the articles as if they came from the New York Times' Web site. We copied an actual article from the site and then replaced the original text with our text—thus, the articles appeared identical to articles from the site. Third, our experiment began about a week after the Senate introduced the McCain‐Feingold bill, and we finished the sessions before the Senate debate began. The articles thus accurately stated that the Senate would soon be considering McCain‐Feingold. Moreover, a flurry of media coverage preceded our sessions but ended just before our first session and did not begin again until after our last session. Therefore, the articles nicely followed prior media coverage, and we did not have to worry about ongoing coverage jeopardizing comparisons across sessions. This greatly enhanced the external validity of our timing and context (Cook and Campbell 1979, 71).2"
"26","Aside from assigning treatment participants to read a free‐speech or special‐interests article, we also assigned them to one of three conversational conditions—a “no‐discussion” group, an “unmixed” discussion group, or a “mixed” discussion group. The no‐discussion group participants read the articles and did not engage in discussion, while the unmixed and mixed discussion participants took part in small group discussions after reading an article. (We describe the difference between unmixed and mixed groups below.)            "
"27","We put considerable time into determining how to structure these discussions. First, to maintain manageably sized groups that also had a mix of opinions, we included four participants in nearly all groups. (We used a few groups of three, but their behavior did not significantly differ from the groups of four.) Second, we attempted to balance realistic discussion settings with characteristics of deliberative settings that typically require citizens “address each other as equals and acknowledge this status by offering reasonable, morally justifiable arguments to each other” (Sanders 1997, 348). We provided a moderate degree of structure by offering (in a random order) each participant, after reading the article, an equal opportunity to state his or her view. We then allowed unfacilitated open discussion for up to six minutes (see Stasser and Titus 1985; Tindale, Sheffey, and Scott 1993). We permitted each participant to pass on stating his or her individual view and told participants that they could discuss any aspect of the article or anything else.            "
"28","Participants in the discussion groups read the article and then took part in either an unmixed frame or a mixed frame discussion. In the unmixed frame discussion groups, all participants had read the same article—either the free‐speech or special‐interests article. The mixed frame discussions included two participants who had read the free‐speech article and two participants who had read the special‐interests article (see Vinokur and Burnstein 1978). For the sake of brevity, we hereafter refer to these as the unmixed and mixed discussants, respectively.            "
"29","We expect that, entering the discussions, the unmixed discussants, on average, will share the same point of view to a greater extent than the mixed discussants. Indeed, these participants all received the same elite frame (and, as we will show, these frames had an impact on the no‐discussion participants). Alternatively, we expect mixed discussants, on average, to be exposed to a greater variety of views since these groups include participants who received different frames. The unmixed groups were thus relatively homogenous, while the mixed groups were relatively cross‐cutting."
"30","In accordance with our prior discussion, we predict that the unmixed (relatively homogenous) group will cause polarization such that the initial elite frames will be exaggerated, while the mixed (relatively cross‐cutting) groups will depolarize, and the impact of the elite frames will be squelched.2"
"31","To summarize, we assigned each participant to either the control group or one of six treatment conditions—which varied the elite frame received (free speech or special interests) and the type of subsequent discussion (no‐discussion, unmixed discussion, or mixed discussion). After completing this part of the study, each participant received a questionnaire. In addition to common demographic queries—including political knowledge and need to evaluate (NE) measures—we included three items to measure elite framing effects (Nelson and Oxley 1999).2"
"32","First, we asked participants if they support passage of the McCain‐Feingold campaign finance reform bill, which was the main focus of the article and discussion. We measured this overall opinion question on a seven‐point scale with higher scores indicating increased support. Second, participants rated how important the key ideas of “protecting free speech rights of individuals and groups” and “protecting government from excessive influence by special interests” were for them when they thought about McCain‐Feingold.2 We measured these belief‐importance items on seven‐point scales with higher scores indicating increased perceived importance. Third, we included belief‐content measures that asked participants if they thought the impact of reform would have a positive or negative effect on “free‐speech rights” and “limiting special‐interest influence.” Higher scores on a one‐to‐seven scale indicate a more positive effect from reform.            "
"33","In evaluating elite framing effects, we follow Nelson and his colleagues by focusing on between frame comparisons of the overall opinion and belief importance measures (e.g., Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997; Nelson and Oxley 1999; Nelson and Willey 2001). We say an elite framing effect occurs if, within a discussion condition (i.e., no‐discussion, unmixed, or mixed), compared to participants who read the free‐speech article, participants who read the special‐interests article exhibit significantly greater support for reform; rate influence by special interests as significantly more important; and rate free‐speech rights as significantly less important. Moreover, we expect the effect of the frames on overall opinion to be mediated by the belief‐importance measures. Finally, consistent with Nelson and his colleagues, we predict that elite framing effects will have no or minimal effect on the belief‐content measures (Nelson and Oxley 1999, 1043; Nelson and Willey 2001, 260); we include content measures to demonstrate that framing works through a mechanism that is distinct from persuasion.2"
"34","We thus expect an elite framing effect for the no‐discussion participants (i.e., this would replicate prior framing effect experiments), an even greater elite framing effect for the unmixed discussion participants (i.e., the conversations exaggerate the initial elite frames), and no elite framing effect for the mixed discussion participants. We summarize these predictions, by treatment condition, in Table 1.2 Recall that we also will examine the mediating role of belief importance, the moderating effects of knowledge and NE, and the longevity of the effects.            "
"35","In Table 2, we report the results for overall opinion, belief importance, and belief content (i.e., the impact measures) for each condition. Within each discussion (treatment) condition, we use asterisks to indicate the significance levels between statistically significant results.2"
"36","We also include the control group results as a point of comparison. Our main analyses do not involve comparisons with the control group, however, since our focus—like that of virtually all prior research—is on how alternative elite communications affect opinions (e.g., Tversky and Kahneman 1981; Kinder and Sanders 1990; Nelson and Kinder 1996; Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997, 578–9). We will, nevertheless, note comparisons with the control group as it serves as an alternative and underappreciated evaluative standard that reveals the impact of frames on unadulterated opinions (Druckman 2001a, 2001b, 1048).            "
"37","As expected, we find strong evidence for an elite framing effect for the no‐discussion group participants—compared to free‐speech participants, special‐interests participants displayed significantly more support for McCain‐Feingold, and rated special interests as a significantly more important and free speech as a significantly less important consideration (t76= 2.01, p < .03; t76= 1.53, p < .07; t76= 1.92, p < .03, respectively). The free‐speech article also persuaded participants to believe the impact on free speech would be significantly more negative; this belief‐content effect does not mitigate the more substantial framing effects, but rather it suggests that the articles have multiple effects (i.e., framing and persuasion; see Nelson and Oxley 1999).            "
"38","We also see an elite framing effect for the unmixed discussion group with the special‐interests participants expressing more support for McCain‐Feingold and rating special interests as more important, than the free‐speech participants (t67= 1.59, p < .06; t67= 1.68, p < .05, respectively). We find no significant effects on the free‐speech consideration or the belief‐content measures. Counter to the polarization hypothesis, we find no evidence of an exaggerated elite framing effect—an ANOVA shows no significant frame x discussion interaction (in the expected direction) that would indicate an exaggerated effect.2 This analysis also reveals that the discussions themselves did not have significant effects on how the elite frames were processed (i.e., there are no significant discussion main effects). In short, elite framing persists largely unchanged in the face of discussions that include mostly common perspectives.            "
"39","We suspect that the lack of a polarization effect stems from the fact that, as discussed (see note 11), while these groups were presumably homogenous relative to the mixed groups, they may not have been perfectly homogenous. The occasional participant could have been unaffected by the article and entered the discussion with an opposing view that was sufficient to prevent further polarization, but not sufficient to generate the depolarization predicted with the relatively more cross‐cutting mixed groups. It also may be that the measurement delay due to the discussions even caused a slight waning of a short‐lived framing effect."
"40","The story changes when we look at the mixed discussion participants. Table 2 shows no significant framing effects for these participants; as predicted, these cross‐cutting conversations eliminate elite framing effects.2 In fact, the mixed discussion participants' level of support for McCain‐Feingold and their belief‐importance responses do not differ significantly from the control groups' responses.2 This corroborates Sniderman and Theriault's (n.d.) claim that, when exposed to conflicting frames, people return to their original or unaffected positions as reflected by the control group (also see Huckfeldt, Morehouse, and Osborn n.d.).2 This finding also resonates with the aforementioned theoretical work on deliberation. The “collision of adverse opinions” in the mixed group altered opinions by eliminating the elite framing effect. The question of whether this is akin to restoring “truth” (Mill 1859) is something to which we will return.            "
"41","Our results extend the study of framing effects into a new issue domain by showing the conventional effect in the no‐discussion group. We also find that conversations that include common perspectives (with people who were exposed to the same frame) do little to the initial elite effect. However, conversations that include conflicting perspectives (with people who received different frames) eliminate elite influence via framing. In sum, in the political world where people receive and then discuss elite information, conversations can limit elite influence—but only if those conversations involve cross‐cutting groups or individuals exposed to alternative arguments.2"
"42","We next examine the mediational process of elite framing by using the same path‐analytic approach as Nelson and his colleagues (Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997; Nelson and Oxley 1999). In Figure 1, we present separate path analyses for the no‐discussion, unmixed, and mixed discussion groups.2 For both the no‐discussion and unmixed discussion groups, the frame shaped the belief importance ratings, which in turn substantially affected overall opinions. In contrast, the frames had minimal impact on the content measures and even when they did (in the no‐discussion condition), this effect did not carry through to overall opinions. In both groups, the frame had no direct effect on overall opinions suggesting that elite framing works by affecting belief importance (and not content) that in turn drives overall opinions.            "
"43","                 Mediational Analyses                         "
"44"," Figure 1c shows that for the mixed group, the frame had no effect on any of the measures; overall opinion was shaped by the belief importance and content measures, but the frame played no role. These results corroborate Nelson and his colleagues' research that shows that framing works through belief importance and as such constitutes a unique psychological process (see note 14). The results also confirm our finding that cross‐cutting conversations limit the impact of elite frames, highlighting the importance of moving the study of elite influence out of a social vacuum and into settings with informational competition.            "
"45","In so doing, future work would benefit from examining information flows more acutely. For example, Figure 1 shows that in the no‐discussion conditions, the frames affected belief content, which in turn had no impact on McCain‐Feingold opinions. In contrast, in both discussion groups, the frames did not influence belief content but belief content shaped McCain‐Feingold opinions. While this does not have consequences for our framing results, it suggests that the conversations introduced distinct dynamics. It may also further explain our failure to find polarization—that is, the conversations did not appear to simply reiterate the elite frames.2"
"46","We next examine individual moderators of framing effects. As discussed, we introduce a new and potentially fundamental moderator—need to evaluate (NE); we expect high‐NE individuals to be less susceptible to framing effects. We also examine the role of political knowledge, hypothesizing that increased knowledge facilitates framing effects (once controlling for NE)."
"47","We took three steps to investigate the impact of these moderators. First, we merged data from the no‐discussion and unmixed discussion groups since the aforementioned (ANOVA) results suggest no significant differences between the two groups (see note 17). Moreover, when we separate out these conditions and run the analyses (below) separately, we find that the results for each condition generally mimic the results for the conditions run together. We do not include the mixed discussion groups since we neither expected nor found (in analyses not reported here) moderating effects—indeed, there were no framing effects to moderate."
"48","Second, we created measures of political knowledge and NE. In creating a knowledge measure, we followed Miller and Krosnick's (2000, 304–5) approach of combining five general‐knowledge items with five domain‐specific knowledge questions about campaign finance reform. We summed correct answers to these questions and then used a median split to assign respondents to a low (0) or a high (1) knowledge group. Our NE measure comes from Bizer et al.'s (2000, 14–5) three‐item scale.2 We aggregated the three questions and then used a median split to create a low (0) and a high (1) NE group.2"
"49","Third, to analyze the moderating effects, we focused on our three key framing variables—overall opinion about McCain‐Feingold, free‐speech importance, and special‐interests importance. We regressed each measure on a dummy variable indicating if the participants received the free‐speech article (0) or the special‐interests article (1). We then added dummy variables for knowledge and NE; these coefficients reveal if those with high knowledge or high NE differed in their opinions (regardless of the frame) from those in the low groups. More importantly, we added interactions between the frame and the knowledge and NE measures. Significant coefficients here indicate if the framing effect differed based on levels of knowledge and/or NE. We present the results in Table 3.            "
"50","Consistent with our expectations, the results show that it is those with higher levels of knowledge who exhibit relatively more susceptibility to elite framing effects. Specifically, significant and positive frame × political knowledge interactions for McCain‐Feingold and special‐interests importance show that the frame exercised its effect particularly on those with high knowledge. This supports the argument that political knowledge facilitates the use of frames by allowing individuals to make sense of and connect the framed information to their opinions. It also suggests that, although elites may attempt to use framing to manipulate an unknowing and naïve populace, it is knowledgeable people who are relatively more apt to use the frames (see Miller and Krosnick 2000, 312).            "
"51","More importantly, we find strong evidence that NE plays a substantial role in moderating framing effects. The frame × NE interaction is significant across all three regressions, indicating, in each case, that high‐NE individuals move (relatively) against the elite framing effect (i.e., recall that the frame variable is coded 1 for special interests). Elite frames have considerably more influence on low‐NE individuals; that is, individuals who engage in less chronic evaluation and who are less likely to possess prior opinions (and frames) display relatively more reliance on the recently received frames."
"52","We do not see our NE result as adding yet another variable to the list of potential moderators; rather, we believe NE constitutes a fundamental moderator of framing and media effects more generally. High‐NE individuals who engage in frequent evaluation will form more opinions on which they can draw. As a result, new information contained in elite messages will not have as large an effect on their opinions—relative to low‐NE individuals who will be more reliant on the messages in constructing their opinions. We also believe that previous conflicting results on the role of knowledge stem, in large part, from a failure to measure NE.2 We hope that future work will include the NE measure, examining it along with knowledge across various issues and types of effects.            "
"53","We also examine the longevity of framing effects. We implemented a follow‐up survey ten days after the initial experiment—over which time the major local newspapers made no mention of campaign finance reform. We focus exclusively on the no‐discussion and unmixed‐discussion participants since these participants exhibited initial effects—do these initial effects endure? We again combine these two groups, as treating them separately yields the same results."
"54","In Table 4, we display the results for our three main framing measures for the participants who responded to the follow‐up.2 The results for each measure move in the direction of a framing effect, but none are significant. The elite framing effect disappeared after ten days even in the virtual absence of other elite information. This is intriguing insofar as no other study has examined the longevity of framing effects, and these results suggest that the effects—at least when it comes to certain issues—may be fleeting. Not only does this bring the robustness of framing effects into question, but it also adds an interesting dynamic to debates about the nature of attitudes. Do short‐lived framing effects suggest slight blips in enduring initial attitudes, or do the effects reflect extreme instability?            "
"55","Most previous work on framing effects involves exposing experimental or survey participants to a single frame and then immediately gauging their response with no alternative forms of information available. Using this approach, scholars have documented numerous framing effects, leading some to view the effects as highly robust and pervasive (e.g., Zaller 1992; Entman and Herbst 2001). In this article, we have enhanced the external validity of the typical framing study by incorporating three dynamics common to many political settings: (1) interpersonal conversations, (2) individual heterogeneity, and (3) over‐time change. We also have extended the study of framing effects to the hotly contested issue of campaign finance reform.         "
"56","Our results highlight the conditional and potentially short‐lived impact of elite framing. Our most important finding concerns the role of cross‐cutting interpersonal discussions in limiting framing effects. Interpersonal conversations permeate the political world, and a failure to consider their moderating impact can lead to misleading conclusions about unilateral elite influence (also see Mendelsohn 1996). We also document individual heterogeneity in elite framing effects by introducing a new and potentially powerful moderator—need to evaluate. Low‐NE individuals and those who are highly knowledgeable appear more susceptible to elite framing effects. Finally, we offer evidence about the short time horizon of elite influence. All of this suggests a more limited impact for elites than is often thought."
"57","We believe, however, that elite framing effects do regularly occur and have important consequences—as we have shown, they are simply conditional. We find that conversations that include mostly common perspectives do not moderate elite framing effects, and individuals tend to engage in such conversations to a greater extent than cross‐cutting discussions (Mutz and Martin 2001; Mutz 2002a, 115; Walsh 2003; however, also see Huckfeldt, Morehouse, and Osborn n.d.). Moreover, we continue to have little idea about the impact of alternative discussion formats—including more informal discussions, discussions that include various mixes of opinions, and discussions that both precede and then follow elite framing attempts on different issues (see Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2002). We need a deeper understanding of the processes by which different forms of influence work (e.g., how adept are individuals at judging the credibility of elites and other citizens?) (see Huckfeldt 2001; Lupia 2002b).2 The important point is that future work on preference formation should consider the simultaneous and competing effects of elite rhetoric and interpersonal discussions.         "
"58","Finally, what do our results reveal about deliberation and democracy? As discussed, theorists often emphasize the salubrious effects of cross‐cutting deliberation (e.g., Mill 1859, 53). Deliberation is said, for example, to increase engagement, tolerance, and justification for individuals' opinions (Mendelberg 2002, 153). Ultimately, opinions formed via deliberation with conflicting perspectives should better capture the “will of the people” by ensuring quality opinions that approximate truth, reasonableness, and rationality (Mill 1859, 23; Dewey 1927, 208; Kinder and Herzog 1993, 349; Benhabib 1996, 71; Bohman 1998, 401; Fishkin 1999, 283; Dryzek 2000, 55; Mendelberg 2002, 180; however, also see, e.g., Sanders 1997).         "
"59","While our deliberative setting may not have been ideal, our mixed discussion results could be construed as showing that deliberation enhances opinion quality—it eliminates elite framing influence that some see as akin to manipulation (Zaller 1992, 45; Farr 1993; Parenti 1999; Entman and Herbst 2001, 207). In our case, then, deliberation enhances opinion quality if opinions affected by elite frames are indeed of lower quality than unaffected opinions (i.e., since the mixed discussion opinions resemble unaffected control‐group opinions). However, we have no basis for assuming relatively higher quality of unaffected opinions, especially since they seem so easily moved by elite frames (Kuklinski et al. 2000, 811). On the flip side, one could argue that deliberation has negative consequences with the framed opinions possessing higher quality (Druckman 2001c); yet, this begs the question of why these opinions also do not last (i.e., our longevity analysis; although is stability even desirable?).         "
"60","A deliberative theorist might argue that the appropriate standard would have been the opinions of participants who deliberated without prior exposure to elite frames. While we agree future work should include this condition, we also recognize the circularity of arguing that deliberative processes enhance opinion quality where opinion quality is defined as the product of deliberation (Bohman 1998).2 In sum, our results accentuate the importance of developing an independent standard by which to evaluate the quality or truthfulness of opinions. While this is certainly challenging, it also is necessary if we are to assess the democratic consequences of elite influence and deliberation.         "
