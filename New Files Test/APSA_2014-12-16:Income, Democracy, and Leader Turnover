"1","Here I show there is a clear relationship between income and democracy, but that it is stronger in the medium than short run, and much stronger shortly after leader turnover. For national income, I use the latest estimates of Maddison and collaborators (Maddison 2010).9 The main dependent variable is the Polity2 index (Polity IV data set, 2009 version), rescaled to range from 0 (pure autocracy) to 1 (pure democracy). This measures the openness and competitiveness of political participation and executive recruitment, along with constraints on the executive. Besides this indicator of the level of democracy, I show regressions in the supporting information for two measures of transitions to democracy, one using a dichotomous variable constructed by Boix, Miller, and Rosato (2013), the other capturing just upward Polity2 movements.         "
"2","To explore how medium‐ and short‐run effects differ, I constructed panels at different frequencies—annual, 5‐year, 10‐year, 15‐year, and 20‐year panels. As in Acemoglu et al. (2008, 2009) and Boix (2011), the panels contain observations from every fifth year for the 5‐year panel, and so on, starting in 1820. Also following Acemoglu et al. (2008, 2009) and Boix (2011), regressions include the lagged dependent variable to capture persistence in democracy, reduce serial correlation, and pick up any tendency to revert to the mean. Where relevant, I calculate the cumulative effect.10"
"3","My basic model is identical to that in Acemoglu et al. (2008):            "
"4","I focus on this model for several reasons (and show alternatives in the supporting information). First, Acemoglu et al. (2008, 2009) argue persuasively that including country and year fixed effects to capture unobserved heterogeneity and common shocks is vital given the strong time dependence in democratization and large differences in country characteristics. Even in democracy regressions with numerous controls, country and year fixed effects prove highly significant; omitting them risks serious bias. Second, since Acemoglu et al. claim that, including country fixed effects, income no longer correlates with democracy, it is appropriate to use their model when questioning their conclusions.         "
"5","Table 2, panel A, estimates this model for 1960–2000. As in Acemoglu et al. (2008, 2009), income is insignificant, with cumulative impact close to zero. This is true at all panel frequencies. Panel B includes all observations from 1820 (the first year with income data) to 2008. I also restrict attention to countries that start the given panel period as nondemocracies (i.e., Polity2 < 6 in the previous period; the Polity team treats +6 as democracy's lower bound). This is important for two reasons. First, the factors that promote democratization may differ from those that sustain democracy (Przeworski et al. 2000; Rustow 1970). It makes sense to analyze democracies and authoritarian states separately, and I focus here on what causes nondemocracies to liberalize. Second, besides theoretical concerns, there is a practical problem in using the full Polity2 scale as dependent variable. Countries that reach a perfect 10—18% during the 20th century—cannot rise higher, however much they modernize. Not adjusting for censoring at the top risks biasing estimates of income's influence downward (Benhabib, Corvalan, and Spiegel 2011). Now a new pattern emerges: In the 10‐, 15‐, and 20‐year panels, income is significantly positive. The cumulative effect rises as panel frequency falls, reaching .25 for 20‐year data.         "
"6","Table A1 in the supporting information shows results are similar if one drops interpolated income data (panel A); uses transitions to democracy rather than levels (panels B and C); excludes just perfect democracies (those for which Polity2t‐1 = 10; panel D); uses the estimator of Alan, Honoré, and Leth‐Petersen (2008), which allows for censoring at the top and bottom while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, as in Benhabib, Corvalan, and Spiegel (2011; panel E); and uses Arellano and Bond's dynamic generalized method of moments estimator (panel F).11"
"7","These checks reinforce the finding. If one extends data before 1945, and especially if one focuses on nondemocracies and adjusts for censoring, higher income correlates significantly with political liberalization. In failing to detect a relationship in annual data—and sometimes 5‐year panels—these results echo Acemoglu et al. (2008, 2009). In finding one in lower frequency panels, they match Boix (2011) and Benhabib, Corvalan, and Spiegel (2011).         "
"8","The new point I emphasize is that the income‐democracy link is strongest in the medium run—panels of 10–20 years. Year on year, measures of democracy usually change little: The coefficient on lagged democracy in 1‐year panels is close to one. But as the gap between observations increases, the coefficient falls; in 20‐year panels, it is near zero or negative, suggesting regression to the mean. To predict how democratic a country will be next year, its current democracy level is definitive. But to forecast 20 years ahead, its income is far more informative.12 In most years, institutions are inertial. But in some, accumulated increases in income trigger bursts of political progress.         "
"9","What initiates reequilibration? There may be several factors. Here I focus on one. I argue that in nondemocracies, economic development affects politics mostly in periods after the ruler exits. Under a long‐serving dictator, society may grow more complex, bourgeois, educated, and autonomous without forcing political reform. Yet when the dictator departs—whether ousted in a revolution or dying peacefully in bed—political practices often converge with new socioeconomic realities. Leader turnover alone does not produce democracy: In poor countries, one dictator usually replaces another. Development alone only makes democracy more feasible; and, as I show later, in the short run, higher growth entrenches dictators. It is the combination of development and leader change that increases the odds of political reform."
"10","Table 2, panel C, shows evidence. I use an interaction term to examine whether income affects democracy differently when the leader has recently exited.13 Leadership data come from the Archigos data set (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009a, 2009b), covering all independent states between 1875 and 2004. A country's “leader” is “the person that de facto exercised power”—in general, the prime minister in parliamentary regimes, the president in presidential and mixed ones, and the communist party chairperson in communist states (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009b). As before, the dependent variable is rescaled Polity2, restricting attention to nondemocracies.         "
"11","Income now has a large effect after leader turnover (significant in 5‐ to 20‐year panels), and no effect at all if no leader exited. Figure 1 shows the predicted 1‐year change in rescaled Polity2 with and without leader change in the previous year. Figure 2 shows the difference between the predicted Polity2 changes with and without prior leader exit.14"

"18","Model 16 suggests one mechanism by which development stimulates liberalization. As countries develop, citizens become better educated, which increases their desire to participate politically, their capacity to organize, and their tolerance (Barro 1999; Glaeser et al. 2004; Lipset 1959; Przeworski et al. 2000). It may also reduce inequality and accelerate growth, indirectly facilitating democratization. However, Acemoglu et al. (2005) argue that country and year fixed effects eliminate the relationship between education and democracy. For education, I use estimates of average years of schooling among those 15 and older (Morrisson and Murtin 2009). The effect of education—insignificant without leader turnover—is larger and significant after leader exit.15"
"19","In the supporting information, I show one gets similar results using an error correction model to estimate the equilibrium relationship between income and democracy to which the system heads in post‐turnover years (SI Table A4). A doubling of GDP per capita increases the equilibrium value of rescaled Polity2 by about .18. I also discuss various other possible estimation strategies, explaining why the one shown here better suits the question at hand."
"20","The effect of income, conditional on leader change, is quite robust to controlling for other possible determinants of regime type—democracy in neighbors, trade dependence, mineral wealth, authoritarian subtype, political history, previous transitions, past violent leader changes, and war or civil war (SI Table A7). Some controls correlate with democracy, as previously suggested; others do not correlate in this demanding setting. All at most slightly weaken the estimated impact of income conditional on leader turnover, and quite often the effect increases.16 Various scholars have studied the role that elections play in authoritarian regimes (for a review, see Gandhi and Lust‐Okar 2009). Could it be elections that activate the impact of income on democracy, rather than leader turnover per se? In fact, controlling for the holding of legislative and executive elections, the effect of income interacted with leader change is even stronger, and the coefficients on the electoral dummies are negative (SI Table A7, column 5). As one might expect, leader turnover makes an even bigger difference in regimes without elections than in those with them. And in years without leader exit, elections do not cause democratization.         "
"21","So far I have established an interesting pattern. If nothing else, leader exit signals that the influence of income has been “switched on.” This helps explain why efforts to relate development to democracy produce sometimes conflicting results that are sensitive to period and lag structure. But is leader exit more than just a signal? Does a dictator's departure cause income to matter more? There are two threats to such inferences. First, democracy might increase leader turnover rather than the reverse. Second, some third factor might cause both democratization and leader change.         "
"22","Consider reverse causation. Of course, political liberalization—which generally involves holding competitive elections—itself often produces leader change. However, in such cases, we should expect leader turnover after or perhaps simultaneously with political reform. In the multiyear panels, when liberalization does occur I only code leader turnover as present if the leader turnover occurred strictly before some net increase in Polity2. It is implausible that such leader replacement was caused by reforms that it preceded. Another possible worry is that Polity coders simply take leader change as a sign of liberalization. In fact, as I show in the supporting information (p. 13), they clearly do not equate the two.         "
"23","One way to exclude reverse causation is to examine types of leader exit unlikely to result from domestic political processes. A good candidate is the dictator's peaceful death in office. Although everyone dies, the timing of death by natural causes usually has little to do with political or economic events. Indeed, previous work has used leaders’ natural deaths to statistically identify the effects of their actions. As Jones and Olken (2005) argue, in cases of natural death, the timing of leader turnover is “essentially random.”         "
"24","Table 3, column 1, shows the impact of income on the rescaled Polity2 change during the 10 years after a dictator's natural death. A decade later, countries with per capita GDP of $10,000 had increased their score by .19 more than had countries with income of $1,000. For comparison, column 2 shows the Polity2 change for all nondemocracy‐decades in which no leader died of natural causes. (Since a leader did generally exit in some other way, my argument predicts quite a strong relationship here as well.) Among these cases, a tenfold difference in income is associated with a .10 difference in Polity2. Finally, in decades with no leader turnover (column 3), political change was unrelated to income.17"
"25","This is quite strong evidence that—at least in some cases—leader change itself causes political reform, which, in richer countries, enhances democracy. Of course, not all leader exits result from natural deaths. Two other causes, although not necessarily random, are relatively external: defeat in war and international recession. Leader turnover during these is unlikely to reflect some purely domestic political process. (Of course, we still need to check whether recession and military defeat do not themselves cause democratization, absent leader exit.)         "
"26","Table 3, column 4, shows the impact of income on the Polity2 change in the decade after a leader exited during a global recession. For each country, i, I define a global recession as a year in which the average growth rate in all other countries, weighted by their recent share in trade with country i, is negative. Again, liberalization in such periods increases with the country's income. Income had a much smaller effect—if any—after global recessions that did not prompt leader turnover, and also in decades containing no years of global recession plus leader exit. When a leader departs amid military defeat, the Polity2 increase correlates very closely with income (column 7). (I exclude wars followed within 10 years by foreign occupation or imposition of a leader since occupation by a democratic power can obviously produce democracy.) In decades containing no year of military defeat plus leader exit, the income effect was much weaker, and there was no effect after military defeats that did not produce leader change.18"
"27","Besides reverse causation, some third factor might cause both leader turnover and subsequent democratization. To be clear, this does sometimes happen. After World War II, Germany's Allied occupiers both replaced its Nazi leaders and introduced democratic institutions. Pro‐democracy movements sometimes sweep away both ruler and regime. However, the evidence shows that such cases are not driving the results."
"28","Various country characteristics might cause them to change leaders frequently and—given modernization—to democratize. We can exclude these as a group. Table A10 in the supporting information shows that controlling for a country's recent rate of leader turnover (over 20, 10, or 5 years) and its interaction with income changes little. What matters is not that countries have a propensity to replace leaders: They must have just replaced one.         "
"29","I consider the following possible confounding factors. First, global recessions and military defeats prompt leader change that clearly does not result from domestic liberalization; but do these factors themselves cause richer countries to democratize? Kennedy (2010), for instance, showed that low economic growth predicts major institutional change, the direction of which depends on the country's income. Although I excluded cases where foreign victors imposed democracy, military defeat might itself incline richer countries to reform. Second, popular mobilization might both oust the ruler and install free institutions.19 Third, Miller (2012, 1002) argued that economic development affects democratization “only in distinctive periods of regime vulnerability.” State weakness provokes both violent leader turnover and—in more developed countries—liberalization. Fourth, certain subtypes of nondemocracy might be more susceptible to both leader turnover and reform.         "
"30","Do these factors prompt leader change? In nondemocracies, exit is more common in years of low economic growth or military defeat, and when the number of antigovernment demonstrations is high and rising (SI Table A12). Instrumenting for growth with trade‐weighted average growth in other countries suggests it has a causal impact. To capture state weakness, I use four indicators: the number of assassinations of high officials, incidence of guerrilla war, civil war, and “major government crisis,” defined as “any rapidly developing situation that threatens to bring the downfall of the present regime—excluding situations of revolt aimed at such overthrow” (Banks 2007).20 Leader turnover proves significantly more likely in years of civil war and government crisis. Finally, leaders change more frequently in military and personalist dictatorships than in monarchies or one‐party regimes.21"
"31","Might any of these factors be what activates income's influence? Table A13 in the supporting information uses interaction terms to check this. For each factor x, I compare the impact of income on democracy: (a) with x but no leader exit, (b) with x and leader exit, and (c) with leader exit but no x. Table 4 summarizes key results. Without leader exit, none of these factors triggers the income‐democracy relationship, except possibly civil war (not statistically significant). Economic contraction and military defeat seem to boost income's impact if they prompt leader change.22 Without these factors, the effect of income given leader exit—ranging from .10 to .16—remains comparable to the .12 found in Table 2. In short, although recession, military defeat, opposition mobilization, and state weakness may all make leader exit more likely—and some may enhance its impact—none can plausibly explain away its influence.23"
"32","Table A14 in the supporting information checks whether leader exit matters more in different authoritarian subtypes, using Geddes, Wright, and Frantz's data (2012; from 1945 on) and a coarser classification based on Banks (2007; from 1920 on). The multiple interactions push the data to the limit, but certain points emerge. Sensitivity to income after turnover appears weakest in monarchies and relatively strong in military and “other” nondemocracies (using Banks data), although the effect takes several years for military regimes. Among Geddes's categorizations, income matters most after a personalist dictator exits.         "
"33","Finally, Table A15 in the supporting information examines whether the mode of leader exit alters its influence. Recall that Miller (2012) associated democratization with violent leader change. In fact, I find results are most significant for regular, peaceful exits, and then deaths by natural causes. Violent leader replacements may sometimes foster democratization, but they are not driving the results.         "
"34","To recap, in nondemocracies, development is robustly associated with liberalization—but primarily after leaders exit. This is true after leaders die of natural causes, the timing of which is relatively exogenous, and also when leaders depart amid international recession or military defeat. Economic contraction, military defeat, popular mobilization, government crises, and civil war may prompt leader turnover and—in some cases—accentuate its impact, but they do not activate the income effect if the old ruler survives. The results are clearest for military and personalist dictatorships, and weakest for monarchies. Regular, peaceful transitions have a stronger effect than violent ones."
"35","Faster economic growth helps dictators survive (SI Table A12), but high income makes liberalization more likely after the leader exits (Table 2, SI Table A2). Combining these points, we see the autocrat's dilemma. Most dictators do not wish to undermine their regime—many hope to hand power securely to relatives or associates—yet self‐interest leads them to support gradual changes in the economy and society that eventually produce democratization. If shocks such as international recessions or world wars lead to ruler replacement in many countries simultaneously, this may help explain coordinated waves of liberalization in countries that have developed rapidly.24"
"36","Why does leader turnover temporarily activate the effects of development? How do long‐serving dictators block political change, despite economic and social modernization? Four sets of answers seem plausible. They concern the environments new leaders encounter, characteristics of entering leaders, their evolution in office, and selection via the filter of political survival."
"37","New leaders face a distinctive environment with threats from inside and outside. The previous dictator's departure often provokes a succession struggle. This can foster liberalization in several ways. Factions, when deadlocked, may settle on a power‐sharing arrangement organized as oligarchical democracy. The leader may appeal to outsiders for support, broadening participation. Over time, dictators who survive disempower rival factions, appointing loyalists to key positions (Svolik 2012). The turnover often provides a focal point for opposition mobilization, which the regime, internally divided, may have trouble repressing. In richer societies, this may produce political concessions or democratic revolution. Beset by factional conflict, military leaders may return to the barracks to restore cohesion.         "
"38","Besides encountering distinctive conditions, new leaders in modernizing autocracies differ from their predecessors. Some take power in popular revolutions. In poorer countries, revolutionaries tend to be nationalists, religious fundamentalists, communists, or authoritarian populists. In developed countries, they are sometimes democrats. Still, most democratizations do not coincide with popular mobilization.25 Even regime insiders appointed amid modernization will often have better education and more liberal values than their predecessors (Inglehart and Welzel 2005).         "
"39","Whatever their initial characteristics, leaders change in office. Most obviously, they grow older; studies correlate age with conservatism (Truett 1993). Seasoned leaders may be more risk‐averse and routine‐bound, new ones more activist and mistake‐prone. Over time, dictators may acquire an image of impregnability and perfect techniques of repression.         "
"40","Whether or not individual rulers change, selection will prune their ranks. Leaders who democratize or succumb to democratic revolution leave the pool of nondemocracies. Those remaining after some years will be tougher nuts to crack, less prone to liberalize however modern their society.26 Selection may also operate on regime types. Since military juntas are less averse to liberalization (Geddes 1999), fewer generals will remain among long‐serving dictators.         "
"41","Adjudicating among these mechanisms is no small task. Still, the data offer some hints. Consider the environment. As Figure A3.A in the supporting information shows, popular mobilization—whether antigovernment demonstrations, general strikes, riots, or attempted revolutions—tends to rise before leader transition, peak in the turnover year, and then fall. (No mobilization precedes rulers’ natural deaths, but—consistent with the focal point argument—demonstrations increase temporarily afterward; see SI Figure A3.B.) Does higher‐than‐average mobilization explain why income then influences liberalization? Whereas increased mobilization simultaneous with leader exit is associated with a strong (although not quite significant) income effect (.19, p = .14; Table 4), more demonstrations after leader exit predict no income effect at all (–.02, p = .88). Elite divisions might increase income's influence in the post‐turnover year—I lack data on these; popular mobilization apparently does not.         "
"42","That leaves change in characteristics of leaders (and regimes) and in the pool of survivors. How to assess the impact of selection? Suppose certain fixed characteristics of leaders or regimes—“selection characteristics”—render them less likely to democratize and lose office. Call leaders endowed with these “reactionaries,” those lacking them “reformers.” The proportion of reactionaries among leaders in office after T years will increase with T. A leader's total tenure can proxy for his or her position on the reformist‐reactionary scale. Interacting his or her tenure with national income, one can estimate the impact of selection on the income‐democratization relationship. Controlling for this, if income still influences liberalization more early on, this probably reflects change in individual leaders rather than selection.27"
"43","Estimations employing this strategy suggest selection is important. I regress Polity2 on its lag, income, the leader's total tenure, dummies for his current year in office, and all interactions of these three, plus country and year dummies.28 Since the many interaction terms are cumbersome, I present results graphically. The longer a leader serves, the less he reforms in any year of his term (Figure 3), and the less his decision depends on the country's income (Figure 4, showing effects in the first year). “Reactionaries” who survive 17 years do not respond to higher development even in their first year. However, selection is not everything. Even “reformist” leaders, selected out quickly, mostly respond to income in their first year (SI Figures A4.A–C).29"

"49","Source: See Table A18 in the supporting information.                     "
"50","On what characteristics does selection operate? Consider higher education. Even controlling for country and year, the share of leaders in nondemocracies with college degrees falls from 58% in their first year to 36% in their 30th. Additionally, college graduates liberalize more than others in richer nondemocracies (SI Table A16, column 1). At an income level of $1,000 a year, college‐educated dictators reform no more than uneducated ones; at $10,000, graduates increase Polity2 by .25 more."
"51","Another characteristic is democratic values. Little data exist on dictators’ psychology, but if individuals acquire lifelong orientations by early adulthood (Sears and Levy 2003) and social values track development (Inglehart and Welzel 2005), we might expect leaders’ attitudes to correlate with the development level in their youth. As a proxy, I use national income when the leader was 20. Controlling for country and year, the share of leaders who came of age in richer societies does decrease with tenure, consistent with selection out of those with modern values. Furthermore, those with more modern values reform more in richer nondemocracies (SI Table A16, column 2).30"
"52","Leaders last longer in certain authoritarian subtypes. Since 1945, military dictatorships have accounted for 16% of leaders in their first year, and 10% of those in their 10th. Military regimes liberalize more than others at most income levels, and the difference increases with the country's income (SI Table A16, column 3)."
"53","In short, in more developed autocracies, leaders with college degrees, who matured in modern societies, or who lead military dictatorships liberalize more and are selected out over time. Long‐serving autocrats more often have no higher education, hold premodern values, and lead one‐party, personalist, or monarchical regimes. Selection probably also operates on harder‐to‐measure traits—ruthlessness, guile—but those studied here help explain why seasoned dictators rarely reform.31"
"54","Finally, why do autocrats in richer countries who do reform tend to do so early (SI Figures A4.A–C)? As noted, this could result from intra‐elite competition associated with succession, or growing caution as new leaders acclimatize. In this connection, note that liberalization is not the only thing autocrats tend to do early. New dictators (but not democratic leaders) are also more likely to increase repression, make major constitutional changes, and even to initiate militarized interstate disputes (MIDs; see Table 5).32 Whether because of changing psychology or conditions, the average autocrat grows more conservative in office.33"
"55","The evidence here is hardly definitive. But it is consistent with a view in which modernization increases the proportion of leaders who, whether rising via revolution or internal succession, have higher education and more liberal values. Such leaders prove readier to reform and often lose in the fairer elections they introduce. Military dictators also exit relatively quickly. Long‐surviving autocrats are those most reactionary and adept at blocking change. Even among reformists, motivation to liberalize weakens after their first year. Tracing the details of this process remains a challenge for future work."
"56","Economic development promotes political liberalization, but not in a smooth and incremental way. Dictators differ, and some have the determination and skill to deflect pressures for reform for decades. Breakthroughs come only after such reactionaries depart."
"57","Because of this, development's effect on democracy is felt most consistently in the medium run. In modernizing autocracies, the pool of new leaders contains some with higher education and relatively liberal values. Such leaders sometimes reform—and then often lose power in the more competitive elections they introduce."
"58","Reactionary dictators face a dilemma. While higher income prepares countries for (eventual) democratization, rapid growth entrenches incumbents, increasing their revenues and popular support. Dictators like Spain's Franco encourage growth because it enhances their personal odds of survival, while unintentionally triggering social changes that spell the eventual decomposition of their regime."
"59","This logic helps explain why modernization theory often seems at odds with current events and democratic breakthroughs come as a surprise. Under Brezhnev, Soviet society grew more educated, urban, and differentiated—with no hint of democratization. In retrospect, we see this prepared the way for a more educated and modern‐thinking leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, to begin reforms. In Indonesia under Suharto, per capita GDP tripled. Yet 2 years before street protests overthrew him, his dictatorship seemed more secure than ever (Liddle 1996). In modernizing autocracies, a stability that observers take for granted can evaporate suddenly.         "
"60","In debates on the causes of democratization, believers in structural factors and contingent action are both right—and both wrong: right in that both emphasize important elements, wrong in that they neglect how they fit together. Structural factors such as economic development shape political regimes, but not immediately and every year. Their effects are “switched on and off” by the contingencies of leadership. Reactionary leaders can delay the impact of economic development, but not forever. And their efforts to prolong their own tenure often prepare the unexpected breakthrough that will follow their demise."
