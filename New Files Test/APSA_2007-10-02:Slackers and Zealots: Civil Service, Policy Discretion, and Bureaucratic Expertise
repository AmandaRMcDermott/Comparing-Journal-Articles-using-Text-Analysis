"1","We model the delegation of authority, selection of bureaucrats, acquisition of expertise, and implementation of policy as a noncooperative game between two players: the legislature and the bureaucrat (L and B for short). The game lasts for two periods13 and yields a choice in each period, denoted by xt, from a unidimensional policy space, . In each period, the legislature sets the bureaucrat's policy discretion. Denote the discretion given by the legislature to the bureaucrat in period t by Dt≥ 0, with Dt meaning that the bureaucrat can choose any policy xt∈[−Dt, Dt]. Thus, a higher value of Dt represents a higher level of bureaucratic discretion in the sense that the bureaucrat can choose from a strictly larger set of policies to implement.         "
"2","Policy outcomes are affected by the policy chosen by the bureaucrat and the state of nature, which encapsulates all factors other than the bureaucrat's policy decision affecting the bureaucrat's and legislature's payoffs. The state of nature in period t is denoted by . We assume that in both time periods, ωt is independently drawn from Ω according to a cumulative distribution F that has zero mean , zero median14, and finite, strictly positive variance σω > 0. Formally, the policy outcome in time t is denoted by yt and is determined by            "
"3","We focus on the following sequence of moves:17"
"4","                        "
"5"," L chooses first‐period discretion D1.                  "
"6","Nature chooses B's type θ and reveals it to B.                  "
"7"," B chooses to invest in expertise (s= 1) or not invest (s= 0).                  "
"8","Nature chooses ωt.                  "
"9","If s= 1, B learns ωt. Otherwise, B retains his or her prior beliefs about ωt.                  "
"10"," B chooses a policy xt∈[−Dt, Dt].                  "
"11"," B chooses whether to stay in government in period 2 (g= 1) or not (g= 0).                  "
"12","(a) If g= 1, with probability ρ, L chooses second‐period discretion as a function of s (i.e., D2(s)) and play continues, repeating steps 4, 5, and 6 (i.e., beginning with nature selecting ω2).                  "
"13","Always if g= 0, and with probability 1 −ρ if g= 1, the period 1 bureaucrat earns the outside option value w, a new bureaucrat takes the job, and steps 1–6 are repeated.                        "
"14","Before continuing, we note that our approach prevents L from conditioning second‐period decisions on first‐period policy outcomes. This is an extension of a standard assumption in the literature: L cannot observe or cannot act on policy outcomes to “discipline”B until the game is over. Allowing L to punish B for policy outcomes represents an interesting avenue for future work.         "
"15","The payoffs for the legislature are given by             "
"16","Denoting the bureaucrat's most preferred policy outcome by pB≥ 0, the bureaucrat's period 1 payoffs are given by            "
"17","The probability ρ∈[0, 1] represents an exogenous probability that the bureaucrat does not continue in office even if it tries to remain in the civil service (g= 1). One facet of bureaucracy that ρ captures is the extent of tenure security: if ρ is large then the bureaucrat is likely to be able to remain in public service if it desires to do so.         "
"18","Before turning to the analysis, we specify four assumptions to streamline it and focus on interesting cases. Ruling out “uninteresting” cases does not mean that those cases are conceptually impossible or empirically irrelevant. Rather, the scenarios we rule out with our assumptions are uninteresting because our theory implies that bureaucratic competence is either guaranteed, or impossible to attain, in the equilibria of those cases."
"19","Assumption 1 (Outside option)  The value of the second‐period outside option exceeds the second‐period government wage:                                 w > r.            "
"20","A wide variety of wage profiles over time is consistent with our results. The values of r and w can each grow over time at different rates or respond (for both types θ) to some extent to expertise investment, and w can grow because of first‐period public service (as might reflect a “revolving door” scenario, whereby former bureaucrats parlay experience and networks in bureaucracy into lucrative private employment). The important assumptions for our results are that (i) w > r at t= 2, and (ii) w is not so strongly affected by B's expertise investment that slackers are induced to invest at t= 1. (Given that w > r in period 2, it is not crucial that r be completely unrelated to first‐period expertise investment, though we assume so partly for substantive reasons (as explained in footnote 18) and partly for presentational reasons (to suppress extraneous parameters that would not affect the character of our results).            "
"21","If r≥w, every bureaucrat will attempt to remain in the bureaucracy in the second period—regardless of the bureaucrat's type, other parameter values, or other endogenous decisions. Empirically this assumption has been long debated, but for senior bureaucratic managers and analysts, and controlling for cost of living, contemporary evidence supports it (Congressional Budget Office 1997). Van Riper (1958, chap. 7) offers some indirect evidence that real wages, and certainly the social status, of government service were low compared to private sector options in the Gilded Age, the period of critical early development of the modern civil service.            "
"22","Assumption 2 (Policy sensitivity)  The cost of acquiring relationship‐specific expertise, c, is neither too small nor too large. Formally,"
"23","Assumption 3 (Uninformed bureaucrats)  For                                 s= 0               and               θ= 0, B               will choose the same policy as that which would be chosen by an uninformed type               θ= 1               bureaucrat.             "
"24","Assumption 3 ensures that the model's predictions are not driven by the behavior of otherwise indifferent actors. Importantly, this assumption strengthens our results: if we altered the assumed behavior of uninformed slackers, zealots would have an even greater incentive to remain in office in the second period (because they would sacrifice more in expectation by leaving). Moreover, leaving the behavior of uninformed slackers as a degree of freedom adds uninteresting complication to the analysis (it increases the number of equilibria that the legislature does not prefer)."
"25","Assumption 4 (Overlapping generations)  A newly hired zealot will acquire information in the second period if it is in the interest of zealots to acquire information in the first period.             "
"26","The motivation behind Assumption 4 is twofold: conveniently, it captures the flavor of a stationary equilibrium within an infinitely repeated version of the model. More importantly, though, it actually represents the “hardest case” for our results.20 Specifically, this assumption reduces the incentive of an informed zealot to stay in the civil service: if an expert zealot believed that his or her replacement would not acquire expertise, regardless of the replacement's type, then the zealot's policy preferences would motivate him or her to forego a larger outside wage option in order to ensure that policy was made by an informed bureaucrat (namely, him or her). Thus, if the legislature can use discretion to induce expertise acquisition by bureaucrats with Assumption 4, then it could also clearly do so if the assumption is relaxed.21"
"27","In this section we analyze B's optimal decisions in the model presented above. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) is the appropriate concept to use since L must choose D without knowing the prior choices of nature, but we leave off‐path beliefs unspecified because they are uninteresting in this setting. In a PBE, the bureaucrat chooses its actions based on its type θ, the discretion offered by the legislature in the first period, and the bureaucrat's (correct) beliefs about the legislature's response to these actions in the second period. Additionally, the legislature must make sequentially rational and payoff‐maximizing choices about discretion levels in both periods.         "
"28","For the remainder, we denote the equilibrium expertise acquisition strategy of a bureaucrat with type θ by s*(θ). We denote the legislature's equilibrium choice of discretion levels D*t (s), for period t and expertise acquisition s, by the profile D*= (D*1, D*2(0), D*2(1)).         "
"29","Results in the policy‐setting portion of the game are important for our analysis, but well known from previous work (especially Epstein and O'Halloran 1999). In this section we review these results briefly. The optimal policy choice is denoted by x*t and is either a constant (in the case of an uninformed bureaucrat, s= 0) or a function of ω (for an informed bureaucrat, s= 1). The proofs of this, and all other results, are contained in the appendix.            "

"31","Lemma 1 states that the equilibrium policy x*t is in the interior of the discretionary region if the latter contains B's (ex ante) expected ideal policy, and at the boundary of the region otherwise.               "
"32","For the case of an informed bureaucrat, the optimal policy choice is presented in Lemma 2. It asserts that the policy choice is B's ex post ideal, if this is in the discretionary window, or the closest policy inside the window otherwise.               "

"34","Bureaucratic Payoffs. The expected period t policy payoff for the bureaucrat, given discretion D and expertise acquisition s, is denoted by φs (D).

"41","A key question in our model is under what conditions a bureaucrat will decide to (attempt to) remain in the civil service after the first period. This decision depends on the outside option and government wage (w and r), the discretion that will be offered by the legislature (D*), the type of the bureaucrat (θ), and the bureaucrat's expertise acquisition decision in the first period (s). We now analyze the decision calculus for slackers and zealots in turn.            "
"42","Slackers' Decisions. Regardless of its expertise acquisition in the first period, the second‐period payoff for a slacker (i.e., θ= 0) who chooses to remain in civil service is simply r, whereas the payoff from leaving the civil service and taking the outside option is w. The assumption that w > r (Assumption 1) immediately implies that all slackers exit the civil service after the first period, regardless of whether they acquired expertise or not.22"
"43","Zealots' Decisions. Using Assumptions 3 and 4 (the uninformed bureaucrats and overlapping generations assumptions), the expected payoff for a zealot who decides to leave office in the second period is equal to                   "
"44","Lemma 4  Given Assumption 1, in any perfect Bayesian equilibrium,                                       g*(1, 1) = 1 (i.e., zealots who acquired expertise(s= 1)will choose to remain in office) if"
"45"," Equation (3) expresses a key result.25 Namely, a legislature attempting to create a skilled and experienced bureaucracy must offer policy‐motivated experts increased control over the issue(s) that these bureaucrats care about.26 Expert bureaucrats have a larger incentive to remain in the civil service after obtaining expertise if their discretion exceeds that available to their replacement, even an expert one. As this difference grows, an experienced expert bureaucrat has a greater ability to implement its preferred policy than will a replacement, even an expert one.27 In short, discretion is a substitute for money, but only for zealots. Since fine‐tuned wage contracts to induce expertise investment are not available to L in this model, it can turn to discretion to serve a similar purpose.               "
"46","For the moment, suppose that the first‐period bureaucrat (denoted by i) observes an idiosyncratic outside option, , drawn from a distribution with strictly increasing cumulative distribution function and mean w. Then Equation (3) becomes                  "
"47","Corollary 1  Suppose the bureaucrat observes an outside option value                  at the beginning of the second period, as described above. Then, the probability that a bureaucrat who acquired expertise will remain in the bureaucracy is decreasing in the probability of zealots,ζ; decreasing in the cost of acquiring expertise, c; and increasing in the government wage, r.               "
"48","Consider the first conclusion of Corollary 1. Bureaucrats with expertise have less of an incentive to stay in the civil service when future bureaucrats are more likely to care about policy, because today's bureaucrat can choose not to stay in the civil service and still obtain the policy benefits of an expert bureaucrat in the future. As we show below, this also means sitting zealots have less incentive to acquire expertise in the first place as the probability of zealots ζ grows. When zealots are very common, a sitting zealot can essentially free ride on future zealots, who will acquire expertise if the first‐period bureaucrat has an incentive to do so (Assumption 4). When slackers are very common, a zealot cannot leave the fine points of policymaking to someone else. Thus, expert administration represents a “public good” among zealots. Accordingly, when there are fewer of them in the population (i.e., when ζ is smaller), each is more likely to be pivotal for its provision."
"49","The second and third conclusions of Corollary 1 are no less important empirically. If the cost of acquiring expertise increases, then the incentive for a bureaucrat to do so is directly reduced, ceteris paribus. Similarly, if the opportunity cost of leaving the bureaucracy (the government wage, r) increases, then the incentive to take the outside option is reduced as well. In this respect, the model obviously does not imply the absurd result that the government “should” set wages as low as possible.               "
"50","The central theoretical concept of this article is the endogenous acquisition of expertise within a bureaucratic agency. In this section, we analyze the bureaucrat's decision calculus regarding expertise acquisition in detail. As in the previous section, we analyze this decision in turn for slackers and zealots."
"51","Slackers' Expertise Decisions. For a slacker, the decision about whether to acquire expertise is simple. As noted above, slackers will not remain in the civil service in the second period, and relationship specificity of expertise means that w does not vary with its acquisition.28 Thus, since acquiring expertise will not affect their first‐period policy payoffs (by assumption, slackers' payoffs are insensitive to policy outcomes), acquiring expertise in the first period is a strictly dominated strategy for slackers. This fact implies Lemma 5.               "
"52","Lemma 5  Given Assumption 1,                                       s*(0) = 0                  in any perfect Bayesian equilibrium: slackers never acquire expertise.                "
"53","Zealots' Expertise Decisions In the sufficient condition stated in Lemma 4, a zealot must take into account its future employment decision (i.e., whether to remain in the civil service or take the outside option) when making a decision in the present about whether to acquire job‐specific expertise. Bureaucrats will acquire expertise if they expect to garner net benefits from this acquisition. These benefits may take the form of “policy rents” offered by the legislature as a result of acquiring expertise. More expertise induces the legislature to offer more discretion in equilibrium, which is valued only by type θ= 1 bureaucrats.29"
"54","The time horizon of policymaking also has an important impact on incentives of θ= 1 bureaucrats. Given that φ0(D) ≤φ1(D) for all D, that φs(D) is weakly increasing in D for both s∈{0, 1} (Lemma 3), and that D*2(0) ≤D*1,30 a zealot should acquire expertise and choose to stay in office (i.e., s*(1) = 1 and g*(1, 1) = 1) only if                  "
"55","Proposition 1  The maximum cost that a type                  θ= 1                  bureaucrat is willing to incur to acquire expertise,                  is increasing inρ.               "
"56","This result emphasizes the retention aspects of tenure security, on top of the selection aspects of merit systems. Even if a patronage system were (somehow, counterfactually) to select exactly the same employees chosen under a merit selection system, the short horizon of the system inhibits the development of expertise, which lowers bureaucratic discretion, which inhibits the development of expertise still further. Even abstracting from the selection of competent employees, the stable, continuing employment of ones whose utility is especially sensitive to policy outcomes spurs the development of bureaucratic expertise. This implies that job tenure and “back door” restrictions on removal power—sometimes relegated to the status of mere power grabs in previous literature (e.g., Van Riper 1958, 40)—are actually crucial components of the incentives for expertise creation in civil service.               "
"57","In this respect a policy‐oriented legislature wants the expected length of employment for bureaucrats who might acquire expertise to be as long as possible. Increasing the security of tenure (i.e., increasing ρ) increases the relative appeal to B of a given level of increased discretionary authority in the future, as well as lengthening the horizon over which expertise investment can pay off. The future by itself is useless: it is an inducement only insofar as it holds something of value to B. Increased discretion as a result of expertise development creates this value when ρ is large.               "
"58","While (ex post) the legislature only wants to retain expert bureaucrats, only bureaucrats who have acquired expertise will choose to remain on the job. Thus, it follows that with regard to the legislature's induced preferences over patronage versus job protection (i.e., ρ), the legislature can treat every new bureaucrat as if he or she will acquire expertise, since those who choose not to do so will voluntarily exit the civil service. This fact is important for the remainder of the analysis, and therefore stated formally as a corollary.               "
"59","Corollary 2  Given Assumptions 1 and 2, in any perfect Bayesian equilibrium satisfying Assumptions 3 and 4,                                       g*(θ, s) = 1                  implies that                  θ= 1                  and                                       s= 1:                  a bureaucrat who remains in office in the second period must be a zealot who acquired expertise in the first period.                "
"60","The analysis thus far has considered the incentives facing the bureaucrat, given a profile of discretionary window sizes offered by the legislature. We now complete the analysis by considering what discretionary profiles will be offered by a rational legislature, given its recognition of the bureaucrat's incentives to acquire expertise and/or take the outside option in the second period."
"61","In a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, the legislature must choose discretion optimally given past decisions by all players and (correct) expectations of future decisions. That is, the legislature cannot commit to its future awards of discretion. Discretion levels must be optimal from an interim standpoint—but as long as they are, they may be treated as credible commitments. Some additional notation will help to make the following analysis more precise. For any discretion level D, let            "
"62","As noted above, slackers will never acquire expertise in equilibrium (Lemma 5) and bureaucrats will attempt to remain in the civil service in the second period only if they acquired expertise in the first period (Corollary 2). These facts jointly imply that there are only two possible “types” of pure strategy perfect Bayesian equilibria: one in which no bureaucrats acquire expertise and all bureaucrats exit the civil service after the first period, and a second type of equilibrium where zealots (and only zealots) acquire expertise in the first period and all those who acquire expertise attempt to remain in the civil service in the second period. In the first type of PBE, where all bureaucrats choose not to acquire expertise, the legislature's expected payoff is             "
"63","The next result characterizes the optimal levels of discretion defined in Equations (8), (9), and (10). In words, the Proposition states that the legislature in this setting gives zero discretionary authority to the bureaucrat when the legislature expects that the bureaucrat will not acquire expertise. This is intuitive, once one realizes that the legislature and an uninformed bureaucrat are equally adept at setting policy. Hence, granting any discretion to an uninformed bureaucrat is weakly dominated from the legislature's perspective. The second part of the Proposition states that the discretion granted to a second‐period bureaucrat will be at least as great as the discretion granted to a new bureaucrat. This follows from the fact that, given Assumptions 1 and 2, second‐period bureaucrats will, without exception, be experts, while in the first period, the bureaucrat may be a slacker and not acquire expertise. Accordingly, when granting discretion to a first‐period bureaucrat who may acquire expertise, the legislature should hedge its bets and offer what is generally an intermediate degree of discretion.         "

"65","Legislative Incentives Whether zealots acquire expertise and attempt to remain in the bureaucracy in equilibrium, or whether all bureaucrats refrain from acquiring expertise and leave the bureaucracy after the first period, depends on the strength of the legislature's desire for informed policymaking. If the legislature does not gain enough from informed policymaking to warrant the agency cost of granting policymaking discretion to the agency, then the equilibrium civil service system will involve neither rewards for expertise acquisition (in the form of future discretion) nor the acquisition of expertise by bureaucrats.33 The cost of providing discretionary incentives results from the expected drift of policy outcomes toward the bureaucrat's policy objectives, pB (McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987), and this must be balanced against discretion's value as an inducement.34"
"66","The legislature's preference for informed policymaking (and voluntary return to the bureaucracy) by zealots over uninformed policymaking by both types of bureaucrats is captured formally by                "
"67","The right‐hand side of Inequality (11) describes the (ex ante expected) value of informed policymaking to the legislature, given the legislature's sequentially rational provision of discretion and the bureaucrat's equilibrium behavior. The term ζργ1(Δ*2) represents the expected value of expert policymaking by an experienced zealot. This term plays a bigger role in the legislature's expected payoff as ζ and ρ both increase. Not only B's incentive to acquire it, but also L's incentive to reward expertise acquisition depends crucially on the security of tenure.            "
"68","While Inequality (11) is a necessary condition for an experienced and expert civil service to result from equilibrium behavior by both legislature and bureaucrats, it is not sufficient. As discussed earlier, the acquisition of expertise within a bureaucratic agency is the result of voluntary decision making and thus, in equilibrium, also subject to an incentive compatibility condition.            "
"69","Bureaucratic Incentives Even if the legislature is willing to bear the agency costs associated with granting discretion to the bureaucrat, zealots may deem the acquisition of expertise too costly to bear. For example, the direct cost c of expertise acquisition may simply outweigh the bureaucrat's (expected) policy benefits of informed policymaking. Thus, even if the legislature is willing and able to grant discretion to informed/expert bureaucrats who remain in the civil service, zealots may nevertheless refrain from acquiring expertise. Substituting Δ*1 for D*1 and Δ*2 for D*2(1) in Inequality (5) directly yields the following incentive compatibility condition for zealots to acquire expertise in equilibrium:               "
"70","The next proposition states that the joint satisfaction of Inequalities (11) and (12) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the legislature to reward expertise acquisition with additional discretionary authority in equilibrium. If either fails to hold, the legislature will offer no discretionary authority to the bureaucrat in equilibrium. For the following, denote a parameter vector by .            "
"71","Proposition 3  The legislature's optimal discretion profile in its most preferred perfect Bayesian equilibrium, given                  denoted by                  is given by                "

"74"," otherwise.                         "
"75","Type I equilibria are akin to a “regime of clerkship” (Carpenter 2001). The legislature offers the bureaucrat no reward for expertise acquisition. Accordingly, no bureaucrats of either type acquire expertise in Type I equilibria, and all bureaucrats leave the civil service after the first period. There is no bureaucratic decision making of any import: the bureaucrat is simply paid a wage of r to implement the status quo policy, x= 0. Expert judgment is not important enough to be rewarded, given the costs of doing so. One implication of Type I equilibrium is that civil service protection inducing bureaucratic expertise is not universally best for L in our model. For example, when policy is not subject to important uncertainty (e.g., is limited in complexity, largely redistributive, etc.), or bureaucratic preferences are highly divergent from legislative preferences, this type of equilibrium may be preferred by L.               "
"76","Type II equilibria represent “politicized competence.” The legislature offers a discretion profile in which all (and only) the policy‐motivated bureaucrats develop expertise in the first period and voluntarily remain in office in the second period. The choice by the legislature to offer discretionary authority to expert bureaucrats provides sufficient incentive for zealots to acquire expertise in the first period.35 In a Type II equilibrium, all zealots (and only zealots) acquire expertise and attempt to remain in the civil service in the second period. Substantively, this equilibrium represents a modern, professionalized, but politicized administrative agency. A noteworthy implication of this proposition is that there is no “Type III” equilibrium in which slackers invest in expertise and disinterestedly implement L's ideal policy,36 thereby achieving “neutral competence.” Such an “equilibrium” would fail the incentive compatibility requirement for bureaucrats. In short, the legislature can have either politicized competence or none at all. It may have reasons for preferring either one, but given the contractual and incentive constraints in this model, those are the only options.               "
"77","Another important implication is that L's preference among equilibria is sufficient to implement its most preferred one. The legislature must simply set its sequentially rational level of discretion, and the equilibrium it prefers (given parameters and constraints) follows from the best response of B. Furthermore, if L desires perfect sorting of B by θ, and desires expertise acquisition, it can achieve this in equilibrium. Therefore, L could not improve on its utility if it were a “mechanism designer,” able to precommit to specific responses (in terms of discretion levels) to expertise investment and self‐selection decisions by B (and, by implication, L cannot attain a “Type III” or “neutral competence” equilibrium by controlling θ itself). For example, the legislature is not best responding if it “artificially” restricts first‐period discretion to a level less than Δ*1.37"
"78","A third implication of the model can be gleaned from the observed behavior in a Type II equilibrium. A bureaucrat attempts to remain in the bureaucracy only after choosing to acquire expertise. Experienced bureaucrats will be promoted or rewarded for their service. This follows from the sequential rationality of L's behavior. Why would the legislature bother to offer rewards that it did not expect to be achieved in equilibrium? In this respect the equilibrium‐behavior‐based linkage between stability and expertise within a bureaucracy is apparent. Expert administration may be occurring precisely when L appears to be simply endorsing an agency where promotions and policymaking discretion seem to follow simply from “years served” in the agency. This suggests a (positive) link between bureaucratic ossification and expert administration, based on the possibility of Type II equilibria.               "
"79","The discussion of Proposition 3 takes the occurrence of a given type of equilibrium as given, but this begs the question of when each type will exist. Here we explore conditions on the parameters that give rise to equilibria of each type.38"
"80","When considering which of the two classes of equilibria will be observed, the principal question is whether the legislature is willing to bear the cost required to provide the bureaucrat with sufficient incentive to become an expert. The legislature's benefits from informed policymaking (i.e., Type II equilibrium) depend on the degree of uncertainty about future policy outcomes (captured by the distribution F(ω), and indirectly by ρ). Increased discretion imposes two types of cost on the legislature, both of which are due to policy drift (McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987). The first comes from nonexpert bureaucrats and the second from bureaucrats who acquire expertise. Bureaucrats who do not acquire expertise will simply shift policy outcomes toward pB (Lemma 1). In expected payoff terms, this is a “pure” cost—the legislature would prefer to offer zero discretion to any bureaucrat who was known to be a nonexpert. The cost of policy drift from expert policymaking is also related to pB, though in a less direct way. An expert policymaker with complete discretion (i.e., a bureaucrat with D=∞) will always produce a policy outcome of y=pB. While not the first best outcome from the legislature's standpoint, this might represent a higher payoff than results from uninformed policymaking with zero discretion. And, to further complicate matters, more extreme values of pB will make it easier for the legislature to provide an incentive for zealots to acquire expertise, as the alternative outcome—reduced discretion for a (possibly slacker) bureaucrat—will be increasingly unpleasant. Accordingly, the effect of pB is not simple. The role of policy uncertainty, as embodied by F, is more direct. In the most extreme case, F represents a degenerate distribution, assigning probability one to ω= 0. In this case, the legislature will (strictly) prefer a grant of zero discretion (D= 0) to any other discretionary level. This preference for zero discretionary authority is independent of whether the bureaucrat is informed or not. Obviously, the bureaucrat would never acquire expertise in such a world anyway. Similarly, suppose that F places a sufficiently high probability on ω= 0. Then, even if L grants substantial discretionary authority to B, B's (expected) policy gains from acquiring expertise will not outweigh the cost c of expertise acquisition. In other words, even if the agent has sufficient authority to “make a difference” with sufficient policymaking powers, the incentive to acquire expertise is proportional to the amount of variance in the situations about which the expertise will provide guidance. Thus, the incentives motivating both the supply of, and demand for, expertise vanish as the distribution of ω converges to a degenerate point mass at zero. Accordingly, the legislature's most preferred PBE in situations “near” this limit must be a Type I equilibrium.            "
"81","Finally, the effects of r, w, and c on equilibrium type are straightforward. If the governmental wage is too low relative to the outside option or if acquiring expertise is too costly, then L's most preferred PBE is a Type I equilibrium. These comparative statics result from the inability of the legislature to offer sufficient incentive to the bureaucrat to justify the acquisition of expertise. In equilibrium, the legislature realizes this and sets discretion under the (correct) belief that neither slackers nor zealots will acquire expertise in either period. Proposition 4 offers a more formal statement of the effects of the parameters on the type of equilibrium that will be observed.            "

"89","Most interesting are the effects of ρ (tenure security), ζ (probability of policy‐interested bureaucrats), pB (ideological difference between agency and legislature), and F (noisiness of policy outcomes relative to the bureaucrat's policy choice). All of these determine L's preferred equilibrium through their effect on a zealot's incentive to acquire expertise. For example, if tenure security is low (low ρ), then the legislature may be unable (or unwilling) to grant enough discretion in the first period to make acquisition of expertise individually rational for zealots. Similarly, if ideological differences between the agency and the legislature are large, then the possible cost of uninformed decision making in the first period may outweigh the expected benefits from informed decision making, leading the legislature to offer no discretion whatsoever (even though, fixing D, larger pB makes B more willing to acquire expertise).               "
"90","This article is based on the idea that bureaucratic policy expertise is, at some level, endogenous. In addition, policy expertise and individually costly investments in expertise, policymaking capacity, and information gathering are often relationship specific. Therefore these investments are subject to a potential holdup problem. The return on them depends jointly on the political environment of bureaucracies and on the personnel management practices and institutions in government.39 A government facing contractual, informational, and incentive constraints can induce the development of relationship‐specific expertise by (1) instituting relatively common civil service practices—notably, protection of job tenure and lower material rewards than an available outside option, and (2) granting bureaucrats some measure of control over policy issues they care about. Such a solution comes with an extra requirement: the bureaucrats who acquire expertise and make careers in public service are exactly those who have unusually strong policy preferences. Neutral competence is impossible in our model not because “neutrality” is impossible, but because only those with a stake in policy can be induced (by the limited instruments available) to become experts. In short, we have argued first that politicized competence is the best kind available in equilibrium, and second that the best available does emerge under our formalization of bureaucratic institutions. In this respect bureaucracies present political principals with an agency problem they themselves designed and that serves a useful purpose (if not the reason they created it). Our main contribution has been to show that, and to show precisely how, the political and personnel management aspects of bureaucratic institutions are jointly sufficient and individually necessary to sustain a high‐capacity, expert bureaucracy.
