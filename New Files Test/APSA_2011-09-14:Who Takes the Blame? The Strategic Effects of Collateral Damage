"1","In fighting against each other, insurgents and counterinsurgents (henceforth, armed actors) make many decisions every day about how to deal with the noncombatant civilian population. At the most general level, encouraging cooperation from civilians and discouraging it with the enemy is a key goal. More specifically, civilians can provide valuable information to armed actors, such as the whereabouts of the other armed actor or which civilians actively aid the other armed actor (Kalyvas 2006). For competent militaries engaged in counterinsurgency, identifying rebel fighters can be the critical tactical challenge (Kitson 1971).         "
"2","The war in Iraq is no exception; Coalition forces have struggled throughout the war to identify insurgents and gain the support of the local population (Cockburn 2007). One American soldier neatly summarized the problem: “The hardest part is picking out the bad guys” (Cockburn 2007, 138–39). Civilians in Iraq not only provided critical intelligence to Coalition forces, but also supplied insurgents with valuable information (Chehab 2006, 7). Because of the importance of information, Coalition forces have, on occasion, resorted to collective punishment of Iraqi civilians in the hope that the desired information will be forthcoming. Farmers belonging to the Khazraji tribe in Dhuluaya village, 50 miles north of Baghdad, saw this strategy in action first‐hand. Cockburn reports that “US troops had told [farmers]…that the fruit groves were being bulldozed to punish the farmers for not informing on the resistance. A local … delegation was told by an officer that trees and palms were being destroyed as punishment of local people because ‘you know who is in the resistance and you do not tell us’” (2007, 125–26).         "
"3","Government and insurgent forces in other conflicts have found that violence against civilians can cut both ways: it can motivate civilians out of fear or push them into the enemy's camp (Kalyvas 2006, chap. 6; Valentino, Huth, and Balch‐Lindsay 2004). Carr (2002) examines cases from the long history of warfare, illustrating that violent strategies of civilian punishment or deterrence are militarily and politically both counterproductive and costly. Kalyvas (2006) argues that selective violence is strategically superior to indiscriminate violence, at least when an armed actor exercises control over the population. After all, unless civilians perceive that violence is being used only on the “guilty,” what incentive is there to comply with the armed actors’ demands? Indeed, a recent study of the effect of Israeli Defense Force house demolitions on subsequent suicide attacks in the Gaza Strip provides evidence that targeted violence against civilians can have opposing effects in the same context, depending on whether civilians perceive the violence as justifiably inflicted (Benmelech, Berrebi, and Klor 2010).         "
"4","Yet governments and rebels routinely engage in violence against civilians, perhaps because, in some cases, it works (Birtle 2008). Indiscriminate violence can cow civilians into submission and cooperation, reducing subsequent insurgent violence, either through intimidation or outright large‐scale elimination (Downes 2007, 2008). Lyall's (2009) finding that random artillery fire directed against villages in Chechnya reduced subsequent insurgent activity in those villages suggests that, under some conditions, indiscriminate violence against civilians can achieve the desired effect.         "
"5","Despite the ambiguous evidence from academic studies, the consensus among U.S. policy makers is clearly that mistreatment of civilians provokes insurgent violence. Testifying before Congress in January 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates highlighted this issue in the context of operations in Afghanistan: “I believe that the civilian casualties are doing us enormous harm in Afghanistan, and we have got to do better in terms of avoiding casualties … because my worry is that the Afghans come to see us as part of the problem, rather than as part of the solution. And then we are lost.”7 Politicians and commanders believe the issue matters enormously because civilians decide whom they will support based partly on how they are treated—or perceive they are treated—by insurgent and incumbent forces.8"
"6","In light of this fact, military commanders and their civilian superiors face quite a dilemma in designing rules of engagement. How much risk must soldiers absorb in trying to discriminate between noncombatant and insurgent? Moreover, does it even matter if U.S. forces go the extra mile in order to protect innocent lives? Does the civilian population in Iraq blame U.S. forces for civilian casualties, no matter which side caused the damage? Do civilians place some of the blame for casualties on insurgents, and if so can they punish them short of organizing competing militias?9"
"7","Together, then, the academic literature and received wisdom from the military and policymaking communities suggest a broad consensus that collateral damage should be militarily problematic, but there is little systematic evidence for that contention. To develop such evidence, we combined data from a broad range of sources. This section describes those data and presents descriptive statistics and figures to demonstrate just how varied the landscape of violence in Iraq has been."
"8","There are no complete or perfect data for civilian casualties in Iraq or in any other conflict.10 The casualty data used in this article come from Iraq Body Count (IBC), a nonprofit organization dedicated to tracking civilian casualties using media reports, as well as hospital, morgue, and other figures.11 These data capture 19,961 incidents in which civilians were killed that can be accurately geo‐located to the district level, accounting for 59,245 civilian deaths.12 The full data run from March 2003 through June 2009, but we use a subset to match the data on insurgent attacks.            "
"9","We divide these killings into four categories: (1) Insurgent killings of civilians that occur in the course of attacking Coalition or Iraqi government targets; this category explicitly excludes insurgent killings that are unrelated to attacks and are better classified as intimidation killings related to dynamics of the civil war (see below);13 (2) Coalition killings of civilians; (3) Sectarian killings defined as those conducted by an organization representing an ethnic group and which did not occur in the context of attacks on Coalition or Iraqi forces; and (4) Unknown killings, where a clear perpetrator could not be identified. This last category captures much of the violence associated with ethnic cleansing, reprisal killings, and the like, where claims of responsibility were rarely made and bodies were often simply dropped by the side of the road.            "
"10","A natural concern is that there is likely to be enormous noise associated with attributing casualties across these categories and that such measurement error would be nonrandom with respect to levels of insurgent attacks, posing significant problems for our analysis. To check for such a possibility, we investigate whether the percent of civilian casualties (both the number of casualties and the number of casualty‐related incidents) in our “unknown” category is a function of the rate of insurgent attacks (variable described in next subsection). If it is not, then the measurement error is likely random with respect to our core dependent variable and therefore less of a problem. Results of this test are reported in the supporting evidence (SE Table 1A). Once we control for the sectarian composition of the area, or introduce district and time fixed effects, there is no clear relationship between unknown casualty events and attacks against Coalition and Iraqi government forces. This suggests that our coding of civilian casualties does not suffer systematic measurement error."
"11","A related concern is that the probability an incident is excluded from our analysis because it lacks the information necessary to match it to a district location may be correlated with violence. If reporters avoid high‐violence areas, for example, then districts with high levels of violence would have more missing data. By contrast, if the desire for a good story (or other career concerns) pushed reporters to cover the most dangerous places, we might see the opposite bias. Because our data include 2,612 incidents for which the governorate is known but the district is not, we are able to test for this possibility by analyzing whether the proportion of incidents at the governorate level that cannot be attributed to a specific district correlates with levels of violence. This test is reported in the supporting evidence (SE Table 1B). There is no significant relationship between levels of insurgent violence and the proportion of incidents that cannot be resolved to the district level."
"12","Our analysis focuses mainly on civilian casualties attributable to Coalition forces or insurgents (categories 1 and 2 above), as these capture collateral damage. Sectarian violence and its relationship to insurgent violence are analytically and theoretically distinct from the concept of collateral damage and so we deal with those subjects elsewhere."
"13","Our measure of attacks against Coalition and Iraqi government forces is based on 193,264 “significant activity” (SIGACT) reports by Coalition forces that capture a wide variety of information about “…executed enemy attacks targeted against coalition, Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), civilians, Iraqi infrastructure and government organizations” occurring between February 4, 2004, and February 24, 2009. Unclassified data drawn from the MNF‐I SIGACTS III Database were provided to the Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) project in 2008 and 2009.14 These data provide the location, date, time, and type of attack for incidents but do not include any information pertaining to the Coalition force units involved, Coalition force casualties, or battle damage incurred. Moreover, they exclude Coalition‐initiated events where no one returned fire, such as indirect fire attacks not triggered by initiating insurgent attacks or targeted raids that go well. We filter the data to remove attacks we can positively identify as being directed at civilians or other insurgent groups, leaving us with a sample of 168,730 attack incidents.15"
"14","To estimate the ethnic mix of the population we combined maps and fine‐grained population data from LandScan (2008).16 After collecting every map we could find of Iraq's ethnic mix, we geo‐referenced them and combined them with the population data to generate estimates of the proportion of each district's population that fell into each of the three main groups (Sunni, Shia, Kurd). Using the figures from what we judged to be the most reliable map, a CIA map from 2003, we coded districts as mixed if no ethnic group had more than 66% of the population; otherwise the district was coded as belonging to its dominant ethnic group.17"
"15","We use the World Food Program's population estimates generated in 2003, 2005, and 2007 as part of its food security and vulnerability analysis.18 Using repeated observations of the population helps minimize the probability that our results are sensitive to biases driven by the substantial population movements Iraq suffered during the war. For districts in Erbil and Dahuk governorates that were not surveyed in the 2003 WFP survey, we use NCC Iraq estimates.            "
"16","For this article we created a district‐week dataset, from February 4, 2004, through February 24, 2009. Descriptive statistics of key variables for all of Iraq across this time period as well as for Sunni, Shia, and mixed areas are in SE Table 1C."
"17","Figures 1–3 illustrate the variation in insurgent attacks and civilian casualties over time for the entire country and within select districts. For the entire country (Figure 1) we see a steady upward trend in attacks (right axis) until fall 2007. Total civilian casualties (left axis) follow a similar trend, but, looking at the breakdown by the armed actor responsible, we see that only sectarian killings mirror the macrotrend. Casualties attributed to Coalition forces and insurgents remain relatively stable throughout the war, with insurgent‐caused casualties generally higher.            "

"21","Most of Iraq's districts are relatively devoid of insurgent attacks on a per capita basis (SE Figure 1), but where there is violence there is noticeable variation in its severity and timing. The trend in violence, for example, does not look the same in two neighborhoods of Baghdad, Al Sadr (commonly known as Sadr City), and Karkh (the area across the Euphrates which contains the Green Zone), though both were quite violent at times (Figure 2). In terms of civilian casualties, we see similar patterns (Figure 3; SE Figure 2). Sectarian violence in our data is very highly concentrated in mixed districts, suggesting our coding rules accurately distinguish it (SE Figure 3).            "
"22","This section assesses the relationship between collateral damage and subsequent insurgent attacks. We first describe our identifying assumption and introduce a simple statistical model designed to deal with the range of potential complicating relationships that might exist between insurgent attacks and various types of civilian casualties. After some basic robustness checks, we then show how the relationships we identify vary across sectarian regions and levels of urbanity and present an alternative matching estimator as an additional robustness check."
"23","Our identification strategy relies on the randomness inherent in weapons effects. The path of shrapnel, how a bullet ricochets, and the pattern of overpressure from an IED all have a large stochastic component, as does the physical location of noncombatants on a minute‐to‐minute basis. Once we control for how past levels of violence affect the general care with which civilians conduct their lives, then whether someone is standing in the wrong spot at the moment a misaimed round enters their house, or whether they happen to be walking by a window at the moment an IED creates fatal overpressure on their street, is largely random. The implication for estimating the effect of civilian casualties is that once one controls for the systematic sources of variation in both civilian casualties and insurgent attacks—Coalition units might operate more aggressively in pro‐insurgent districts, for example—then we can give a causal interpretation to coefficients from a regression of current attacks on past civilian casualties.19"
"24","We check this identifying assumption in our preferred specification in detail below, but as a first cut consider one striking pattern: the week‐to‐week bivariate correlation in the number of insurgent attacks per district is .95, but only .04 for Coalition‐caused casualties and .14 for insurgent‐caused ones. To provide visual intuition, we plot (Figure 4) the weekly time series of insurgent attacks for Baghdad governorate's nine districts with the weekly time series in civilian casualties attributable to Coalition and insurgent forces. There is no clear relationship between overall insurgent attacks and civilian casualties. Even the long‐term relationship is largely absent in the two single‐sect districts of Baghdad. In Al Sadr (a densely populated Shia area), the two time series seem to be strongly correlated. In Mahmoudiya (a Sunni suburb south of Baghdad) and Tarmia (a Sunni suburb north of Baghdad) there are high numbers of attacks but few civilian casualties. In Al Resafa (a mixed‐sect central commercial district) there are high numbers of civilian casualties, relatively few insurgent attacks, and the two time series seem uncorrelated. That is, while the area‐specific trends in insurgent attacks are highly correlated over time, the same is not true for civilian casualties, which cannot be predicted well at all on the basis of previous levels. This is evidence of greater randomness in the occurrence of civilian casualties, which we exploit in trying to identify the causal effect of those casualties on insurgent attacks.         "
"25","Insurgent Attacks and Civilian Casualties in Baghdad Districts (Feb. 2004–Feb. 2009)"
"26","To motivate the statistical model, suppose that insurgent attacks in area i at time t are a function of the information available to government forces plus insurgent group‐specific strategic goals plus time‐varying district characteristics. The information that is available to the government is a function of how each side treated civilians in the recent past and underlying local attitudes. Assume that civilians respond to past actions so that information passed to the government is increasing in past civilian killings by insurgents and decreasing in past killings by the government and its allies. This leads to the hypothesis that attacks in t will be increasing in government killings of civilians in t‐1 and decreasing in insurgent killings of civilians in t‐1.         "
"27","We test that prediction by estimating the following model, which uses a combination of differencing and fixed effects to control for factors affecting both civilian casualties and attacks:             "
"28","Our core results are presented in Table 1. We report the first differences specification above as well as the analogous regression in levels to highlight the need to control for underlying local attitudes via the differencing.24 This approach is designed to pick up the average effect across areas with different levels of insurgent attacks.25 Estimating the same regression only for district‐weeks with above median levels of insurgent attacks yields somewhat stronger results.            "
"29","Table 1 shows that Coalition‐caused civilian casualties in t‐1 are positively associated with incidents of insurgent violence in period t and insurgent‐caused civilian casualties are associated with less violence in the subsequent period.26 But is this effect causal? We believe the balance of the evidence suggests it is.            "
"30","As a first cut, the results do not change if we control for a broad range of potential confounding factors. Controlling for changes in insurgent attacks in previous periods (ΔYt‐1) allows for the possibility that selection into certain levels of insurgent attacks and civilian casualties is due to historical processes captured by preexisting trends—Coalition units that have experienced increasing rates of attacks may tend to use more firepower, for example—and does not change the results (SE Table 2A). Neither do the results change if we add district fixed effects to control for the possibility that the error term in first differences is predictable across districts (SE Table 2A). The results in Table 1 are also robust to dropping Baghdad from the analysis (SE Table 2B), meaning they are not driven by the peculiarities of the sectarian conflict in that city.27"
"31","Two further concerns arise with Table 1. One concern is that the results may be driven by natural oscillations in the time series of attacks and casualties. A second concern is that because we rely on a temporal difference to identify the causal impact of past collateral damage on current levels of insurgent attacks, we may simply be seeing a correlation because trends in insurgent attacks and civilian casualties are both driven by some omitted variable. Placing the lead of differences in casualties on the RHS instead of the lag, a standard temporal placebo test, can check both possibilities. Leads of casualties have no predictive power, providing evidence that our results are not driven by oscillation or parallel trends (SE Table 2C). Put in plain English, future changes in civilian casualties are not correlated with current changes in insurgent attacks, but past ones are, on average and in mixed areas.            "
"32","Finally, the most serious concern with a causal interpretation of the results in Table 1 is the possibility that the number of civilians being killed by the Coalition or insurgents reflects their expectations about the level of attacks in subsequent periods. Suppose, for example, that Coalition forces correctly predicted high levels of insurgent violence in the near future. One rational reaction could be to increase the number of raids and aggressive checkpoints today, leading to more civilian casualties today. This seems unlikely given how robust the results are to including past trends and district fixed effects, but we test for this in two additional ways.28"
"33","First, following a suggestion in Wooldridge (2002), we tested for the possibility that casualties in t‐1 are driven by (correct) anticipation of future attacks by testing H0: γ= 0 in the equation Δat=Δxt−1b+wt−1γ+Δut, where wt‐1 is the vector of Coalition‐ and insurgent‐caused civilian casualties in t‐1 (the subset of the variables whose endogeneity concerns us) and xt‐1 is the matrix of coefficients described above, including differences in civilian casualties. Using a robust Wald test we fail to reject the null for insurgent casualties in all models, which amounts to formally showing that the number of civilian casualties in period t‐1 is uncorrelated with the residuals in our core model. For Coalition‐caused casualties in Table 1, we reject the null at the p = .900 level in Model (1) and at the p = .953 level in Model (5), suggesting we have some reason for concern about selection effects with respect to Coalition attacks. When, however, we drop the 693 district weeks that cannot be matched with other districts on their history of violence (as described below in the matching section) and experience more than one civilian casualty caused by both actors, the coefficient estimates become slightly larger in the same direction and the p‐values on the test for exogeneity drop below the 90% level in both Model (1) and Model (5) (p = .867 and p = .880, respectively). This gives us confidence that the selection bias which remains in our core specification is unlikely to be driving the result. In our second test, we directly check for selection effects by regressing various types of civilian casualty levels on the rate of insurgent attacks in the next period. The lead of insurgent attacks does not predict Coalition‐, insurgent‐, or sectarian‐caused civilian casualties once we difference to account for district‐specific characteristics (SE Table 2D), providing further evidence that civilian casualties are affecting subsequent insurgent attacks on Coalition forces, not the other way around.29"
"34","On balance, Table 1 and the various robustness checks provide good evidence that Coalition‐caused casualties lead to increased levels of insurgent violence against Coalition and Iraqi forces, while insurgent‐caused casualties have the opposite effect. Given the nature of the data and aggressive set of robustness checks we employ, the balance of the evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that Coalition‐caused collateral damage leads to increased attacks and insurgent‐caused collateral damage leads to reduced attacks.            "
"35","So how do these results vary across areas? We find two key patterns. First, the effects we observe are being driven by districts whose population is more urban than the median district, where 48.5% of the population lives in urban areas according to the WFP surveys (SE Table 2F). The anti‐Coalition effect is absent in nonurban districts (in fact, the effect is in the opposite direction) and the anti‐insurgent effect is severely muted."
"36","Second, and more critically, the results vary tremendously by the sectarian character of an area. Table 2 reports our core specification from Table 1 (Model 5) broken down by sectarian mix, showing the effects are being driven by mixed areas.30"
"37","In mixed areas, a one standard deviation increase in the number of insurgent‐caused civilian casualties predicts approximately 0.5 fewer attacks in the next week for a 12% drop from the average number of attacks per 100,000 in mixed areas.31 Interestingly, the effect is substantively larger in Sunni areas, especially the anti‐Coalition effect, but is less consistent and so is not statistically significant.32 Notice that these results are not what we would expect to find if it were true that, in the context of the civil war and sectarian violence, civilians in mixed areas were more likely to look to various militias or insurgent groups for protection and were thus likely to stay quiet and share no information with Coalition forces for fear of losing their local protection. If that story described civilian incentives in mixed areas, we would expect a null finding on insurgent‐caused casualties in mixed areas.            "
"38","Finally, we study how the impact of civilian casualties varies across four types of insurgent attacks: (1) direct fire attacks involving weapons that can only be used with a direct line of sight to the target, such as rifles and the like, thereby exposing insurgents to the risk of detection while setting up and to a high chance of death or capture during the incident; (2) indirect fire attacks involving weapons such as rockets which can be fired far from their target, implying less risk of exposure during setup and none during the incident; (3) IED attacks that involve planting an explosive which is detonated when Coalition forces pass by, involving some risk of exposure during setup, some risk to the attacker during the incident if the weapon is command detonated, and some risk of failure if civilians tip Coalition forces off to the weapon's presence; and (4) suicide attacks which are typically very resistant to exposure during setup (Berman and Laitin 2008). As SE Table 2G shows, the symmetric anti‐Coalition and anti‐insurgent effects are present for direct fire and IED attacks. The rate of indirect fire attacks, however, is decreasing in Coalition‐generated casualties and the rate of suicide attacks is decreasing in insurgent‐generated casualties. The overall effects we identify thus seem to be driven by the two forms of attacks that we believe to be most sensitive to information sharing by the population.            "
"39","This section presents an alternative semiparametric approach to estimating the causal impact of civilian casualties on subsequent insurgent violence. The basic idea for this alternative, less model‐dependent approach is that we can estimate the causal effect of collateral damage on subsequent violence by comparing outcomes across districts/weeks that are matched on factors influencing the propensity of both sides to kill civilians, such as average levels of violence or whether one side or the other feels it is winning in an area. Many such factors are unobservable, but we might think most of the information about them is captured in the history of violence through time t in district i. If we look at the set of district‐weeks that have experienced similar levels of insurgent attacks in the past—say t‐4 to t—as well as similar trends over that period, then we might think that Coalition and insurgent forces operating in those district‐weeks would face similar incentives regarding the use of force and level of care taken to avoid civilian casualties. Put more starkly, insurgents who believe they are losing an area might be expected to operate more aggressively than they otherwise would.            "
"40","This expectation suggests a simple analytical path:33 (1) use a matching algorithm to identify district‐weeks with similar histories; (2) within each stratum, use a regression model to estimate the relationship between the number of civilians killed today and the number of insurgent attacks in the next period using a cubic time trend at the quarter level to control for broad secular trends;34 and (3) take the average of these results weighting by the size of the strata. The resulting estimate provides the average treatment effect for district‐weeks that experience any history of violence represented in the set of strata used at step (2).            "
"41","We match district‐weeks using the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) algorithm implemented in the cem package for Stata (Iacus, King, and Porro 2008). The procedure is quite simple. First, coarsen the data on each matching variable so that it falls into meaningful bins, just as one would when constructing a histogram. For the average number of attacks in the last five weeks, for example, the bins might be zero attacks, one attack, two to five attacks, and so on. Second, perform exact matching on the coarsened data so that all district‐weeks with roughly the same history and intensity of violence are placed in a common stratum. This procedure does not use a parametric model for selection to treatment and so is very amenable to matching for continuous treatment variables. It also has a variety of desirable properties relative to more commonly used methods such as propensity score matching, including reduced model dependence.35"
"42","Our core matching solution replicates the intuition behind the first‐differences specification. To capture incentives created by the level of insurgent attacks, we match on average rate of attacks per 100,000 people in periods t to t‐4 by dividing that rate into five bins at the 10th, 33rd, 66th, and 90th percentiles of the average. To capture incentives driven by the history of violence, we code the differences in insurgent attacks week to week according to whether they increase, remain approximately the same, or decrease.36 This three‐level coding over five periods leaves us with 243 possible histories, of which 241 are observed in the data. This approach leaves us with 493 strata with district‐weeks in both treatment and control groups and is justified to the extent that we believe matching on past insurgent violence effectively controls for characteristics impacting the propensity of actors to kill civilians.37"
"43","Table 3 summarizes the matching approach in two ways. First, we report the average marginal effect of killing one additional civilian on future insurgent attacks per 100,000 in a district‐week. Second, to reduce model dependence further we report results where we have dichotomized the independent variable, providing the difference in mean levels of future insurgent attacks per 100,000 people between weeks in which Coalition or insurgent forces kill no civilians and weeks in which they kill one or more civilians.            "
"44","Three facts stand out from this matching exercise. First, we can confirm our previous findings on Coalition‐caused casualties for the entire country and for mixed areas. In the entire country we find a significant positive treatment such that each additional civilian killed by Coalition forces predicts approximately 0.16 additional attacks in the following week per 100,000 population. This effect is fairly substantial. The median Coalition‐caused incident resulted in two civilian deaths. This means that for an average district in Iraq—which has 277,238 residents—an average Coalition‐caused incident results in roughly 0.9 extra insurgent attacks on Coalition forces in the subsequent week. Second, there is also evidence that insurgent‐caused collateral damage leads to fewer insurgent attacks, though the effects are statistically weaker in the matching estimate. An average insurgent‐caused incident involves 3.7 civilian deaths, meaning that it predicts roughly 3.6 fewer insurgent attacks on Coalition forces in the next week in the median‐sized mixed district of roughly 559,900 people. Third, the positive finding for Coalition forces is substantially larger in Sunni areas, while the negative one for the insurgents is statistically absent."
"45","Figure 5 provides a graphic intuition for these results. The x‐axis in each plot is the number of weeks before or after period t. The y‐axis in the top plot is the average marginal effect of Coalition civilian killings in time t on SIGACTs/100,000 population for the entire sample. The y‐axis in the bottom plot is the average marginal effect of insurgent civilian killings, where those effects are calculated by averaging coefficients from regressions run within matched strata weighting by the size of those strata.            "
"46","Effect of Civilian Killings on Insurgent Violence in Matched Strata (Matching on Four‐Period History of SIGACTs/100,000, and Average Insurgent Attacks)"
"47","If our procedure matched effectively and there is no causal impact of past insurgent attacks against Coalition forces on current civilian casualties within matched strata, then these differences will be close to zero through period t (or at least relatively constant) and will then spike up (or down) for at least one period after week t, reflecting the effect of killing civilians.38 These plots confirm that our matching exercise effectively controls for selection on some unobservable characteristics, at least to the extent that those unobservables would have led to differential pretreatment trends in violence. As in our core specification, greater violence against civilians by the Coalition predicts higher levels of insurgent attacks. Once we match on past histories in this manner, greater violence by insurgents against civilians (in the course of attacks on Coalition and Iraqi government forces) appears to be a weaker predictor of lower levels of attacks than in the parametric results. These plots also provide strong intuition for how to think about the duration of the treatment effect. In the Coalition cases, the treatment effect lasts two to five weeks before dropping back to statistically insignificant levels. In the insurgent case it lasts one week, is followed by increased violence in t+2, and then returns to levels that are higher than, but statistically indistinguishable from, the pretreatment trend.            "
"48","In interpreting these plots a note of caution is warranted. The results from the matching exercise do not exactly match the parametric results. They are, after all, different estimators being applied to different samples (many district‐weeks are dropped from the matched sample). What seems clear from Figure 5 is that there is a large positive change in the rate of insurgent attacks following Coalition killings. That lasts for at least two weeks. There is a smaller negative change in the rate of attacks following insurgent killings but it is much less dramatic, and there is a positive pretreatment correlation between insurgent killings and the rate of attacks in the matched sample. SE Figure 5A shows the same plot where we employ a slightly looser definition of changes in insurgent attacks to generate the history and use a cubic time trend within matched strata to control for residual imbalance (instead of the year fixed effects and linear time trend in the main results). Here the effects through t+4 are more cleanly in line with the patterns in the parametric results, but there is a long‐run difference in insurgent attacks presumably driven by omitted variables not accounted for by the cubic time trend. This figure highlights the fact that while the exact shape of the semiparametric results depends on how we match, as they should, the substantive results are similar over four to five weeks across a range of specifications. There is a clear increase in insurgent attacks after Coalition‐caused casualties for several weeks and a less dramatic one‐week decrease in attacks after insurgent‐caused casualties.            "
"49","This section considers two sets of explanations for our findings. The first set consists of theories about the nature of counterinsurgent warfare that imply a positive correlation between insurgent attacks and past civilian casualties as a consequence of Coalition unit organization and tactics. The second set consists of explanations residing in the ways in which collateral damage impacts noncombatant preferences."
"50","Two mechanisms implied by prominent theories of counterinsurgent tactical behavior imply results similar to ours. The first mechanism is based on arguments about the impact of Coalition unit tactical decisions—whether soldiers are on foot or mounted in vehicles.39Lyall and Wilson (2009) reason that mounted patrols, as opposed to foot patrols, are less able to foster relationships with the population and gather valuable intelligence information about local activity. Furthermore, these units are more likely to breed enmity among civilians because of the inconvenience posed to civilians and the disruption of their daily lives by mechanized patrols. These factors combined to lead to higher levels of insurgent attacks in areas patrolled by mounted vehicles.            "
"51","Lyall and Wilson's (2009) theoretical logic suggests two dynamics by which civilian casualties would increase in areas with more mounted patrols. First, in response to mounted patrols, insurgents could substitute into larger explosives, meaning that insurgent‐caused civilian casualties would increase. Second, mounted patrols have access to heavier weaponry, which are more likely to cause civilian casualties even if aimed accurately. Suppose that more mechanized units tend to get attacked more because they have less information. The first dynamic would create a spurious positive correlation between killings by the insurgents and attacks because the kinds of units that were being attacked more would also be the units being attacked with weapons most likely to lead to insurgent‐caused casualties. The second dynamic would create a similar spurious correlation between killings by the Coalition and attacks because the kinds of units that were being attacked more would also be the units equipped with weapons most likely to lead to Coalition‐caused casualties."
"52","Simple physics dictate that the dynamics above would operate most strongly in areas of higher population density where the consequences of an errant .50 caliber round or large IED are more likely to kill civilians. Thus, if there is a spurious positive correlation between killings and insurgent violence that is driven by mechanization—which we cannot directly test because reliable data do not exist on units’ areas of operation (AO) in Iraq or on the extent to which tactical behavior correlated with unit equipment (i.e., armored units patrolling mounted to a greater extent)—we should also find that the ratio of civilian casualties to attacks should be higher in more urban and more densely populated districts. We test this logic by regressing ratios of civilian casualties to insurgent attacks on the percent of the district that is urbanized and on the district's population density.40 These ratios are intended to capture how precisely the different parties employ violence with respect to civilians.41 We find no evidence the ratios are higher in areas of denser population or with a higher percentage of urban populations (SE Table 3). The link between unit characteristics and civilian casualties is unlikely to be driving the results.            "
"53","The second mechanism is that civilian killings by Coalition forces would correlate positively with insurgent attacks because Coalition units that engage less with the local community in their AO both kill more civilians and suffer more insurgent attacks. One proxy for community engagement by U.S. forces is the initiation of small‐scale reconstruction projects by military units under the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP).42 If better information flowing from engagement with communities allows units to be more discriminate, we should see a drop in the ratio of civilians killed by the Coalition per attack. If better information makes it harder for insurgents to operate, we should see an increase in the ratio of civilians killed by insurgents per attack. Put formally, if a relationship between engagement (i.e., interacting directly and repeatedly with civilians) and precision (ability to engage insurgents without causing collateral damage) were driving our results, then the ratio of Coalition‐caused civilian casualties per attack should be negatively correlated with the number of CERP projects initiated and the ratio of insurgent‐caused civilian casualties per attack should be positively correlated with the number of projects initiated.            "
"54","We test for this alternative explanation using two proxies for engagement, the number of CERP projects started in a given district‐quarter and the total value of those projects in millions of dollars.43 Regressing casualty ratios on these proxies, we find that neither the number of projects nor levels of spending are associated with overall casualty ratios, or casualty ratios for any specific actor (SE Table 4). This increases our confidence that the relationships we observe are not driven by the fact that units which do not engage with the communities kill more civilians and suffer more attacks.            "
"55","There are many ways in which noncombatant reactions to collateral damage might impact subsequent levels of violence. The simplest is that communities might clamor for revenge when the Coalition causes civilian casualties, leading insurgents to conduct more attacks, and might put pressure on insurgents to rein in attacks after insurgent‐caused casualties.44 This explanation seems unlikely to generate the patterns above for three reasons. First, for there to be an increase in insurgent attacks because the population clamors for revenge, insurgents would have to be producing fewer attacks than they were capable of perpetrating before the civilian casualty incident(s). That seems unlikely as a general trend, though it might be true in some places at some times. Second, this “revenge” mechanism does not have a clear prediction for variation across more or less urban districts. Third, if insurgents responded to calls to be more discriminate after they caused casualties, we would expect the reduction in attacks to be strongest for indirect fire attacks (those involving mortars and rockets), which are the least discriminate form of insurgent attack. It is, in fact, positive and statistically insignificant (SE Table 2G).45"
"56","Given this and the findings above, we need a mechanism that (1) assumes insurgents produce at capacity (or at least at the limit of what the population will tolerate as in the Berman, Shapiro, and Felter [forthcoming] “hearts and minds” model); (2) predicts the impact of civilian casualties will be strongest in urban areas and mixed sectarian regions; and (3) implies a differential response for indirect fire and suicide attacks, which are less sensitive to information leakage than other forms of attacks."
"57","One such mechanism is the combination of “sensible” civilian reactions to collateral damage with the critical role of information in Iraqi insurgency, what we term the “informational mechanism.” Versions of this mechanism have been implicit in the long tradition of analysis that emphasizes intelligence collection as the fundamental task for counterinsurgents (e.g., Galula 1964; Kitson 1971; Thompson 1966). It seems quite apt in Iraq where the ability of Coalition forces to capture and/or kill insurgents rests not on the Coalition's ability to project combat power (they have that in spades), but on the acquisition of reliable information on the whereabouts of insurgents. The conflict in Iraq is thus quite different from insurgencies where the government's capacity to produce violence is in question.46"
"58","Three commonsense assumptions about information in such settings lead directly to the core results above. First, the less information shared with government forces and their allies, the easier it is for insurgents to operate and the more attacks there will be against Coalition and Iraqi forces.47 Second, the more civilians Coalition and Iraqi government forces kill, the less information other civilians share with them voluntarily, and symmetrically, the more civilians that insurgents kill in the course of their attacks on Coalition and Iraqi government targets, the more information civilians share. Third, Coalition and Iraqi forces want fewer insurgent attacks, and insurgents want to conduct more (given, of course, that they are not engaged in negotiations or a ceasefire). While each assumption may seem obvious, the first two merit a bit of unpacking.            "
"59","With respect to the assumption that information was the key constraint on violence in Iraq, there is little qualitative evidence that the supply of fighters was an important constraint for any of the insurgent organizations. There is, however, copious evidence that insurgents were very concerned with the population's willingness to cooperate with them.48 Even if information was not the sole constraint on insurgents’ production of violence in Iraq—as it is certainly not in many conflicts—our unit of analysis naturally draws attention to it. There is little reason to expect the impact of recruits to be highly localized in time or space. Insurgent groups move personnel around for a variety of reasons, and the time lag from decision‐to‐join to attack can vary from days to months. The impact on violence of the population's willingness to share information, however, could be quite localized in both time and space. Because our analysis focuses on how changes in civilian casualties from one week to the next impact subsequent violence within confined geographical areas, it effectively focuses on factors that can respond almost immediately to changes in the treatment of civilians. We believe this approach zeroes in on the impact of informational processes as opposed to recruiting ones.            "
"60","With respect to the second assumption about how collateral damage impacts information sharing, there is a range of reasons collateral damage could affect civilians’ propensity to share information with government forces in a “sensible” manner. Adjudicating between them is not our goal, but it is useful to lay out just three of them. First, civilian casualties transmit information to the population about how a government established and organized by each armed actor would treat them. As collateral damage increases, the natural inference is that the actor responsible places relatively less value on the lives of (certain) civilians. Collateral damage therefore provides evidence about how a government organized and populated by insurgent‐ or Coalition‐selected officials will value citizens’ livelihoods in the future. If information shared by one individual can have a substantial effect on insurgents’ ability to produce violence against Coalition forces, then one logical reaction of forward‐looking civilians to mistreatment is to share more or less information."
"61","Second, civilian casualties transmit information on the threat that each side poses to the civilian's physical security in a specific time and place.49 Civilians seeking to reduce the threat to themselves and their families can therefore sensibly take actions that support the less dangerous armed actor. Certainly intimidation by one side or the other can dampen this process, but on the margins citizens caring about their personal security should become more or less willing to share information as one side or the other reveals how much of a threat they pose to civilians. The balance of opinion in the policy and military communities is that even clearly unintentional civilian casualties by government forces lead to reduced cooperation from civilians (see, e.g., Their and Ranjbar 2008).            "
"62","Third, civilian casualties can create motivations for revenge on the part of noncombatants. If civilians are aware that sharing information with counterinsurgents is costly for insurgents, then one way in which they can exact retribution for harm caused by insurgents is to share information with government forces and their allies, and vice versa for harm caused by government forces. Calling in tips requires less of a commitment, in terms of time and risk, than joining a pro‐ or antigovernment militia and so we might expect the marginal effect of civilian casualties on information sharing to be relatively large compared to the effect on participation—a slightly different revenge mechanism whose predictions we discussed above."
"63","A natural concern here is that the marginal impact on subsequent insurgent violence of any one civilian's decision to share information should be trivial, so that substantial civilian coordination would be necessary to meaningfully affect insurgent violence. If true, there would clearly be a sizable collective action problem to overcome in the context of civil conflict, and the reactions described above would not be “sensible.” In Iraq, however, individual decisions could have substantial impact. As a general rule, Coalition forces would conduct raids based on two independent sources of information and would take even single‐sourced information into account when planning patrols and the like.50 As even one successful raid could dramatically reduce insurgent capacity in a given area for weeks or even months, the decisions of just one or two civilians could have massive implications for levels of insurgent attacks.51 Over time, Coalition forces became very effective at collecting information in ways that minimized risks for informants (Anderson 2007). This meant that sharing information in response to civilian casualties was indeed sensible in that it carried relatively little risk and could have large impacts.            "
"64","Unfortunately, we cannot directly assess the impact of collateral damage on information flow to counterinsurgents because no unclassified data exist on such information transfers. Intelligence from human sources (HUMINT) is among the most highly classified types of information held by the U.S. military, and no data on tips provided to Coalition forces in Iraq exist in unclassified form. Instead, as is often the case in political science, what we can do is make a cautious case that the results are consistent with the observable implications of the information mechanism."
"65","That case rests on four findings. First, increases in Coalition‐caused civilian casualties at time t predict increased insurgent attacks at time t+1 in that district and increases in insurgent‐caused casualties predict reduced insurgent attacks at t+1.52 This symmetric average response is a prediction of the informational mechanism that is not shared by the revenge mechanism. While other mechanisms could predict such a response, they are unlikely to be driving the results, as discussed in the previous subsection. Second, the effects come from predominantly urban districts. In urban areas there are more people around who can observe what insurgents are doing, which means that (a) the number of people who could share operationally relevant information is greater and (b) it is harder for insurgents to identify informants and thus the sensitivity of information sharing to casualties should be higher. Third, the effects are strongest in mixed sect areas, exactly the places where ingroup policing is harder. In such areas intimidation of civilians to prevent them from responding “sensibly” was likely harder given the presence of multiple competing militias.53 Moreover, in mixed areas there were, due to the nature of the war, both people strongly opposed to the Coalition and people strongly opposed to the insurgency. Fourth, the impact of civilian casualties on indirect fire attacks is in the opposite direction of the main effect. If insurgents substitute into tactics which are less sensitive to information sharing when the population becomes more willing to talk to counterinsurgents, that is exactly what we should see.            "
"66","Overall then, the informational mechanism seems to be the most likely of the explanations we examined because (1) it rests on the plausible argument that if civilians share less information with counterinsurgents, then insurgents can produce more attacks because they are losing fewer men and weapons to raids and the like; and (2) it has implications for variation in the impact of collateral damage across districts and types of attacks that are largely borne out."
"67","This article answers a simple question: what are the military consequences of collateral damage in intrastate conflict? Using weekly time‐series data on civilian casualties and insurgent violence in each of Iraq's 104 districts from 2004 to early 2009, we show that both sides pay a cost for causing collateral damage. Coalition killings of civilians predict higher levels of insurgent violence and insurgent killings predict less violence in subsequent periods. These findings match those of Kocher, Pepinsky, and Kalyvas (2011) insofar as aerial bombings in Vietnam caused civilian casualties and therefore did more to reduce population cooperation with counterinsurgents than they did to reduce insurgents’ military capacities.         "
"68","The patterns we find are consistent with a theory of insurgent violence that takes civilian agency into account. In line with a long tradition of theoretical and empirical work (e.g., Berman, Shapiro and Felter forthcoming; Kalyvas 2006; Kitson 1971; Lyall and Wilson 2009), we argue that insurgents’ ability to conduct attacks is limited by the degree to which the civilian population supplies valuable information to counterinsurgents. To the extent that collateral damage causes local noncombatants to effectively punish the armed group responsible by sharing less information with that group and more with its antagonist, collateral damage by Coalition forces should increase attacks by insurgents, whereas collateral damage caused by insurgents should decrease attacks. Our data are consistent with this argument and cast doubt on several alternative explanations for the results.         "
"69","Critically, we find substantial variation across Iraq in the response to collateral damage. The effects are strongest in mixed areas and in areas with a largely urban population. We argue this suggests that the results are in fact driven by the impact of civilian casualties on noncombatants’ propensities to share valuable information with counterinsurgents because (a) the population in mixed areas has a more heterogeneous set of political preferences and so there are more people whose behavior can be swayed by civilian casualties, and (b) in predominantly urban areas, there are more noncombatants around to observe insurgents’ activities and it is harder for insurgents to wield a credible threat of retribution against informers."
"70","Alternative mechanisms explaining variation in insurgent attacks following civilian casualties as a reaction to popular pressure or as a function of Coalition tactics or unit organization receive little support in the data. If the relationship between how Coalition units patrol and their propensity for causing collateral damage were driving our results, we should have found that the ratio of Coalition‐caused casualties to insurgent attacks was greater in urban, high‐density areas. If the consequences of engagement by counterinsurgents with the community were driving our results, we should have found that proxies for that engagement—CERP spending and projects initiated per capita—reduced the ratio of Coalition‐caused civilian casualties to insurgent attacks and increase the insurgent casualty ratio. We found no evidence on either score, suggesting these alternative mechanisms are not driving the results."
"71","There are at least three broad implications of our analysis. The first is that exploring civilians’ strategic incentives is a profitable avenue for better understanding the dynamics of intrastate conflict. Our results strongly suggest civilians are making decisions about whom to cooperate with based on constantly changing information and that these decisions affect traditional variables of interest, such as violence directed against the state and its allies. The bulk of the literature implicitly discounts the possibility of noncombatants strategically exerting a sizable influence, focusing instead on the interaction between insurgents and incumbent forces (Stanton 2009) or between elements of their organization (Weinstein 2007). Our evidence suggests this is a potential limitation.         "
"72","The second implication is that the dynamics of substate conflict may depend heavily on the military balance in that conflict. Unlike the modal intrastate conflict over the last 60 years, the government side in Iraq has had—with the involvement of the United States—enormous military superiority. The conflict in Iraq is not uncommon in this regard, however. Civil conflicts often showcase such asymmetries; the Mau Mau insurgency in Kenya, the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan, and the Nationalist insurgency in Northern Ireland are but a few examples of insurgents fighting militaries that do not face a challenge in projecting military power into contested territory. In these conflicts the binding constraint on insurgent violence is likely to be an informational one, not the manpower constraint normally presumed by theories designed to explain cross‐national patterns of conflict.54 When insurgent violence is constrained by manpower limitations instead of by the availability of information to counterinsurgents, there may be a very different relationship between collateral damage and subsequent insurgent violence.         "
"73","Finally, the third implication stems from the core finding of the article: both Coalition forces and insurgents paid for their (mis)handling of civilians, at least in terms of subsequent violence. The argument is often made that even though terrorists or insurgents may not abide by the laws of war or seek to minimize collateral damage, abiding by those rules and taking on added risk is a moral obligation for forces representing liberal democracies. It turns out to be strategically advantageous: such behavior will be attractive to civilians. It also turns out that insurgents’ sanguinary tendencies hurt them, at least in this case, where information is a key constraint on the production of violence.55 In light of our results, it is no surprise that the September 2009 iteration of the Afghan Taliban “Book of Rules” includes the dictate that “The utmost steps must be taken to avoid civilian human loss in Martyrdom operations.”56 Actions that make it harder for insurgents to precisely target government forces present insurgents with a hard trade‐off between accepting greater risks to their forces and triggering adverse civilian reactions and may therefore deter insurgents concerned with popular perception.
