"1","Research on news media persuasion—and media effects more generally—faces four major obstacles that have frustrated scholars as they try to reach consensus. The first two obstacles prevent the detection of media effects, while the later two are alternative explanations for evidence that is uncovered. The first is lack of variation in message. For instance, based on the relative short‐term stability of aggregate public opinion (Converse 1990; Page and Shapiro 1992), even in the face of fierce political campaigns (Finkel 1993), some researchers infer that campaigns (and news coverage of them) leave little imprint on public opinion. Others, however, note that we should only expect opinion movement when the balance of persuasive messages varies (Erikson 1976; Zaller 1996), a surprisingly rare occurrence. They point out that rival campaign messages tend to offset each other, making aggregate opinion stability unsurprising (Bartels 1992, 2006). In the case of news outlets, the balance of persuasive messages rarely varies because each outlet usually maintains a similar political stance over long periods. The New York Times, for instance, has generally supported Democratic candidates for almost 40 years (Ansolabehere, Lessem, and Snyder 2006).         "
"2","The second obstacle preventing the detection of campaign and news media effects is that measures of exposure tend to be poor. To measure exposure, researchers often must use error‐prone variables such as whether a respondent lives in a county in which a newspaper has high circulation (e.g., Erikson 1976), general political knowledge (e.g., Price and Zaller 1993; Zaller 1992), or self‐reported campaign attention or media usage (e.g., Barker 2002; but see Bartels 1993; Hetherington 1996). These error‐prone variables introduce biases of potentially substantial magnitude and unpredictable direction (Achen 1983). Combined, the lack of variation in the balance of messages and difficulties measuring exposure are major obstacles to detecting media effects and may have led to the “minimal effects” paradigm that once dominated media effects scholarship (Klapper 1960; McGuire 1986).         "
"3","Despite these difficulties, some studies find evidence consistent with campaign or news media persuasion. When they do find such evidence, however, researchers face two additional obstacles to demonstrating these effects convincingly. These obstacles take the form of alternative explanations that are difficult to rule out. First, individuals may choose media outlets that share their politics (self‐selection), creating the appearance of persuasion. Second, media outlets may follow, not lead, their audiences' politics, which also could be mistaken for persuasion. Thus, although many studies find individual‐level associations between survey reports of exposure to certain news outlets and political opinions (Barker 1999, 2002; Barker and Lawrence 2006; Dalton, Beck, and Huckfeldt 1998; Druckman and Parkin 2005; Kahn and Kenney 2002; Lawson and McCann 2004; Newton and Brynin 2001; Project for Excellence in Journalism 2007), these associations could arise either because of media persuasion or because of these two alternatives.         "
"4","Research on media persuasion has employed several strategies to address these four obstacles. For example, Erikson (1976) finds variation in news media messages by exploiting the 1964 shift to Democratic Party endorsements by many newspapers. DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) find variation by examining the entry of the Fox News Channel onto cable systems in the late 1990s. Several studies develop better measures of exposure by using survey data to directly tie individuals to the newspapers they read, radio programs they listen to, or television shows they watch (Barker 1999, 2002; Barker and Lawrence 2006; Druckman and Parkin 2005; Lawson and McCann 2004; Newton and Brynin 2001). Laboratory experiments (e.g., Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Berinsky and Kinder 2006; Gilliam and Iyengar 2000; Iyengar and Kinder 1987) can avoid many inferential pitfalls, but face concerns over external validity. Field experiments greatly reduce concerns about external validity, but, so far, are rare (but see Gerber, Karlan, and Bergan 2006).         "
"5","However, few studies directly examining news media persuasion convincingly surmount all four obstacles. Some studies that come closest to surmounting the obstacles find large media effects (Veblen 1975; Zaller 1996). Yet, these only examine outcomes such as policy opinions or primary election votes, not votes in national elections, which may be more difficult to shift. A few recent persuasion studies use approaches surmounting these obstacles and find evidence of large television advertising effects (e.g., Huber and Arceneaux 2007; Johnston, Hagen, and Jamieson 2004) and substantial elite influence on public opinion (e.g., Gabel and Scheve 2007; Zaller 1992), but do not examine news media persuasion. In sum, formidable methodological obstacles and the tendency of the most convincing studies to focus on other types of media effects have left the question of whether major news outlets can readily shift national‐level, major party vote choice largely unanswered.         "
"6","In this article, we examine the effect of newspaper endorsements and slant in the 1997 UK general election. It presents a rare opportunity to study media persuasion because it provides the elements necessary to overcome the aforementioned obstacles. First, this election has variation in media messages: a shift in the editorial stance and tone of coverage of some newspapers but not others. Soon after the 1992 election, in response to the United Kingdom's ejection from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, a recession, and Conservative Party leadership squabbles and scandals, most British newspapers became less enthusiastic about the Conservative government, including longtime supporters like the Times and Daily Mail (McNair 2003, 159–60; Norris 1998; Seymour‐Ure 1997; Tunstall 1996, 254–55). Although most papers merely dampened their Conservative support, several papers eventually went further, suddenly breaking with their past behavior by endorsing the Labour Party during the 1997 election campaign.         "
"7","In particular, the Sun, which had the largest circulation in Great Britain,1 broke with its strident support for the Conservatives and swung its support to Labour (McNair 2003; Norris 1998; Seymour‐Ure 1997). The Sun announced its shift with a front‐page endorsement of Tony Blair on the second day of the official 1997 campaign (McNair 2003). It labeled Blair a “strong, dynamic, purposeful leader” whom Britain was “crying out for” (Scammell and Harrop 1997, 160) and finished the campaign with an election‐day cover photo of Blair and a banner headline proclaiming, “IT MUST BE YOU”[caps in original] (179).2 According to published accounts, the Sun's owner, Rupert Murdoch, dictated the Sun's shift (Cassidy 2006; Scammell and Harrop 1997). He reportedly did so in part because Blair made policy concessions, including assuring Murdoch of his moderate views on European integration and offering Murdoch a friendly regulatory environment (Cassidy 2006; McGuire and McKinney 1997; Smith 2006).3 Besides the Sun, three smaller newspapers switched from no endorsement in 1992 to a Labour endorsement in the 1997 election. These were the Daily Star, Independent, and Financial Times. Table 1 classifies newspapers by their partisan slant in 1992 and 1997 (based on Scammell and Harrop 1997, Seymour‐Ure 1997, and Norris 1998) and provides estimates of the size of their respective readerships in 1996.4"
"8","While most British newspapers became critical of the Conservative government during its 1992–97 term and positive toward Blair personally, these papers' endorsements of Labour were surprising. These “switching” papers had no recent histories of supporting Labour and did not leak their endorsements in advance. Of all traditional Conservative Party papers, the Times had had the earliest and often most serious criticisms of John Major's government (McNair 2003), yet did not endorse Labour in 1997. Scammell and Harrop (1997, 160) recount the Sun's switch this way:         "
"9","                        "
"10","Until the [Sun] declared for Labour, with deadly timing on the day after Major announced the election, it had been careful to distinguish between the admirable Blair and his dubious party. Now, on the instructions of Rupert Murdoch, the Sun threw its weight behind Labour, to the obvious discomfort of some correspondents, including its political editor, Trevor Kavanagh.               "
"11","The Sun's campaign coverage emphasized Blair's leadership abilities and Major's ineptitude. Unsurprisingly for a tabloid, it did not delve into the policy issues at stake in the election (Seymour‐Ure 1997). By providing a rare case of over‐time variation in communication flows, the unexpected switch in partisan slant by these four newspapers during the 1997 campaign provides an opportunity to estimate the persuasive effect of news media outlets on voting behavior.         "
"12","In exploiting changes by these papers, we capture both the effects of the editorial endorsement and changed slant in news coverage. In a media environment in which papers endorse on the front page, the line between editorials and news is blurry. While distinct in theory, these are too confounded to differentiate here.5"
"13","This case is also unusually well suited for studying media persuasion because the British media environment facilitates more accurate measurement of individuals' exposure to press messages (Newton and Brynin 2001), overcoming the second major obstacle faced by media effect studies. In the United States, for instance, connecting survey respondents with the endorsement of their newspapers is difficult because most people read local papers, and respondents in national samples thus read hundreds of different papers. In Britain, however, the major daily newspapers have national distribution, so one can more easily connect respondents in national surveys with the contents of the paper each one reads.         "
"14","To examine the effect of these editorial and slant shifts, we use the British Election Panel Study 1992–97 (BEPS), which interviewed the same national sample four times before the endorsement shifts (in 1992, 1994, 1995, and 1996) and once afterwards (following the 1997 election). This panel survey provides a least four elements that aid causal inference. First, it allows us to rule out self‐selection because we can measure which papers respondents read before the endorsement shifts. While other tests of media persuasion with panel data remain vulnerable to self‐selection bias,6 the suddenness of these shifts makes the prospect of self‐selection remote. Among voters in the BEPS sample, 211 read one of the slant‐switching papers in 1996 (the last wave before the endorsement shifts), which, using terms suitable for a quasi‐experiment, we refer to as receiving the Treatment. We refer to the 1,382 panelists who either read papers whose partisan slants were constant or who did not read a paper as the control or untreated group.7 To rule out the possibility that readers in 1996 sensed future endorsement shifts, we also use readership in the first wave (1992) to instrument the treatment. Second, the BEPS enables us to address concerns about measurement error by constructing an additional, more demanding, measure of the treatment: habitual readership. We code individuals as habitual readers when they read one of the switching papers in every wave in which they were interviewed before the endorsement shifts. Third, the multiple panel waves enable us to measure many other characteristics that might differ between the treatment and control individuals, and to do so before the papers switched (pretreatment). Moreover, the large number of control subjects (1,382) allows us to correct for bias from spurious covariates that vary across treatment and control groups using parametric models and matching techniques. Finally, the multiple pretreatment interviews also permit us to conduct placebo tests (or falsification tests), which help to further rule out omitted variable bias and reverse causation. To summarize in more technical language, the BEPS allows us to estimate the treatment effect with a quasi‐experimental, difference‐in‐differences design (Angrist and Krueger 1999; Athey and Imbens 2006; Shadish, Cook, and Campbell 2002), while correcting for nonrandom selection on observables with parametric techniques and matching, and assessing bias from nonrandom selection on unobservables with placebo tests and sensitivity analysis.         "
"15","Two studies already examine newspaper influence in the 1997 election. Newton and Brynin (2001) study the role of newspaper endorsements in the 1992 and 1997 UK elections, finding evidence of news media persuasion. To help eliminate bias from self‐selection, they improve upon previous studies by comparing individuals who read newspapers consistent with their partisan identification with those who did not. They find, for example, that Conservative Party identifiers are more likely to vote Conservative when they report reading a Conservative paper compared to those who read Labour papers. As with other endorsement studies discussed above, however, these results remain vulnerable to bias from self‐selection. For example, Conservative Party identifiers who choose to read Labour papers may do so precisely because they are more predisposed to vote against the Conservative Party.         "
"16","In the second study, Norris et al. (1999) directly examine the influence of the Sun's switch in the 1997 election. In contrast with our analysis below, they find no association between newspaper readership and vote change between waves of the 1997 British Election Campaign Study (BECS). However, unlike the panel data used in this paper (the BEPS), the first interview in the BECS occurred two to four weeks after the official six‐week campaign began and thus after newspapers issued their endorsements. Consequently, that study misses any persuasion that occurred between the endorsements and this first interview.8"
"17","In addition, several studies examine the effects of newspaper endorsements in other contexts (Bullock 1984; Erikson 1976; Gavin and Sanders 2003; Kahn and Kenney 2002; Lessem 2003; Lieske 1989; MacKuen and Coombs 1981; Robinson 1974, 1976; Veblen 1975). However, none is able to marshal the advantageous events and data available here, while applying modern econometric techniques to assess the validity of causal inferences. To our knowledge, no existing observational study of news media persuasion combines all of these qualities crucial to identifying causation.         "
"18","Did the change in partisan endorsements and news slant by the Sun, Daily Star, Independent, and Financial Times persuade readers to vote differently than they would have otherwise? The evidence suggests that it did. Figure 1 straightforwardly compares the increase in the percentage of voters choosing Labour between 1992 and 1997 among those who did and did not read these papers.9 Among those who did not, the percent voting for Labour rises by only 10.8 percentage points, from 32.2 to 43.0%. Among those who did, it rises considerably more: 19.4 points, from 38.9 to 58.3%. Consequently, switching paper readers were 6.6% more likely to vote for Labour in 1992 and 15.2% more likely to do so in 1997. Thus, reading a switching paper corresponds with an (15.2 − 6.6 =) 8.6 point greater increase in the likelihood of voting for Labour. This statistically significant estimate of the bivariate treatment effect, presented in Column 1 of the top section of Table 2, suggests that the shifts in newspaper slant were indeed persuasive.            "
"19","                 Persuasive Effect of Endorsement Changes on Labour Vote Choice between 1992 and 1997                         "
"20","This figure shows that reading a paper that switched to Labour is associated with an (15.2 − 6.6 =) 8.6 percentage point shift to Labour between the 1992 and 1997 UK elections. Paper readership is measured in the 1996 wave, before the papers switched, or, if no 1996 interview was conducted, in an earlier wave. Confidence intervals show one standard error."
"21","Of course, readers of the switching papers potentially differ from control individuals on a myriad of attributes, and these differences, rather than reading a paper that switched, could be inflating this bivariate relationship. By design, we reduce the possibility that such differences result from self‐selection by measuring readership before these papers unexpectedly switched to Labour. Nevertheless, differences could still exist. As is evident in Figure 1, for instance, switching paper readers were more likely to vote for Labour in 1992, which may also be indicative of a greater predisposition among these readers toward switching to Labour in the future.            "
"22","To address the possibility that differences on other attributes, not the slant changes, caused switching paper readers' greater shift to Labour, we condition on a large number of potentially confounding variables. We searched the literature and conducted our own analysis to determine what other variables are associated with shifting to a Labour vote. In all cases, we measure these control (or conditioning) variables before the endorsement shifts to avoid bias that can result from measuring control variables after the treatment (posttreatment bias). Unless otherwise specified, these are measured in the 1992 panel wave.10 Based on our analysis, the best predictor of shifting to Labour is, not surprisingly, respondents' prior evaluations of the Labour Party (see AppendixTable 1). Respondents who did not vote for Labour in 1992, but who rated Labour favorably, are much more likely than are others to shift their votes to Labour in 1997. To account for any differences in evaluations of Labour, we include Prior Labour Party Support as well as Prior Conservative Party Support as controls. We also include indicator variables for Prior Labour Vote, Prior Conservative Vote, Prior Liberal Vote, Prior Labour Party Identification, Prior Conservative Party Identification, Prior Liberal Party Identification, and whether their Parents Voted Labour.            "
"23","In addition to support for the parties, we find that a six‐item scale of Prior Ideology (Heath, Evans, and Martin 1994; Heath et al. 1999) proves a good predictor of switching to a Labour vote. Given the housing market crash earlier in John Major's term (Butler and Kavanagh 1997, 247), we expect that a self‐reported measure of respondents' Prior Coping with Mortgage might explain vote shifts.11 We are also concerned that the tabloid format of the Sun and Daily Star might attract readers of a lower socioeconomic status—Labour's traditional base. One might expect these readers to return to the reinvigorated Labour Party, which had been out of favor for two decades. To account for such differences, we include Prior Education, Prior Income, Prior Working Class Identification, whether a respondent is a Prior Trade Union Member, whether he or she identifies as White, a six‐item scale of Prior Authoritarianism (Heath, Evans, and Martin 1994; Heath et al. 1999), as well as Prior Profession and Prior Region. We also account for differences in Age and Gender, both of which Butler and Kavanagh (1997, 247) find to be associated with switching one's vote to Labour in 1997. Finally, to account for further differences between the treated and untreated groups on variables that might moderate persuasion, we also include Prior Political Knowledge and whether the respondent is a Prior Television Viewer or a Prior Daily Newspaper Reader. Finally, given that Blair positioned himself as a centrist, moderates may have shifted to Blair at higher rates, so we also include a measure of Prior Ideological Moderation created by folding over the six‐item ideology scale. Except for 1992 vote choice, missing values on these variables are imputed.12 The results remain substantively identical without the imputation.            "
"24","Reassuringly, readers of switching papers are in fact surprisingly similar to control respondents on these covariates. Table 3 compares the characteristics of the two groups. Relative to untreated individuals, treated respondents are a bit less politically knowledgeable, more working class, more educated, and more female. The net direction of the bias from these differences is not obvious a priori. Some differences likely predispose the treated to shift toward Labour, while others predispose them against shifting.            "
"25","Does the evidence of persuasion hold after controlling for these differences? Columns 2–6 of the top section of Table 2 present estimates of the treatment effect after applying various methods to account for them. We first describe the methods used in each column and then discuss the estimates. Column 2 uses a parametric approach: a probit model that includes all the variables listed in Table 3 as controls, with most categorical variables entered as a series of indicator variables, including fixed effects for region and occupation (see Table 1A in the appendix for the full results).            "
"26","Controlling for differences parametrically, however, has the disadvantage of making assumptions about the functional form of covariates that, if false, can bias estimates of causal effects (Achen 2002). This is especially true when treated and control groups differ on key covariates. For example, our probit model assumes that the effect of Working‐Class Identification on switching to Labour is linear (in the probit link function). Since treated and untreated individuals do differ somewhat on this variable, the model would fail to account correctly for these differences if this variable's effect on switching to Labour is nonlinear. This problem potentially applies to other functional form assumptions such as possible variable interactions. To address these problems, we also employ matching techniques. Matching reduces omitted variable bias without making strong assumptions about functional form of covariates and increases the robustness of treatment effect estimates to model specification choices (Ho et al. 2007). Since the “true model” can never be known with certainty (Achen 1982; King 1991), these are important advantages.            "
"27","The intuition behind matching is straightforward. Instead of estimating the effect in the full sample, we first match treated with untreated respondents on observed covariates. We then drop individuals who lack matches, ensuring that the two groups are very similar on these characteristics. Consequently, differences in voting between treated and untreated individuals in the matched sample are more likely to result from the treatment itself, rather than differences on covariates."
"28","We apply two types of matching: exact and genetic. Columns 3 and 4 present estimates of the treatment effects employing exact matching. We drop treated and untreated respondents who lack an exact match on the following variables, ensuring the treated and untreated groups are identical on these characteristics: Labour Vote, Conservative Vote, Liberal Vote, Labour Identification, Conservative Identification, Liberal Identification, Labour Support, Conservative Support, and Political Knowledge.13 We then apply a probit model to this subset of the original sample. Analogous to Columns 1 and 2, Column 3 of Table 2 presents the treatment effect without parametric controls, and Column 4 presents the treatment effect from a probit model with control variables.            "
"29","With exact matching, we are limited to the categorical variables we consider most important because exact matching on additional variables results in a precipitous loss of respondents. However, the models in Columns 5 and 6 attempt to balance the treated and untreated groups on all the Table 3 variables using a genetic approach developed by Diamond and Sekhon (2005). As the last column of Table 3 illustrates, genetic matching achieves good balance on all the covariates.14 By matching on all covariates, we further reduce concerns about omitted variables and functional form assumptions.            "
"30","Both matching and parametric controls attempt to eliminate bias from nonrandom selection on observables. If the estimated treatment effect arose from such bias, it should vanish when we employ these methods. Looking across the results in the top section of Table 2, however, the effect size is robust to controls and is always statistically significant at conventional levels. The estimates vary somewhat, ranging from 8.6 to 14.0 percentage points for all treated readers and 12.7 to 25.7 for habitual readers.15 Thus, a substantively and statistically significant effect persists across these different approaches to nonrandom selection on observables.16"
"31","Given this large persuasive effect, we explored several mechanisms of persuasion and whether some individuals are more susceptible (treatment interactions), but data limitations prevent any strong inferences. For example, given that the Sun's official endorsement article emphasized Major's incompetence and Blair's strong leadership skills (Seymour‐Ure 1997), it may have persuaded readers by convincing them Blair was a stronger leader. Although the BEPS asks about Blair's and Major's leadership abilities, the questions produce almost universally positive ratings for Blair and almost universally negative ratings for Major. As switching paper readers do not differ from others on this question, these data fail to shed light on this mechanism of persuasion. We also find some evidence that treatment effects are larger among those who self‐report as working class or as having trouble coping with their mortgages, but no evidence of political knowledge interactions (Zaller 1992, 1996). (See footnote 2 for more details.) Thus, although some findings are suggestive, the sample size and limitations of the survey items restrict our ability to understand the precise mechanism of and susceptibility to this persuasion.            "
"32","We conduct several additional tests of robustness of the main finding. To address concerns that strong Conservative supporters may have self‐selected away from switching papers between 1992 and 1996, as well as concerns about other nonrandom selection into the treatment group, the seventh column of Table 2 presents an instrumental variables model where we instrument readership in 1996 with readership in 1992.17 This approach produces a treatment effect similar to the other models: 10.9%.18 As another test of robustness, we estimate the treatment effect between 1996 and 1997 (instead of between 1992 and 1997), using the hypothetical vote choice question in 1996 as the measure of previous vote, and measuring the controls in 1996 instead of 1992.19 With 1996 as the baseline, the treatment effect estimates increase somewhat. The probit coefficient for the treatment effect is .71 (s.e. = .18, n = 1330), implying a marginal effect of approximately 10 percent. Thus, our result holds up nicely against a wide range of controls, measured either early or late in the panel. Finally, Table 2A in the appendix shows that the treatment effect does not appear to be specific to a subset of the switching papers. It is robust among only readers of the Sun and only readers of the other three switching papers, though the estimate is larger for the latter. (Readership of the three other switching papers is too small to estimate their independent effects with precision.) In summary, the persuasive effect observed in Figure 1 does not appear to be an artifact of differences on the observed covariates. Reading one of the papers that switched to Labour appears to have persuaded people to vote for Labour.            "
"33","While the persuasive effect does not appear to result from differences between the treated and untreated groups on the variables discussed above, it could arise from differences on variables we have failed to incorporate in the analysis, that is, from nonrandom selection into treatment and control groups on unobserved characteristics. To address this concern, we conduct two placebo tests and a sensitivity analysis. The first placebo test assesses whether our covariates are capturing all relevant differences between the treated and untreated. Although the United Kingdom did not hold a general election in 1996, that year's wave asked how respondents would have voted had there been an election. If the covariates are capturing the key differences between the groups, we should find little difference between the treated and untreated respondents' 1996 vote intentions in the matched samples, because the treated had not yet received the treatment. The bottom row of Table 3 presents this placebo test. Even though we do not match on 1996 vote intention, differences on it largely disappear in the matched data. In the full sample, the treated are 6.6% more likely to vote for Labour in 1996. This difference falls to only 2.2% in the exactly matched sample and 1.7% in the genetically matched sample, suggesting observed covariates successfully account for most of the difference in the tendency to vote for Labour in 1996.            "
"34","The long panel allows us also to conduct a second placebo test to further address concerns about unobservables. With this long panel, we can examine individuals who read the Sun, Daily Star, Independent, or Financial Times in early waves of the panel, but stop reading these papers before the Labour endorsements. Since these individuals are similar to our treated respondents on the key observed characteristic—initially reading one of these papers—we might also suspect them to be similar on unobserved characteristics. Of the 1,382 untreated respondents, 120 fall into this category: they read the Sun, Daily Star, Independent, or Financial Times but stop before 1996 and so presumably fail to receive the treatment. Among them, we see no evidence of a treatment effect. Relative to the other control group members, they are slightly less likely, not more likely, to shift their votes to Labour (a difference of −3.59 percentage points; s.e. = 3.8).            "
"35","Finally, we can also address concerns about unobservables through a sensitivity analysis that examines the plausibility of an omitted variable creating the appearance of an effect in the absence of a true effect (Rosenbaum 2002). In our case, to take an illustrative example, for an omitted variable to have generated the 8.6% (bivariate) effect, it would have to do at least as good a job predicting 1997 vote as one's prior vote and be differentiated across readership by more than .3 on a 1‐point scale. Since none of the observed covariates differs this much across readership (the largest is Prior Working‐Class Identification at .134), an omitted variable or group of omitted variables seems unlikely to be the source of our findings. Thus, two placebo tests and a sensitivity analysis assuage concerns about bias from differences on unobservables.            "
"36","Another alternative explanation for our finding is that switching papers may have shifted to Labour between 1992 and 1997 because they observed their readers shifting to Labour and then followed them (McNair 2003). To address this concern, we conduct a third placebo test by checking that readers of these papers do not begin shifting to Labour before the 1997 campaign. We do so by verifying that the persuasion effect only emerges between the 1996 and 1997 waves of the panel. Finding that it emerges before 1996, that is, before the endorsement switches, would raise concerns about reverse causation. Our dependent variable for this third placebo test is the vote intention question in the 1996 wave (used in the first placebo test). Figure 2 presents the persuasive effect, as in Figure 1, while also showing vote intention for the treated and untreated in 1996, just before the treatment. It further differentiates between two types of treatment groups: all readers (top panel) and habitual readers (bottom panel).20 As expected, the treatment effect is absent before the 1997 wave, reducing concerns that the endorsement shifts were responses to already changing voting preferences among readers of these papers.21"
"37","                 The Treatment Effect Only Emerges in 1997                         "
"38","Using the hypothetical vote choice question asked in the 1996 wave, this figure shows that the treatment effect only emerges after 1996. Habitual readers are those who read a paper that switched in every wave in which they were interviewed before the 1997 wave. Respondents who failed to report a vote choice or vote intent in any of the three waves are excluded from the analysis, which results in a smaller n than in Figure 1. Confidence intervals show one standard error.                        "
"39","In summary, the treated group's shift to Labour did not occur before the endorsement shifts, but afterwards. Of course, treated readers could have shifted after the 1996 interviews but before the 1997 endorsement announcements. Although we cannot rule this out, treated and untreated groups are so similar on covariates that it seems unlikely the treated shifted suddenly to Labour in this short interval, long after the Conservative government had become deeply unpopular."
"40","Another remaining concern is that Conservative readers may have self‐selected away from reading switching papers before the 1996 panel wave. Many previously pro‐Conservative papers, including switching papers like the Sun, Daily Star, and Financial Times, became critical of Major's government after the 1992 election. This coverage could have provoked Conservative supporters to drop these papers and Labour supporters to read them, leaving switching paper readers potentially more vulnerable to persuasion.            "
"41","Although plausible, we find little evidence consistent with this account. In the previous section, we showed that readers of switching papers did not become more predisposed to Labour between 1992 and 1996 (compared to others), indicating no net tendency by Conservative supporters to stop reading switching papers before they switched. To address this concern further, we examine newspaper readership across the panel, but find little evidence of self‐selection by readers between the 1992 and the 1996 waves. The defection rate from switching papers to other papers or no paper between 1992 and 1996 was identical for 1992 Labour and Conservative voters: 36.6 and 36.5%, respectively. Additionally, slightly more 1992 Labour voters left switching papers for Labour papers than 1992 Conservative voters left the switching papers for Conservative papers: 11 versus 9%.22 Similar patterns emerge when we examine 1992 partisan identification instead of 1992 vote choice. For instance, 1992 Labour identifiers abandoned switching papers for Labour papers at about the same rate as 1992 Conservative identifiers abandoned the switching papers for Conservative papers: 8.6%. Thus, there is little evidence of self‐selection between the 1992 wave and the 1996 wave (when we measure readership).            "
"42","Although Conservative supporters generally do not drop out of the treatment group at higher rates, they may be more likely to drop out of the panel all together. Panel attrition could be higher for them if they dislike speaking with an interviewer about the seemingly dismal prospects of their party. To ensure that these difficult‐to‐persuade individuals do not drop out of the panel at higher rates, we check the attrition rates for various groups, but find no cause for concern. In fact, a higher percentage of 1992 Labour voters drop out of the panel between 1992 and 1997 than do Conservative voters, 47 versus 44%, respectively. Similarly, those who strongly support Labour (on the Labour Support variable) drop out of the panel at a higher rate than those who strongly oppose Labour, 50 versus 43%, respectively.23"
"43","Using panel data and matching techniques, we exploit a rare change in news slant and find strong evidence of news media persuasion. By comparing readers of newspapers that switched to similar individuals who did not read these newspapers, we estimate that these papers persuaded a considerable share of their readers to vote for Labour. We emphasize again the unusual confluence that permits us to estimate this persuasive effect while avoiding many of the methodological problems that plague previous studies. First, we have an uncharacteristic change in the partisan slant of newspapers. Second, we can measure individuals' exposure to these news outlets before the shift occurs. Third, the large sample size of the BEPS allows us to address omitted variable bias by matching similar exposed and unexposed respondents in addition to the standard parametric techniques. Finally, the many pretreatment panel waves in the BEPS allow us to address various other potential sources of bias and conduct several placebo tests. To our knowledge, no other observational media persuasion study combines these attributes."
"44","Depending on the statistical approach, our point estimates of the persuasive effect of news endorsements and slant vary from about 10% to as high as 25% of readers. If, in the 1997 UK election, the Sun's endorsement was in exchange for a friendly regulatory environment for Murdoch, the concession may have bought Blair between 8 and 20% of his 3.9 million‐vote margin over the Conservatives. The magnitude of this effect is not just larger than those found in previous press endorsement studies, which usually find persuasion effects between 1 and 5% (Erikson 1976; Krebs 1998; Lessem 2003), but also suggests that the influence of media endorsements and slant on vote choice is large relative to other well‐documented effects on voting. For example, it is larger than the incumbency advantage in U.S. House elections, one of the most studied effects in political science, which has averaged about five percentage points in recent decades (for a review, see Ansolabehere et al. 2006).

"45","At the outset, we posed Zaller's (1996) question of whether democratic stability is the product of citizen or elite behavior. Our results offer no solace for those who worry that the public is too easily swayed by the power of mass communication. They indicate that stable elite communication flows, rather than any inherent durability of public preferences, are the likely source of the consistency and relative moderation found in many democracies.         "
"46","In summary, our analysis provides rare evidence that the news media exert a strong influence on mass political behavior. Consequently, the previous consensus that media messages are minor factors in shaping election outcomes may not just need to be revised, as it already has been, but reversed. Based on these findings, news media messages can be one of the most powerful influences on voting documented by political scientists."
