"1","Majority rule can be unstable. Unless certain stylized conditions are met, theories of multidimensional voting suggest that majority rule should produce unstable coalitions and majority cycles (McKelvey 1976; Plott 1967; Schoeld 1978).1 Riker (1980, 1982) made a powerful case against democracy using those results. He claimed that majority rule is inherently indeterminate and cannot reveal a coherent popular will without additional institutional constraints.         "
"2","Such findings create a puzzle for the U.S. Constitutional Convention, which was governed by majority rule with almost no additional constraints. Did the decisions of the Constitutional Convention reflect the will of a majority of state delegations? Were parts of the Constitution in a majority cycle?"
"3","This article has two goals. First, it attempts to evaluate the stability of coalitions and presence of majority cycles over the issue of legislative apportionment before and during the Constitutional Convention, using each state's vote share as a measure of its interest. This provides an example of majority cycling for a literature struggling to find examples (Gehrlein and Lepelley 2010; Mackie 2003; Regenwetter et al. 2006). Second, the article determines whether vote shares can provide new insights into why the Convention proposed and adopted the Three‐Fifths Clause for the House and equal apportionment for the Senate.         "
"4","Our analysis assumes delegates would limit themselves to the nine principled rules of apportionment proposed at the Constitutional Convention, rather than all possible distributions,2 and compares apportionment rules in terms of dominance relationships. For the purposes of this article, apportionment rule A strictly dominates apportionment rule B if and only if a majority of states receive a greater vote share from A than from B.3 Given these assumptions, we find that coalitional stability depended upon the number of states making decisions. With 13 states, equal apportionment strictly dominated all of the other principled rules proposed at the Convention, helping us to explain why equal apportionment could not be dislodged when the Articles of Confederation were created. With Rhode Island and New Hampshire absent during the first third of the Convention, the same set of rules—including the infamous Three‐Fifths Clause adopted for the House and equal state apportionment adopted for the Senate—were in a top cycle.4 We suggest that the Three‐Fifths Clause was adopted during this period partly because of the cycle. After New York departed, the Three‐Fifths Clause, equal apportionment, and a few other rules became coalitionally stable, allowing the Great Compromise to be reached. This helps us explain why the Three‐Fifths Clause for the House and equal apportionment for the Senate were adopted and remained in place.         "
"5","We begin by briefly reviewing the concept of coalitional instability and introducing an example of cycling over vote shares from the Constitutional Convention. We then review relevant literature, introduce the nine principled rules of apportionment proposed, and describe how the states stood to gain from each. We then use the incentive structure stemming from vote shares to describe why the Three‐Fifths Clause was proposed and initially passed. We conclude with a few thoughts about the implications of our research for the problem of legislative apportionment."
"6","Voting on apportionment is a high‐stakes version of a divide‐the‐dollar game. Consider a legislature with three players, , attempting to divide a scarce resource, such as the distribution of seats in a national legislature. Players take turns proposing a distribution of seats until a majority of players settle on a distribution that (1) allocates at least one seat to each player (which we will temporarily model as ), and (2) defeats all other feasible distributions. The feasible distributions for this game are            "
"7","The result is fairly general (Ward 1961). If all allocations are possible and the preferences of players are unrestricted, then a top cycle is likely to encompass the entire set of alternatives, similar to McKelvey's (1976) and Schofield's (1978) seminal results for multidimensional voting models. For this reason, we should not expect majority rule to produce stability over constant‐sum issues like apportionment. However, our article deals with only nine proposals. A set of nine points drawn from a multidimensional space with a global top cycle may not include a cycle itself. Hence, there is no a priori reason to conclude that cycles existed among the apportionments proposed at the Convention.         "
"8","We will assume a cycle exists whenever a voting rule, such as majority rule, produces cycling in the dominance relationship. See Table 1 for an example. Table 1 includes the vote shares of 11 states from three different methods of apportionment that were actually proposed at the Convention. In this case, six states (a majority of 11) received greater vote shares from apportioning a chamber using the quota of contributions (Co), a method proposed in the Virginia Plan, than apportioning the chamber according to the number of free inhabitants (F) in each state, and six states received greater vote shares from F than from the Three‐Fifths Clause (3f). One might think that if Co dominates F and F dominates 3f, then Co must dominate 3f. But this is not the case. A majority of states receive greater vote shares from 3f than from Co, indicating a majority cycle. In such cases, group preferences based on dominance relationships are inconsistent, and different majorities will attain greater vote shares from different apportionment rules.         "
"9","Historians who study the Constitutional Convention have focused on different topics. They often describe the long, drawn‐out debate on apportionment and how the Convention almost came to a full stop over the issue (Beeman 2009; Fehrenbacher 2001; Rakove 1987). Many claim that Northerners compromised with Southerners over the Three‐Fifths Clause to keep the South in the union and that the large‐state delegates compromised with the small‐state delegates on equal apportionment in the Senate. Some even claim that the union would have dissolved without these deals (Levinson 2015; Rakove 1996).         "
"10","Political scientists, in contrast, have focused their attention on estimating the coherence of the large‐state and small‐state coalitions across the Convention (Jillson 1981, 2002), the influence of individual delegates (Dougherty and Heckelman 2006), and why some of the large‐state delegates changed their position on apportionment (Pope and Treier 2011). Studying a slightly later period, Eguia (2013) has applied the theory of coalitional stability to the formation of parties in the first congresses.         "
"11","What the literature neglects is that nine principled rules of apportionment were proposed at the Constitutional Convention and even more were scribbled in the notes and plans of government authored by the delegates. A multiplicity of coalitions could have formed in support of different rules of apportionment, and there is no reason to believe that the Three‐Fifths Clause in one chamber and equal apportionment in the other were inevitable. As we shall see, when these rules were adopted initially, a majority of states would have received greater vote shares from something else."
"12","Voting in the Congress of the Confederation and the Constitutional Convention was conducted in state blocs, with each delegation casting one vote. The size of each delegation varied from two to eight members, depending upon the number of delegates appointed by each state. The vote of a state was determined by a majority of its delegates. A tie was treated as an abstention."
"13","The Convention's remaining rules fostered an “institution‐free” environment. Delegates were recognized in the order in which they rose from their seats to speak or to propose. No delegate could speak on an issue more than twice before all delegates had a chance to speak on the same issue. There were no rights of first recognition or other mechanisms that would allow someone to control the agenda. Any delegate could propose a motion, propose to table a motion, or propose to revisit a motion that had previously failed or passed."
"14","Eighteen different rules of apportionment were proposed at the Constitutional Convention that had an identifiable distribution of seats, nine of which were principled and nine of which were ad hoc. We focus exclusively on the principled rules because delegates wanted a perpetual union that could adjust to demographic changes (see Table 2). The ad hoc rules were mostly considered for apportioning the first legislature before the first census.5 Vote shares associated with the principled rules are in the appendix.         "
"15","The status quo leading into the Constitutional Convention was equal representation (E), which gave each state one vote. This was the rule used in the First Continental Congress and the Articles of Confederation. John Witherspoon (NJ) defended the idea:            "
"16","The colonies should in fact be considered as individuals; and that as such in all disputes they should have an equal vote. [T]hey are now collected as individuals making a bargain with each other, and of course [have] a right to vote as individuals.…[H]e admitted that equality of representation was an excellent principle; but it must be of things which are co‐ordinate; that is of things similar, and of the same nature. (Ford et al. 1904–37, VI: 1103)               "
"17","Witherspoon viewed the Articles of Confederation as a compact between individual, sovereign states. As such, he thought each state should be treated equally in the Congress of the Confederation (Dougherty 2001, 29).         "
"18","Delegates from the larger states disagreed. Henry Middleton (SC) wanted to apportion representation under the Articles of Confederation according to the amount each state paid to the national government ‐ Co in Table 2 (Ford et al. 1904–37, VI: 1081). John Adams (MA) and Benjamin Rush (PA) wanted to apportion seats in proportion to state populations (Ford et al. 1904–37, VI: 1104–05). Neither idea succeeded.         "
"19","When the Constitutional Convention began in 1787, delegates from the larger states refused to be defeated again. They proposed a variety of rules of apportionment, each of which advantaged a different set of states. The first ideas were written in the Virginia Plan—an outline of government that was presented at the beginning of the meeting. The Plan recommended apportioning the lower house using either the quotas of contribution or free inhabitants. Presumably, the Convention would pick between the two."
"20","Quotas of contribution apportioned the legislature in proportion to the amount each state paid in taxes. The idea would give states that paid more a greater say over how monies would be spent. It was also used in Massachusetts in the early 1780s (Taylor 1961).         "
"21","James Wilson (PA) proposed apportioning the lower house by “the whole number of white & other free Citizens & inhabitants of every age sex & condition including those bound to servitude for a term of years and three‐fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing description except Indians not paying taxes, in each State” (Farrand 1966, I: 201, emphasis added). This was the infamous Three‐Fifths Clause, which combined a popularly based apportionment with one of the more valuable types of property in one chamber. Eleven states agreed to the same ratio for apportioning congressional requisitions in 1783, giving Wilson some confidence that this ratio might succeed (Farrand 1966, I: 205; Ford et al. 1904–37, XXIV: 260–61).6"
"22","Later in the Convention, Abraham Baldwin (GA) recommended apportioning the upper house in proportion to the value of property in each state ‐ Pr in Table 2 (Farrand 1966, I: 469–70, 475). The justification for representation based on property traced back to the liberal idea that property could not be taken without the consent of the people or their representatives. A member of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1780, Theophilus Parsons, thought “the only objects of legislation…are the person and property of the individuals which compose the state.…If the law affects the property only, the consent of those who hold a majority of the property is enough” (Taylor 1961, 78). Because government affects people and their property, Baldwin proposed that one chamber should be apportioned according to each principle.         "
"23","By July 12, the delegates were weary of the debate. With a hint of frustration and fatigue, Gouverneur Morris (PA) declared that he had come to the Convention to forge a compact for the country, and he hoped that others shared his goal (Farrand 1966, I: 593). He pointed out the futility of one region trying to dictate the terms of apportionment to another and warned that states in some portion of the union might break off and form their own country. Through sheer resolve, the Convention compromised on a bicameral legislature, one apportioned by the Three‐Fifths Clause and the other apportioned equally among the states.         "
"24","To determine dominance relationships, we compare all nine rules of the apportionment pairwise using an R script written by one of the authors. The script uses each state's vote share (a proportion of the seats) from each apportionment rule as inputs and makes pairwise comparisons between the vote shares to determine which apportionment rules dominate the others. An adjacency matrix is then constructed from the dominance relationships. Next, the script employs a Floyd–Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path from one rule of apportionment to another and then identifies majority cycles."
"25","It is important to note that our analysis applies to bicameral legislatures as well as unicameral legislatures. Let (A,B) indicate a bicameral legislature apportioned with rule A in the first chamber and rule B in the second chamber. If C dominates A in a unicameral legislature, then A is not coalitionally stable. Moreover, in the comparison of bicameral apportionments (A,B) and (C,B), it must be the case that (C,B) dominates (A,B), implying that (A,B) is not coalitionally stable either. In other words, an apportionment that is not unicamerally stable cannot be part of a coalitionally stable bicameral legislature. For this reason, we make dominance comparisons one chamber at a time.7 We also consider what would happen if delegates compared apportionments using the average of their state's vote share in the two chambers at the end of the Robustness section.         "
"26","Under the Articles of Confederation, each state had one vote and 13 states typically attended. When the Constitutional Convention began, two states that were big advocates of equal apportionment were conspicuously absent: Rhode Island and New Hampshire. Rhode Island never sent a delegation, and delegates from New Hampshire did not arrive until July 23, after the issue of legislative apportionment had been settled. Moreover, delegates from New York left before the New Hampshire delegates arrived, creating four phases of attendance: (1) the Continental Congress phase (with the original 13 states), (2) the phase in which New York attended the Convention but New Hampshire and Rhode Island did not (May 30 to July 10), (3) the phase in which neither New York, New Hampshire, nor Rhode Island attended the Convention (July 11 to July 22), and (4) the phase in which New Hampshire attended the Convention but New York and Rhode Island did not (July 23–September 17). Because the issue of legislative apportionment was arranged during phase 2 and sealed in phase 3, we focus our attention on the first three phases of attendance."
"27","Thirteen states regularly attended the Congress during the months in which the Articles of Confederation were created (phase 1).8 The dominance relationships that existed among the nine rules of apportionment with the original 13 states are shown using the reachability matrix displayed in Table 3.9 The numbers in the matrix indicate the smallest number of pairwise votes needed to reach one apportionment rule from another if delegates voted for a larger vote share for their state.            "
"28","A 1 appears in the table if the rule in column j dominates the rule in row i directly (i.e., in a single step). For example, the 1 appearing in row F, column E indicates that E directly dominates F. A column with only dots and a zero identifies a strict Condorcet loser,10 such as Co in column 1. A row with only dots and a zero identifies a rule that is not dominated by any other rule. If that rule provides a greater vote share than all other rules, it is a strict Condorcet winner.11 With 13 states making decisions, E was a strict Condorcet winner among the set.            "
"29","The remaining numbers in the table indicate the shortest number of steps from the apportionment listed in row i to the apportionment listed in column j with 13 states voting. For example, Pr does not dominate S directly. But Pr's domination of S through H2 indicates that the shortest path from S to Pr is two steps.            "
"30","The dominance relationships among these nine rules can be summarized by the chain E ≻ F ≻ 3f ≻ 5f ≻ H1 ≻ (cycle of Pr, S, H2) ≻ Co, where A ≻ B means that A dominates B. None of the other eight rules dominates equal apportionment (E), which explains why it was stable in the Congress of the Confederation. This does not mean that a rule could not be created that dominates E; the divide‐the‐dollar game suggests that such an apportionment can always be created. But if delegates restricted themselves to the apportionment rules presented in Table 2 (perhaps because they found these rules to be the only reasonable ones), then E would remain in equilibrium. Delegates from the larger states may have disliked it, but there was little that they could do to dislodge E with all 13 states present.            "
"31","Things changed, however, at the Constitutional Convention. Rhode Island never attended, and during the first third of the Convention, New Hampshire did not attend either. The absence of these two small states changed the dominance relationships: E no longer dominated every other rule of apportionment because two of its proponents were absent. Instead, every rule of apportionment, including E, was dominated by at least one other rule of apportionment. To see this, consider Table 4, which displays the shortest number of steps in the dominance relationship from the apportionment rule listed in row i to the apportionment rule listed in column j with Rhode Island and New Hampshire excluded. The lack of dots indicates a top cycle over all nine apportionments.            "
"32","The 1's in Table 4 show that every apportionment rule is dominated by some other rule directly. This includes both a House apportioned according to the Three‐Fifths Clause and a Senate equally apportioned. The fact that every rule of apportionment is directly dominated by another rule is similar to the result of the divide‐the‐dollar game, which shows that a stable coalition should not be expected with an infinite set of apportionments. Our result is surprising because there is coalitional instability among only nine apportionment rules, the same rules that were coalitionally stable with the original 13 states.            "
"33","Consider the Three‐Fifths Clause. A majority of states would have received greater vote shares under three different rules of apportionment than they would under the Three‐Fifths Clause. Furthermore, a majority of states would have received greater vote shares if the Senate was apportioned by one of six different rules rather than equal apportionment. These include free inhabitants and the Three‐Fifths Clause. For every apportionment, including those appearing in the original Constitution, a majority of states would have received greater vote shares if the Convention had adopted something else."
"34","The core problem is that these rules are entangled in various cycles. Among the Convention's nine rules of apportionment, there were 11 vote cycles of length 3 (i.e., 11 different three‐tuples were in a cycle similar to the one in Table 1). Three of those cycles include 3f ≻ Co ≻ F ≻ 3f, F ≻ E ≻ Co ≻ F, and 3f ≻ 5f ≻ Pr ≻ 3f, each of which contains one of the two apportionment rules enumerated in the original Constitution.            "
"35","A majority of states had greater vote shares under Co than under F. If delegates voted in favor of the rule that produced a greater vote share in every pairwise vote, and someone proposed Co in place of F, then Co could have won. Furthermore, Co could have been beaten in turn by 3f and 3f beaten by F, illustrating the cyclicity of these three rules."
"36","Of course, cycles are not limited to three‐tuples. They can contain any number of apportionment rules in the intermediate steps. In our case, the entire set of apportionments is in a top cycle. Such a result is reminiscent of Ward's (1961) claim about cycling over the division of scarce resources.            "
"37","When Lansing and Yates left on July 11, leaving New York without a vote, the dominance relationships changed once again (see Table 5). There was no longer a strict cycle over all of the rules of apportionment, nor any subset. Instead, four rules—F, E, 3f, and 5f—were all coalitionally stable among the nine rules listed in Table 2. The remaining five rules were directly dominated by at least one of the other rules listed in the table. Much of the stability was due to narrow dominance relationships (6–5 margins) becoming 5–5 ties with New York excluded.12 Roughly half of the pairwise comparisons are 5–5 splits in Table 5, the most obvious of which are the cases where both (row i, column j) and (row j, column i) have missing values. The large number of ties cut the paths of many potential cycles.            "
"38","Of course, such stability was only temporary because New Hampshire arrived less than a week later, ending the period. But the temporary stability was long enough for the Convention to settle on a rule. It adopted 3f for the House and E for the Senate during the instability of phase 2 and then officially agreed upon that bicameral apportionment of the “Great Compromise” during phase 3, when only 10 states were present and (3f, E) was coalitionally stable. After the compromise was agreed upon, delegates committed themselves to it."
"39","The dominance relationships described in this section are summarized for six of the nine rules of apportionment in Figure 1.            "
"40","Dominance Relationships for Three Phases of Attendance"
"41","Note: An arrow from A to B indicates that A dominates B.                        "
"42","Historians have repeatedly asked why the Three‐Fifths Clause was proposed and adopted at the Constitutional Convention. They make new claims by rehashing the same set of statements and historical documents. In this section, we offer an explanation that takes advantage of vote shares instead. Delegates were aware of vote shares and estimated them fairly accurately.13 Although states did not always vote in favor of a larger vote share for their state, we will imagine that they did to see whether we can gain some new insights into why the Three‐Fifths Clause for the House and equal apportionment for the Senate were proposed and adopted.14"
"43","When the Dickinson committee proposed its first draft of the Articles of Confederation in 1776, a total of 13 states made decisions (phase 1 of state attendance). Because equal apportionment was the status quo and it was the only coalitionally stable rule among those listed in Table 2, it is not surprising that equal apportionment could not be dislodged.         "
"44","But things changed when the Constitutional Convention began, in part because Rhode Island and New Hampshire were no longer among the decision makers (phase 2 of state attendance). On May 29, Edmund Randolph began the substantive business of the Convention with the introduction of the Virginia Plan, which recommended a bicameral legislature with a lower house apportioned using either the quotas of contribution or free inhabitants. To avoid stalling on the particulars, delegates agreed to reject the “equality of suffrage established by the Articles of Confederation” (E) and to replace it with a more “equitable ratio” (Farrand 1966, I: 36). Two votes later, they agreed that the legislature ought to be bicameral—a recommendation of political philosophers such as Montesquieu.         "
"45","On June 11, the Convention resumed its discussion of apportionment. John Rutledge and Pierce Butler of South Carolina proposed quotas of contribution for the lower house. Before it could be voted upon, Wilson proposed the Three‐Fifths Clause instead. Wilson, who was described as one of the most faithful democrats of the Convention (Hall 1997, 90), believed in popular government and wanted institutions that would promote that goal. He preferred apportioning the legislature by free inhabitants to the Three‐Fifths Clause and the Three‐Fifths Clause to various property‐based apportionments such as the quotas of contribution. He favored F to 3f because he opposed slavery and his state had few slaves (Farrand 1966, I: 587). He preferred both ideas to a property‐based apportionment because he wanted to ground the national government in popular sovereignty (Farrand 1966, I: 605). Given his preferences, it is surprising that he proposed the Three‐Fifths Clause, rather than free inhabitants. The Three‐Fifths Clause went against his convictions about slavery and provided a smaller vote share for Pennsylvania.         "
"46","Wilson may have included slaves to gain the support of South Carolina and Georgia, which received greater vote shares under equal apportionment than free inhabitants alone. This would improve the chances of a population‐based apportionment. Moreover, Wilson believed slavery's days were numbered and, through the course of normal politics, the institution would soon be extinguished (Hall 1997, 60; Van Cleve 2010, 178). If this were the case, he would have his goal: an apportionment based on free population that was consistent with his opposition to slavery. Wilson's motion passed in the Committee of the Whole with nine states in favor and only New Jersey and Delaware opposed (Farrand 1966, I: 201). There were no signs that the Northern states that agreed to the clause had compromised.         "
"47","It is important to reflect on Wilson's initial strategy because it is a major part of why the Three‐Fifths Clause was adopted. Suppose Wilson thought that delegates would vote in favor of their state's vote share on each vote, and he was careful enough to compare the apportionment rules on the table: E, 3f, Co, and F. He would know that a majority of states would prefer Rutledge and Butler's motion of Co over F, so he could not propose F without its quickly being defeated by Co in a subsequent vote. He would also know that a majority of states would prefer 3f to Co and a majority would prefer 3f to E, making 3f a reasonable proposal. If 3f were proposed, it would provide an overture toward Southern interests, and it would defeat Co if another delegate, like Rutledge, Butler, or Dickinson, tried to propose it again. The Three‐Fifths Clause would also defeat equal apportionment if the small states reintroduced E. This made 3f a reasonable introductory move, one that would defeat the two rules on the table and open the door for his most preferred alternative, F. A House apportioned according to free population could either be proposed later in the Convention or it would naturally come into existence once slavery had ended."
"48","As soon as the Three‐Fifths Clause was initially adopted for the House, Roger Sherman (CT) proposed equal apportionment for the Senate, which failed five states to six. This was a premature proposal of the Great Compromise ‐ three‐fifths for the House and equal apportionment for the Senate. Had it passed at this early stage, the Convention might have saved itself considerable grief. Instead, Wilson and Alexander Hamilton from New York countered with a proposal to apportion the second branch the same as the first, which quickly passed with the six states of the large‐state coalition voting in favor of it (Farrand 1966, I: 202). At the end of the day, the Committee of the Whole had agreed to the Three‐Fifths Clause for both houses (3f, 3f).         "
"49","Two weeks later, Lansing (NY) and Jonathan Dayton (NJ) proposed equal apportionment for the House again, which failed 4–6–1. If delegates voted in favor of their state's vote shares, it would have failed as well. The debate continued: Delegates from both the large and small states tried to break the other side using persuasion, rational argument, and various appeals to principle. Some of these arguments reflected deep conviction, whereas others openly advanced their state's interests. Shortly after equal apportionment for the House failed, Oliver Ellsworth from Connecticut proposed equal apportionment for the Senate. This proposal was again defeated, but now by the narrowest of margins (5–5–1). Baldwin had defected from the large‐state coalition causing, Georgia to divide. Delegates immediately referred the apportionment of both chambers to a committee. Before the committee could report, Rutledge proposed Co again for the first branch. Although it failed, as vote shares would predict, the proposal demonstrated that Co was a continual threat. Had F been temporarily adopted prior to this date, it could have been replaced by Co at this juncture."
"50","When the committee made its report on July 5, it proposed the basis of the Great Compromise: three‐fifths for the first chamber and equal apportionment for the second (3f, E). The Convention then accepted equal apportionment for the second branch in a vote of 6–3–2. North Carolina had changed positions and Massachusetts and Georgia were divided, partly because of the need to compromise and partly because of subtle changes in the proposal (Pope and Treier 2011).         "
"51","New York departed 3 days later, settling the Convention down into a temporary equilibrium of (3f, E) during phase 3. On the same day, Butler and General Pinckney of South Carolina insisted that 5f replace 3f in the House (Farrand 1966, I: 580). It was another attempt to increase property in the apportionment, which failed 3–7.         "
"52","To broaden the appeal of the Three‐Fifths Clause and to shield Northern delegates from criticism during ratification, Wilson then proposed that both direct taxes and House seats be apportioned according to the Three‐Fifths Clause. This passed 6–2–2, sealing the Great Compromise on July 16."
"53","Ultimately, the small‐state delegates had an entrenched interest in equal apportionment, and the large‐state delegates suffered from fatigue. Equal apportionment was a unique solution from the small‐state perspective because it had been the status quo for decades and created the largest vote shares for New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Delaware.15 None of the other eight proposals maximized vote shares for that many states. Because the other proposals measured state size, or partially weighted state size, these four states experienced a considerable drop off in their vote share moving from equal apportionment to their second‐best options. For example, the Three‐Fifths Clause would have reduced the vote shares of those four states by an average of 58%. Wary of a looming battle over ratification, it must have been obvious to some of the large‐state delegates that they would have to allow equal apportionment in one of the chambers.         "
"54","Wilson could have proposed F in place of 3f later in the Convention, but he chose not to, perhaps because the agreement seemed fragile. If F replaced 3f, it would have upset the Southern states and might be replaced by a property‐based apportionment in turn, undermining his goal of popular sovereignty. Given his belief that slavery would soon be extinguished through normal politics, he must have felt confident that his second choice would quickly evolve into his first."
"55","The Convention eventually voted on F and 3f head‐to‐head, but well after the Great Compromise (August 8). At that point, most delegates did not want to revisit the contentious issue of apportionment again. They rejected the proposal in a 1–10 vote, despite the fact that six states would receive a greater vote share under free inhabitants than the Three‐Fifths Clause. Even Wilson stood against the proposal, calling it “premature” and noting that agreeing to the clause “would be no bar to the object of it” (Farrand 1966, II: 223). In other words, removing slavery from the apportionment would not remove slavery from the country. The union paid dearly for the delegates' commitment to their compromise, and for their fatigue.         "
"56","After the Constitution was ratified, (3f, E) remained in place because the Constitution required three‐quarters of the states to ratify amendments. None of the apportionments listed in Table 2 could defeat the Three‐Fifths Clause in the House or equal apportionment in the Senate using a three‐fourths supermajority rule. Nor could a variety of other apportionments, such as the ad hoc apportionments proposed at the Constitutional Convention. This made (3f, E) stable under the Constitution, much like E under the Articles of Confederation. A brief window of opportunity allowed for the introduction of the Three‐Fifths Clause at the Constitutional Convention. Once that window closed, (3f, E) remained in place, initially because of a compromise and later because of institutional constraints.         "
"57","Our analysis has focused on a limited set of apportionment rules that delegates found worthy of proposing at the Convention. But what if they thought the rules in their notes, the rules mentioned in debate, and the rules proposed in the Continental Congress were viable options as well? Including such rules adds four rules to our study (see the appendix).16 Although adding these rules complicates the exposition slightly, it does not affect the results substantially. With 13 states, equal apportionment was still a strict Condorcet winner. The only rule that dominates free inhabitants is equal apportionment, as was the case earlier in the article. With Rhode Island and New Hampshire excluded, all 13 rules of apportionment would be in a top cycle, including the cycle 3f ≻ Co ≻ F ≻ 3f, and a majority of states would still prefer the Three‐Fifths Clause to equal state apportionment. Thus, the same conditions would exist that enticed Wilson to propose the Three‐Fifths Clause. Without New York, the window of opportunity would close and stability would return, as before. However, equal apportionment and free inhabitants would be the only weak Condorcet winners in the third phase, rather than the Three‐Fifths Clause, the five‐fifths ratio, and the other two.17"
"58","But what if delegates were forward‐looking? As a separate robustness check, we conducted the analysis of the nine rules proposed at the Convention using figures from 1800, 1810, and 1820 separately.18 In each case, we included all of the states in the union and reported percentages among the states attending during our three phases. Using any set of these figures, equal apportionment is the strict Condorcet winner in phase 1, as before. In phase 2, all of the apportionment rules are in a strict cycle with the exception of the quota of contribution, which is a strict Condorcet loser in the 1800 and 1820 data. In phase 3, equal apportionment is a weak Condorcet winner again. This suggests that our story is fairly robust for forward‐thinking delegates. If delegates limited themselves to the nine rules of apportionment, E would be in equilibrium among the original 13 states. But without Rhode Island and New Hampshire, no apportionment rule would be stable, even if delegates considered vote shares three decades forward. All that would differ is that 3f would not be coalitionally stable in phase 3. A commitment to compromise would have to keep 3f in place, as it did in the August 8 vote between 3f and F.            "
"59","As a final robustness check, we considered what would happen if delegates compared the average of their state's vote share across the two chambers, rather than their state's vote share one chamber at a time. Using the nine principled rules proposed at the convention produces 45 possible bicameral apportionments, which we compared using the 1787–1790 data. The results were surprisingly similar. With 13 states, (E, E) is a strict Condorcet winner, consistent with the stability under the Articles of Confederation. With Rhode Island and New Hampshire excluded, all 45 bicameral apportionments are in a top cycle, with an average of only 1.5 steps from one bicameral apportionment to any other bicameral apportionment. With New York excluded as well, partial stability returns with (E, E), (3f, E), and (5f, E) all weak Condorcet winners, consistent with our argument.19"
"60","The Three‐Fifths Clause was morally repugnant and only partially defensible as a glue needed to bind the union. Sanford Levinson (2015) argues that the Three‐Fifths Compromise “was necessary to avoid dissolution of the fragile United States.” But the apportionment of the House of Representatives was not the result of a dilemma between the Three‐Fifths Compromise or no constitution at all. Nor was it the inescapable result of delegates pursuing the interests of their states.         "
"61","The Three‐Fifths Clause was one of many viable apportionments that a large‐state coalition might coalesce around. Wilson may have proposed it to get the national government grounded in popular sovereignty. But it was not his first choice."
"62","As it turns out, slavery did not wither as Wilson had expected. Instead, it became the center of sectional tensions for the next 75 years. The Three‐Fifths Clause created an overrepresentation of the South in the House of Representatives and led extreme New England Federalists to propose New England's secession from the union in 1815. Expanding populations in the North eventually made the Senate the protector of Southern interests rather than the House. Congress then papered over sectional tensions by passing the Missouri Compromise, the Kansas‐Nebraska Act, and the Apportionment Act of 1842, but these acts treated the symptoms and not the cause. Legislative apportionment is inherently unstable because there is always another apportionment rule that can increase the vote share of some states at the expense of others. Such instability can even exist among the nine rules of apportionment proposed at the Constitutional Convention. Unfortunately for the nation, delegates did not apportion the House by free inhabitants when they had the opportunity."
"63","We should be careful, however, not to make hasty generalizations. Finding cycles and coalitional instability in the first third of the Convention does not mean that other settings are equally unstable. Cycles and coalitional instability may be more frequent in cases with a larger number of alternatives, such as cases of legislative apportionment, than they are in cases with a small number of alternatives, such as American elections. This study shows that the type of instability described by McKelvey (1976) and Schofield (1978) existed with potentially dire consequences. However, the debate about whether cycling is common will surely rage onward.         "
