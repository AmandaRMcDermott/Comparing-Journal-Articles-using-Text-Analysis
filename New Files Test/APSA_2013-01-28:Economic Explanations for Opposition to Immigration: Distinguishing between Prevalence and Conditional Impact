"1","Analysis of the LMC hypothesis has been hampered by a number of challenges that make it difficult to assess the strength of its empirical support. The first challenge is defining which segments of the labor force face competition from migrants. To date, researchers arguing in favor of the LMC hypothesis often start by presenting findings in the labor economics literature which indicate that immigrant inflows can have detrimental employment and wage effects on natives with whom they compete (e.g., Borjas 1999, 2003, 2006; Borjas, Freeman, and Katz 1996).8 When searching for evidence of this alleged effect on voters’ attitudes on immigration, scholars largely rely on the finding that lower‐educated individuals—interpreted as a proxy of low skill—are those most opposed to immigration, both in the United States and abroad (e.g., Hanson, Scheve, and Slaughter 2008; Kessler 2001; Mayda 2006; Scheve and Slaughter 2001). This correlation is then interpreted as evidence that low‐skilled individuals are opposed to immigration because they feel vulnerable in the face of low‐skilled foreigners competing for their jobs. This line of research has faced a number of criticisms.         "
"2","First, although education is surely correlated with people's skill level, schooling is a very problematic proxy for skill because highly educated and lower‐educated individuals differ along many noneconomic dimensions that also motivate anti‐immigrant sentiment. In particular, education is correlated with cultural tolerance and cosmopolitan social attitudes (Chandler and Tsai 2001; Gang, Rivera‐Batiz, and Yun 2002; Nie, Junn, and Stehlik‐Barry 1996; Schuman, Steeh, and Bobo 1985). Therefore, it could be that the strong negative relationship between education and opposition to immigration stems not from the labor‐market concerns of lower‐educated individuals—as some of the studies cited above contend—but rather from the fact that lower‐educated individuals are on average more nativist and culturally intolerant of foreigners.9 Hence, studies using education to measure economic threat will have upwardly biased estimates.         "
"3","Second, the LMC hypothesis predicts that natives will be most opposed to immigration from foreign workers with skill levels similar to their own. Yet testing this hypothesis requires studying policy issues for which native and immigrant skills are aligned, which has been absent in most research done so far. Education cannot proxy for skills since people within a given education category have extremely heterogeneous skill sets that are differentially affected by immigration. A similar problem exists for employment status, another common proxy for labor‐market threat. People may be unemployed for a myriad of reasons, many completely unrelated to immigration. Therefore, aggregate studies that do not attempt to clearly match native and immigrant skills will have downwardly biased estimates of economic threat. As we explain below, our research design “threads the needle” between these two extremes to more precisely evaluate the LMC hypothesis."
"4","We conducted a review of studies from the past 15 years that have attempted to estimate the degree to which economic and cultural concerns underlie opposition to immigration (the results of the review are reported in Table A1 in the online materials).10 While the review shows that all studies that test for both mechanisms find strong evidence in support of the cultural threat hypothesis, a substantial share of studies find no evidence for the LMC hypothesis. And among the studies that do purport to find support for the LMC hypothesis, almost all use respondents’ level of education to measure the native group under economic threat (Hanson, Scheve, and Slaughter 2008; Kessler 2001; Mayda 2006; Scheve and Slaughter 2001).11"
"5","The other seemingly supportive studies of the LMC hypothesis are based on survey questions that explicitly ask respondents about their views on the economic impact of immigration on the local economy and/or local natives’ job prospects. However, these correlations do not provide compelling support for the LMC hypothesis for two reasons. First, sociotropic attitudes on the state of the local economy may reflect opposition to immigration unrelated to individualistic labor‐market concerns. For instance, immigrants may place pressure on public works and budgets, thereby harming the local economy. Second, individuals who are antithetical to immigrants for cultural reasons are likely to describe immigration as harmful on any dimension on which they are asked to assess its merits, making it difficult to draw reliable inferences from any given statistical relationship.12 Indeed, Sniderman, Hagendoorn, and Prior (2004) present experimental evidence showing that correlations between such attitudinal measures can produce unreliable inferences.13"
"6","In a recent article, Hainmueller and Hiscox (2010) make significant headway by addressing some of the limitations of the research that examines the LMC hypothesis. The authors administered a survey experiment to a national sample of American adults, randomly asking one‐half to report their support for high‐skilled immigration and asking the other half to report their support for low‐skilled immigration. The authors find little support for the LMC hypothesis via their experiment. Inconsistent with the predictions of existing political economy models, the authors find that both high‐skilled and low‐skilled natives strongly prefer high‐skilled immigrants over low‐skilled immigrants. Accordingly, in predicting support for immigration, the interaction between native skill and immigrant skill is insignificant.         "
"7","However, like the other studies above, Hainmueller and Hiscox (2010) use respondents’ educational attainment to measure skill level (and by proxy, their labor‐market interests). They do this to show that even when using a measure prone to positively biased estimates of economic threat, they still find little support. Nonetheless, the ideal approach would be to move beyond indirect measures, such as education, and assess labor‐market competition more directly. Yet measuring the labor‐market threat that individuals face due to immigration is challenging because of data availability. In particular, the fact that most surveys use national samples which include only few respondents from each industry (and skill set) limits the ability to accurately estimate the effect of a given labor‐market threat on people's immigration attitudes. Additionally, researchers cannot ask about policies related to all different sectors. To properly estimate this effect, one needs either a much larger national sample (along with a much longer questionnaire) or a sample targeting specific employment sectors that are vulnerable to competition from certain groups of immigrants.         "
"8","Adopting the latter approach, we conduct an in‐depth case study of Americans’ attitudes toward H‐1B visas, the plurality of which are occupied by Indian immigrants employed in the high‐technology sector (more on that below). We surveyed respondents via a targeted interviewing approach of 75 U.S. counties in which we oversample areas with a high percentage of workers in the information technology (IT) sector—precisely those people who are likely to feel economically threatened by H‐1B immigration. Hence, this study differs from past research by (1) focusing on a specific set of skills (high technology) and (2) examining whether the pattern of opposition to a particular type of immigrant (H‐1B visa holders) who poses a direct labor‐market threat follows the predictions of the LMC hypothesis. By targeting geographic areas where the IT industry is prominent, we are able to interview a sufficient number of individuals who possess the specific skills needed to precisely test the LMC hypothesis."
"9","This targeted sampling strategy allows us to distinguish prevalence from conditional impact when assessing the factors underlying people's preferences on immigration policy. The importance of analyzing the former is perhaps obvious: it tells us why people oppose immigration at a given point in time. Yet examining the latter is also important because it illuminates the potential effect of a given mechanism. While at a certain moment in time immigrants may or may not be perceived as much of an economic threat, this situation could change (e.g., during a tightening of the local labor market). Understanding the conditional impact of each type of threat on people's attitudes on immigration is thus not merely a hypothetical issue, but rather represents a pertinent question from a political standpoint, a point we return to in the discussion."
"10","While our empirical analysis focuses on a specific type of immigrant in particular regions of the country, the objective of this study is to utilize the features of this case to test the broader arguments in the literature about the underlying sources of popular anti‐immigration sentiments. Accordingly, we conclude by explaining how our results speak to policymaking in the immigration domain more broadly. Further, a principal contribution of this study is that the research design—where we oversample areas with high rates of high‐technology employees—provides a more careful test of the LMC hypothesis, allowing us to establish less‐biased upper limits on the influence of economic threat. This innovation enables us to demonstrate the analytical importance of distinguishing between the prevalence and the conditional impact of factors underlying people's preferences on immigration policy.         "
"11","In addition to the targeted sampling of high‐technology areas, our survey has two additional, unique design elements that allow us to address two major methodological challenges involved with studying public attitudes toward immigration: (1) the problem of correlated threats and (2) social desirability bias."
"12","H‐1B immigration into the United States—much of which is occupied by culturally distinct Indian migrants—serves as an instructive test case for disentangling the role of both economic and cultural threat in shaping public attitudes on immigration. This is because Indian H‐1B visa holders are culturally distinct in appearance and custom, but unlike other immigrant groups, they also disproportionately occupy high‐skilled positions in the labor force. Hence, the often‐studied instance where the lower‐educated have both stronger economic and cultural reasons to oppose the immigrant group in question does not apply in this case, since Indian immigrants on H‐1B visas are more directly competing with highly skilled and highly educated Americans, who are presumably less xenophobic. In other words, the problem of correlated threats hampering past research is largely alleviated by examining the specific case of H‐1B immigration to the United States.            "
"13","Data limitations have not only constrained the analyses of labor‐market effects on immigration attitudes but have also posed formidable challenges to testing the proposition that cultural concerns underlie immigration opposition. These cultural arguments are typically substantiated via correlations of self‐reported attitudes on social and cultural issues with responses to policy questions on immigration. While the correlations are strong (e.g., Bauer, de Sola Pool, and Dexter 1963; Mayda and Rodrik 2005; O'Rourke and Sinnott 2002), their proper interpretation is unclear. In particular, the fact that highly educated individuals are shown to be both less opposed to immigrants’ entry and more culturally tolerant of foreigners lends itself to (at least) two competing explanations. It could be that (1) cultural anxieties underlie immigration opposition, as some scholars contend; or (2) a selection effect is at play, whereby social desirability is causing educated people both to eschew survey responses on immigration that appear bigoted and to express more tolerant positions on cultural threat items.            "
"14","To address this empirical challenge, in addition to standard explicit self‐reported measures, we incorporated into our study an Implicit Association Test (IAT), a method for gauging veiled or unconscious antipathetic sentiments toward various social groups. Although the IAT is commonly used in psychological, neuroscience, and marketing research (Nosek, Greenwald, and Banaji 2007), its use in political science has been much more limited. However, recent work has shown that the IAT can be very useful in studying politically relevant attitudes that individuals will often want to misrepresent (Fazio and Olson 2003; Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz 1998) as well as in predicting political behavior (e.g., vote choice [Arcuri et al. 2008] and immigration policy judgments [Perez 2010]). Using the IAT method, we can assess the contention made in previous studies that cultural threat shapes immigration policy views, a claim so far made largely using measures potentially subject to social desirability bias. Implicit measures such as the IAT have a different set of strengths and limitations as explicit measures. Therefore, using both within the same study provides a robustness check of previous findings regarding cultural threat.            "
"15","We attempt to explain people's attitudes toward a particular type of high‐skilled immigrant—holders of H‐1B visas, which have two important features germane to our study: they have become dominated by the high‐technology sector and are increasingly occupied by Indian immigrants. Examining the recent profiles of those provided with H‐1B visas, it is notable that over half (52%) are workers born in India and that one in every two workers is employed in computer‐related occupations (USCIS 2008). By focusing on attitudes toward H‐1B visas—held by those most likely to compete with native high‐technology workers—we consider a case in which (1) the immigration policy predominantly affects the earning prospects of highly educated individuals; (2) the immigrant population that is found economically threatening is predominantly high‐skilled Indians, a population that is also culturally distinct from much of the native population; and therefore (3) theories of cultural and labor‐market threat produce contrasting predictions, allowing us to better disentangle the impact of these two sources of opposition (see Figure A2 in the online materials for basic background information on the use of H‐1B visas in the United States).14"
"16","We interviewed 1,134 respondents recruited by Survey Sampling International (SSI) of Shelton, CT, over the Internet between August 20, 2009, and September 9, 2009.15 SSI recruits individuals via opt‐in recruitment methods. We used SSI because they allowed us to implement our targeted sampling strategy by capturing substantial numbers of respondents in high‐technology counties. However, opt‐in Internet samples also tend to be more politically interested than samples recruited via simple random sampling. In the context of this specific study, we do not consider this issue to be a serious concern for three main reasons. First, our results are robust to the application of poststratification weights designed to enhance the representativeness of the sample. Second, although sample selection may affect the overall levels of variables, we are most interested in the relationships between variables, which are less likely to be affected by the opt‐in nature of the sample (Sanders et al. 2007). Third, as explained below, the observed relationships between demographic variables and support for immigration mirrors those found in previous articles, which used random samples, also suggesting that the relationships between the variables we find are not unrepresentative. Demographic characteristics of the sample are described in Table A3 in the online materials.16 As noted earlier, we oversampled high‐technology regions of the country, which were defined to be the 25 counties in the United States with the highest percentage of workers employed in industries classified as code 54 (“Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services”) by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). This category includes various occupations in the IT sector, including “Engineering Services,”“Custom Computer Programming Services,”“Computer Systems Design Services,”“Computer Facilities Management Services,” and “Other Computer Related Services.” In these high‐technology counties, between 13.5% and 48.3% of workers were employed within NAICS code 54, allowing us to capture a relatively high rate of technology workers. We supplemented this sample by interviewing respondents in 50 additional counties, which had the national median percentage of workers in NAICS code 54, ranging between 2.2% and 2.3%.17 Survey invitations were sent so that approximately three‐fourths of respondents came from high‐technology counties. The geographic distribution of our survey respondents is illustrated in Figure A3 in the online materials.18 In total, 10.4% of employed respondents were working in the high‐technology sector, which was exactly equal to the share of the workforce in the counties represented in our sample that worked in the high‐technology sector according to U.S. Census figures (see Table A3 in the online materials).            "
"17","Because we are interested in the relationship between prejudice against Indians and opposition toward H‐1B immigrants, for all analyses below we excluded the 10 respondents who self‐identified as Indian or Indian American. Additionally, we dropped the 123 respondents who did not complete the survey."
"18","Summary statistics for all variables used in the analyses are presented in Table A4 in the online materials. Respondents viewed questions in the following order: (1) assessment of the respondent's geographic location; (2) employment questions (e.g., employment status, whether one works in the high‐technology industry, etc.); (3) political views (e.g., attitudes toward H‐1B visas, Indian immigration, etc., with the H‐1B visa question used as our dependent variable asked at the start of this section); (4) demographic questions (e.g., gender, age, income, ethnicity, etc.); (5) Implicit Association Test; and (6) explicit cultural threat questions.19 While descriptive statistics for raw measures are reported, for all analyses we recoded all survey measures below to lie between 0 and 1. This allows us to interpret coefficient estimates as representing a 100β percentage‐point movement in the dependent variable.            "
"19","Dependent Variable Respondents were asked: “Some people have proposed that the U.S. government should increase the number of H‐1B visas, which are allowances for U.S. companies to hire workers from foreign countries to work in highly skilled occupations (such as engineering, computer programming, and high‐technology). Do you think the U.S. should increase, decrease, or keep about the same number of H‐1B visas?” (response options: “increase a great deal,”“increase a little,”“keep about the same,”“decrease a little,”“decrease a great deal”). A higher value reflects greater support for increasing H‐1B visas.               "
"20","Economic Threat We measure economic threat in two ways. First, we code whether a respondent works in the high‐technology industry. In order to assess this, we first determined whether respondents were employed or not by asking them: “Which of the following categories best describes your current employment status?” with a set of relevant response options (e.g., full‐time employee, part‐time employee, homemaker, unemployed, etc.). We then asked employed respondents: “Please tell us what the company you work for does,” followed by a list of 22 industries from the NAICS classification system.20 All respondents who selected “Engineering, Computer‐Related Design, and Architecture” were coded as high‐technology workers. To ensure that this narrow industry definition did not lead us to misclassify respondents who actually engaged in high‐technology work, we asked a follow‐up binary question: “Do you work in the high‐technology industry?” Respondents who answered “yes” to this question were also coded as high‐technology workers.               "
"21","As a further assessment of economic threat, we asked employed respondents to assess whether they felt that their job was in jeopardy: “Looking forward to the next three years, how confident do you feel about being able to keep your current job?” (response options: “extremely confident,”“very confident,”“somewhat confident,”“slightly confident,” and “not at all confident”). This question allowed us to isolate those individuals in the high‐technology sector who thought their job was at risk and may be more threatened by immigrants applying for H‐1B visas.21"
"22","Cultural Threat As noted, a common claim in the literature holds that opposition to immigration stems from its perceived cultural consequences. Politically, these consequences have been described by some as a threat to the country's “identity” or a challenge to the natives’ traditions and values (e.g., Citrin et al. 1997; Larsen et al. 2009). While the term “cultural threat” is a useful label for purposes of exposition, it is somewhat crude. Surely for some individuals, opposition to immigration stems from a tangible sense of danger that the inflow of foreigners represents. Yet for others, opposition to immigration is probably a product of a subtler and perhaps unconscious sense of unease or apprehension about interaction with foreigners, be it their appearance or dress, the smell of their food, religious rituals, or the unfamiliar customs that immigrants often bring with them. Opposition to immigration, particularly when stemming from this latter and less‐defined form of cultural‐based apprehension, may be poorly captured using standard survey methods that gauge explicit attitudes.               "
"23","The explicit measures of cultural threat are based on two different survey items. The first asked respondents: “How threatened do you think the American way of life is by foreign influence?” (response options: “extremely threatened,”“very threatened,”“moderately threatened,”“slightly threatened,” and “not threatened at all”). A higher value reflects a greater sense of threat.22 In a second question, we asked respondents to evaluate Indians on a series of traits: capable, polite, hardworking, hygienic, and trustworthy.23 This battery of trait questions was asked toward the end of the survey due to the potential sensitivity of the questions and to minimize the degree to which respondents could be primed to think about Indian immigrants by this line of questioning. All responses were measured on 5‐point scales, with the question asking to what degree Indians possessed the positive trait in question. We averaged responses to these items to create a scale lying between 0 (positive traits of Indians) to 1 (negative traits of Indians). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was .83, above traditional cutoffs for scale reliability.               "
"24","We employ the Implicit Association Test, a common measure of unconscious prejudice, bias, and/or apprehension against a particular group, as our implicit measure of cultural threat. The IAT was administered toward the end of the survey, with only the Indian trait questions being asked after the IAT, to minimize the degree to which respondents could be primed to think about Indians by completing the IAT.24 The IAT is an experimental method designed to gauge the strength of associations linking social categories (e.g., blacks versus whites) to evaluative anchors (e.g., good versus bad). Respondents complete two types of tasks in random order. In the first task, respondents classify whether Indian and white faces are “European American” or “Indian American.” In the second task, respondents classify whether certain words are “good” or “bad” words. Then, respondents classify both faces and words, and what is randomly manipulated is whether “European American”/“good” (and accordingly, “Indian American”/“bad”) are associated with the same key or whether “European American”/“bad” (and accordingly, “Indian American”/“good”) are associated with the same key. The IAT requires the rapid categorization of the evaluative anchors and social categories such that easier pairings (and faster responses) are interpreted as being more strongly associated in memory than more difficult pairings (slower responses). Individuals who are prejudiced against Indians should be quicker at making classifications of pictures and words when “European American” (“Indian American”) is paired with “good” (“bad”) than when “European American” (“Indian American”) is paired with “bad” (“good”). Figure A4 in the online materials provides screenshots of what the respondent sees when completing the IAT as well as a fuller discussion of the procedure. The logic underlying the use of the IAT, introduced by Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz (1998), is that difference in categorization performance is argued to measure differential association of the two concepts with the attribute and to capture “implicit” (system 1) attitudes that are effortless and automatic, as opposed to “explicit” (system 2) attitudes that are effortful and conscious (Kahneman 2003).               "
"25","The IAT effect (a D score) has a possible range of −2 to +2, which we recoded to lie between 0 (low prejudice) and 1 (high prejudice).25 The mean raw score and standard deviation are .53 and .43, respectively. Correlations between the IAT effect and our two explicit attitude measures—foreign threat and the Indian trait index—are significant but low, which comports with extant research on explicit and implicit measures (e.g., Dovidio, Kawakami, and Gaertner 2002; Hofmann et al. 2008). The IAT effect has r= .08 (p = .01) and r= .07 (p = .03) correlations with the foreign threat measure and the Indian trait index, respectively. Previous research suggests that the dissociation is most apparent in sensitive domains in which people are highly motivated to answer in a politically correct way to an explicit measure (Fazio and Olson 2003).               "
"26","Although the IAT is commonly used as a measure of implicit attitudes (Nosek, Greenwald, and Banaji 2007), and it is generally agreed that implicit attitudes are plausible theoretical constructs, it is also true that the IAT does not capture all aspects of prejudice. The IAT score may reflect shared cultural stereotypes rather than personal animus and the affective negativity attributed to participants may be due to cognitions and emotions that are not necessarily signs of active prejudice (Arkes and Tetlock 2004). Thus, the IAT has a different set of strengths and limitations compared to more traditional, explicit measures of cultural concerns. Therefore, in our analyses, we include explicit and implicit measures of cultural threat (1) to assess the effects of prejudice on immigration opposition above and beyond what is captured by explicit measures and (2) to account for the fact that apart from differences in intentionality, effort, and awareness, it is possible that implicit measures do not measure exactly the same constructs assessed by self‐reports. The IAT should not be regarded simply as a measure of the constructs stripped of self‐presentation concerns; self‐presentation is just one of a variety of factors that moderate the relationship between implicit and explicit measures (Nosek 2005; Nosek, Greenwald, and Banaji 2007). Implicit and explicit assessments may have separate predictive utility, and as such, it is common practice and theoretically important to include both explicit and implicit attitude measures (Blanton and Jaccard 2008). In fact, in his study regarding the IAT and immigration policy judgments, Perez (2010) stressed that even after controlling for explicit attitudes, implicit attitudes still exerted a direct influence on one's immigration policy judgments. In other words, he found that attitudes toward immigrants originate from both conscious and subconscious sources, justifying the inclusion of both measures in studies of immigration attitudes.               "
"27","Control Variables Past research on mass attitudes toward globalization, particularly on trade openness, finds a consistent empirical relationship between various individual characteristics and prointegration preferences. We therefore control for a number of the standard demographic and political factors that could be associated with support for immigration‐friendly policies: (1) gender, (2) age, (3) marital status, (4) education level, (5) whether the respondent identifies himself or herself as white, (6) income, and (7) party identification.26 In our multivariate analyses, we also cluster standard errors at the zip‐code level, thereby correcting for correlation between the disturbances of observations within zip codes.               "
"28","Placebo Dependent Variable We asked respondents: “Some people have proposed that the U.S. government should increase the number of immigrants from India allowed to enter the United States. Do you think the U.S. should increase, decrease, or keep about the same number of Indian immigrants?” (response options: “increase a great deal,”“increase a little,”“keep about the same,”“decrease a little,”“decrease a great deal”).27 Again, higher values on the 5‐point scale reflect greater support for immigration. We use this variable as a sort of placebo test—cultural threat should decrease support for Indians entering the United States through any means, H‐1B visas or otherwise. In contrast, economic threat should have a weak (or no) effect on attitudes toward Indian immigration generally, but it should be particularly and strongly associated with opposition to expanding H‐1B visa entries, since these are a direct manifestation of LMC. This assumes that respondents do not automatically associate Indian immigrants with high‐skilled immigration, which we later show empirically to be a sensible assumption.               "
"29","Placebo Occupational Category As an additional falsification test, we compare the attitudes of high‐technology workers to an occupational group with similar education and high‐skilled “white collar” status but not threatened by Indian immigrants on H‐1B visas. We constructed a dummy variable indicating workers who were (1) employed; (2) selected NAICS codes representing “Finance, Accounting, and Consulting,”“Insurance,”“Real Estate, Rental, and Leasing,” or “Law and Legal Services” in response to the economic threat question; and (3) not coded as high‐technology workers. Hereafter, we refer to these individuals as “white‐collar nonhigh‐technology workers” or “other white‐collar workers.”28"
"30","Before discussing the main results, we first demonstrate that our measures of economic and cultural threat are tapping distinct phenomena. As shown in Figure 1(a), the distributions of one of our cultural threat measures, the IAT score (represented by kernel densities), are nearly identical for high‐technology workers and other respondents (nonhigh‐technology workers and respondents out of the labor force). The difference‐in‐means between the two groups is .02 (p = .75, one‐tailed), and a Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test finds that the two distributions are similar (p = .70).29 Because we have clear theoretical expectations, we use one‐sided hypothesis tests hereafter. As the figure shows, this relationship stands in stark contrast to the difference in the distribution of IAT scores among those in favor of increasing as opposed to decreasing the allocation of H‐1B visas (see Figure 1b), a relationship we discuss in greater detail below. Consequently, any differences we observe between high‐technology workers and other responses are not the result of higher latent cultural threat among those in the high‐technology sector.            "
"31","                Implicit Animosity toward Indians"
"32","Before delving into multivariate analyses, we first illustrate our results via simple difference‐of‐means tests. In the top half of Figure 2, we plot support for H‐1B visas against our main operationalizations of economic and cultural threat (see Figure A5 in the online materials for weighted estimates). As shown in Figure 2(a), high‐technology workers exhibit the lowest support for H‐1B visas, consistent with the LMC hypothesis. Whereas technology workers’ support for H‐1B visas was .28, the support level was substantially higher among other white‐collar workers (.40), among nontechnology and nonwhite‐collar workers (.35), and among nonemployed individuals (.34). All three of these differences are statistically significant (p = .04, p = .06, and p = .07, respectively). These differences are also substantively meaningful, representing about 6 to 12% of the length of the scale (or about 21 to 39% of the standard deviation in support for visas).            "
"33","                The Effect of Economic Threat and Cultural Threat on Support for H‐1B Visas and Indian Immigration"
"34","Note: Each bar graph includes 95% statistical significance bars.                        "
"35","How can one tell whether these differences are due to economic threat per se and not due to a conflation of economic threat with cultural threat? As a stronger test of the LMC hypothesis, we condition on low cultural threat by only examining respondents with cultural threat scores that fall below the median. In other words, by looking at this subset of respondents, we can examine whether economic threat still explains attitudes on immigration even among those who are not especially culturally threatened. As shown in Figure 2(a), among those low in cultural threat as measured by the IAT, high‐technology workers again exhibit the lowest support for visas compared to the other groups.30"
"36","Additionally, we find that the individuals most opposed to H‐1B visas are high‐technology workers who are “not at all confident” or “slightly confident” that they will be able to keep their jobs. Among this subgroup, support for the visas is only .14, significantly lower than among other white‐collar workers (.40, p = .005), nontechnology and nonwhite‐collar workers (.35, p = .01), and nonemployed workers generally (.34, p = .01). Support for visas among this subgroup is also lower than among other white‐collar workers (.39, p = .05) and nontechnology and nonwhite‐collar workers (.26, p = .08) who are similarly not confident about keeping their jobs. Conversely, all other technology workers more confident in their future employment prospects exhibited a support score of .31, statistically similar to all nontechnology workers generally (.35, p = .21) and to employed individuals confident about keeping their jobs (.36, p = .13).31 Hence, the differences in immigration attitudes between high‐technology workers and other respondents cannot solely be due to the selection of certain types of individuals into high‐technology work or the selection of high‐technology companies into certain geographic areas. Rather, the evidence suggests that negative economic experiences among high‐technology workers drive them to be less supportive of H‐1B visas than their more financially stable counterparts.            "
"37","Importantly, as shown in Figure 2(b), high‐technology workers are specifically opposed to H‐1B visas, not to immigration by Indians more broadly. This suggests that latent cultural concerns are not at play. Support for Indian immigration among technology workers is .34, similar to that of other white‐collar workers (.39, p = .21), nontechnology and nonwhite‐collar workers (.34, p = .51), and nonemployed individuals (.36, p = .34). We obtain similar results when only examining individuals low in cultural threat. Technology workers exhibit a support score of .38, statistically indistinguishable from other white‐collar workers (.41, p = .34), nontechnology and nonwhite‐collar workers (.38, p = .44), and nonemployed respondents (.38, p = .45).32 Each of these findings points to the fact that economic threat is not simply picking up opposition to the presence of foreigners more broadly. High‐technology workers are not more likely to oppose foreign immigration more generally, but only the form of immigration that is perceived to directly threaten their economic interests.            "
"38","Cultural concerns—devoid of social desirability bias—were strong predictors of both attitudes toward H‐1B visas and Indian immigration more broadly. We again split respondents at the IAT median score in order to bifurcate the sample into “high”’ and “low” levels of cultural threat. As shown in Figure 2(c), culturally threatened respondents exhibited a visa support score of .31, significantly lower than the .37 exhibited by respondents with low IAT scores (p = .001). We can again perform a similar exercise to the one described above to see that these results are not confounded by economic threat. Only examining workers not in the high‐technology sector—individuals who do not directly face economic threat from H‐1B visas—the effect of cultural threat is still powerful. Respondents with above‐median IAT scores reported less support (.32) than those with below‐median IAT scores (.37), a statistically significant difference (p = .002).            "
"39","Unlike economic threat, the effect of cultural threat should be broad and affect all sources of new, culturally distinct immigrants. As shown in Figure 2(d), cultural threat does indeed strongly and negatively predict support for the expansion of Indian immigration in the full sample (DOM= .06, p < .001) and among people outside of the technology industry (DOM= .06, p < .001). Hence, we find additional support for previous literature that has stressed the prominence of cultural concerns, and it appears that these results are not artifacts of social desirability bias.33"
"40","The effects of economic and cultural threat also emerge when controlling for various demographic and political variables. Table 1 presents OLS estimates predicting support for H‐1B visas (measured on a 5‐point scale).34 In constructing the specifications, we paid attention to only include variables that could plausibly be considered “pretreatment” with respect to economic and cultural threat. For instance, since economic threat may produce explicit cultural concerns, we made sure to estimate models including the economic threat variable but excluding the explicit cultural threat variables.35"
"41","As shown in the first column of Table 1, high‐technology workers exhibited 11 percentage points less support on the H‐1B visa scale compared to nontechnology workers, the baseline category (β=−.11, p = .004). The control variables allow us to place this effect size in perspective. The effect of economic threat is about half that of education, where moving from having less than a high school diploma to having an advanced degree is associated with an increase in support for curtailing immigration by 20 percentage points. Note that education is generally considered to be the strongest predictor in previous studies of attitude toward forces of globalization.            "
"42","As another test of the labor‐market competition hypothesis, we conduct a placebo test by examining whether white‐collar, nonhigh‐technology workers are also less supportive of H‐1B visas. The logic behind this placebo test is that these white‐collar workers have a similarly high labor‐market standing as high‐technology workers but do not face labor‐market threat from immigrants on H‐1B visas. As shown in the third column of Table 1, white‐collar nonhigh‐technology workers are as supportive of H‐1B visas as the baseline category of nonwhite‐collar workers (β= .01, p = .43). However, high‐technology workers are substantially more likely to oppose H‐1B visas than white‐collar workers employed outside of the high‐technology sector (Δβ= .11, p = .02). Hence, the policy preferences of high‐technology workers—presumably due to their specific labor‐market situation—differ from other white‐collar workers in a predictable manner. Accordingly, the difference we observe between occupational categories is unlikely to be an artifact of “white collar”‐type workers selecting into high‐technology employment.            "
"43","We conduct a second placebo test by assessing whether economic threat and cultural threat predict opposition to Indian immigration in general.36Table 2 presents OLS regressions predicting support for increasing the number of immigrants from India. As shown in all four columns of the table, economic threat does not predict the contraction of support for immigration of Indians. In other words, economic threat is negatively related to support only for the specific form of high‐skilled immigration that potentially poses competition for jobs, but not toward Indian immigration generally.            "
"44","In contrast, the effect associated with cultural threat on support for Indian immigration is comparable to that of economic threat in predicting opposition to H‐1B visas. As shown in the first and third columns of Table 1, moving from the bottom to the top of the IAT score (increasing in prejudice against Indians) is associated with a 12 percentage point decrease in the policy scale (p = .02). Interestingly, this effect remains even when controlling for explicit measures of cultural threat—negative perceptions of Indians and reported threat from foreign influence (see the second and fourth columns of Table 1). As shown in the second and fourth columns of Table 1, we also find a significant, negative effect of explicitly measured cultural threat (as measured by negative traits and perceived threat of foreign influence) on support for H‐1B visas. Thus, it is possible that previous studies may in fact have understated the influence of cultural concerns on immigration attitudes, given that they did not measure implicit attitudes that are not picked up by self‐reports. As shown in Table 2, cultural threat is also negatively related to support for Indian immigration. Unlike economic concerns, cultural concerns are indiscriminant with respect to whether the immigrant group will affect one's position in the labor market—any “intrusion” of foreign influence is opposed.            "
"45","Providing additional reassurance in the estimates, it is perhaps useful to note that the direction of the effect for each control variable in our analyses (e.g., gender, age, education, race, income, and party identification), including all controls with statistically significant effects, is consistent with previous findings (e.g., Hainmueller and Hiscox 2007; Mayda and Rodrik 2005). Furthermore, we conducted two additional robustness tests of the main finding that high‐technology workers are less supportive of H‐1B visas (see Appendix C in the online materials). First, we examine whether the finding could be an artifact of the specific regression specification we estimated. Using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), we analyze specification uncertainty by calculating posterior distributions over a range of coefficients and models. Our results are robust across various ways one could construct the regression model. Second, we also explore whether our results could be accounted for by unobserved individual characteristics that explain both individuals’ selection into the high‐technology sector and opposition to immigration, rather than being a result of concerns about labor‐market competition. We follow the method of sensitivity analysis proposed by Imbens (2003) and find that omission of an unobservable from the model is highly unlikely to account for the main finding.            "
"46","In sum, our analyses show that individuals employed in the high‐technology sector are significantly more likely to support a decrease in the number of H‐1B visas to foreign workers than are otherwise similar respondents employed in other sectors. Using a number of inferential strategies, we provide evidence that these differences in preferences on this immigration policy are unlikely to be a result of different cultural inclinations distinguishing high‐technology workers from other individuals."
"47","In studying the factors that shape individual attitudes on immigration, this article makes the case that scholars need to distinguish more carefully between two separate issues: the prevalence and the conditional impact of the various factors under investigation. More specifically, in analyzing the role of economic and cultural threat as factors shaping attitudes, researchers should not conflate the question of which source of threat is the main driver of opposition to immigration at a given place or time with the related, yet different, question of what impact each factor has on citizens’ immigration attitudes in circumstances where the threat is present. Indeed, studying the determinants of immigration attitudes should not be analyzed as a “horse race” between economic and cultural threat, as they are not mutually exclusive phenomena. By introducing three innovations with respect to research design—case selection, sampling strategy, and measurement—this study is able to document this important distinction between prevalence and conditional impact and address some of the key outstanding issues in the study of public opinion on immigration."
"48","The results we obtain using both IAT and explicit attitudinal measures confirm past research showing that cultural apprehension substantially increases opposition to immigration, in this case to the granting of H‐1B visas. Because the IAT has a different set of strengths and weaknesses as explicit measures, showing that both types of attitudes influence opinions on immigration increases our confidence in past research. However, in contrast to research denying its impact, our targeted sampling approach demonstrates that in a sector in which labor‐market competition exists, it is associated with a fairly sizable increase in levels of opposition to granting H‐1B visas to additional immigrants. Further, we are able to show that the results are not driven by cultural considerations, as high‐technology workers have similar IAT scores as others (Figure 1a) and the differences in policy preferences between employment categories remain even when examining only people who score low on the measure of cultural threat (Figure 2a). Our results thus suggest that past research may have failed to find evidence of economic factors underlying anti‐immigration sentiment not because labor‐market threat has no effect on people's preferences, but because for a large share of Americans, immigrants do not pose such a threat. As such, these findings make clearer why previous research that analyzed aggregate, national‐level opinion found evidence for cultural threat—which is high both in conditional impact and in prevalence—but found little evidence for economic threat—which can be high in conditional impact but is low in prevalence.         "
"49","One might contend that the research design we employed “stacked the deck” in favor of the LMC hypothesis. By focusing on a sector in which immigrants represent a sizable share of the workforce, conducting a targeted sample of the affected areas, and focusing on a narrow immigration policy that is directly relevant to that one sector, we are more likely to find evidence in line with the hypothesis. This contention, for sure, has merit. Yet two responses are in order. First, in “stacking the deck” in the way described above, this study offers a critical test of the LMC hypothesis in the sense that if it fails to find confirmatory evidence, it would disprove the claim that employment concerns have a sizable conditional impact on immigration preferences, let alone that they are prevalent. Second, while the findings of a targeted case study of this type do not necessarily apply to all the different manifestations of the immigration debate, they do provide what is arguably a credible upper‐bound estimate of the conditional impact of the LMC, at least with respect to the attitudes of high‐skilled workers. Indeed, by using our “magnifying glass” of the most likely case, our estimates of the conditional impact of economic threat are on par with the conditional impact of cultural threat. Yet for economic threat to be even close to as big a factor as cultural threat in the aggregate, the conditional impact would need to be much greater due to its generally lower prevalence. It is therefore instructive to know that even when we closely and carefully examine the influence of labor‐market concerns, the effect is detectable and substantively significant, yet limited nonetheless.         "
"50","A natural extension of this study would be to replicate the same research design in other segments of the labor market in which different immigrant groups are prominent. For example, the meatpacking industry, in which over a third of workers are foreign born (primarily Mexican) and which is primarily located in rural areas with otherwise low concentrations of immigrants, may help assess the extent to which the size of the conditional impact of the opposition to potential immigrant competitors is similar in a context of different immigrant groups, as well as in sectors employing lower rather than high‐skilled natives.37 Furthermore, new research that will expand the range of industries that are targeted for in‐depth study would be able to shed light on whether the findings from this specific case study of the high‐technology sector can be generalized to explain variation in attitudes of workers across different sectors of the economy.38 This is an important question that remains open for further study. Finally, our finding that high‐technology workers were significantly more opposed to the expansion of H‐1B visas (but not immigration in general) calls for more research on whether asking workers about their views on specific rather than on generic immigration policies produces systematically divergent results.         "
"51","The relevance of our findings for understanding the broader political debate over immigration is nonetheless a pertinent question: to what extent, for example, does this analysis speak to the ongoing debate surrounding low‐skilled migration to the United States from Mexico? A useful framework to contextualize our findings is the matrix proposed by Lowi (1972) and Wilson (1973), which offers a typology of the different types of political competition over public policy.39 The typology is based on differentiating policies along two dimensions: (1) whether the policy's costs are concentrated or diffuse and (2) whether the benefits the policy yields are concentrated or diffuse. The policy of issuing H‐1B visas, as our analysis earlier highlighted, is one where both the benefits and the costs are concentrated. The beneficiaries are primarily equity holders and management in a fairly narrow segment of the economy, who gain access to skilled foreign labor at a low cost, often significantly lower than that associated with employing comparable domestic labor.40 Similarly, the costs are also concentrated, confined to the narrow group of workers competing in the same occupations as the incoming H‐1B migrants.41 According to Wilson's framework, policies with concentrated costs and benefits lead to “interest group politics,” whereby protagonists around the issue have strong incentives to mobilize while the broad public remains largely uninvolved. Indeed, this account accords well with the politics surrounding the legislation over changes to the H‐1B program. On the one hand, narrow interest groups are vigorously lobbying either in favor or against the visas program.42 On the other hand, the broader public and media are largely absent from the debate, as are most politicians. Put differently, visas for high‐skilled workers, an issue with low prevalence but high conditional impact, is fought out intensely among interest groups via lobbying efforts, but done so mostly behind the scenes and off the national political stage.         "
"52","In contrast, low‐skilled migration from south of the border, primarily from Mexico, is a clear example of an issue with both high prevalence and large conditional impact, thus leading to a very different political dynamic. The high prevalence is at least partly due to the sheer scale of low‐skilled Hispanic migration to the United States (Hanson 2007), yet it is also an outcome of the cultural threat that Hispanic migration allegedly poses. In particular, concerns about the language proficiency of Hispanic migrants and their prospects of assimilation are issues that are widely discussed in both the political arena and the popular media.43 Since the gains from low‐skilled migration—numerous forms of low‐cost services performed in a broad geographic dispersion—and the costs are both widely distributed, Wilson's framework predicts a very different type of political battle labeled “majoritarian politics.” In this type of conflict, each side seeks to mobilize broad constituencies made up of diverse groups and individuals, including some who are only indirectly affected by the issue. Indeed, this seems to be an apt description of the debate in the United States over Hispanic migration, which has been a prominent issue in both local and national politics and which engages presidents, governors, mayors, the media, and political parties, as well as a wide array of civil society groups. In sum, the Lowi‐Wilson framework helps not only to situate the findings of our study in the broader discussion over the politics of immigration, but also points to the type of sectors that can gainfully be studied in future work.         "
"53","A notable finding of this study is that the opposition to the entry of high‐technology workers was not shared by skilled natives employed in other white‐collar occupations. Furthermore, we also find that workers in the high‐technology sector were opposed to the narrow policy of visas in skilled occupations, but were not more antagonistic toward the arrival of Indian migrants more broadly. These two patterns suggest that there is not much of a “spillover” effect, whereby concerns about one form of immigration spread across the economy to other sectors and toward other types of migrants. This implies that politicians who seek to cater to the needs of special interest groups (e.g., business associations in a certain industry) can do so by advancing highly targeted immigration policies, without necessarily affecting voter preferences on other forms of immigration."
"54","This analysis highlights the need for scholars in general to take note of the importance of utilizing targeted sampling strategies that can effectively test the mechanisms underlying their arguments. Consider, for example, the ongoing debate in the political economy literature that centers on the question of whether individual preferences on trade policy follow a “factor‐based” or an “industry‐based” logic (e.g., Mayda and Rodrik 2005; Scheve and Slaughter 2001). Whereas the former logic suggests that people's attitudes on trade liberalization are shaped by the impact of trade on the relative market demand for their skills, the latter logic holds that people's preferences are dictated by trade's impact on their industry of employment. Almost without exception, research using individual‐level data has found only weak evidence for an industry‐based logic, but much stronger support for the factor‐based argument (e.g., Beaulieu 2002; Mansfield and Mutz 2009). As with the case of attitudes on immigration, evidence for the importance of the factor‐based logic is obtained using education as a proxy for skill. Our findings suggest that lack of support for the industry‐based logic may have more to do with the data (i.e., the samples) used to test the competing hypotheses than with the actual merits of the argument. It could be that by sampling larger sets of respondents in targeted industries (including import‐competing ones), scholars would be able to detect “industry effects” on trade attitudes that are difficult to estimate when using national samples with only a handful of respondents from each industry. In contrast, if no evidence of industry effects is found in such a targeted approach, such a study would effectively put to rest this frequent contention.         "
"55","Finally, our results call for applying great caution in drawing conclusions regarding the conditional impact of certain factors, instead of interpreting them as evidence about their prevalence. Without fine‐grained data for testing a mechanism at the subunit level in which the mechanism is presumed to operate, one should shy away from making inferences about the mechanism's potential strength and instead focus on the question of its actual prevalence. In fact, several recent studies offer compelling examples of how data collection at the microlevel can allow scholars to test arguments about the local dynamics of the politicization of the immigration issue (e.g., Dancygier 2010; Hopkins 2010). Pursuit of this approach, we contend, offers the most fruitful path forward in explaining variation in the national prominence and form of the immigration issue in contemporary politics.         "
