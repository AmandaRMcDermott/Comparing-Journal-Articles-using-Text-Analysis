"1","The belief that appearances matter in a representative democracy figured prominently in the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold certain provisions of the Federal Campaign Finance Act of 1971 as amended in 1974 (FECA), as well as the more recent Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA). Congress, the court argued in Buckley, “could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence ‘is also critical … if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent,’ ” (Buckley v. Valeo 1976, 9, quoting CSC v. Letter Carriers 1973, 565).3 In McConnell v. FEC (2003), the recent decision upholding most provisions of the BCRA, the Court consistently refers to the Government's “strong interests” in “preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption.” Whereas Buckley had referred to the Government interest in “combating the appearance or perception of corruption engendered by large campaign contributions” as of “almost equal” importance to combating corruption (Buckley v. Valeo 1976, 27), McConnell refers at one point to the “Government's strong interests in preventing corruption, and in particular the appearance of corruption,” phrasing that suggests an evolution in the Court's view of the importance of appearances to the legitimacy of democratic institutions (McConnell v. FEC 2003, 47, my emphasis). “Take[ing] away Congress' authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and ‘the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance’ ” (McConnell v. FEC 2003, 53, quoting Shrink v. Missouri 1999, 390).         "
"2","The Court is not the only institution to place an increasing emphasis on appearances. The Senate Ethics Manual now states explicitly that Senators have an obligation to ensure their actions do not create appearances of impropriety or conflict of interest (U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics 2003, 21). The House Ethics Manual stipulates that, since public office is a “public trust,” members shall “conduct themselves at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the House” (U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct 1992, chap. 1). The rules Congress now applies to itself were already reflected in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which created the Office of Government Ethics and the now‐lapsed Office of Independent Counsel. Similar codes have been adopted by most U.S. states, the governments of virtually all of the developed democracies, and, indeed, most corporations and nonprofit organizations as well.         "
"3","The combined effect of these codifications has been to upgrade considerations of appearance from the prudential status they have always had in politics to ethical obligations and institutional norms. Such upgradings raise few theoretical problems insofar they amount to new justifications added to others for outlawing corrupt acts. It seems likely and reasonable that public officials will appear to be cleaner if the public knows they will be sanctioned for bribes, quid pro quo, undue use of influence, or any of a number of other actionable offenses. But regulations of appearances take on a life of their own—and thus require independent theoretical justification—in two distinct classes of anticorruption measures. These measures are aimed not just at corrupt or improper acts, but also at appearances of corruption, even when there is no underlying misdeed.         "
"4","First, as with FECA and BCRA, many laws are prophylactic in nature (Stark 2000, chap. 1). They guard against the appearances of corruption indirectly, by limiting the circumstances that make corrupt acts possible. Such laws focus primarily on finances, limiting the amounts and sources of campaign contributions, honoraria, and gifts, and requiring disclosure or divestiture of economic interests. Under such laws, officials are strictly liable for infractions. Officials are, in effect, liable not just for their actual conduct, but also for how their conduct appears to others. That citizens rely on appearances provides one key justification for strict liability: what citizens can know are the general rules that define the role and govern the conduct of representatives. Citizens are rarely in a position to know whether, say, a particular campaign contribution actually influenced the subsequent vote of a member of Congress. As indicated by the Court's reasoning, prophylactic laws aim to produce confidence in appearances—confidence that the causes and reasons for public decisions are visible—by limiting the chances that the public's business can be conducted out of the public eye.         "
"5","Second, since the mid‐1960s ethical standards have emerged that make the appearance of corruption or impropriety itself an offense—usually punishable by censure or loss of position—even when the appearance cannot be traced to an underlying corrupt or improper act, and even when the official has not run afoul of prophylactic conflict of interest laws. Such standards are found in the ethical codes of both houses of Congress, the “Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch” (Code of Federal Regulations 2003, 532),4 as well as within the ethical codes of numerous corporations and nongovernmental organizations.         "
"6","Both classes of laws and codes—what I am referring to as appearance regulations—have been conceived and justified in large part by the view that citizen confidence in democratic institutions requires confidence in appearances. But there are important differences. Prophylactic rules are essentially structural and negative: they for the most part aim to manage conflicts of interest by limiting flows of money and favors. Although the strict liability embedded in prophylactic laws is justified in part by a need for appearances to have integrity, appearances are regulated only indirectly, as a consequence of prohibiting the circumstances that tend toward corruption. In contrast, laws and codes that require officials to maintain appearances consistent with their office speak to the widely held sense that prohibitions are not sufficient to define the positive obligations of office, indeed, that it is possible and even common for representatives to conduct themselves legally and yet fail the duties of their office (Lewis 2000; Warren 2004).         "
"7","Appearance standards are also distinct from prophylactic laws in that they aim to support a relationship of accountability between citizens and representative, given the mediated quality of the information available to citizens (Hellman 2001, 686; Thompson 1995, 125–26). From this perspective, appearance standards indicate a representative's obligation to provide citizens with resources necessary for their judgments, a point to which I return below. For this reason, the transformation of appearance standards into positive duties not encompassed by specific prohibitions goes to the very heart of the representative relationship in a democracy and certainly well beyond the financial conflicts of interest at the center of prophylactic legislation such as FECA and BCRA.         "
"8","Finally, appearance standards differ from prophylactic laws in that they place an extra burden on political representatives. Representatives are charged with the creative work of developing rules for collective actions, but they do so under “political” conditions—that is, when “the public interest” is uncertain or contested. The obligations and duties of representatives are less specific than, say, those of civil service or judicial offices. In large part owing to this circumstance—one that follows from the political nature of the office—representatives have a positive duty to maintain communication with constituents in order that their interests are reflected in decisions. The office of the representative is, in short, communicative and creative, making it likely that any set of codified prohibitions sufficient to guard against improprieties would also undermine the representative functions of the office. It is for these reasons, perhaps, that suspicions of corruption surround Congress much more so than the professional offices of the executive and judicial branches—and why here too appearance standards would seem to carry a greater burden."
"9","As regulations of appearances have come into their own, however, they have also attracted criticism. With respect to prophylactic laws, some suggest, “reformers' ostensible concern about the appearance of corruption is just for appearances. The politicians' real concern is to silence their critics” (Will 2002; see also Morgan and Reynolds 1997), a sentiment that figured heavily into Justice Scalia's dissent in McConnell (2003). As to appearance standards, critics point out that they are inconsistent with accepted legal standards. They are necessarily vague and imprecise because they cover improprieties that are not codified. Officials are, in effect, held accountable for infractions that they could not know in advance, thus violating their due process rights against factual prejudgment and legal retroactivity. Appearance standards thus create, according to critics, a class of “political crimes,” punishable without benefit of due process of law (Stark 2000, chap. 20). In addition, some critics argue that because appearance standards focus on the ethical qualities of public officials, they degrade political debate by shifting public attention from policy to character (Rosenthal 1998). Moreover, the critics suggest, focusing on appearances may actually increase corruption, since the obsession with appearances itself induces officials to behave as Machiavellians—to stage appearances of ethical conduct rather than actually acting ethically (Morgan and Reynolds 1997; Rosenthal 1998). Finally, to paraphrase Justice Kennedy's dissent in McConnell (2003), is it not sufficient simply to regulate corrupt or improper acts, which are, after all, the root cause of appearances of corruption?         "
"10","My arguments here, however, are directed less at the critics of appearance regulations than at supporters, whose justifications, as I shall argue below, leave appearance regulations vulnerable to such criticisms. The short answer to the critics is that justifications of appearance regulations follow neither from legal frameworks as applied to individuals, nor from everyday ethics, but rather from political theory—democratic theory in particular. Two considerations weigh in favor of this strategy of justification. First, Court opinions consistently weigh “Government interests” in sustaining the institutions of representative democracy above other considerations. Second, the rapid development of laws and codes justified by appearance regulations provides a prima facie case for developing and assessing the Court's suggestions from the perspective of democratic theory."
"11","What would understanding appearance standards from the perspective of democratic theory involve? As a first approximation, we might say that:"
"12","                        "
"13","Appearance regulations function to support citizen inclusion in public discourse and judgment, which is one means citizens possess to hold representatives accountable for representing their interests and values. Appearance regulations do so by defining the duties of representative office with respect to citizens' need for trustworthy information, under circumstances in which citizens are vulnerable to deceit, owing to the strategic nature of politics combined with the mediated qualities of the citizen‐representative relationship."
"14","If appearance standards underwrite citizens' capacities to hold official accountable, they do so as an enabling complement to the many other accountability mechanisms that work within democratic institutional ecologies, including voting, checks and balances, transparency legislation, media scrutiny, and civil society activism."
"15","At least these two claims are implied in the Court's justifications of appearance standards, and, as I shall argue, should be involved in any democratic justification. But in addition, justifications commonly include a third claim, namely,"
"16","Representatives hold a “public trust” on behalf of citizens, and appearance standards underwrite public trust (see, e.g., Hellman 2001, 668; Thompson 1995, 125–26). Appearances of corruption erode public trust.                  "
"17","From a theoretical perspective, this third claim is crucially ambiguous, in part because the implications of the first two claims have not been sufficiently developed.5“Public trust,” as commonly conceived, assumes that the interests and values of citizens and public officials converge, as they often do in settled areas of administration. In such domains, officials act, or should act, as trustees of the public interest. But in the more political offices—such as those of representatives—the conditions of trust cannot be taken for granted, just because the domain is defined, in part, by conflicting interests and values. The public trust justification of appearance regulations overreaches, and it does so precisely at that point where political processes begin—that is, processes oriented toward collective decision making in the face of conflict (Warren 1999a). In politics, trust of this kind (as opposed to the trustworthiness of officials) is not always desirable (Thompson 2004, chap. 11). When one trusts, as Baier notes, “one depends on another's good will.” One is “necessarily vulnerable to the limits of that good will. One leaves others an opportunity to harm one when one trusts, and one also shows one's confidence that they will not take it” (1986, 235). More formally, trust exists for A when he delegates to B control over good C in which A has an interest. Borrowing Hardin's terminology, A has good reason or warrant to trust B when A can know that his interests are encapsulated in B's, because in knowing this, he also knows something about B's motivations (1993; 1999, 24–26).6 B is trustworthy just to the extent that she attends to A's interests. I shall refer to trust based on encapsulated interests as first‐order trust.7"
"18","As a general matter, political relations fail to meet the conditions of first‐order trust because would‐be trusters should not assume that trustees encapsulate their interests (Warren 1999b). More specifically, distrust is warranted under the conditions that define political conflict:         "
"19","                        "
"20","Members of a collectivity have differing interests."
"21","At least some members (B) have the capacity to pursue their interests."
"22","Such pursuits adversely impact—or are perceived to impact—the interests of others (A)."
"23","B has no apparent motive to encapsulate A's interests."
"24","Under these circumstances A should distrust B, whether B is a fellow citizen, a group, or political representative. Moreover, the risks of mistaken trust increase when the powers of the state—or any other organized power for that matter—come into play owing to its capacities to make and impose authoritative decisions.         "
"25","Two general features of democratic institutions address trust relationships. The first is widely recognized: the devices of voting, elections at regular intervals, and institutional checks and balances ideally function to align interests between citizens and their representatives, in this way tending to underwrite the conditions of trust. The second feature is equally important but less well recognized: democracies underwrite trust by “institutionalizing distrust” (Strompzka 1999, 140–45; see also Thompson 2004, 250–63). Because politics works at the frontiers of consensus, no representative can encapsulate all the interests of citizens, nor should citizens assume that trust of representatives can be taken for granted. Indeed, democratic institutions evolved on the bases of widespread judgments that, as a rule of thumb, trust ought not to be placed in political elites (Dunn 1988; Strompzka 1999, chap. 7). Every good political institution, as Bentham put it, is a “system of distrust.”“Who[m] ought we to distrust, if not those to whom is committed great authority, with great temptations to abuse it?” (1999, 37). A key achievement of democratic institutions—a key to their vibrant stability—has been to institutionalize a distinction between those domains of society where first‐order trust is warranted, and domains where it is not.         "
"26","Theoretically, then, democracies generate trust within society as well as in many functional institutions by “institutionalizing distrust” within the political system. Democratic institutions work best when they neither suppress the conflicts nor deny the distrust that accompanies them. Rather, democracies empower partisans to pursue their interests and values through arguments and votes, while denying them the powers of violence or economic blackmail. The “institutionalization of distrust” consists of the system of empowerments and prohibitions that pushes the conflicts at the root of distrust into venues where they are visible and can be negotiated by the powers democracies allow (Thompson 2004, 256–59; Warren 1999b). Thus democracies affirm distrust because they acknowledge the existence of conflicting interests and values within any collectivity. But they hedge the consequences of conflict—and thus of distrust—by limiting the powers that partisans can deploy to persuasion and voting, in this way providing incentives for deliberations, bargains, compromises, and even transformations of interests and values. If first‐order trust is to be had, then, it should be an outcome of political processes that align interests and values rather than a precondition. If democracies are associated with more (first‐order) trust within society (Uslaner 2002, 223–25), it is likely because they do the work of interest and value alignment—the condition of warranted first‐order trust—better than other kinds of systems, and they do so because they provide institutional conduits for distrust, where its underlying causes can be negotiated.8 In this way, democracies continually build the conditions of first‐order trust within society by institutionalizing distrust within political systems. If the first‐order trust model applies to government at all, then, it would seem more appropriate for its less political, more administrative functions—say, delivering social security checks, or monitoring airline safety—than for its more political functions such as political representation, as well as administering or adjudicating policies about which there is no broad consensus.         "
"27","If distrust is an appropriate response to political relationships, then why should we be concerned about low trust in the political functions of government? If the characterization above holds, democracies work when they are continually transformative of relations of distrust within politics into those of first‐order trust within society, as well as within the less political, more administrative functions of government. If low trust in government indicates that citizens are appropriately distinguishing between arenas where trust is warranted and those where it is not, then all is all is well.         "
"28","But if low trust instead indicates disaffection from the institutions that manage distrust, then the kind of distrust necessary for a democracy to work—engaged monitoring of political officials—is replaced by disengagement, undermining the transformative capacities of democratic institutions. So the dichotomy between (first‐order) trust and distrust is insufficient, since it does not tell us how to distinguish between the engaged distrust upon which democracy thrives, and the distrustful disaffection that leads to its demise (Tucker 2004, 16–18). Engaged distrust, I shall suggest, depends upon trust in another sense, to which I shall refer as a second‐order trust that political officials will provide the trustworthy information for citizens to make judgments about whether to trust in the first‐order sense or to participate because first‐order trust is not warranted.         "
"29","The democratic functions of second‐order trust only become evident when we conceive democracy at a high level of abstraction, as the form of collective self‐rule that empowers affected individuals to participate in collective decisions. Ideally, democracy requires that every individual potentially affected by a collective decision should have an opportunity to affect the decision, proportionally to his or her stake in the outcome (see, e.g., Dahl 1998, 37–38; Habermas 1996, 107; Held 1996, 324; Young 2000, 23). For democratic inclusion to be effective, individuals not only need to be enfranchised to participate in collective decisions. Individuals must also have the conditions and capacities to make autonomous judgments—that is, decisions free from coercions, threats, or blackmail, and based on a good understanding of the interests and values of oneself and others. Second‐order trust goes to this latter normative criterion of democracy: the capacity to make autonomous judgments is a condition of participating in public judgments, including the choice of representative, assessing his decisions and rationales, and, ultimately, holding him to account.         "
"30","The pivotal role of second‐order trust in democracy is even more clear when we consider its opposite, deceit. Deceit and violence, writes Bok, “are the two forms of deliberate assault on human beings. Both can coerce people into acting against their will. Most harm that can befall victims though violence can come to them also through deceit. But deceit controls more subtly, for it works on belief as well as action” (1978, 19). When deception succeeds, “it can give power to the deceiver—power that all who suffer the consequences of lies would not wish to abdicate” (1978, 22–23).         "
"31","Democracies control outright violence and (less successfully) economic coercion. To be sure, within every democracy there are groups—certain minorities, some of the poor, undocumented immigrants—whose rights are precarious, poorly enforced, and often violated. But from the perspective of democratic theory such violations are exogenous to democracy. Unlike violence, however, deceit is a form of coercive exclusion that is endogenous to democracy, which can take up residence within speech through deceit, the primary medium of conflict resolution in democracy. Precisely because the use of violence is highly constrained, democracies may actually create incentives for deceit by those having or desiring power or by those seeking to defend what they have. Indeed, for this reason, corruption is, perhaps, the pathology of politics to which democracies are most prone (Warren 2004). And because it is intrinsic to corruption that it “subtracts power from visible sites” (della Porta and Vannucci 1999, 124), the possibilities of deceit are thoroughly entangled with the probabilities of corruption.         "
"32","It is for good reason, then, that democratic politics breeds suspicion: partisans know that their powers are those of persuasion, and all know that persuasion can make use of deceit. So although the jaded but common view that “all politicians are liars and thieves” is an exaggeration, it is also revealing of the circumstance that deceit is the principal means of coercion in a system that valorizes speech and persuasion (Arendt 1968, 227–64).         "
"33","These considerations suggest that the sensitivity to appearances within a democracy reveals a deeper concern with deceit and its close relationship to distributions of power, given the democratic norm of inclusive and autonomous public judgment. Appearances are clues to the possibilities of coercion through deceit, the importance of which is intensified by background distrust and suspicion. Once deceits are uncovered or discovered—as they were with Watergate, the Pentagon Papers, the Savings and Loan scandal, Enron, the justification of the war in Iraq, the Sponsorship Scandal in Quebec, and numerous other major and minor instances—individuals often reassess their past actions in light of the knowledge that they have been manipulated. The results tend to be poisonous, magnifying distrust and casting all in the light of betrayal. The deceived justifiably “feel wronged; they are wary of new overtures. … They see that they were manipulated, that the deceit made them unable to make choices for themselves according to the most adequate information available, unable to act as they would have wanted to act had they known all along” (Bok 1978, 21–22). A democracy that works, then, must have hedges, not against (first‐order) distrust—which is warranted within any domain structured by conflicts of interest—but against deceit, because deceit deprives citizens of not just of their ability to make autonomous political judgments about issues or their political agents, but also their ability to judge when trust is warranted and when it is not. When second‐order trust is not possible, we should expect distrust to cause disaffection rather than participation.         "
"34","Many structural tendencies in the developed democracies reinforce distrust‐based disaffection (Mansbridge 1997). Governments have dramatically expanded their functions, while decision making has become more complex. From the citizen's perspective, the possibilities for deceit grow with the multiplicity and complexity of political decisions. For an increasing number of citizens, group and party‐based hedges have been replaced with what Thompson calls “the politics of trust.” Individuals, now less aligned with parties and agenda‐comprehensive groups, and aided by the rapid development of the visual media, look for hedges against deceit by seeking to discern “the character of the individuals who are (or might become) their leaders and are more concerned about their trustworthiness, because increasingly this becomes the principle means of guaranteeing that political promises will be kept and that difficult decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty will be made on the basis of sound judgment” (Thompson 2000, 112; see also Thompson 2004, 247–49). Mansbridge refers to this form of representation as “gyroscopic,” since voters seek representatives who rotate on their own axis, forming a principled and predictable control over the political system (2003, 520–22).         "
"35","But if, as studies suggest (Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse 2002, chap. 6; Stimson, Mackuen, and Erikson 1995), this first‐order trust‐based mode of representation forms a large and sometimes dominant mode of representation, then we might also expect deceits and disappointments to assume a high public visibility for two reasons (Patterson 1996). First, the interest situation of the political representative is always complex, requiring her to balance and compromise many competing interests and values. Second, even if there were to be a coincidence of interests between citizen and representative, it is unlikely that most citizens of large‐scale democracies could have sufficient knowledge of a politician's interests and motivations to warrant first‐order trust (Hardin 1999).         "
"36","But let us try out another version of citizen demands for trustworthy representation. Maybe the demand is not for encapsulated interests (the basis of first‐order trust), but rather for “sincerity” or truthfulness—the positive value associated with the common sentiment that most politicians are liars, and one that gets more directly at the problem of deceit. Jimmy Carter's promise to speak from the heart and John McCain's “Straight Talk Express” spoke to this sentiment. In these cases, political candidates asserted that what they say can be trusted, that their speech will reflect their best judgments, beliefs, and understandings of the facts and reveal their motivations for decisions and actions. In contrast, during the 2000 presidential campaign, Al Gore's apparent shifting on the issues, his difficulties in expressing positions in simple language, all seemed to signal—at least to a crucial group of independent, nongroup affiliated voters—that he was “not to be trusted.”         "
"37","This form of trust (or distrust) is not based on encapsulated interests (in which case the political representative is a public trustee), and therefore it is not trust of the first order. Rather, it is trust in the veracity of speech, what I am referring to as second‐order trust (Bok 1978, 33n). Truthful speech acts would provide citizens with the knowledge they need to judge whether, in any particular case, first‐order trust is warranted. When second‐order trust does lead to first‐order trust, second‐order trust becomes less relevant. Indeed, in its strongest forms, first‐order trust is a passive relationship: the point of trusting you is that I don't need to monitor your performance—I trust you to do your best for my interests. It follows that if I trust a political representative in the first‐order sense, I may also reasonably conclude that I don't need to participate in the sense of monitoring the official or pressuring for my views to be taken into account.         "
"38","But it may also happen that second‐order trust leads to first‐order distrust: as a citizen I judge that my interests are not encapsulated by a political representative's interests, and I make this judgment because of what she truthfully and sincerely says. Based on her words (which I trust) I decide to forgo first‐order trust in favor of pressure or persuasion, through which I will seek to have my interests encapsulated within the representatives' interests. Indeed, this is the relationship between first‐order and second‐order trust that is most desirable in democratic politics: citizens should participate in arenas where they have conflicting interests, and they should be able to base their participation upon second‐order trust in representatives. First‐order trust and political participation trade off against one another, as they necessarily will in today's complex democracies (Bohman 1999; Warren 1999b). Second‐order trust enables individuals to decide how to divide their political labors between first‐order trust and participation, while enabling participation where first‐order trust is not warranted.         "
"39","In a democracy, then, second‐order trust is the trust that a representative's public appearances—her words and deeds—provide a reliable guide to her reasons for decisions, that secretive influences are not bending the representative's judgments, and that she is not engaged in deceit about public matters. Stated positively, second‐order trust is a confidence in the fidelity of the representative to the norms of publicity and public accountability. In principal‐agent language, when the representative is the recipient of the principal's second‐order trust, he is not the agent of the principal's interests, but rather the agent of a key condition—credible information about motivations and interests—of the principal's capacity to participate in public judgments. Second‐order trust is a condition of inclusion in political judgments. So second‐order trust reflects “trust in government” in the specific sense that processes of decision making have the integrity necessary for individuals to monitor decisions and hold their representatives accountable, should they decide to do so. From the perspective of democratic systems, second‐order trust enables public deliberation and justification to have an autonomous force—that is, for reasons and reasoning to have a motivational force within the system (Gutmann and Thompson 1996; Habermas 1996; cf. Sunstein 2002, chap. 1).         "
"40","The key problem with the standard defense of appearance regulations, then, is it depends upon a model of trust that is inappropriate for politics. The defense views political officials as public trustees rather than as representatives within democratic political processes. The model rests on what is, in effect, a bureaucratic conception of trusteeship, which assumes that public purposes have been settled and, as it were, handed off to officials who function as trusted agents in the first‐order sense. It is no wonder, then, that in the United States thinking about the ethics and duties of office is highly articulated in the executive branch, but still in its infancy in the political arenas—the political offices of the executive branch and in the legislature (Hastings Center 1985; Stark 2000, 56; Thompson 1995; Warren 2004).         "
"41","We are still left with the question, however, as to how individuals could know when second‐order trust is warranted. Can appearances support this warrant? This question brings the democratic functions of appearance regulations more sharply into focus. The question turns on the epistemology of appearances, from which both ethical and institutional consequences follow. “Epistemology,” as I shall use the term here, has to do with the authority or “force” of cognitive judgments. By “appearances” I shall simply mean the range of publicly available performances of persons—speech, deeds, and images—which, combined with contextual information, enable individuals to judge those matters related to second‐order trust. At least three kinds of epistemic relationships depend upon appearances in this sense: (a) politicians' attentiveness to citizens' judgments; (b) citizens' judgments of their representatives' second‐order trustworthiness; and (c) citizens' judgments of substantive matters of policy."
"42","Typically, only the first of these relationships figures into criticisms of appearance regulations (Morgan and Reynolds 1997; Rosenthal 1998). It is distinctive of the perspective of the representative official that the relationship between appearances and the underlying reality holds: the representative knows what he thinks and does, and he seeks to appear in such a way that these realities are either presented to or obscured from public view. To the extent that the issue is framed from the representative's perspective, appearance regulations would seem to make no distinctive epistemological contributions. In the case of a conflict of interest, for example, the question as to whether an official's judgment was in fact compromised or simply appeared to be so can, in principle, be resolved by referring the appearance to a reality knowable by the official. Those like Justice Kennedy who view appearance regulations as adding nothing to the reality—either an official acted improperly or did not—are viewing appearance regulations solely from the perspective of the public official rather from the perspective of the epistemological requirements of citizen judgments (McConnell v. FEC 2003, 13–14, cf. Hellman 2001, 686; Thompson 1995, 124).            "
"43","Nonetheless, even from the official's perspective, appearance regulations—particularly appearance standards—make a distinctive epistemological contribution when assessed from the perspective of democratic theory. While conflict of interest and other prophylactic laws guard against compromising circumstances, appearance standards go further, reminding officials of those influences to which they should be responsive. As Stark puts it, “a capacity to take into account the public's factual prejudgments, as well as an ability to anticipate the public's changing normative purposes—its political perception and political sensitivity—are traits central to a traditional western philosophical understanding of the nature of political judgment” (2000, 225). “The appearance standard …places a set of illiberal constraints on officeholders in order to heighten their democratic representativeness—in order to ensure that officials perceive reality the way the public does and are sensitive to the norms that the public harbors” (229). Appearance standards can in this way enhance what Mansbridge calls “anticipatory representation,” in which, under conditions of unstable preferences, a representative bases his decisions upon voters' emerging preferences rather than their existing ones (2003, 516–20).            "
"44","Such arguments become even stronger from the perspective of deliberative theories of democracy, which depend in part on individuals' capacities to understand the arguments of others (Habermas 1996). Within democratic systems, representatives should represent not just the expressed interests of their constituents. They should also represent public arguments and justifications of decisions (Mansbridge 2003, 522). Within a democratic context, a representative's attentiveness to how he appears to others is part and parcel of perspective taking, which is in turn an essential part of deliberation. This function is intrinsic to democratic representation, since the legitimacy of decisions depends, in part, upon whether individuals affected understand the reasons for representative's decisions. Attentiveness to appearances is thus a kind of knowledge, gained initially, perhaps, through self‐assessments in relation to conscience and imagined audiences, then through consultation with friends, advisors, and others, and finally through broad, public engagements which are inclusive of those to whom the representative's imagination and social experience does not ordinarily stretch (Arendt 1968, 241; Bok 1978, 99–104). Appearance regulations should, then, attune the representative to these epistemic requirements of his representative role within public deliberations.            "
"45","Decisions to extend second‐order trust are among the judgments a citizen must make about their representatives. While such judgments may depend on inferences from institutional roles (as I shall suggest below), in the final analysis they are judgments of character (Aristotle 1954, 1378a). The resources citizens can bring to bear on judgments of character are necessarily different than those of the representatives themselves. Representatives can measure their own sincerity and good will against what others perceive, and thus can—if they are honest with themselves—distinguish between the appearances and reality. Again, for citizens the distinction between appearance and reality has no epistemic meaning, since they lack access to the motivations of officials. Nonetheless, citizens can and do make warranted inferences by measuring what representatives say—their reasons for their positions and their promises—against their decisions and actions. As Thompson notes, appearances are neither inherently arbitrary, nor are the norms based on appearances.            "
"46","                              "
"47","Although like any other rule of ethics, the appearance standard requires interpretation, it is, just as much as any other rule, based on facts. The standard is justified by empirical regularities: observed correlations between certain kinds of practices (accepting large contributions) and certain forms of corruption (granting favors). Appearances, rightly understood, are based on inferences from objective circumstances to subjective motives and institutional tendencies. (1995, 128–29)"
"48","Moreover, because such inferences are made over time, representatives can develop a reputation for sincerity and goodwill, which in turn makes inferences from appearances more certain in particular cases."
"49","In today's democracies, of course, the information citizens require for such judgments is highly mediated. Few individuals are sufficiently well placed to make these judgments directly and must rely upon reports from the media, advocacy groups, political opponents, commissions, oversight bodies, and election campaigns for their information, driven by their own interests and causes to seek out information, organize and filter it, and present it to the public. Most information necessary for second‐order trust—information about representative's sincerity and motivations—comes to citizens through these kinds of intermediaries. Under these conditions, critics' complaints about the “subjectivity” and arbitrariness of appearance regulations are understandable given the ill will of many advocacy groups and some portion of the mass media (Rosenthal 1998; Sabato 2000). But it is just because of these circumstances that appearance standards are particularly important: they establish baseline expectations for judging the appearances conveyed by intermediaries (Hasting Center 1985, 27–28).            "
"50","The third epistemic relationship, citizens' judgments of policies, follows directly from the above considerations. In large‐scale, complex democracies, citizens' abilities to participate in substantive judgments about policies are highly (but not solely) dependent upon second‐order trust in their representative. Although representatives are not public trustees because they are not consistently in a position to provide first‐order trustworthiness, they can and should function as (second‐order) trusted sources of arguments and facts within public debates. In most policy areas, the democratic expectation should be that second‐order trust underwrites inclusive public deliberation and judgment. If deliberations move toward a broad convergence of interests, then first‐order trust is warranted."
"51","But in some policy areas—national security or some areas of macroeconomic management such as monetary policy, for example—the relationship between first‐ and second‐order trust is reversed owing to their strategic environments. Because secrecy excludes citizen judgments about policy, citizens are entitled to assume that their representatives are acting as first‐order trustees on the basis of convergent interests. Second‐order trust appears over time, ideally warranting the initial first‐order judgments. In open societies with a full complement of media, advocacy groups, and political oppositions as well as transparency legislation, such initial first‐order judgments of trust are likely to be tested retrospectively, in such a way that first‐order trust gives way to second‐order trust. If ex post inquiries show that officials erred in their secretive judgments, as is often the case in hindsight, these findings would not necessarily show that first‐order trust was misplaced, but rather that goodwill and the intent not to deceive were not sufficient for good decisions. Political officials would still have taken decisions with an eye toward future appearances, and the second‐order trust necessary for democracy would remain intact. But in other cases—American policies in Chile in the early 1970s, the Iran‐Contra affair in the 1980s, and, most probably, the George W. Bush administration's justifications for conducting the war in Iraq, for example—secrets were designed “to prevent citizens and their [legislative] representatives from challenging the premise of the argument, the assumption that the policy itself was justifiable” (Gutmann and Thompson 1996, 117). In such cases, both first‐ and second‐trust are misplaced, and citizens will feel, justifiably, that their (executive branch) representatives betrayed their trust. In contrast, when second‐order trust remains intact, political officials gain latitude from citizens to conduct some policy work out of the public eye, usually on the assumption that secrecy is a strategic necessity, and that the policy, when it becomes known, will be subjected to public scrutiny (Gutmann and Thompson 1996, 114–27). Under these circumstances, appearance regulations stand as promissory notes for future justifications.            "
"52","Given the democratic norms of inclusion of citizens in public judgments, the ethics of appearances—the obligations that define the role of political representative—follow closely from the epistemology of appearances.9 As Thompson puts it,         "
"53","                        "
"54","In a democracy the obligation to respect the reasonable reactions of other people has political implications. The obligation is both more difficult and more important to fulfill in public than in private life. It is more difficult because citizens cannot easily collect the evidence they need to judge the motives of politicians in particular circumstances. Without such evidence, they have to judge presumptively. The obligation is generally more important than in private life because it goes to the core of the role of a representative. Citizens have a right to insist, as the price of trust in a democracy, that officials not give reason to doubt their trustworthiness. … Representatives must avoid acting under conditions that give rise to a reasonable belief of wrongdoing. When they fail to avoid doing so, they do not merely appear to do wrong, they do wrong. (1995, 125–26; cf. Hellman 2001, 668)               "
"55","The exacting connection Thompson draws between epistemology and ethics can be further elaborated in the terms of democratic theory. The obligations that attach to office holding in a democracy follow from the institutions' role in enabling democratic norms, in this case, the citizen's right to inclusion in public deliberation and judgment. In a representative democracy, it is a condition of inclusion that representative function as responsive and responsible agents for citizens within public discourse (Hastings Center 1985, 37). That is, representatives' ethical obligations to appearances flow from their role in maintaining the conditions of citizen inclusion in public judgments.         "
"56","Again, the language of trust has obscured the precise nature of these role‐based ethical obligations. While there is an important sense in which representatives hold a public trust, the language of trusteeship is often coupled—especially in conflict of interest regulations—with the notion that public official should exercise impartial judgment on behalf of the public interest (Stark, 115–16), on the assumption that citizen and representative are engaged in a “common project” which requires representatives to respect “normative trust” (Hellman 2001, 658–59, 668). Indeed, the language of trust has inadvertently sided with the “trustee” rather than the “delegate” description of representation, thus reinforcing a dichotomy that has, in any case, proved to be of little use in describing a representative's role (Gutmann and Thompson 1985, 169–74; Mansbridge 2003). She should, on this interpretation, function as a first‐order trustee, on much the same model as a bureaucrat. But a political representative's job is to determine the public interest by responding to, aggregating, interpreting, mediating, anticipating, and ultimately judging a multitude of influences, precisely because in political judgments the nature of the public interest is what is at issue. In the terms I am using here, what distinguishes the political representative from the bureaucrat is her role as a second‐order trustee within a democratic system. Entrusted are the conditions of citizen inclusion in public judgments. Thus, the questions appropriate to defining the relational, role‐based obligations of second‐order trusteeship are as follows:         "
"57","                        "
"58"," What kinds of influences do representatives respond to? Representatives should be influenced by, and represent as a second‐order trustee, facts and arguments rather than money or other nonreasoning‐based influences.                  "
"59"," Who exerts influence? Representatives should respond to all affected by potential decisions rather than only to a subset of those affected. Second‐order trusteeship holds for the domain of those affected.                  "
"60"," How are the influences exerted? Are the influences public so that all affected have an opportunity to participate? Or are they covert, excluding those who would otherwise have a right to seek influence? Second‐order trusteeship is inherently public in nature.                  "
"61","The political nature of the representative's role, with its demands to balance the appeals of some constituents against others and both against broader public interests, makes it exceedingly difficult to codify these ethical obligations. The problem of what these obligations require with respect to appearances, however, can be radically simplified by means of a political analogy to the moral logic of the categorical imperative.10 In drawing the line between what is proper and improper, a representative should ask: Would I want the reasons for my decision to become known to all those affected? This one question combines the what, the who, and the how of the above questions by testing whether the representative's motives are consistent with discursive, inclusive, and public influences.11 From an ethical perspective, then, appearance standards function as an ethical test that focuses on the epistemic relationship between representative and citizen and requires the representative to judge his actions from the perspective of what is or might be known by citizens. While no test can be definitive, a test such as this one can help identify in specific cases the ethical obligations that relate to the epistemic requirements of democratic inclusion.         "
"62","An interpretation of appearance standards such as this one would make sense of codes that list specific improprieties, but also identify appearances of corruption as a separate kind of offense. Rather than amounting to an unnecessary “piling on”—as critics suggest—the additional obligation might be seen as a reflexive test that provides substance to the codified improprieties, made necessary by the inevitable ambiguities of rules, as well as the insufficiency of “working to rule” in matters of ethical judgment (Hasting Center 1985, 27–28). The wrong committed by representatives when they fail appearance standards is, then, not just a strategic failure; it is also an ethical failure of the duties that define the representative role (Thompson 1995, 124). The most damaging consequence is the violation of second‐trust and, with this, a corruption of democratic process.         "
"63","From the perspective of citizens, ethics cannot by itself sustain the burden of decisions as to whether to place second‐order trust in their representatives. Within the context of strategic environments—and politics is such an environment—ethical obligations are vulnerable to collective action problems: those who hold to ethical norms can be suckered by adhering to them. Candidates for elected office, for example, have often claimed that they would like to forgo money from large donors, but they cannot “unilaterally disarm.” Moreover, appearance standards are, ultimately, standards of behavior that should follow from a representative's understanding of role obligations and the good will to realize them. But while behavior can be regulated; ethical sensibilities and good will cannot. Thus, even when citizens' know the ethical obligations of representatives, then, they still face the problem of assessing their sufficiency as a warrant for second‐order trust, particularly within a context of limited knowledge based on appearances.12"
"64","In principle, warrants for second‐order trust can be strengthened by institutions, which, if well‐designed, can bear much of the burden of citizens' inferences from appearances to second‐order trust (see, e.g., Offe 1999). From the perspective of social theory, institutions are rule‐based practices combined with sanctions. What citizens can know about representatives is, in part, what they know about the institutions of which representatives are a part. Institutions with integrity define the office‐holder obligations that follow from their defining purposes. Office‐holders inherit and benefit from the confidence bestowed on strong and predictable institutions. Accordingly, they assume a responsibility to exemplify and maintain confidence in the institution. Finally, institutions backstop ethics by leveling sanctions at those who deviate from their requirements.         "
"65","To the extent that representative institutions are designed to support integrity, judgments about second‐order trust can be transferred, as it were, from institutions to representatives in at least four ways. First, when institutions exist that enable anticorruption laws—independent judiciaries, oversight commissions, and permanent auditing agencies, for example—citizens have more reason to impute second‐order trustworthiness to their representatives (Rose‐Ackerman 1999, chap. 9). From the perspective of appearances, these institutions back up the ethics, providing citizens with some confidence that what they cannot see is not secretly undermining what they can see. As noted above, these kinds of regulations and enforcement mechanisms function not only to curb violations, but also to provide the conditions of second‐order trust by inducing politicians to avoid having interests or connections that produce questionable appearances. In this respect, anticorruption regimes are not so different from laws that make trust easier among strangers: I am more willing to trust a taxi driver with my life if I know that the taxi commission and department of motor vehicles have some effective regulation over the driver and his car.         "
"66","Second, citizens can infer second‐order trust from the standards exemplified by the visible conduct of officeholders themselves. Institutions with high legitimacy constrain their members to exemplify institutional norms in their appearances. In representative institutions, appearance standards are more than prohibitions; they are part of the defining purposes of the political institutions, precisely because they function within the domain of public judgment to signal inclusion of those affected by collective decisions."
"67","Third, discursively structured representative institutions allow citizens to infer that representatives have in interest in a reputation for veracity that supplements institutional ethics (Stark 2000, chap. 23). The incentive can be inferred for those institutions that (a) effectively prohibit conflict resolution by nondiscursive means, thus increasing the strategic value of persuasion. A reputation for truthfulness has force in such bodies, while being caught out in a deceit destroys the power of good reputation. The incentive also depends on (b) a degree of representative inclusion sufficient to provide checks against deceits. If representation is more inclusive, more pressure will exist within the institution to avoid deceits, since broader inclusion leads to more incentives for members to monitor one another. Inclusion is a hedge against the possibility that members share interests sufficiently that sectors of the public are cut out of decision making—a problem that affects Congress in part owing to its system of campaign financing.13 Both (a) and (b) are necessary for citizens infer a political official's interest in a reputation for veracity and thus to warrant second‐order trust. Finally, institutional regulations enabling what is often called “transparency” or simply openness provide incentives for officials to act as if their actions may some day be exposed to public scrutiny. These regulations include freedom of information legislation, sunshine laws, laws mandating that information be collected in usable ways, as well as the many disclosure rules that accompany official positions. Such rules and regulations enable institutional monitoring by civil society groups—the media, public interest groups, watchdog groups—as well as groups involved in electoral competition (Rose‐Ackerman 1999, 165–71). This kind of context enables appearance standards to function as anticipations of future justifications, in this way aligning representatives' strategic interests with their ethical duties (Hastings 1985, 26). When representatives know that information about their circumstances and connections is potentially available, they are more likely to anticipate the future public justifications of present decisions. When citizens know that representatives could be called to account in the future based on present decisions—and know that representatives know—they have more reason to extend second‐order trust in the present.         "
"68","In view of citizens' low trust in government over the last several decades, particularly in the United States but also in most of the developed democracies, the increasing focus on regulating appearances of corruption is entirely appropriate. The reasoning that would support appearance regulations, however, remains underdeveloped, depending as it has upon a “public trust” model of the role of government officials. The model is misplaced in the case of political representatives because it assumes convergent interests and values, conditions that are more likely to be found in arenas of consensus rather than those of conflict that define politics. The justification for appearance regulations is unambiguous, however, when developed from the perspective of democratic theory. Democratic systems of representation depend upon the integrity of appearances, not simply because they are an indication of whether officials are upholding their public trust, but because they provide the means through which citizens can judge whether, in any particular instance, their trust in public officials is warranted. The representative's role is, in part, to provide citizens with the information they need to judge when they should trust and when they should more actively participate in political decision making. The representative can fill this role only if he is worthy of a second‐order trust—trust in the veracity of his words and deeds. A representative who is not trustworthy in this sense also denies citizens their rightful participation in public judgments. Likewise, institutions that fail to support citizens' confidence in appearances produce political exclusions and generate a form of disempowerment. Together these failures amount to a corruption of democratic processes. Understanding this dimension of democracy, then, requires that we avoid viewing appearances as mere reflections of underlying realities, and appreciate that they are the grounds upon which democratic judgments are made, and thus part of the constitutive fabric of democracy. Appearance regulations underwrite this key dimension of democracy."
