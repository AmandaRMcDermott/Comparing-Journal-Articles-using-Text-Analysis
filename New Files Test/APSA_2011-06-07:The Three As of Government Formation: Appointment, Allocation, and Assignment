"1","Our model relates to a growing literature that uses principal agent theory to understand the multiple relations in parliamentary democracies (Martin and Vanberg 2004; Strøm, Muller, and Bergstrom 2003; Thies 2001). Our analysis of aggregation of dispersed information by cabinet members is circumscribed in the cheap talk literature (Crawford and Sobel 1982) that analyzes strategic communication by an agent to a principal who implements policy. Whilst this literature has been used to explore information transmission in Congress (Baron 2000; Gilligan and Krehbiel 1987; Patty 2009), to our knowledge our work is the first to apply this machinery to parliamentary democracies. In the classic model of committee organization in the U.S. House (Gilligan and Krehbiel 1987), the parent body chooses the procedural rules that, in turn, provide incentives for committee members to acquire information in a unidimensional policy space. In our model of Westminster government, a Prime Minister assigns a minister’s task by defining his jurisdiction and responsibilities. Ministers acquire information (costlessly) on policy issues over which they have jurisdiction, and so, and in contrast to the classic model, expertise is endogenously assigned by the Prime Minister.         "
"2","The fact that departmental jurisdictions overlap, as we show below, means that a multidimensional model is appropriate to our setting. Our framework and initial results (propositions 1 and 2) apply the multidimensional cheap talk model introduced by Battaglini (2002) and highlight the importance of these results toward understanding government organization. Whereas Battaglini shows that in a multidimensional cheap talk setting there is a fully revealing truth‐telling equilibrium where jurisdictions are orthogonal to the biases of senders, we show that in our world this is true of any truth‐telling equilibrium. Using this framework, our results can clearly be distinguished from those of the unidimensional model that has been used to analyze Congress: whereas in that model information transmission improves when the (median) preference of the committee and the parent body are not far apart, in our model diversity does not undermine the power of a Prime Minister and can sometimes benefit her. Jurisdictional assignments as equilibrium phenomena have been studied previously by Ting (2002), who analyzes optimal assignments in the presence of moral hazard when the legislature controls the agency budget and contractual rewards; he shows conditions under which a legislature would wish to consolidate bureaucratic tasks in a single agency. Indridason and Kam (2008) also look at moral hazard in a situation where the budget resources a minister can claim for a given portfolio may be transferred to a rival minister following a reshuffle. In contrast, our model is of asymmetric information due to expertise. A similarity arises between the work of Indridason and Kam and ours in that the Prime Minister can exploit differences between her ministers and align their incentives with her own.         "
"3","Finally, a critical question that we address is the optimal assignment when the Prime Minister is constrained to making only small adjustments to ministerial responsibilities. The political situation we analyze is a special case of the assignment problem studied in mathematics (Burkhard, Dell’Amico, and Martello 2009).         "
"4","Our key contribution is in exploring the ways that a Prime Minister uses the tools that are available to her in order to align the incentives of her ministers with her own. An implication of our analysis, that we explore more fully below, is that by carefully selecting ministers’ tasks a Prime Minister is better able to draw on their advice. An illustrative case is the first cabinet of Margaret Thatcher that included Tory “wets,” such as William Whitelaw, James Prior, Iain Gilmour, and Lord Carrington, who opposed her monetary policies. The inclusion of these ministers in Thatcher’s cabinet reflects their considerable experience, expertise, and standing within the party. But this is not the whole story. Whitelaw, for example, having stood against Thatcher in the 1975 Conservative Party leadership contest, served as Thatcher’s Home Secretary and then as Leader of the House of Lords and became her most loyal lieutenant. The successful relationship between them—Thatcher acknowledged Whitelaw’s role in her now famous accolade “every Prime Minister needs a Willie”—is often put down to Whitelaw’s character, pragmatism, and commitment to public service. A key factor in the relationship was, however, that Whitelaw was not consulted on matters over which he disagreed with the Premier and thus was at ease in providing advice on other issues. Young (1999) writes of Whitelaw’s actions: “He was operating on a different plane, making his own analysis, which told him that blind obedience punctuated by sage advice on matters outside the economic realm, was the only rational course of action” (1999, 235).         "
"5","The key general insight that we offer is that a Prime Minister can astutely manage her cabinet, and in particular the dimensionality of the policy space, in a way that policy‐relevant information can be effectively aggregated and in line with the Prime Minister’s objectives. In the case of Whitelaw, the Prime Minister was able to restrict the policy space on which she adhered to his advice so that she could benefit from his experience and expertise on issues where they were aligned. This element is important to understanding the nonconflictual working relationship between such erstwhile rivals to the Tory leadership."
"6","Our analysis goes further in exploring how a Prime Minister can manipulate the machinery of government in order to illicit information from her ministers. A recent report by the Institute of Government into the changing structure of Whitehall states that the ability of the Prime Minister to rearrange departments serves as “such an important tool that only one new Prime Minister since 1950 has chosen not to reconfigure departments in some way after assuming the leadership” (White and Dunleavy 2010, 1). Such reconfiguration typically takes one of two forms: new departments are created from a rearrangement of existing departmental responsibilities; or the department structure remains the same but ministerial responsibilities are reassigned across departments.         "
"7","An example of the first comes with the creation of the Department of Energy and Climate Change in October 2008 taking over energy functions from Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and taking over climate change functions from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. A further example concerns the recent overhaul of the Home Office, which included the setting up of a new Ministry of Justice and a new Office for Security and Counter‐Terrorism within the Home Office. A still recent example is the setting up of the Department for International Development in 1997 following a transfer of responsibilities from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.         "
"8","Major organizational changes are typically taken without a major change to the departmental structure and involve a simple transfer of policy responsibilities. The history of the Home Office is particularly interesting, with a plethora of policy functions being transferred and withdrawn from its jurisdiction over the course of its history. At different points in time it has been responsible for sport, broadcasting, and adoption and child care, which it received following a transfer of responsibilities from the Ministry of Health in 1947 with the same policy powers being transferred back to the Department of Health and Social Security in 1971 (the DHSS was itself a department that merged functions previously held by other departments). More recently, in 2007, criminal justice, prisons, probation, and legal affairs were transferred to the Ministry of Justice while counterterrorism strategy was brought under the Home Office’s remit. These are a few of more than 40 changes made in the twentieth century.1"
"9","Such changes, which amount to a major reorganization of the policy responsibilities and functions of British government, fall under the Royal Prerogative which is exercised by the Prime Minister.2 No primary legislation is required and changes are made in the absence of an objection from either House.3 Indeed, a recent report of the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee stated that “it is anomalous that it is so procedurally straightforward for the Prime Minister to reorganize the Civil Service by amending the functions of the ministers it serves, when reorganizing other public services may often involve statutory consultation, parliamentary approval, or even primary legislation.”4"
"10","An important and previously uninvestigated consequence of these organizational changes is that there is considerable overlap in the jurisdictions of different departments. To provide some examples from the current assignment of Whitehall departments: policies on health, whilst part of the domain of the Ministry for Health, are also dealt with in the Department of Education; policies on terrorism, counterterrorism, and security come under the purview of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office; international relations falls under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State for Defence and the Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs."
"11","The ability to strategically adapt the government machine has an important consequence: in so doing, a Prime Minister is able to manipulate a minister’s jurisdiction in ways not afforded to her when able only to allocate portfolios with preexisting and well‐defined policy boundaries. Government reorganization can be used to a Prime Minister’s advantage, in particular when she is constrained with regard to the personnel in her cabinet. A contemporary example involves Vincent Cable, the Business Secretary in the current British government, who until recently was responsible for media regulation. In this role, Cable was responsible for investigating the plans of News Corporation’s boss Rupert Murdoch to take over all of British Sky Broadcasting. Cable was, however, secretly recorded by undercover journalists stating that he had “declared war” on the media tycoon, with the Daily Telegraph publishing the story on December 21, 2010. This statement of his ideological position brought into question his impartiality and put him at odds with government policy. The consequence of his gaffe was not resignation, despite Opposition calls, for as a senior Liberal figure in the fledgling coalition he could not be replaced. Instead Prime Minister Cameron transferred aspects of media and telecoms policy from Cable’s department (along with 70 civil servants) to the Department of Culture Media and Sport headed by Jeremy Hunt, the Culture Secretary. In our terminology there was no change in terms of the Prime Minister’s appointments or allocations, but the assignment varied. The final implication was that the policy outcome—government approval of News Corporation’s plans on March 2, 2011—was different from the outcome that would likely have prevailed under the initial assignment.         "
"12","Our notion of assignment described earlier also accounts for the fact that the Prime Minister can limit the types of proposals that a minister can make. Ministers must make policy proposals, within the area of their jurisdiction, that accord with guidelines set down by the Prime Minister. A leading example is where the Prime Minister provides direction over spending priorities. A stark and currently very relevant case is where the Prime Minister wishes to ring‐fence or prioritize certain areas of spending over others. Such ringfencing protects budgets according to policy priorities identified by the Prime Minister. For example, in a recent announcement David Cameron committed to increase the Foreign Aid budget, administered by the Department for International Development, by 0.7% of gross national income by 2013 despite overall public spending cuts totaling 83 billion pounds. Other examples include the budget for the Department of Education, which is due to rise year on year, though capital spending has been slashed by 60%. These examples are indicative of the ways in which the Prime Minister can limit the type of proposals that a minister brings to cabinet and introduces to the floor of the House of Commons."
"13","We develop a formal model that explores a situation in which an executive leader organizes her cabinet. Her organizational strategy has three elements: she selects the personnel who will serve in her cabinet; she allocates their portfolios; and she assigns ministerial responsibilities in a way in which we make precise below. The strategic actors in our model are then a Prime Minister and her ministers who are motivated by policy. Outcomes are determined by strategic interaction between ministers who report to the Prime Minister on their assignment and the Prime Minister who organizes her cabinet and implements policy."
"14","We initially restrict to a government that consists of two ministerial posts, though we later extend our analysis to a larger cabinet. The preferences of ministers are defined over policy outcomes  and are single peaked and quadratic with bliss points at mi and i∈{1, 2} so that payoffs are defined as .5 We write the Prime Minister’s ideal point as pm* and, for notational simplicity, normalize so that it is located at the origin pm*= (0, 0). This implies that the ministers’ bias with respect to the Prime Minister is (mi−pm*) =mi.            "
"15","The Prime Minister must appoint ministers, allocate a portfolio to each, and then assign their responsibilities. The first element of assignment is the set of policies over which the minister reports to cabinet. This is what we term a minister's “jurisdiction.” For two policy dimensions it is possible that a Prime Minister would assign all issues related to dimension X to the portfolio of one minister, and the other Y to the other minister. As we have seen, however, there may be a degree of overlap in the jurisdictions of different departments. So we allow for the fact that a Prime Minister might give some influence over issues on X and Y to both ministers.            "
"16","The second element of a minister's assignment is the type of proposal that a minister can make within his jurisdiction. As we have seen, although ministers are responsible for their own departments, the Prime Minister sets important policy guidelines that constrain the type of proposals ministers can make. To illustrate, consider Figure 1, which depicts a two‐dimensional policy space involving policy X and policy Y. We indicate by m1 a minister’s policy bias relative to that of the Prime Minister (recall that the Prime Minister’s ideal policy lies at the origin and so in this example the minister’s bliss point is to the northeast of that point). If the minister had influence on both policies, then he would wish to implement a policy that is greater than pm* on both policy dimensions. Consider, for example, a situation where the minister could decide how much money should be allocated to policies X and Y. The minister would like to spend more on both relative to the Prime Minister. If, however, the minister were forced to choose a level of spending along the line given by A1, then her preferred allocation on that line is the same as that of the Prime Minister: her indifference curve is tangent to A1 at the origin.6"
"17","                 Defining a Minister’s Assignment                         "
"18","An implication of this example, which we explore more fully, is that by carefully defining ministerial responsibilities a Prime Minister may be able to align the incentives of her ministers with her own. A critical aspect is that jurisdictional overlap creates a multidimensional problem that provides the Prime Minister greater strategic leeway. To return to our spending example, if the Prime Minister were only able to define her minister’s responsibilities along a single dimension, then she could constrain his proposals in a very stark fashion: by, for example, setting a maximum (or minimum) level of spending. In multiple dimensions, however, the Prime Minister can define the ministerial brief in a way that provides her with strategic advantage.7"
"19","To complete our formal setting, we now describe more fully the relationship between the Prime Minister and her team of ministers, the timing of our game, what ministers know, and how they know it."
"20","Information.  The source of a minister’s influence in our model is an informational asymmetry. We assume that there are underlying social, economic, and political fundamentals that are (initially) not directly observed by either the Prime Minister or her ministers. We capture these fundamentals via the vector . Once a minister has been allocated a department and its jurisdiction is assigned, however, he acquires all information relevant to policymaking in that jurisdiction. An implication of our assumption is that in assigning responsibilities, the Prime Minister decides which of her minister will become informed and on which set of issues. Having defined a minister’s jurisdiction, the Prime Minister completes the assignment by specifying the minister’s task: the minister, upon receiving the policy‐relevant information in his jurisdiction, must report a single dimensional variable to the Prime Minister, . An assignment, however, restricts ministers to reporting on one of two directions  that span the whole policy space (i.e., .               "
"21","Timing.  In the first stage of our model, the Prime Minister appoints her ministers, allocates their portfolios, and assigns their responsibilities. In the second stage, ministers bring a proposal to the Prime Minister that conforms with the responsibilities assigned to them. Finally, upon receiving the minister’s proposal the Prime Minister implements policy, which we denote as . Her chosen policy may depend on the declarations made by ministers so that y((s1(θ), s2(θ))). The policy outcomes x depend on both the chosen policy y and the underlying fundamentals θ. Specifically, the final outcome satisfies x=y+θ. The policy that the Prime Minister chooses depends upon her beliefs about these fundamentals given the declarations of her ministers. We write the posterior belief of the Prime Minister on the possible states of the world as .               "
"22","Our solution concept is perfect Bayesian equilibrium. Loosely speaking, this requires that the actions of the Prime Minister and her ministers be sequentially rational given their beliefs; and that their beliefs be consistent with rational play and Bayes' rule along the equilibrium path, and with some beliefs off the equilibrium path. We focus attention on the existence of a truthful and fully revealing equilibrium: ministers adopt a truthful strategy, that is, they report the true state of the world within their ministerial responsibility and, in combining her ministers’ joint declarations, the Prime Minister learns all there is to know about the true state of the world. In game theoretic terms, a fully revealing equilibrium is defined by posterior beliefs cumulated on the true state of the world, μ(s1(θ), s2(θ))(θ) = 1. Of course, an equilibrium may not be truthful and yet still be fully revealing. This occurs, for example, if the ministers systematically misreport: it may be common knowledge that a minister exaggerates by adding a bias to his report and that the Prime Minister takes this into account by discounting such reports. Applying reasoning akin to the revelation principle, it can be shown that there is no loss of generality in restricting attention to fully revealing equilibria that are at once truthful and involve degenerate out of equilibrium beliefs.8 The intuition behind this result is that cabinet members only care about final outcomes: when a fully revealing equilibrium exists they may as well report truthfully (they need never construct complicated out‐of‐equilibrium beliefs, as the preferred policy of the Prime Minister is an equilibrium outcome in either case).            "
"23","In this section, we establish our core results in a simple two‐member cabinet. We develop our results by looking at two distinct and extreme cases. In the first, assignments are given by the policy axis and the only instrument the Prime Minister can use in order to implement her policy agenda is to choose which individuals sit in her cabinet and to allocate a portfolio to each. In the second case, we assume the Prime Minister has no discretion over who to appoint but is able to allocate portfolios and assign ministerial responsibilities."
"24","We begin our analysis by focusing on the simplest scenario in which departmental jurisdictions are fixed, but the Prime Minister has complete discretion to appoint her ministers. To make things interesting we make a slight restriction on the type of ministers that are available, assuming that there will always be some ideological conflict. That is, a Prime Minister is unable to appoint ministers who share her ideal point."
"25","As a toy example that helps illustrate some of the main ideas and introduces our basic notation, consider a situation where the ideal points satisfy pm*= (0, 0), m1= (0, 1) and m2= (1, 0), respectively (the first coordinate represents the ideal point on policy X, and the second coordinate the ideal point on policy Y). In this situation the Prime Minister has perfectly aligned preferences with m1 on policy X, (both the Prime Minister and her minister would like the policy outcome to be as close as possible to the origin), whereas, analogously, on policy Y, the Prime Minister and m2 are perfectly aligned.            "
"26","Under these circumstances, and given any underlying value of θ, the Prime Minister can strategically appoint her ministers so that they reveal their information truthfully. Consider a situation where m1 is appointed to the department that has full jurisdiction over policy X, so that his assignment is A1= (1, 0), or any proportional vector to this one, and agent 2 has full jurisdiction on the second policy dimension so that he reports on A2= (0, 1). Now imagine that m2 truthfully reveals her information to the Prime Minister (so that s2(θ) =θ2). Armed with this information, the Prime Minister will implement a policy (y2=−θ2) such that x2= 0. In order to compute minister 1’s best response to truthful revelation by minister 2 we can draw the indifference curve tangent to his assignment: the point of tangency coincides with the ideal point of the Prime Minister. Thus, minister 1 delivers a report that yields a policy outcome x1= 0. In a truthful equilibrium, the minister reports s1(θ) =θ1 and the Prime Minister implements y1=−s1(θ). In this example, the Prime Minster elicits all the information relevant to full implementation of her agenda: si(θ) =θi for mi is a best response for minister i when the other minister reveals her information truthfully. It remains to be shown that this is in fact part of a (perfect Bayesian) equilibrium.            "
"27","Proposition 1  When ministerial responsibilities coincide with policy dimensions and each minister’s assignment is orthogonal to his bias, then there is an equilibrium where each minister reports truthfully the state of the world given his assignment. The Prime Minister believes these statements, and the policy that is implemented yields an outcome coinciding with the Prime Minister's ideal point.                "
"28","This first result shows that, without specifying the agents’ messages or the response of the Prime Minister to these messages, there is an equilibrium in which the preferred policy of the Prime Minister is implemented.9 One such equilibrium is both truthful and fully revealing.10"
"29","The results of the previous section reveal conditions under which cabinet selection acts as an instrument allowing the Prime Minister to implement her agenda. Of course, there are limitations to the use of this tool. A Prime Minister may be forced to select on some individual trait other than the political preferences of her appointee—for example, talent, experience, or following in the party—and may find that those best able to serve under her do not share her political opinions.11 This might suggest then that the Prime Minister’s position is weakened. Indeed, the view that a Prime Minister’s power is both limited and contextual due to restrictions on her ability to appoint is commonly held.            "
"30","This viewpoint overlooks the fact that the Prime Minister has other instruments at her disposal, and that their use may also influence the policies that are implemented. In particular, she can decide which policies form part of a minister’s jurisdiction and the type of proposals a minister can make. In the previous section we looked at a situation where assignments are aligned with the policy axis and so a single department has jurisdiction in a given policy area. Although analytically convenient, as we have seen, usually there is some overlap in the jurisdictions of different departments. Figure 1 depicts a situation where the minister’s policy bias relative to that of the Prime Minister is given by m1 and the assignment A1 involves both policy X and policy Y. Recall that the Prime Minister’s ideal policy lies at the origin and so in this example the minister’s bliss point is to the northeast of that point. Ideally, from his perspective, the minister would recommend a policy that is greater than pm* on both policy dimensions. Suppose, however, that the minister’s assignment is given by A1: then he must acknowledge a trade‐off in which he can increase X only by decreasing Y. A natural way to think of this trade‐off regards policies over distribution, where X and Y involve spending on particular policies and/or targeted distribution to specific constituencies. For example, a report on A1 to the northwest of the origin ties an increase in spending on policy Y to a decrease in spending on policy X, relative to the Prime Minster’s ideal point; the opposite spending pattern is implied by a report to the southeast of the origin. Thus, although relative to the Prime Minister, the minister would like to spend more on both policies (constituencies), he is forced into a trade‐off between the two. The Prime Minister has the power to determine this trade‐off by defining his minister’s brief. In our model this is achieved by determining the slope of A1. She will do so optimally given her knowledge of the minister’s bias. We are now ready to show that in any fully revealing equilibrium (in which the Prime Minister implements her preferred policy), each minister’s assignment needs to be orthogonal to his own bias.            "
"31","Lemma 1  Fix the ideal points of ministers and allow the Prime Minister to choose their assignment. In a fully revealing equilibrium, a minister's assignment is orthogonal to his bias and not affected by the ideal point of the remaining cabinet ministers. Multiplying a minister’s bias by a constant does not change his assignment.                "
"32","The implication of this result is that, when the Prime Minister is constrained to appoint a minister with a given and known bias, then she can always define a minister’s responsibilities in such a way that he reports truthfully. This result is not affected by the size of the minister’s bias relative to the Prime Minister’s ideal point, nor the distribution of ideal points in the cabinet. The following proposition shows that a set of orthogonal assignments forms part of a fully revealing perfect Bayesian equilibrium."
"33","Proposition 2  Assume that the biases of the ministers with respect to the the ideal point of the Prime Minister are linearly independent. Allow the Prime Minister to choose ministerial assignments. She then elicits full information from her ministers and so can fully implement her policy agenda.                "
"34","A technicality in the wording of the proposition deserves further attention: the biases of the ministers with respect to the ideal point of the Prime Minister need to be linearly independent. By Lemma 1 we know that in a fully revealing equilibrium each assignment needs to be orthogonal to its minister’s bias. If biases are linearly dependent, assignments would coincide and the Prime Minister would no longer be able to infer the true state of the world in our two‐dimensional policy space. Instead, linear independence ensures that both assignments span the whole policy space and the Prime Minister is then able to illicit all information she needs to implement her preferred policy.               "
"35","According to one prominent and widely held view, the Prime Minister’s control over policy is limited by the need to include ministers who (1) do not share her policy preferences and (2) are either too senior, talented, or well supported in the party to be overlooked.12 Our analysis suggests that these are necessary though not sufficient conditions. According to our view, the Prime Minister is constrained, that is, she is unable to fully implement her agenda, only when each of the following conditions hold with respect to a particular minister: the Prime Minister is forced to appoint the minister even though the minister's preferences are not aligned with her own; the minister has veto power over his appointment to a particular ministry; the minister has veto power over any changes to his assignment; in such circumstances, the minister’s report cannot yield implementation of the Prime Minister’s preferred policy. In all other situations, even when the Prime Minister is constrained to appoint ministers whose preferred policies are very far from her own, she nevertheless is able to implement her desired policies. Moreover, and perhaps surprisingly, this does not depend on the assumption that the Prime Minister implements policy as we show in the following corollary to Proposition 2.               "
"36","Corollary to Proposition 2  When the configuration of tasks is optimally designed from the Prime Minister’s perspective, she is strictly indifferent between choosing policy herself or fully delegating the task to her minister.               "
"37","The implication of this result is stark. As long as the Prime Minister has full control over assignment, her influence is undiminished even when she allows policy to be chosen and implemented by her ministers. Thus, what Lupia (2003) has referred to as the “perils of delegation” in parliamentary democracies are avoided so long as the Prime Minister has full control over the allocation of ministerial tasks. When policy decisions are delegated to ministers, they implement precisely those policies the Prime Minister would implement in the event that she had full and perfect information.               "
"38","As we noted earlier, our model is related to the classic application of the cheap talk literature to Congress (Gilligan and Krehbiel 1987). There it is well known that the legislative body can extract more information when committee members have biases that are small relative to the Floor median. Do the insights from the congressional literature on information transmission carry over in our multidimensional setting more suited to Westminster? Here we observe that our results do not hinge on the distance of ministers' ideal points from the preferred outcomes of the Prime Minister. Given any bias, however big, the Prime Minister can design a ministerial brief such that the minister will report truthfully, and given the optimal assignments to all cabinet members, the Prime Minister extracts all relevant information. In fact the Prime Minister is never worse off when the cabinet is more diverse.               "
"39","In the remainder of the article, we consider how robust our findings are to different assumptions about the institutional environment. Thus far our analysis has relied on a two‐member cabinet. It is natural to consider the implications of analyzing a fully fledged cabinet consisting of an arbitrary number of ministers deciding over multiple policy issues, and so we extend our model to consider a multimember cabinet with n > 2 distinct policy issues related to the same number of government departments.         "
"40","Proposition 3  Consider a situation where the number of policy issues decided by the government is n > 2 so that the cabinet consists of n ministers with fixed ideal points. Allowing the Prime Minister to choose the assignment of each of her ministers, and assuming that the biases of at least two ministers with respect to the ideal point of the Prime Minister are linearly independent, the Prime Minister elicits full information from her agents and so can fully implement her policy agenda."
"41","Perhaps surprisingly, when moving to the general case we can use less restrictive assumptions about the ideal points of the ministers. In particular, for n > 2, we only need two ministers’ ideal points to be linearly independent (i.e., the orthogonal hyperplanes to their biases span the whole policy space). This can be shown with a three‐minister example as illustrated in Figure 2. Here note that the ideal points of m1 and m2 are linearly dependent: both ministers agree with the Prime Minister on two of the three policy dimensions. Following our earlier logic, it is straightforward to see that the Prime Minister can elicit all of the relevant information when assigning jurisdiction over policy X to m3, jurisdiction over policy Y to m1, and jurisdiction over policy Z to m2; each minister needs to report on the assignment formed by the policy axis. This is not the only way in which the Prime Minister can organize her government and be in a position to implement her agenda: she could, for instance, obtain the same outcome by switching the jurisdictions of m1 and m2. In fact she could give overlapping jurisdiction on policies Y and Z as long as these were linearly independent. We note that in such a situation both ministers acquire information on policies Y and Z but not on X, whereas m3 only acquires information on policy X. This shows that in dimensions n > 2, a minister’s expertise can be limited to policies over which he has jurisdiction. Thus, the Prime Minister, as part of the assignment process, endogenously determines the expertise of her ministers.            "
"42","                 Portfolio Allocation When n= 3                         "
"43","A key innovation in our analysis is that we consider the assignment of ministerial departments as being part of a Prime Minister’s strategic plan. As we have seen, when the Prime Minister can create departments with overlapping jurisdictions and optimally assign tasks, then she can obtain her desired outcomes even when constrained with regard to the appointments she makes to cabinet. Most models of government formation do not consider this aspect. In the portfolio allocation models, for example, each minister’s jurisdiction involves a single policy dimension. An interesting theoretical question then is the extent that the optimal assignment (from the Prime Minister’s perspective) deviates from a status quo where ministers’ assignments are given by the policy axis as in Figure 1. Our focus is in the angular move α, defined as the necessary adjustment making a minister’s assignment orthogonal to his bias, when starting from this status quo. Our interest in this parameter can be motivated from the following thought experiment. Imagine that ministers enter government with the expectation that they will be given full control over a well‐defined portfolio with jurisdiction over a given policy area (i.e., the policy axis X in Figure 1). How much must the Prime Minister adjust this portfolio to correct for the bias of her minister and in order to align his incentives with her own? We know that, in any fully revealing equilibrium, the Prime Minister will adjust until Ai is orthogonal to mi (as illustrated in Figure 1 for i= 1 and A= 1). Thus, for example, when mi= (1, 1), the move is 45°.         "
"44","To explore our question, we ask how does α respond to the size of government.13 The political implications of increasing the size of the government are the following: on the one hand, an increase in the size of government implies an increase in the number of possible assignments, and this is associated with an increase in the complexity of the Prime Minister’s assignment problem; on the other, an increase in the size of government increases the possibility that for a given set of ministers, and on any particular assignment, the Prime Minister can find a minister with an ideal point that is orthogonal to the status quo assignments, in which case he need make no adjustments to that portfolio. We look at the extreme case where the Prime Minister has no appointment power; thus, we treat each minister’s ideal point as a random draw from a known distribution. We assume that the size of the adjustment (the angle α) that produces an assignment orthogonal to a minister’s bias is independently drawn from a distribution F with density f. We define AAn as the average size of adjustment when assigning n ministers. We analyze how this average adjustment responds to increasing the size of government (i.e., as n grows large).         "
"45","Proposition 4  When there is a strictly positive probability that the adjustments required to existing portfolios are arbitrarily small (i.e., F(α) > 0 for allα > 0), the average adjustment of the optimal assignment tends to zero as the number of policy dimensions increases (limn→∞AAn= 0).            "
"46","In the limit, as the size of the government grows large, the necessary adjustments required to the status quo provisions in order for the Prime Minister to implement her agenda go to zero. Pushing further, we analyze the same parameter in commonly sized cabinets (i.e., n just below 30). An immediate concern is how fast the average adjustment AAn converges to zero and whether, in commonly sized cabinets, these are also negligible. We analyze this question numerically by assuming that there are n ministers whose bias with respect to the Prime Minister on each policy dimension is drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance. As for our our earlier results, status quo jurisdictions are the coordinate axis. We compute the minimum angular move so that each assignment is orthogonal to the bias of each minister. For each of the 500 simulations we run, we find the optimal assignment that minimizes the size of the required adjustment. We compute the average adjustment among all our simulations. Full details of our algorithm can be found in the appendix; here we concentrate instead on our substantive results represented by Figure 3.            "

"48","The upper (red) line in Figure 3 shows the rate of convergence when the Prime Minister has no freedom to appoint who sits in her cabinet, but can make assignments in such a way that ministers will report truthfully. We see that, as the number of jurisdictions increases, the average adjustments to the status quo fall rapidly toward zero.14 When n= 2 the (average) necessary angular move away from the status quo jurisdictions is α= 29.832°. This falls to α= 0.722° as the government size increases to n= 29.15 The lower (gray) line in Figure 3 shows a situation where the Prime Minister has some discretion over appointments and has twice as many ministerial options as jurisdictions. As might be expected, convergence is much faster as under these circumstances the Prime Minister can place in her cabinet those ministers with the smallest biases. These graphs provide an indication as to how the instruments at the Prime Minister’s disposal, namely her ability to appoint ministers, allocate portfolios, and assign tasks, interact to allow her to implement her agenda. Moreover, they show that for these particular parameters, the adjustments required to the status quo assignments (i.e., those that coincide with the policy axis) in a reasonably sized government are negligible.            "
"49","Our results are based upon a somewhat stylized and reduced form view of the Westminster Model. Here we consider how robust are our findings to the addition of some institutional detail. First, we consider what would happen if the Prime Minister were to be held accountable via an electoral mechanism, that is, she could be replaced by some section of the polity. Next, we consider alternative views of the cabinet: in one, ministers deliberate over outcomes; in another they are able to collude before providing their reports to the Prime Minister. Finally, we consider a world where ministers are distinguished by their expertise as well as by their policy preferences."
"50","Thus far we have not considered any mechanism by which the Prime Minister can be held to account for the organization of her government and the decisions that are reached given her organizational strategy. In some sense we might view the Prime Minister as the agent of her party who is endowed with the powers to appoint ministers, allocate them to portfolios, and assign tasks. The question then arises: which agent would the party choose? Our key results reveal that when the Prime Minister has control over assignments, even though she may be constrained with regard to appointments, she can implement policies as if she were fully informed on the relevant issues. An implication of these findings is that it is straightforward to extend our analysis to a world in which the Prime Minister was selected by the party or some subset of its membership. For example, we could extend our analysis to a world where there was an open entry contest to become the Prime Minister, in which eligible citizens (however defined) cast their votes between competing candidates. A straightforward application of the citizen‐candidate framework (Besley and Coate 1997) yields the following: when voters anticipate the final implemented policies, there is an equilibrium in which at least one candidate stands for the office of Prime Minister; the equilibrium is Pareto efficient; if there exists an individual amongst the polity whose ideal point is a Condorcet winner then that citizen is elected unopposed. Thus, there is a normative justification for providing a Prime Minister with the tools to implement her agenda.            "
"51","One objection to our analysis, with its focus on allocation and assignment, is that a Prime Minister might not need such powerful instruments at her disposal in order to implement her agenda. Instead she could use cabinet deliberations as a mechanism for learning the true state of the world before making policy decisions. One way she could do this is to have ministers report everything they know rather than limiting the type of proposals that they can make. Then any discrepancy between their reports would immediately reveal that at least one minister did not report truthfully. In such a world, Ambrus and Takahashi (2008) show that there is a fully revealing equilibrium in which off the equilibrium path actions are appropriately punished. Applied to our world, the intuition is straightforward: when the Prime Minister can commit to implementing a policy commonly disliked by her ministers in the event their statements do not match, then ministers’ willingness to conceal information is avoided. This logic yields an outcome—full implementation of the Prime Minister’s agenda—that is observationally equivalent to ours.            "
"52","We provide some reasons for why the mechanism that we highlight offers a more compelling account. The main reason is that a model that focused on cabinet deliberations, unlike ours, cannot account for observed changes to ministerial assignments that are due to government reorganization. A further argument relies on the theoretical robustness of the equilibrium of our model. Suppose that, instead of perfectly observing θi, a minister’s observation of the state is noisy. As long as such noise is of a particular type—independent and symmetrically distributed across the various policy dimensions—equilibria of the sort we have constructed in Proposition 2 remain.16 This is not the case, however, for the truth‐telling equilibrium that can emerge due to cabinet deliberation. To see why, note that when reports contain error, the Prime Minister is unable to draw comparisons between them and so is unable to punish deviations accordingly.            "
"53","A final theoretical concern is collusion‐proofness. Asking ministers to report on the whole dimensionality introduces scope for collusion between ministers. They may jointly agree to report in a way that yields a final outcome closer to their bliss point. To see this, recall that the equilibrium constructed in Proposition 2 allows each minister to determine the coordinate on his own jurisdiction. The situation described there may, however, induce ministers to collude and thereby arrive at mutually beneficial outcomes. Figure 4 depicts a situation where they do so. It depicts a policy outcome xc that lies in the Pareto set of m1 and m2. Given the declaration of minister 1, minister 2 can send any message such that the final policy outcome is anywhere along Jc (orthogonal to minister 2’s bias through policy xc). Note that minister 2 has a profitable deviation: he can choose a report such that the final policy is . Thus, collusive agreements will prove unstable in the absence of an enforcement mechanism. We state this formally in a note to the proof of Proposition 2 in the appendix. Whilst the equilibrium constructed here is collusion‐proof in the sense that, although Pareto improvements from the ministers’ perspective are always possible, they do not form part of an equilibrium in the absence of a commitment mechanism. It remains an open question whether ministers are able to forge an agreement (an enforceable side‐contract à la Laffont and Martimort 1997) that avoids unilateral deviations.            "
"54","                 Collusive Agreements Do Not Constitute an Equilibrium                         "
"55","A Prime Minister may consider motivesother than the desire to counter ministers' biases when organizing her government. In particular, she may wish to account for a minister’s expertise when allocating his portfolio. Until now we have considered only a world where all ministers are experts (they are perfectly informed) on the issues over which they have jurisdiction. Here we consider a world where this is no longer so for all ministers: some ministers are better informed on some issues than are others. The question we ask is whether the Prime Minister can organize her cabinet so that (in equilibrium) she obtains truthful reports from her ministers."
"56","When potential cabinet members have a known bias on a policy where their expertise lies, the Prime Minister needs to tradeoff receiving a biased report from an expert, or a noisy report (on an assignment orthogonal to the sender’s bias) from a relatively less well‐informed minister.17 In this circumstance, the Prime Minister will generally be unable to aggregate information efficiently. To illustrate this point we develop a numerical example where the Prime Minister delegates the implementation of policy to two ministers on Ai.18"
"57","We consider a situation with a two‐dimensional policy space where two ministers have biases, (m1, 0) and (0, m2). The true state of the world is unknown, but its prior distribution is common knowledge, θi∼N(0, σ2) for i= 1, 2 and θ1 and θ2 are independent. Minister 1 perfectly observes the true state of the world in the first dimension but privately observes a noisy signal on the second dimension: s1∼N(θ2, τ2). By contrast, minister 2 can perfectly observe the second dimension but privately observes a noisy signal in the first one: s2∼N(θ1, τ2) (both signals are independent).Upon receiving the relevant information, ministers implement a policy constrained by their ministerial brief: (A1, 1) for minister 1 and (1, A2) for minister 2. In other words, minister i needs to decide a real value ri and the overall implemented policy is equal to r1· (A1, 1) +r2· (1, A2).            "
"58","In the appendix we provide step‐by‐step calculations providing equilibrium declarations of ministers given any pair of assignments. We then look at the optimal assignment by the Prime Minister when taking into account the ministers’ best responses. In order to illustrate our point, we give particular values to the biases and the variance of the signals (we consider the case where biases and variances of posterior beliefs on the true state of the world are all equal to one, m1=m2= 1 and  for i≠j). We find that the (unique) optimal assignment is not orthogonal to the ministers’ biases. This result shows that the Prime Minister will prefer extracting better information by utilizing a minister’s expertise even when this implies that the assignments are not orthogonal to the ministers’ biases. This, of course, implies that ministers will no longer report truthfully (the ministers’ indifference curves are no longer tangent to their jurisdictions at the origin—the preferred policy of the Prime Minister) and so the final policy implemented will not be the Prime Minister’s ideal one. Analyzing the way in which the Prime Minister modifies assignments according to the relative expertise of her ministers and their biases constitutes ongoing work.            "
"59","Before concluding, we provide a brief overview of our results and discuss their empirical relevance. We have studied an abstract model of government formation that highlights the importance of jurisdictional assignments as part of a Prime Minister’s organizational strategy. An immediate empirical payoff of our model is that we can use the fully revealing equilibrium described in Proposition 2 to derive a number of comparative static results that show how jurisdictions change according to differences in the composition of the cabinet (according to members' ideal points). It is straightforward to show that, when the Prime Minister is constrained to changing assignments, then any exogenous shift in a minister’s bias will lead to a change in his (orthogonal) assignment. It is difficult to construct an empirical test of these claims. In particular, although some steps have been taken to put together data that detail how jurisdictions have altered in the British case, we as yet have no independent measures of ministerial ideal points. Since ministers are bound by the convention of collective responsibility, and in any event partisan votes are enforced by government whips, we cannot obtain measures of variance in ministers' ideal points that would allow us to test our ideas.19 We note, of course, that any model (or claim or conjecture) about how assignments varied with the ideal points of ministers would face the same common problem: we cannot always obtain exogenous variation on the variables of interest; and, as pointed out by Krehbiel (1993), this is in particular the case where the variable of interest concerns the preferences of political actors.         "
"60","Of course, it would be desirable to directly test some of the implications of our model. It is possible to generate (uncontaminated) data from a suitable experimental setting. Here we discuss ongoing work that provides the first test of our theory. In that work we analyze whether a subject acting as Prime Minister can offset the bias of a subject acting as minister by allowing the latter to choose (implement a policy) on a particular set of outcomes. We simplify our model and focus on the relationship between the Prime Minister and a single minister (by assuming a nonstrategic second minister). We allow the subject acting as Prime Minister to choose among a menu of ministerial briefs (each corresponding to a different trade‐off). Knowing the true state of the world, the subject acting as a minister then chooses a final allocation from the menu assigned to him. This simple experimental design allows us to analyze whether assignments are made optimally and the “minister” responds truthfully. More elaborate experiments should introduce the strategic interaction that arises between two ministers and on aspects such as collusion or expertise."
"61","Given the problems of measurement and identification that arise when exploring the phenomenon at hand, our formal model provides useful and nonobvious insights into the consequences of the organizational powers of the Prime Minister, which we elaborate upon here. The first key insight—one that we believe has been overlooked by analysts who have focussed entirely on the composition of cabinets and turnover of ministerial positions—is that the allocation of tasks is a powerful tool for the chief of the executive to have at her disposal. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that the Prime Minister’s ability to implement her desired policies is not necessarily diminished when she is unable to fully determine who sits in her cabinet; when she is able to assign ministerial jurisdictions and responsibilities then she can still implement her agenda. Would the Prime Minister nevertheless prefer a cabinet in which the views of her colleagues are aligned with her own? Our model shows that, whilst this view may be correct in a unidimensional world, where the ministers acted as either veto players or agents of the Prime Minister, such an inference is incorrect in a multidimensional setting in which ministers are the providers of information."
"62","A further empirical insight stems from our analysis of relations between the Prime Minister and her ministers. One of our key results is that when the Prime Minister designs her government optimally, then she is strictly indifferent between implementing policy herself or having her minister do so. The conventional view of British politics is that ministers are not autonomous: Prime Ministers regularly intervene in the running of departments and there is no constitutional enshrined protection for ministerial autonomy as provided under German Basic Law, for example. Our analysis allows us to explore a relevant counterfactual: what would happen if ministers were free to implement their desired policy, as the principal of ministerial autonomy implies, though are constrained to act only on those policies over which they are granted jurisdiction and according to the responsibilities defined by the Prime Minister? We show then that the same policy outcomes prevail irrespective of whether the Prime Minister or her minister implements policy."
"63","Although the analysis of strategic information transmission has been central to the formal literature on congressional committees and their relationship to the U.S. House of Representatives, these models have not, until now, been applied in a parliamentary setting. We analyze how ministerial appointments, responsibilities, and the structure of government departments can be adapted strategically by a Prime Minister who aggregates information provided by (biased) ministers who are experts in their brief. In assigning a minister’s responsibilities optimally, the Prime Minister is able to extract all of the relevant information so that she can implement her preferred policies. In fact, once she has organized her government optimally, the Prime Minister is indifferent between implementing policy herself or delegating this task to her ministers. Perhaps surprisingly, this result does not depend on the extent of ministers’ biases relative to the Prime Minister. We also provide an example where ministers have exogenously given expertise that is correlated with their biases and show that then the Prime Minister is unable to implement her desired policies."
"64","We end by suggesting other avenues for future research on this topic. Although our model captures some of the critical features of Westminster democracy, we use simplifying assumptions. In our basic model, civil servants are both perfectly informed and perfect agents of ministers, and so we abstract from the agency problem between a minister and his staff and the incentives required for a bureaucrat to obtain information (Bawn 1995). However, our model does extend to the basic agency problem between a minister and her civil servants. Indeed, the permanency of officials in most parliamentary systems means that the assignment of tasks is likely to be used by a ministerial principle to extract information from her agents. Whilst our model provides useful insights to Westminster democracy, it abstracts from issues of party competition and coalition formation and the basic framework developed here could be extended to include variations on this institutional architecture. Nevertheless, as our earlier example of telecoms regulation in the United Kingdom (page 4) makes clear, our insights carry over to coalition scenarios: in that case, the Prime Minister was unable to fire the minister responsible, or allocate him a different portfolio, due to the constraints of the coalition agreement; but he obtained a more desirable outcome by reassigning ministerial tasks.
