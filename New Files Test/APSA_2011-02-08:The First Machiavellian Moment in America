"1","In order to appreciate the enduring significance of puritan Machiavellism in seventeenth‐century New England, we must first understand what makes their story fascinating and surprising in historical terms. There were two particular approaches to interpreting Machiavelli's politics which colored debates among the zealously reformist English Protestants who have come to be known as “puritans.” I will now review the key passages from Machiavelli's texts which dominated his readers’ attention in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and which underlay the alternative approaches, yielding the “tyrannical” and “republican” versions of Machiavelli. I will then consider the emergence of a populist or democratic strand of the latter version in the country from which the first New Englanders migrated.1"
"2","To this day, Machiavelli is renowned for the subversive account of conventional ethical precepts in The Prince (1532) which outraged many of his earliest readers in the sixteenth century. Especially pungent are Chapters 15, 17, and 18, where Machiavelli argued that statesmen must be skilled at doing evil as well as good deeds (Gilbert 1965, 57–58), that human nature is so vicious that a prince is better off being feared than loved (62, 66), and that wicked means are permissible in pursuit of worthy ends (67). Yet literate Europeans took easily to the means‐ends argument, at least: modern scholarship has identified numerous works written from a devoutly Christian point of view which fully accepted Machiavelli's basic point that rulers are sometimes obliged to commit strategic injustices (Donaldson 1988, esp. 111–21; Mosse 1968, esp. chap. 9; Sommerville 1988). The real problem was that, when read in tandem with a handful of passages on religion in his Discourses on Livy (1529), Machiavelli's statecraft seemed to set out profane rather than holy ends in justification of evil means. He was more interested in judging religious creeds and conventional virtues by their usefulness for civic life than by their intrinsic truth. In Chapters 11 and 12 of Book 1 of the Discourses, he argued that teaching false religious beliefs (e.g., in miracles) was an indispensable policy for statesmen (Gilbert 1965, 224–27), while in Chapter 6 of The Prince he argued that the success of a prophet (e.g., Moses) depends on the strength of his army rather than the truth of his prophecy (26–27).         "
"3","At the same time, a plausible case could be made that Machiavelli's apparent attack on Christianity was more narrowly directed at the institutions and leaders of the Catholic church. In the same chapter that suggested that miracles were falsehoods used to maintain social order and unity, he went on to accuse the papal hierarchy of hypocrisy, immorality, and divisive influence within Italy (Gilbert 1965, 228). Perhaps as a result, Protestants often admired Machiavelli as “an authoritative anti‐papal historian” (Anglo 2005, 173; see also 26–27, 97–99), and by and large they didn't pursue literary campaigns against him until after 1572. In that year the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in France changed the context in which they thought about Machiavelli, while his texts changed not at all. The massacre of French Protestants was rumored to have been ordered by Queen Catherine of France, a descendent of the Medicis, who were the leading family of Machiavelli's native Florence. This was the atmosphere in which Innocent Gentillet composed his influential polemic Contre Machiavel (1576) (Gentillet 1974), and in which Protestants around Europe adopted the term “Machiavellian” as a descriptor of political immorality: committing injustice under the sacred seal of authority, fomenting public disaster for private benefit. Through subsequent decades of sectarian strife, accounts of Catholic atrocities accompanied by attributions of Machiavellian influence poured out of Protestant presses (Anglo 2005, chap. 11; Donaldson 1988, chaps. 1–4; Raab 1964, chap. 2). Citing the very passages from Machiavelli's works reviewed above, Gentillet stamped an enduring image of Machiavelli as an advisor to tyrants like Catherine on the minds of his readers, including many English puritans.         "
"4","But the evidence of Machiavelli's intense hostility toward the Catholic church remained, as did a tradition of interpreting his politics as friendly to republican liberty and popular government rather than to tyranny. These two notions help to explain why some English puritans in the seventeenth century made two rather surprising intellectual leaps: they sought a rapprochement with Machiavelli, and they did so precisely for his populist politics."
"5","Notwithstanding those passages that illustrated Machiavelli's ostensible agenda of enabling rulers to lie, cheat, and steal in the service of their own interests and against the public's, a wide range of textual evidence could be cited in support of a republican interpretation. Most obvious in this respect are the early chapters of Book 1 of the Discourses, where Machiavelli praised the ancient Roman model of a republic that offers liberty, opportunity, and political power to ordinary citizens and thereby builds a platform for imperial expansion and glory. Chapter 3 explained that the Roman tribunes were created as a check on the power of a nobility that habitually oppressed the plebeian class (Gilbert 1965, 201–2), Chapter 4 argued that this sort of institutionalized class conflict was good for the city as a whole (202–4), and Chapters 5 and 6 concluded that the masses are better “guardians of liberty” than the elites, after reviewing arguments on both sides of the question (204–11). Chapter 7 furthered the theme of institutionalized conflict by arguing that regular procedures of accusation and punishment must be afforded to popular bodies for use against overly ambitious citizens (211–13). And later, in Chapter 58, Machiavelli offered a more elaborate defense of popular judgment: the people are as “stable, prudent, and grateful” as any prince, and sometimes more so, and they “make far better choices” of officers and “appear in goodness and in glory far superior” (315–17). His invocation of the motto vox populi vox dei, “the voice of the people is the voice of god,” supplied a ringing culmination to Book 1's argument for republicanism on two foundations, the normative superiority of popular power and the institutional need for procedures of accountability to give it effect.         "
"6","Even The Prince, ostensibly a handbook for tyrants, contained arguments for both popular judgment and institutionalized accountability. In Chapter 9 Machiavelli advised his readers that “the people's object is more creditable than that of the rich: the latter wish to oppress and the former not to oppress” (Gilbert 1965, 40). The articulation of this assumption echoes Chapters 5 and 6 of Book 1 of the Discourses, and the conclusion follows that the prince who courts the masses rather than the elites “never is deceived by them but receives assurances that he has made his foundations strong” (41). Chapter 19 continued in more detail with the need for princes to avoid the people's hatred, discussing popular conspiracies in a sympathetic manner (68–69). Machiavelli then praised the French constitution for averting such conspiracies by dint of the parliament's institutionalized checking powers against the nobility (70), again echoing the praise of Rome in the early chapters of Book 1 of the Discourses.         "
"7","On this textual basis there grew up an alternative to Gentillet's interpretation of Machiavelli as the exponent of immorality and tyranny, one that didn't require ignoring The Prince in favor of the Discourses. As one legend had it, Machiavelli privately confessed to having written his advice‐book ironically, with the intent of guiding tyrants straight into the jaws of popular rebellion. This story was sporadically bandied around Europe for several decades until one variant of it gained currency in England, alleging that The Prince was an exercise in muckraking intended to enable enlightened subjects to fight back against their oppressors. The most famous teller of this version of the story was Alberico Gentili, the exiled Italian Protestant and Oxford jurist who in 1585 called Machiavelli a “eulogist of democracy” on the supposition that he had exposed tyrants’ tricks to “the suffering nations” (Gentili 1924, 2:156). Gentili's regular publisher, John Wolfe, had in the previous year printed the first edition of Machiavelli's Prince and Discourses to appear in England, in the original Italian (Donaldson 1988, 87–95). Wolfe's preface urged readers to let Machiavelli teach them the difference “between a just prince and a tyrant, government by many good men and government by a few bad ones” (93).         "
"8","The contrast between Gentillet's “tyrannical” and Gentili's “republican” interpretations remains central to commentaries on Machiavelli's politics to this day.2 The story that follows is about zealous English Calvinists who might have been expected to echo Gentillet, their coreligionist, but who instead echoed Gentili. Since the seventeenth‐century resurgence of Gentili's account of a populist Machiavelli can be seen in greater detail in the richer documentary field of English political writing, I will trace its outlines there before turning to the evidence for remarkably similar patterns of thought in the less well documented life of the American colonies.         "
"9","Machiavelli's works were available to readers in sixteenth‐century England in Latin, Italian, and French editions, and to a lesser extent in manuscript translations in English (Petrina 2009, 14–32). But the prospective audience was considerably widened by Edward Dacres’s printed English translations of the Discourses (1636) and The Prince (1640). Dacres’s prefaces to his translations implied that Machiavelli could be a valuable guide to those desiring to know their enemy and fight fire with fire. Thus, the Discourses were commended to those who might be called to steer the ship of state through troubled waters (Dacres 1636, ep. ded.). As for The Prince, “this book carries its poison and malice in it, yet methinks the judicious peruser may honestly make use of it in the actions of his life, with advantage,” for “he that means well shall be here warned where the deceitful man learns to set his snares” (Dacres 1640, ep. ded. and “To the Reader”).         "
"10","Within a few years, during the English Civil War, Machiavelli was being taken to heart by some of the most zealous Protestant fundamentalists in England: the Levellers, a political movement that combined the more radical regiments in Oliver Cromwell's army of Christian warriors with support from some of the grittier neighborhoods around London. John Lilburne, for instance, underwent a shift in attitude from initial righteous hatred of Machiavelli, in the spirit of Gentillet, to something like grudging affection. The unofficial Leveller leader got over his association of Machiavellian statecraft with the tyrant Cromwell once he grasped the “fight fire with fire” logic, as expressed in the epithet of “subtle wise man” which Lilburne tagged to the Florentine (Raab 1964, 172–74). This language echoed Gentili's homage to “this shrewdest of men” (Gentili 1924, 2:156) and the “wise impieties” mentioned in a contemporary pamphlet. The Atheisticall Politition was a mockingly titled work that in fact took Machiavelli's thought seriously as ammunition against a corrupt royal court (Bovey 1642). Machiavelli could instruct republicans and honest men, not just tyrants and oligarchs.         "
"11","A more substantive treatment of Machiavelli's distinctive political themes of popular judgment and institutionalized accountability appeared in Vox Plebis (1646), one of many Leveller pamphlets published in support of Lilburne's legal battles for economic justice and religious toleration. Vox Plebis endorsed Machiavelli by name on three occasions, while setting out around 20 additional, unattributed glosses or paraphrases of Machiavelli's texts (Overton 1646, 1–3, 58–68), with special emphasis placed on some of the key passages reviewed above, including Chapters 9 and 19 of The Prince and Chapters 7 and 58 of Book 1 of the Discourses.         "
"12","The underlying theme of Vox Plebis was that Parliament ought to heed the voices of ordinary Englishmen as a force in public affairs. In the first place, this was presented as a matter of Parliament's own interest. Echoing the argument of Chapters 9 and 19 of The Prince, the Levellers warned members of Parliament that “at the same instant they begin to break the Laws, and to execute an Arbitrary power upon the people's liberties, at that very instant they begin to lose their State,” and that “it never turns to a State's advantage to gain the people's hatred: the way to avoid it is to lay no hands on the Subjects’ estates” (Overton 1646, 2–3, 64). But the populist theme was also a function of the people's own merits, and Chapter 58 of Book 1 of Machiavelli's Discourses was paraphrased accordingly: “it is a sure Maxim, that the people are of as clear judgment in all things that concern the Public as any, and as wise and circumspect concerning their liberties, and are as capable of the truth they hear” (67). As examples of this “truth,” the next few sentences affirm that (glossing Chapter 58 again; cf. Dacres 1636, 228–37) commonwealths “have never been much amplified in dominion or riches unless only during their Liberties”; that (glossing Chapter 4 of Book 2; cf. Dacres 1636, 275–83) states ought to treat free subjects as “Associates and not Vassals”; and that (glossing Chapter 16 of The Prince; cf. Dacres 1640, 122–27) states should spend their subjects’ resources “moderately” rather than “through covetousness to devour them in one day” (Overton 1646, 67).         "
"13","Readers of Dacres’s recent translations would have recognized these straightforward glosses of Machiavelli's works, and the title of Vox Plebis would have reminded them of Machiavelli's favoritism toward the plebeian as against the patrician class in ancient Rome. Indeed the pamphlet referred to members of Parliament as “Guardians of the public liberty” (Overton 1646, 3), “Guardians of our Birth‐rights and most powerful Tribunes of the people's liberties” (58), and “most honorable Tribunes of the People, preservators of the Common‐wealth, and chief Guardians of our Laws and Liberties” (59–61)—thereby invoking Chapter 3 of Book 1 of the Discourses (cf. Dacres 1636, 17–19). Vox Plebis went on to recommend that free states “must cherish impeachments and accusations of the people against those that through ambition, avarice, pride, cruelty, or oppression seek to destroy the liberty or property of the people,” thus rephrasing the central lesson of Chapter 7 of Book 1 (Overton 1646, 61; cf. Dacres 1636, 37–42). It was therefore no surprise when Vox Plebis finally acknowledged its debt to Machiavelli by name after a litany of examples from ancient history in which overly ambitious citizens had been punished by legal processes, most of them taken directly from Chapters 22 and 24 of Book 1 of the Discourses (Overton 1646, 60; cf. Dacres 1636, 105–6, 111–13).         "
"14","Though the heavy reliance on Machiavelli in Vox Plebis was unusual in Leveller literature, and though it might have resulted from the brief and opportunistic participation of Marchamont Nedham (Scott 2003, 83–84), the Machiavellian nexus between popular judgment and institutional renovation was in fact the culmination of the Levellers’ ideological legacy. They were the architects of the so‐called Agreements of the People (Sharp 1998, chaps. 7, 12), constitutional blueprints for national government which advocated the abolition of the monarchy and of the House of Lords, leaving the House of Commons as a unicameral assembly, as well as the accountability of governmental officers through political trials and local‐constituency audits (see Maloy 2008, 43–49). Whereas previously the radical republican tradition had regarded Machiavelli as a teacher of either how to be a tyrant or how to depose one, the Levellers illustrated his potential as a source of lessons on how to reconstruct a stable constitutional order out of the rubble of war and resistance. This was the kind of puritan Machiavellism that was available through the development of Gentili's line of interpretation as against Gentillet—and an ideological formation that, perhaps surprisingly, had already emerged some years previously in debates over constitutional structure in New England.         "
"15","The sort of Machiavellian moment that occurred in seventeenth‐century New England, like the later one identified by Pocock around the American founding, was less about the trumpeting of Machiavelli's name than about the use of basic assumptions and arguments that the diffusion of Machiavelli's texts had helped to nurture in English political culture. What we see in the colonial arena, in a much scantier field of documentary evidence than the home country provides, are arguments for institutionalized accountability based on premises about popular judgment which are strikingly similar to those just reviewed in the Levellers. There are no surviving records of the New England democrats’ explicit acknowledgment of Machiavelli's inspiration, as there is in Vox Plebis, but their political opponents in Massachusetts declared it to be present nonetheless.         "
"16","The physical evidence for the diffusion of Machiavelli's texts in the early New England colonies has long been available but never seriously considered by intellectual historians or political theorists. At least two private libraries among the first generation of colonists, those of William Brewster and John Winthrop Jr., are known to have contained a copy of The Prince (H. Dexter 1889, 43; F. Dexter 1907, 7). Scholars typically assume that the few books that were brought over from England were liberally shared through borrowing by the relatively literate members of the New England settlements, and Winthrop Jr. in particular was known to loan out his books all over the region (Morison 1956, 135). A third extant copy of The Prince, in the 1595 Latin edition, was inscribed “Matheri” (Tuttle 1910, 71), leaving us no way of knowing which of the several generations of Mathers in Massachusetts first acquired the book. In a fourth case, the inventory of books taken after the death of a second‐generation New Englander in 1713 contained a line that read, simply, “machevelus” (Jodziewicz 1988, 86). Though a Latinized bibliographic reference like this one doesn't necessarily indicate a Latin text as opposed to an English or Italian one, and though an edition of The Prince might or might not also include the Discourses (as in the first Italian edition printed in England), it's clear at least that the puritans of New England imposed no sectarian test that excluded Machiavelli's works from their consideration. The same could be said for other practical politicians whose books turned up on American shores in the middle seventeenth century, such as Francesco Guicciardini, Machiavelli's compatriot and contemporary, and Walter Raleigh (Morison 1956, 134–39; Wright 1920, 25, 36).         "
"17","The political and military context that the puritan colonists were entering in the 1620s and 1630s would have enhanced the evident utility of The Prince and similar works. Given the likelihood of competition with presumptively hostile Indians and Catholics, the New Englanders believed that in order to survive they would have to know how to fight. This was one of the lessons to be drawn from Capt. John Smith, who was widely read by early New Englanders as an authority on American colonization. His accounts of affairs in Virginia, many of them at first hand, vividly depicted interest and force as the prime considerations in Indian policy and were taken as precedents for other colonies. Smith's advice on diplomatic and military strategy made his Description of New England (1616) as valuable a part of Brewster's library as The Prince (H. Dexter 1889, 43). Moreover, the political landscape on which the New Englanders were encroaching resembled the carnival of city‐states and potentates in Renaissance Italy, taking in a complex arena of power which included Narragansetts, Nemaskets, Patuxets, and Pokanokets to the south and west of the English and Abenaki settlements to the north (Humins 1987; Salisbury 1981). Thus, Guicciardini's History of Italy was a natural companion piece to Machiavelli's Prince, the former being an accessible source of details on the historical background to the latter. English editions of the former were printed in 1579, 1599, and 1618, and William Bradford and Winthrop Jr. kept Guicciardini in their libraries (Anderson 2003, 15, 23–24, 270; Morison 1956, 134–35). If knowledge of Florentine statecraft was essential to keeping up with the international arms race in strategic thinking, the move to a precarious new home surely helped to reorient the puritans’ inherited antipathies for Machiavellian statecraft.         "
"18","The best documented cases of this statecraft in action are associated with John Winthrop (see Mosse 1968, chap. 6), the leading statesman of the Massachusetts colony from its inception in 1630 until his death in 1649. In the most celebrated episode of his discretionary theory and practice, in 1643, Winthrop relied on the primacy of interest and force in human affairs to justify his decision unilaterally to provide supplies to an army of French Catholics which sought his help in a dispute over control of the colony of Acadia. He was justified by an emergency in acting unilaterally, he claimed, and Massachusetts could trust even the papists because “we rely not upon their faith but their interest … having sufficient strength to secure ourselves” (Winthrop 1972, 2:111–12).         "
"19","But political thought in New England entered distinctively Machiavellian territory precisely in opposition to Winthrop's discretionary style of rule: the cleavage of Machiavellian populism versus Guicciardinian elitism which McCormick has identified within recent republican thought (McCormick 2003) was prefigured in seventeenth‐century New England's internal political debates. In their efforts to discipline and diminish the magistrates of Massachusetts, Winthrop's political opponents adhered to precisely those two aspects of Machiavelli's politics which were later put into print by the Levellers in England: popular judgment and institutionalized accountability.         "
"20","As far as the limited documentary record reveals, the most articulate of Winthrop's ideological challengers was Thomas Hooker, a reverend minister and paragon of puritan piety. Hooker was a most unlikely Machiavellian figure, to say the least, yet his extant writings exhibit key elements of the populist critique of the government of Massachusetts. Winthrop's political opponents were often required to submit their written arguments to the quarterly assembly at Boston for public examination, and his influence was such that the repudiation and destruction of the documents usually followed (e.g., Emerson 1976, 149; Shurtleff 1854, 1:135–36, 205–8; Winthrop 1972, 1:124). Hooker never publicly aired his views on civil authority while he lived under Winthrop's jurisdiction—a sign of shrewdness, compared to others. Yet he did write to Winthrop privately on politics, he preached on politics after leaving Massachusetts and helping to found the Connecticut colony, and late in life he wrote a treatise on church government which confirmed and ramified his general principles.         "
"21","One of these principles was what might be called “providential populism,” a puritan gloss on the Machiavellian premises emphasized by the Levellers in Vox Plebis by way of Chapter 9 of The Prince and Chapter 58 of Book 1 of the Discourses. The conventional attitude of the time was that ordinary people deserve diligent care by faithful shepherds, but that the sheep themselves can't be judges or actors of any consequence. In this vein, Guicciardini's commentary on Machiavelli's Discourses, in fact, directly attacked Chapters 5 and 58 of Book 1 (Guicciardini 1965, 71, 105). Though this commentary wasn't printed before the nineteenth century, Guicciardini's assumption of the “ignorance and confusion” of ordinary people was also aired in his widely available History of Italy (Guicciardini 1969, 80–82, 121–22) as well as in the Latin edition of his Ricordi (Anglo 2005, 638–39). During Winthrop's struggles in Massachusetts, he too feared the “heat and tumult” of deliberative processes turned over to “a whole multitude” (Hutchinson 1865, 78). On one occasion he countered a rival who “speaks of the safety, etc., in the Judgment of the Deputies rather than in the magistrates,” pleading that “we should incur Scandal by under‐valuing the gifts of God, as wisdom, learning, etc. … if the Judgment and Authority of any one of the Common rank of the people should bear equal weight with that of the wisest and chiefest magistrate” (Winthrop 1867, 2:434–45). And he attacked Hooker's Connecticut colony for “two errors in their government: 1. They chose divers scores [of] men, who had no learning or judgment which might fit them for those affairs”; secondly, their “managing of state business” was done by pastors “stepping out of their course” to meddle in politics (Winthrop 1972, 1:286).         "
"22","These remarks were undoubtedly aimed at Hooker himself, whose rejection of the conventional denigration of popular judgment in civil affairs was at least the ally if not also the inspiration of Winthrop's political rivals in Massachusetts. In a private letter, Hooker told Winthrop that it violates “both safety and warrant” to allow public affairs to be “left to [the magistrate's] discretion. I must confess, I ever looked at it as a way which leads directly to tyranny, and so to confusion” (Hooker 1860, 11). This deliberate shifting of the commonplace association of “confusion” away from popular participation and toward elite discretion was undergirded by Hooker's more general conviction that traditional elitist assumptions about ordinary people's capacities were inconsistent with divine providence. As he wrote in the preface to A Survey of the Summe of Church‐Discipline (1648), “these are the times when the people shall be fitted for such privileges… . Whereas it hath been charged upon the people that through their ignorance and unskilfulness they are not able to wield such privileges, and therefore not fit to share in any such power, the Lord hath promised to take away the veil from all faces in the mountain” (Hooker 1972, sig. a, fol. 1a–b). Citing Isaiah 25:7 rather than Roman history, this was a distinctively puritan gloss on Machiavellian populism.         "
"23","Hooker's only published peer in this respect was John Robinson, the “Pilgrim Pastor” who was minister to the future settlers of New Plymouth during their Dutch exile but died before his own intended migration to America. Robinson also urged participation by “the less skilful multitude” in the government of churches as a divine imperative while denying the usual assumptions about the disruptive and unrighteous consequences of that participation. His own church's experience in Yorkshire and the Dutch provinces, he suggested, had shown that recognizing the legitimate powers of the brethren could produce surpassing levels of harmony and sobriety (Robinson 1851, 2:223). Robinson also defended a populist interpretation of Matthew 18:17, which on his view required that “the things which concerned the whole Church were to be declared publicly to the whole Church and not to some part only” (Burgess 1920, 69). Forecasting Hooker, Robinson upheld the axiom that “in the multitude of counsellors there is safety” by way of Proverbs 11:14 (Robinson 1851, 3:392), and he condemned critics of his populist reading of Matthew 18:17, in a sardonic turn of phrase, as “heavy friends to the people's liberty” (Robinson 1625, 31). In Hooker and Robinson, then, we find two spokesmen for a minority faith within a minority faith: a distinctively populist approach to political problems which mimicked Machiavelli's own and may have endeared the Florentine to puritan readers of a certain persuasion.         "
"24","Not coincidentally, Robinson's followers in New Plymouth and Hooker with his brethren in Connecticut, along with Roger Williams and his neighbors in Rhode Island, evolved political systems varying in key respects from Winthrop's Massachusetts. The reason is that some New England puritans followed the Machiavellian logic leading from popular judgment to institutionalized accountability, an ideological development that precipitated conflict with Winthrop and earned condemnation from the Massachusetts establishment. In the process, Winthrop and his allies were revealed as the heirs to Gentillet's interpretation of Machiavelli as the exponent of immorality and tyranny, at the same time accusing their opponents of views that resembled Gentili's populist interpretation."
"25","The substantive political issue that separated Massachusetts from the colonies on her periphery had to do with constitutional structure. The basic institutions by which civil authority was distributed in the New England colonies followed a consistent pattern: the “general court,” composed of citizens (“freemen”) attending in person or else of deputies sent from particular towns, handled basic legislative tasks; the “governor” acted as the chief executive and judicial officer; the “board of assistants” was composed of magistrates who handled executive and judicial duties alongside the governor himself; and the governor and assistants together were considered part of the general court and always had some hand in legislation as well. What set the peripheral colonies apart from Massachusetts was that, over time, each of them weakened its governor and assistants vis‐à‐vis its deputies through two devices: unicameral decision making and nonelectoral accountability (see Maloy 2008, chap. 6). The latter included procedures of audit and impeachment similar to the “accusations” that had been celebrated in Machiavelli's Discourses and would soon be revived in the Levellers’ Vox Plebis.         "
"26","The ground for the New England democrats’ constitutional reforms was prepared by, and the ideological rationale most coherently expressed in, an organized (but ultimately failed) movement of reform within Massachusetts itself.3 Fragmentary records of the reformers’ rationale link the movement, which emerged in the early 1630s and persisted through the middle 1640s, to figures like Israel Stoughton, Richard Bellingham, and William Hathorne. The two most controversial institutions in the Massachusetts colony's government were the “negative voice” and the “standing council.”         "
"27","The first and most consequential of these was a veto power held by a majority of the Board of Assistants, including the Governor, over any measure passed by a majority of the deputies in the General Court. Thus, the negative voice was the lynchpin of de facto bicameralism: even though proposals and debates were heard in a single chamber, votes were counted in two distinct pools, and the Governor and 12 Assistants were thereby enabled to cancel out three or four dozen deputies. Under the opposition's proposal for abolishing the negative voice, the Governor's and Assistants’ votes would be counted in the same pool as the deputies, with each vote weighted equally. The bitter struggle that ensued was resolved by a rather one‐sided compromise in 1644, when the Board of Assistants was allowed to keep its veto in exchange for formal recognition of a reciprocal power in the deputies and formal separation of the General Court into two chambers (Winthrop 1972, 118–19). In short, the General Court now had two distinct deliberative bodies, but the voting rules remained unchanged—a signal victory for Winthrop and his fellow magistrates, who despised the notion of allowing equal weight to ordinary citizens or their representatives.         "
"28","The standing council, by contrast, was successfully neutered, even if not formally abolished, by the opposition campaign. It was an executive and judicial body that was distinct from the Board of Assistants; its members, including Winthrop, held lifetime terms and ill‐defined powers (Winthrop 1972, 2:90–91, 167–70, 204–10). The standing council was a symbolic disaster in a colony whose denizens had brought with them from England considerable suspicion of a life‐tenured king and House of Lords. It may even have been a ruse in the first place, since it was only created in the aftermath of the first attempt in the General Court to abolish the negative voice; thus, it could function either as an institutional safeguard of the magistrates’ power in case their veto couldn't be saved, or else as an outlet for the deputies’ hostility in case it could.         "
"29","The campaigns against both the negative voice and the standing council had the same underlying constitutional motive: to augment the power of the deputies by diminishing that of the Governor and Assistants. The deputies were chosen within dozens of towns around Massachusetts, while the Governor and Assistants were elected by all the citizens who could travel to Boston to cast ballots. The deputies were relatively humble men, albeit big fishes in the small ponds of their individual towns, while the Governor and Assistants were among the wealthiest and best educated in the colony. Thus, the overarching purpose of the opposition to Winthrop over the negative voice and the standing council was to use institutional design to counter elite discretion with popular power. This was a broadly Machiavellian agenda, of course. The deputies’ desire to abolish the Governor's and Assistants’ veto even echoed, in a rather literal way, Chapter 50 of Book 1 of the Discourses, which argued that “the power of stopping the public actions of the city should not be given into the hands of one council or one magistracy” (Dacres 1636, 198). But the opposition's more general argument was that executive and judicial powers should be considered strictly accountable to the people, not discretionary in nature. In a rare example of surviving evidence for the opposition's motives, Israel Stoughton wrote a private letter in which he recalled that, early in the colony's life, “the people chose them [Winthrop and the Assistants] Magistrates, and then they made laws, disposed lands, raised monies, punished offenders, etc., at their discretion” (Emerson 1976, 146). In support of the effort to control this discretion, Stoughton countered that the colony's charter “makes their power Ministerial according to the greater vote of the general courts, and not Magisterial according to their own discretion… . Their power … was not so great that they could do aught or hinder aught simply according to their own wills, but they must eye and respect general courts, which by patent consist of the whole company of freemen” (149). When he took the trouble to write down 12 arguments in support of the opposition's reform agenda, Stoughton was branded by Winthrop as “the troubler of Israel … a worm … and an underminer of the state,” and his paper was destroyed by order of the General Court (149–50).         "
"30","Winthrop later dissected his rivals’ position in the classic anti‐Machiavellian language of Gentillet. Their view, which of course he rejected, was “that it should be dangerous for the Commonwealth to have the magistrates united in Love and affection … but that they should rather be divided in factions, etc. If this pass for good doctrine, then let us no longer profess the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but take up the rules of Machiavelli and the Jesuits… . [For] the Devil teacheth them[,] divide et impera [‘divide and rule’]” (Winthrop 1867, 2:279). Through their recurrent efforts to abridge discretionary power, the deputies did indeed behave as though they believed in the sort of institutionalized class conflict broached in Chapters 9 and 19 of The Prince and celebrated in Chapters 4 and 5 of Book 1 of the Discourses. During the contentious elections of 1634, for example, “some of the assistants were questioned by some of the freemen for some errors in their government, and some fines imposed, but remitted again before the court broke up”; Winthrop himself was shortly thereafter subjected to a personal audit by the General Court (Winthrop 1972, 1:132). To these devices was added, in 1645, an impeachment trial against Winthrop (2:221–30). These were pioneering episodes in the theory and practice of democratic accountability in a modern political setting: the democrats wanted sanctions, not explanations, and they weren't willing to wait until election day. Given their likely familiarity with Machiavelli's Discourses, Winthrop and his fellow puritans knew that Chapter 7 of Book 1 had set out political trials of powerful individuals as essential bulwarks of liberty.         "
"31","The terms in which Winthrop condemned his opponents, moreover, recalled the famous claim of Gentillet's Contre Machiavel that “divide and rule” was a typically Machiavellian tactic. Gentillet had cited several passages of both The Prince and the Discourses for the maxim that a ruler should promote “divisions among his subjects” and that “seditions and civil dissensions are useful” (Gentillet 1974, 340, 452, 464). The 1595 Latin edition of The Prince contained the Vindiciae contra Tyrannos (1576) as an appendix, the preface to which condemned Machiavelli precisely for favoring partisanship and discord. Two other French authors commonly found in colonial libraries, Daneau and Primaudaye, authored works containing passages that praised Gentillet's criticism of Machiavelli and called the Florentine a “monster” (Anglo 2005, 343–45, 364–65). Winthrop was resorting, in short, to the standard puritan arguments against Machiavellism.         "
"32","The logic by which Winthrop understood his opponents to be political Machiavellians had much to recommend it. In Dacres’s translation of the Discourses, Machiavelli's defense of popular judgment (bk. 1, chap. 58) was seen to point to the flourishing of “those cities where the Principality is in the people,” suggesting that the kind of unified command normally associated with a single ruler could also be attributed to a collective agent—much as, in England, Vox Plebis addressed members of parliament as a collective prince in charge of “their state” (Dacres 1636, 233; Overton 1646, 2). It's in this sense, then, that Winthrop predicated Gentillet's allegation of “divide and rule” on the town deputies who opposed him. Among the numerous cases cited by Machiavelli of influential leaders who faced popular resistance was Francesco Valori in Florence, “who was, as it were, Prince of the city,” and whose detractors found “no way in the commonwealth to resist him, unless with some faction opposed to his” (Dacres 1636, 39–40). Defying Gentillet's tendentious interpretive practice, however, this discussion (precisely in Book 1, Chapter 7, on impeachments) was meant to show how legalized, institutionalized class conflict offered a peaceful alternative to the bloodletting that actually occurred in Florence. Whereas Winthrop pretended that the General Court of Massachusetts would “divide and rule” in the same manner as a tyrannical prince, his opponents’ institutional agenda reflected a more genuinely Machiavellian view of how a republican state “divides and rules.”         "
"33","But the puritans who insisted that Winthrop be subjected to nonelectoral accountability didn't make a particularly successful go of it. The two men who were delegated by the General Court to audit Winthrop in 1635 found that he had incurred personal debts on the colony's behalf, for which he publicly refused compensation, and the deputies who moved his impeachment in 1645 lost the vote in the General Court to convict him. Thereafter Winthrop's influence again ascended, resting stably on the heights of a significant constitutional settlement by which the issue of the negative voice had been resolved: the Massachusetts opposition had conceded the preservation of the Assistants’ veto in a bicameral assembly in exchange for little more than periodic elections and written limitations on governmental authority. This sort of trade‐off, in the name of Winthrop's elitist, Guicciardinian republicanism, looks remarkably similar to how American constitutionalism as a whole is often conceptualized, as typified in the “Machiavellian moment” of 1787."
"34","Yet Winthrop clearly associated the alternative, now failed republican paradigm with Machiavelli's zeal for institutionalized class conflict, and in the wake of his impeachment he described his rivals in the same terms of “reason of state” and of irreligion which had become associated with Machiavelli's name across Christendom. The deputies behind his impeachment had acted “as if salus populi [the people's safety] had been now the transcendent rule to walk by, … all authority … must be exercised by the people in their body representative” (1972, 2:231). In the extraordinary circumstances of his own impeachment and acquittal, the besieged Guicciardinian statesman of Boston resorted to the oldest of anti‐Machiavellian epithets: his trial and the reform movements that had preceded it had been exposed as “the workings of Satan to ruin the colonies and Churches of Christ in New England” (2:231).         "
"35","This mixture of righteous indignation and genuine fear stands in contrast to the public statement that Winthrop gave immediately after his acquittal: the famous “Little Speech on Liberty.” There he chided his opponents for their “mistake about liberty and authority.” The true meaning of “civil” liberty, he argued, was for citizens to enjoy a moment of consent to magistrates followed by a period of obedience, just like the relation of a wife to her husband or a church to Jesus Christ (Winthrop 1972, 2:228–30). This was a more conciliatory version of the message that his impeachment was an unholy act, and his consensual language of altar and hearth not only reflected his undoubted commitment to conserving Massachusetts’ godly experiment but also typified his skill at turning acrimony into harmony. Ironically, perhaps, this speech was faithful to the Machiavellian notion that a prince can never be more secure than when the people are on his side. If Machiavelli hadn't praised the French parliament as a check on a haughty nobility (The Prince, chap. 19), or the Roman practice of subjecting ambitious leaders to political trials (Discourses, bk. 1, chap. 7), Winthrop himself might have been the real Machiavellian in this episode. But the fact that it took place against a context of ongoing ideological debate over elite discretion and popular control reminds us that Winthrop's “Little Speech” was as much about accountability and discretion as it was about liberty.         "
"36","Yet it's clear that Winthrop's statecraft did call for extensive deliberation: consensus and harmony being prime social goals, political disagreement was to be ameliorated through reasoned and respectful discussion. The General Court was the regular forum for such discussion, but informal conferences are also mentioned ad nauseam in the records of early Massachusetts politics. For their part, Winthrop's opponents were interested less in reason than in power, and more in the moment of decision than in the attempt to render decisions noncontroversial. Their method of “divide and rule” revolved around procedures that would encourage conflict followed by some genuinely popular resolution thereof. Like “contestatory” adaptations of deliberative theory today, the puritan Machiavellians understood that resolution without conflict is hardly better than conflict without resolution. Unicameralism was meant to supply a genuinely democratic option for resolution, as institutionalized accountability was meant to do for conflict."
"37","In short, deliberative theory today looks like the heir to Winthrop's elitist version of statecraft. The key to salvaging its democratic credentials, then, must lie in restoring the principle of popular control to its conceptual core. Just as theories of statecraft in the seventeenth century had to be distinguished according to whether they served popular control or elite discretion, so too with varieties of deliberationism today. What forms of conflict and of resolution serve popular control as opposed to elite discretion? This is a question not for normative theory narrowly speaking but for political science in general, and the failure to pose it in the case of another feature of modern constitutional states, viz. periodic elections, has been the cause of some embarrassment. While historical research has recently been rediscovering the fact that elections were originally designed to facilitate elite rather than popular power (Maloy 2008; Manin 1997), empirical and analytical research has been finding that the circumstances under which elections can plausibly be construed as mechanisms of accountability are surprisingly rare (Przeworski, Stokes, and Manin 1999). If deliberative institutions were actually to be created in the absence of a firm conceptual distinction between popular control and elite discretion, they would likely meet the same fate in the course of time.         "
"38","The theoretic oversight that banishes this distinction from consideration plagues political science in general, not just normative theory. The regime type, once the master category of systemic political analysis, now turns largely on the holding of competitive elections regardless of how power is distributed subsequently (e.g., Przeworski et al. 2000, chap. 1). The question of regime structure, e.g., of unicameral versus multicameral configurations of power, is merely ancillary, and the question of nonelectoral accountability is even more marginal. The Machiavellian democrats in old and New England held an alternative conception of political power, with important ramifications running through several branches of political analysis.         "
"39","To take an obvious illustration, the basic institutions of the U.S. Constitution are superficially Machiavellian: a “mixed” regime (see Discourses, bk. 1, chap. 2) with the possibility of nonelectoral accountability through the impeachment of executive and judicial officers. But below the surface, Machiavelli's preferred constitutional mixture doesn't look equivalent to the multicameral engine of American government: the functional “separation of powers” among differently constituted agencies is one thing; aristocratic voting rules within a legislative agency are something else, and “checks and balances” among agencies which in fact violate functional separation are something else again. Though the puritan Machiavellians’ perspective doesn't necessarily condemn all kinds of interagency checks, it does rule out the veto powers currently residing in unelected, indirectly elected, and disproportionally elected bodies (e.g., the Supreme Court, the President, and the Senate, respectively). Moreover, the process of impeachment in Congress, while superficially similar to the one employed by the puritan Machiavellians, is nonetheless integrated into the basic multicameral engine. The vote for actually punishing the impeached officer resides in an aristocratic body, and the counting threshold is raised from simple majority to two‐thirds, which evidently discourages resort to the institution at all. This is one illustration of the difference made by the puritan Machiavellians’ analysis of power: unicameralism and nonelectoral accountability can't be treated as isolated and incidental add‐ons to a political regime, since competitive elections distribute power differently in their presence than they do in their absence, and accountability itself operates differently in unicameral versus multicameral systems.         "
"40","A further implication of this story for both empirical and normative research is that “democratic” institutional design must learn to escape the prison of 1787. Deliberative theorists tend to propose add‐ons to the existing building, like polls for advising power holders and special holidays for electing them (e.g., Ackerman and Fishkin 2004; Fishkin 1991), but the “contestatory” alternative is in fact equally modest in its remodeling ambitions. Pettit has explicated “contestatory democratization” in terms of citizens’ rights of “appeal and review” against governmental policy, to be institutionalized in vaguely characterized judicial or administrative bodies (Pettit 1999, 180–81; Pettit 2000, 119–23). He's explicitly endorsed a multicameral legislative structure, together with other common features of existing constitutional republics, as “providing ordinary people with pre‐emptive resources of contestation against government decisions”(Pettit 1999, 185–86; Pettit 2000, 128–30). And he's called for mandatory voting and the use of deliberative polls to deliver citizens’ opinions to decision makers (Pettit 2000, 135–36). If the tagline of “contestation” is meant to signal a move toward taking power more seriously than deliberative theory does, these are small steps indeed. No one familiar with the puritan Machiavellians’ story can take it as “obvious,” as Pettit has done, that a multicameral regime with various elite veto‐players allows “ordinary people” the power to contest governmental policy (Pettit 2000, 130; see also Pettit 2006).         "
"41","In short, if modern liberalism is a refinement and rationalization of Anglo‐American constitutional norms since roughly the turn of the eighteenth century, deliberationism is a refinement of the refinement. So far it appears that contestationism is merely another refinement of the 1787 paradigm, since it either defies (on unicameralism) or ignores (on nonelectoral accountability) the institutional agenda of an alternative strand within the Anglo‐American tradition. If these well‐known schools of political theory are any indication, political science today offers no radical option for democratic institutional reform (but see McCormick 2006; Maloy 2008, 186–89)—an important contemporary fact that the historical perspective supplied by the seventeenth‐century puritan Machiavellians brings into focus.         "
"42","Machiavelli was and is best known for his theory of statecraft, a pragmatic, strategic approach to politics which attempts to specify means for attaining the distinctive collective ends of political life on the basis of realistic assumptions about individual and group behavior. The early New England debates surveyed above show two opposed variants of statecraft in operation, roughly corresponding to Machiavelli and Guicciardini and distinguished by their preferences for popular control and elite discretion, respectively. Winthrop adopted the latter and his democratic opponents the former. Winthrop and the Massachusetts establishment practiced one form of “divide and rule”; their democratic critics proposed another. Winthrop's way was to distinguish privileged elites from ordinary citizens through aristocratic voting rules; his opponents’ was to adopt egalitarian voting rules while using nonelectoral institutions of accountability as vehicles of episodic conflict between privileged elites and ordinary citizens. Whereas the democrats could not accept Winthrop's aristocratic voting rules because they would defeat popular control, Winthrop could not accept nonelectoral accountability because it would defeat elite discretion."
"43","The failure of the New England democrats was every bit as momentous as the similar but more famous result that Oliver Cromwell achieved a few years later over the Levellers in old England. Both movements of puritan Machiavellism championed unicameralism and nonelectoral accountability, while both Winthrop and Cromwell stood for a minimalist electoral regime with checks and balances within a multicameral constitution; the debate between the unicameralist Thomas Paine and the multicameralist John Adams in the 1770s and 1780s raised many of the same issues and had the same antidemocratic result (Maloy 2007). All these episodes represent lost opportunities for the populist strand of modern constitutionalism. Whereas the now familiar complex of checks and balances, legal limitations on government, and periodic elections is today considered the height of democratic liberation around the world, the original Anglo‐American advocates of this sort of “mixed” regime were well aware that they were the antidemocrats. Thus, the “struggle for democracy” theme that typifies both popular and scholarly conceptions of the American political tradition (e.g., Greenberg and Page 2001) could just as easily be recast as a “struggle for aristocracy”—and with greater accuracy, if the struggle in question is supposed to refer to the winning rather than the losing side.         "
"44","The problem posed by the first Machiavellian moment in America isn’t, as we once believed, about the relation of civic virtue to our “liberty.” Instead it's about another of our cardinal terms of political value, about whether and how we understand “democracy” itself."
