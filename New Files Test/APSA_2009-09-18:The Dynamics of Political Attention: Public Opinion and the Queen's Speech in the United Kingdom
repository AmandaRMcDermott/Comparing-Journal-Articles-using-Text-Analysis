"1","Studies of the aggregate responsiveness of government to public opinion (for literature reviews, see Burstein 1998; Manza and Lomax Cook 2002; Wlezien 2004) suggest there is an equilibrating relationship between public policies and public preferences over time (e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Franklin and Wlezien 1997; Soroka and Wlezien 2004, 2005; Wlezien 1995, 1996, 2004). The idea of dynamic representation (i.e., responsiveness) is structured in time, measuring the degree to which preceding changes in public opinion are correlated with subsequent changes in government policies such as expenditure or legislation. This conception of macropolitics emphasizes the continuous character of shifts and transitions in the behavior of government officials and the public (Stimson 1991; Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995). It is premised upon the majoritarian model of democracy (Lijphart 1984) where responsiveness is constituted in the satisfaction of the preferences of a numerical majority of the people. Furthermore, it implies the presence of negative feedback within the political system (Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995; Wlezien 1995) since vote‐seeking policy makers have an incentive to respond to public opinion only if the public, in turn, notices and rewards such behavior (and punishes nonresponsiveness along the lines of Fiorina 1981). The continuous equilibration of public opinion and government behavior, i.e., dynamic representation, is therefore dependent upon negative feedback; where there is an accurate and efficient flow of information to elected officials concerning public preferences or priorities.         "
"2","The punctuated equilibrium model (e.g., Baumgartner and Jones 1991, 1993, 2002; Jones and Baumgartner 2005a, 2005b) proposes a quite different perspective regarding the dynamics of political responsiveness. It observes that public policies are subject to extended periods of incrementalism, characterized by equilibrium or stasis, which are disrupted from time to time by rapid or dramatic realignments. The attention of policy makers to particular issues or problems is therefore punctuated by episodic disruptions of its equilibrium state that overcome the cognitive and institutional friction inherent to government decision making (see Jones and Baumgartner 2005a, 2005b; Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen 2003). That friction is a form of negative feedback that, True, Jones, and Baumgartner argue, maintains the equilibrium of policies “… somewhat like a thermostat maintains constant temperature in a room” (2007, 160). At any moment in time the policymaking agenda is crowded with multiple issues in competition with each other for attention (e.g., Kingdon 1995). However, the scarce and bounded nature of government decision making restricts its capability to attend to particular issues and secure the reversal or the realignment of policies. Instead, the disproportionate response of policy makers to information signals, added to cascade effects in mobilizations of interests, institutions, or ideas (e.g., Downs 1972; Schattschneider 1960), leads to rapid and urgent reprioritizations of attention. This is observed, for example, in macropunctuations of budget change distributions in the United States and elsewhere (Baumgartner, Foucault, and François 2006; Breunig 2006; John and Margetts 2003; Jones and Baumgartner 2005a; Jones et al. 1998; Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen 2003). As such, this model implies that extended periods of equilibrium are the product of negative feedback processes that resist change whereas policy punctuations are a result of bursts of positive feedback that, from time to time, propel public policies to new equilibria. Notwithstanding this fragile coexistence of positive and negative feedback, there is evidence of static correspondence between the issue attention of government and the public (Jones and Baumgartner 2004, 2005a).         "
"3","As accounts of macropolitics, these models share a concern with the nature of feedback and equilibrium in political systems and the degree to which representative institutions translate information signals into political outputs. Furthermore, both conceive macropolitical outcomes as the aggregate of microlevel decisions and behavior. There remains an outstanding puzzle concerning the degree to which punctuated equilibrium in political attention is compatible with the responsiveness of government to public opinion."
"4","Theories of macroresponsiveness and macropunctuations provide reasons to suspect that attention of the public and policy makers to particular issues or problems might sometimes exist in a long‐run equilibrium state, where shocks that disturb the normal distance between the variables are corrected over time through a process of feedback. The architecture of the error‐correction framework is able to capture both short‐run and long‐run processes, as well as diagnosing negative and positive feedback processes that give rise to either equilibrium or disequilibrium. Since the introduction of error‐correction models in econometrics (Davidson et al. 1978) and theoretical proof of their representation of cointegrated variables (Engle and Granger 1987), political scientists have adopted the error‐correction framework for analysis in a number of different contexts (De Boef and Keele 2008), including models of governing and opposition party support (Clarke and Stewart 1995; Clarke, Ho, and Stewart 2000; Clarke, Stewart, and Whiteley 1998), the public mood (Durr 1993; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002), trust in government (Keele 2007), and specific policy‐opinion dynamics (Jennings 2009). Its application here is directed towards investigation of feedback and equilibration, in combination with tests of nonnormality of input and output distributions and model residuals.         "
"5","While error‐correction models tend to be isomorphic with the concept of cointegration for political scientists (see De Boef and Keele 2008),1 this framework is appropriate for modelling feedback and equilibrium relationships in stationary as well as nonstationary data (Banerjee, Dolado, and Galbraith 1993; Davidson and MacKinnon 1993; De Boef and Keele 2008). The presence of cointegration in political relationships remains contentious, while reliance upon the Engle‐Granger two‐step procedure has been shown to be problematic (De Boef and Granato 1999). Furthermore, most diagnostic tests for unit root possess low power against local alternatives (De Boef and Granato 1997, 1999), meaning it tends to be difficult to ascertain whether series are (co)integrated with confidence. This analysis therefore specifies the dynamic and equilibrating relationship between public and policymaking attention in the form of a single‐equation error‐correction model:            "
"6","That is where short‐run changes in the attention of policy makers to a particular issue (ΔAGENDAt) are a function of short‐run changes in public attention to that same topic (ΔOPINIONt), and where the lagged value of the dependent variable (AGENDAt−1) measures the speed of reequilibration (α*1) in response to shocks to the long‐run agenda‐opinion equilibrium. This model, like other models of dynamic representation (e.g., Wlezien 2004), also includes a variable (PARTYt) to capture contemporaneous effects of indirect representation through partisan control of government.         "
"7","Within the error‐correction framework, changes in government attention are estimated as a function of contemporaneous changes in public opinion and the degree to which these are outside their usual equilibrium in the previous time period. This suggests that if there is a deviation from that long‐run equilibrium, when policy makers commit either “too much” or “too little” attention to a particular issue, responsiveness is equal to the rate and strength of error‐correction that restores congruence between policymaking attention and public opinion (i.e., issue representation) to its earlier status quo. Although the punctuated equilibrium model instead observes error‐accumulation in extended periods of incrementalism, it also recognizes that political institutions “… impose error correction by providing incentives to those who make course corrections” (Jones and Baumgartner 2005b, 334). The responsiveness of policymaking attention is therefore constituted both in the strength of short‐run effects and in the degree of error‐correction or error‐accumulation in response to disequilibrium. This representation is consistent with theoretical expectations about political behavior, as policy makers should respond to disturbances to the long‐run equilibrium with a view to reelection. That equilibrium state is a function of cognitive or institutional friction that absorbs the effects of shocks on government policies and public opinion and implies long‐run attraction towards the equal ranking of issue priorities by policy makers and the public. This counteracts error‐accumulation through a process of negative feedback. At the same time it is conceivable that although government might respond to public concerns about particular issues, the effect on public opinion might sometimes be self‐perpetuating (i.e., increasing at times of high attention and decreasing at times of low attention) rather than countercyclical. It follows that policy makers' attention might be responsive to public opinion in the sense that these move together over time in a long‐run equilibrium state but not insofar as government attentiveness is guaranteed to dampen public concern about an issue.         "
"8","The error‐correction representation of agenda‐opinion dynamics implies that feedback is a continuous rather than an intermittent process. This differs from adjustment through punctuations where responses to additive information signals are nonlinear and bring about new equilibria. When input (public opinion) and output (policymaking attention) series are drawn from an aggregate leptokurtic distribution, periods of positive feedback are inferred from outliers in the fat tails of that distribution and negative feedback from incrementalism in the tall slender peak of the distribution. For theoretical reasons that are detailed later, effects of error‐accumulation might be expected to be different in the context of the error‐correction framework. The technicalities of theoretical specification are therefore critical for the diagnosis of negative or positive feedback between policymaking and public attention."
"9","At the same time, estimation of parameters of the error‐correction model also enables detection of positive feedback in a number of different forms. First, positive feedback is identifiable where the input or output series is an explosive process and integrated of an order greater than one.2 Second, while the error‐correction parameter (α*1) is supposed to be negative according to its formal construction, a sign reversal where the value of the coefficient is positive indicates that agenda‐opinion dynamics are procyclical instead of countercyclical. That means that policymaking or public attention to a particular issue increases at times of high attention and decreases at times of low attention, reinforcing the disequilibrium. Whereas thermostatic mechanisms act to cool the system temperature as it increases, procyclical mechanisms amplify disturbances, causing it to become unstable and spin out of control. This is shown in a graphical illustration of the effect of parameter values in Figure 1. If the value of α*1 is greater than 0, then equilibrium errors accumulate at an exponential rate. In other words, a positive error‐correction parameter indicates that disequilibrium in agenda and opinion congruence is not corrected through negative feedback. It might instead suggest that the long‐run equilibrium is fragile and misspecified. This is an explosive process since the effect of a shock grows over time. Subject to this kind of positive feedback, a disturbance to the long‐run equilibrium state would lead to responses of increasing magnitude from policy makers.         "
"10","                 Graphical Illustration of the Dynamic Effect of Different ECM Parameters                      "
"11"," Note: The simulation is generated for an autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model, Yt=α0+α1Yt−1+β0Xt+β1Xt−1+ɛt (following De Boef and Keele 2008), that is derived from an ECM, Δ Yt=α*0+α*1 Yt‐1+β*0Δ Xt+β*1 Xt‐1+ɛt, where β*0= 0.5 and β*1= 0.25 (where the Bardsen transformation proves that β*0=β0, β*1=β0+β1, α*1= 1 −α1).                     "
"12","If the value of α*1 is negative and equal to between 0 and −1, equilibrium shocks are (in contrast) corrected at a gradual rate. The closer the parameter is to −1, the faster the rate of reequilibration. This form of equilibration is the theoretical expectation of models of macroresponsiveness, as policy makers have electoral incentives to respond to shifts in public opinion. Indeed, the empirical evidence reflects this process of equilibration (e.g., Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Wlezien 2004).         "
"13","However, if the value of α*1 lies between −1 and −2, then the correction of errors oscillates between positive and negative values but dissipates over time, tending towards zero. This generates an iterative process where, for example, policymaking attention undercorrects and then overreacts in response to disturbance of the public's concern about a particular issue, eventually returning to its long‐run equilibrium. It is therefore possible for processes of reequilibration to be unbalanced within the error‐correction framework. This overreaction of feedback is not equivalent to positive feedback, but is characteristic of disproportionate information processing (Jones and Baumgartner 2005a, 2005b) in the sense that policy makers over‐weight new information signals about public opinion. In contrast, if the value of α*1 is less than −2, the effect of a shock to the equilibrium state oscillates between positive and negative responses that are of increasing magnitude; exhibiting the characteristic of “sensitive dependence upon initial conditions” that is associated with chaotic processes where small perturbations to the short‐run relationship can lead to large deviations of the long‐run equilibrium. This captures positive feedback processes where policy makers underreact and overreact with escalating force so that government attention becomes more and more distant from equilibrium public opinion. In practice, this sort of process is implausible since correction through the institution of elections would tend to curtail such disequilibrium before the disjuncture of government priorities and public opinion became too extreme.         "
"14","Third, if residuals generated from estimation of the error‐correction model are nonnormal (i.e., leptokurtic), skewed, or time dependent (i.e., heteroskedastic), this might suggest the process of equilibration is erratic or volatile, where errors either accumulate over time or for the duration of an observed period. This indicates a form of disequilibria in agenda‐opinion responsiveness, where the variables drift apart for a period of time though in some instances might revert to a long‐run equilibrium. This is consistent with theories of punctuated equilibrium since periods of drift might be attributed to the incrementalism of policy makers and public opinion. The parameters and residuals of the error‐correction framework can therefore be used to represent both linear and nonlinear processes. This enables the diagnosis of equilibration through negative feedback, such as in studies of macropolitical responsiveness, or disequilibrium through positive feedback, such as in studies of macropunctuations. Indeed, this framework provides a formal representation for the characterization of processes such as agenda expansion (Schattschneider 1960) and positive mobilization (Downs 1972).         "
"15","The punctuated equilibrium model suggests that while government policies/outputs and public attention tend to be nonstationary processes, they are drawn from aggregate nonnormal (leptokurtic) distributions.3 That is a potential concern because error‐correction models are derived under the assumption that the errors are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) normal N (0,σ2) and because least squares estimates are sensitive to departures from normality. If the leptokurtosis of input and/or output distributions produces leptokurtic and/or heteroskedastic residuals, there is a danger of misleading inferences concerning dynamics of equilibration (in particular in cases where adjustment processes are nonlinear). However, while aggregate distributions of political attention are found to be leptokurtic for particular countries, issues, and institutions (e.g., Baumgartner, Foucault, and Francois 2006; Breunig 2006; Jones et al. 1998; Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen 2003), it is possible for the long‐run moving equilibrium to remain intact, and for the estimated residuals to be i.i.d. normal, if variables drift together over time despite the presence of punctuations. In other words, if disproportionate shocks to (univariate) input or output distributions are contemporaneous, then the combined effect on the (multivariate) error‐correcting equilibrium might be i.i.d. normal as the relative distance between the variables remains stable. Nonnormal distributions of the residuals are therefore a potential indicator of positive feedback when the equilibrium state becomes unstable for periods of time.         "
"16","The measure of policymaking attention for this project is the Queen's Speech: a formal statement of the program of legislative measures that the government intends to enact in the next parliamentary session. This list of legislative proposals tends to receive the support of the legislature because of the British tradition of party discipline, where extant research finds that there is a high likelihood that these intentions are translated into policy outputs further down the policymaking chain (MacDonald and Budge 2005, 164). Such a convention of executive agenda setting is a feature of both presidential and parliamentary systems, such as the president's State of the Union Address in the United States, the presidential New Year's Address in France, and King's or Queen's Speeches in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Spain, and the Netherlands. While there is evidence of opinion‐responsiveness in symbolic rhetoric of the U.S. president (Cohen 1997), the Queen's Speech is an integral part of the legislative process in the United Kingdom. The head of state does not have a personal role in drafting the speech, which is drawn up by the government and approved by cabinet, but delivers it line by line with great solemnity at a lavish ceremony in parliament. Through this statement, the government sets out its formal program for legislative enactment in the forthcoming session of parliament, often linked to specific parts of the executive (e.g., ministries of state), as well as dealing with matters of foreign policy. Evidence on congruence of manifesto pledges, Queen's Speeches, budgetary statements, and Prorogation Speeches (i.e., the government statement at the close of each parliamentary session) confirms that the majority of specific pledges are implemented in parliament (Bara 2005). In the British context, the Queen's Speech therefore provides a valid and reliable measure of the legislative agenda and policy outputs. It also indicates priorities of policy makers in domains such as foreign policy, where the amount of expenditure or legislation does not always signal change in policy outputs.            "
"17","The text of each Queen's Speech was coded at the quasi‐sentence level for policy content according to a U.K. version of the coding framework of the Policy Agendas Project (see Table 1, http://www.policyagendas.org.uk).4 This analysis is based upon the frequency of policy statements referring to a given major topic in each speech,5 which provides an unbounded measure of legislative attention (rather than a percentage share).            "
"18","The Gallup Organization's poll question about the “most important problem” (MIP) is the most continuous time series measure of public attention to issues in both the United States (1935) and the United Kingdom (1959). This is sometimes used as an indicator of public preferences or attention (e.g., Jennings 2009; Jones and Baumgartner 2004, 2005a; MacKuen and Coombs 1981; McCombs and Shaw 1972). However, the MIP question is not perfect as a measure of the public's preference for specific policies (see Wlezien 2005). There is a significant distinction between the importance of an issue, its importance relative to other issues, and its salience; not to mention the extent to which it is considered an “issue” or a “problem.” Nonetheless, it remains the best and oldest available indicator of the public's relative prioritization of the focus of government attention and activities on particular topics.6 At worst the MIP provides an approximate measure of what is on people's minds, even if we cannot be sure how this corresponds to preferences. For public opinion to emit negative feedback like a thermostat it must be stationary (Wlezien 1995): that is, its statistical properties (i.e., mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure) remain constant over time. Opinions in previous time periods are irrelevant to feedback about the present state of affairs. It is conceivable that public attention might in some instances exhibit longer‐term persistence in extended periods of incrementalism. In other circumstances, policy makers might stimulate public attention to particular issues or policies rather than dampening it, in a form of positive feedback. For example, public concern about homeland security might increase, rather than decrease, as policy makers assign more and more attention to the issue, reinforcing public beliefs about its relative importance. At the same time, it is plausible that those same public anxieties could be reassured by announcement of legislative initiatives or executive action. As such, there is theoretical reason to suspect that it is possible for public opinion to exhibit positive, as well as negative, feedback in responsiveness to political attention. The error‐correction framework accommodates this possible coexistence of positive and negative effects, as policy makers' and public attention drift upwards or downwards together over time while the long‐run equilibrium state is maintained through corrective negative feedback.            "
"19","This analysis uses an enhanced MIP dataset compiled through its reconciliation of the surveys reported in British Political Opinion, 1937 –2000 (King and Wybrow 2001) and the original Gallup Political and Economic Index (1959–2001).7 The MIP data were coded according to the Policy Agendas framework, and response totals were standardized to equal 100 (i.e., these were equal to between 94% and 146% in the Gallup Index, but with 354 of 426 observations in the range between 98% and 102%, with a mean 101.0 and standard deviation 5.2). To calibrate agenda‐opinion dynamics, the mean of standardized responses was calculated for the parliamentary session that preceded each Queen's Speech, instead of the mean responses for each calendar year. This ensures that estimations of responsiveness refer to MIP responses that were either before or after the Queen's Speech, where specification of a lag of one calendar year is unable to model the empirical interaction between government attention and public opinion (i.e., in practice the Queen's Speech tends to be presented in October or November, so it can respond to public opinion in that calendar year or in the preceding year). As a result, no empirical data are lost because the parliamentary session is not concurrent with the calendar year. This prevents detection of responsiveness in the wrong direction where the underlying set of MIP observations is active before and after the Queen's Speech. The pattern of issue attention over time of the Queen's Speech and MIP is illustrated in Figure 2.            "

"22","From visual inspection of Figure 2, it appears that most of the Queen's Speech and the MIP series tend to drift together over time and share a similar stochastic trend. That is consistent with evidence of correspondence between government and public attention over time from the United States. The distinct similarities in trends of both government and public attention in the United Kingdom over a period of more than 40 years are themselves notable. These tend to reflect conventional wisdom on the rise and fall of certain issues on the political agenda. For example, it shows gradual increases in concern with health issues after the 1980s, spikes in attention to labor issues around the time of the “winter of discontent” in the late 1970s, an expansion of interest in economic issues between 1960 and 1980 and something of a contraction thereafter, and a decline of international affairs from the 1980s onwards due to the end of the Cold War. It also suggests that for a number of issue topics public opinion and policymaking attention coexist in a dynamic long‐run equilibrium state.            "
"23","Topics were selected where the mean for both the Queen's Speech and MIP was greater than 2% over the period between 1960 and 2001. This focuses analysis through selection of topics according to their longer‐term salience. As a result, the environment (7), energy (8), transportation (10), social welfare (13), banking, finance, and domestic commerce (15), space, science, technology, and communications (17), foreign trade (18), and government operations (20) topics are excluded from this analysis.8"
"24","In order to consider the equilibrating responsiveness of the Queen's Speech to public opinion concerning the MIP, single‐equation error‐correction models of agenda‐opinion dynamics are estimated for macroeconomic issues (ΔQS1), civil rights and immigration (ΔQS2), health (ΔQS3), labor and employment (ΔQS5), education (ΔQS6), law, crime, and family issues (ΔQS12), community development and housing (ΔQS14), defense (ΔQS16), international affairs (ΔQS19), and territorial issues (ΔQS21). These models are reported in Table 2. The results include short‐run components to measure both the contemporaneous effects of public opinion (ΔMIPt) and partisan control of government (PARTYt) on policymaking attention, a long‐run component to measure the lagged effect of public opinion (MIPt−1), and an error‐correction component (QSt−1) to capture the rate of adjustment to the long‐run equilibrium in response to disturbances. The error‐correction parameter indicates the extent of negative (or positive) feedback between the Queen's Speech and the most important problem.            "
"25","The short‐run parameters of the error‐correction models (ΔMIPt) indicate that there is a contemporaneous effect of public opinion on policymaking attention, significant at the 90% confidence level, for macroeconomic issues (QS1), health (QS3), and labor and employment issues (QS5). This finding is consistent with accounts of the dominance of economic concerns and the welfare state in the postwar British context. The long‐run parameters of the model (QSt−1) suggest that shocks are stabilized in policymaking attention as each error‐correction parameter is significant at the 99% confidence level. For example, the results for macroeconomic issues indicate that shocks to the agenda‐opinion equilibrium are corrected at a rate of 88% in the Queen's Speech (QSt−1=−0.884). Thus 12% of the initial disequilibrating shock remains after one year, 1.3% after two years, 0.001% after three years, and so on. Notably, immigration (QS2), health (QS3), and education (QS6) are topics where there is evidence of overcorrection (QSt−1 < −1), reflecting the hypersensitive nature of policy makers' attention in these domains. For education, a shock to the agenda‐opinion equilibrium is corrected at a rate of 117% (QSt−1=−1.165), with a 17% overcorrection in the first year, a 2.7% correction after two years, a 0.4% overcorrection after three years, and so on as it tends toward the long‐run equilibrium state.9"
"26","In contrast, the error‐correction parameter is weakest in defense (QS16t−1=−0.740) and international affairs (QS19t−1=−0.687). These are issues where policymaking attention might be expected to be more insulated and less responsive to shocks. Also, estimates of the effect of partisan control of government (PARTYt) are consistent with conventional wisdom: Conservative governments tend to prioritize defense (QS16) and international affairs (QS19) since the estimated parameters are negative, although the latter is not significant at the 95% confidence level, and Labour governments tend to emphasize the economy, health, labor and employment, and housing. Labour control also appears to be associated with heightened attention to law, crime, and family issues, which is somewhat counterintuitive given the Conservative's claim to be the party of law and order.            "
"27","To consider further the nature of this equilibrating dynamic, it is possible to calculate the long‐run multiplier (k1). That is the total short‐run and long‐run effect on policymaking attention of a one‐point increase in public opinion distributed over future time periods,10 where the total impact of a shock is greatest the closer the error‐correction parameter is to zero (when all other short‐run and long‐run variables are held constant). For example, a 1% increase in the public's attention to macroeconomic issues results in an additional 9.2 mentions of this topic in future Queen's Speeches (k1= 9.210). The size of the long‐run multiplier is greatest in magnitude for the education (QS6) and law and order (QS12) topics, indicating that the impact of MIP on the Queen's Speech is most sustained in these domains (although the effect is nonetheless significant in most other domains).            "
"28","As Soroka and Wlezien (2005, 668) note, this kind of representation provides a measure of responsiveness in a statistical sense, since it is conceivable that priorities of policy makers and the public might respond at the same time to exogenous variables that are not included in the model. For example, changes in economic conditions might cause government attention and public opinion to move in tandem over time, generating an appearance of responsiveness that is spurious. To control for this, the annual “misery index” (i.e., the inflation rate added to the unemployment rate) can be tested as a lagged independent variable (MISERYt−1) in each agenda‐opinion model. This is insignificant at the 95% confidence level for each of the 10 topics, so it is dropped from the results reported in Table 2.            "
"29","For macroeconomic issues (QS1), although the lagged misery index is not significant itself, its inclusion eliminates statistical significance of the short‐run effect of the MIP on the Queen's Speech (see Column 2, Table 4). This suggests economic conditions might still be a factor in agenda‐opinion responsiveness for this particular topic. What if some combination of public opinion and economic conditions drives government attention to macroeconomic issues? To consider this, an interaction term was created and included as a short‐run and long‐run variable in the model, instead of public opinion. The results are striking (see Column 3, Table 4). The short‐run and long‐run effect of the interaction term is significant at the 99% confidence level. Furthermore, the error‐correction term is equal to −1.000, suggesting perfect equilibration. This implies that policy makers are responsive to objective economic conditions as well as to public opinion, consistent with the extensive literature of economic voting. Nevertheless, it also suggests policy makers do not respond to prevailing economic conditions in isolation. Agenda‐opinion responsiveness for macroeconomic issues is not spurious even though it interacts with exogenous factors.            "
"30","The results indicate that policymaking attention does respond in a corrective, and sometimes overcorrective, dynamic to changes in public opinion concerning the most important problem facing the country. That is even though the input (MIP) and output (QS) distributions are drawn from a general distribution of percentage attention change that is leptokurtic (see Table 3). The kurtosis score is positive and equal to 9.259 for the Queen's Speech and 57.843 for the MIP, which suggests public opinion is more punctuated than policy makers' attention. This nonnormal distribution of government and public attention is confirmed by significance of the Kolmogorov‐Smirnov D statistic and the Shapiro‐Wilk W statistic, at the 95% confidence level. The long‐run multipliers indicate that changes in public opinion have a sustained impact on policymaking attention across a number of topics.            "
"31","These findings concerning agenda‐opinion responsiveness suggest equilibrium dynamics are characterized by negative feedback, despite presence of punctuations in distributions of policymaking and public attention (Table 3). As a result, there might be some doubt concerning the presence of nonlinear processes in agenda‐opinion dynamics. This might be attributed to the constitutional format of the Queen's Speech, which is subject to little institutional friction in the sense that there are few substantive constraints on changes in its content.11 However, residuals from the estimated models are indicative of some kind of nonlinear process in a few cases. While similar to the positive feedback measured with the leptokurtosis of input and output distributions, the nonnormality of the error‐correction model residuals indicates that the series drift apart as the variance fluctuates over time; where the skewness of the residuals suggests the process of equilibration is unbalanced as well as time dependent. This is illustrated in Figure 3 where the estimated residuals for the immigration topic (QS2) become more and more volatile over time. This suggests equilibrating responses of government attention to public opinion becomes more and more unreliable and volatile as errors accumulate. For territorial issues (QS21) the residuals are more volatile for a period during the 1970s, suggesting there is some drift and disequilibrium in agenda‐opinion responsiveness, but that this is corrected over time.            "

"33","The results presented here are important for a number of theoretical, methodological, and empirical reasons. First, long‐run congruence of the political agenda and public opinion provides evidence of dynamic attention‐based representation in the U.K. context, adding to findings on issue representation from the United States (Baumgartner and Jones 2004) and dynamic representation from the United Kingdom (Soroka and Wlezien 2004). The significance of the long‐run impact (k1) of public opinion on government's attention to macroeconomics (QS1), health (QS3), labor and employment (QS5), law and order (QS12), housing (QS14), and defense (QS16) is consistent with established accounts of the particularities of Britain's postwar consensus regarding expansion of the welfare state combined with a more conservative focus upon macroeconomics, defense, and law and order (Kavanagh 1987; Kavanagh and Morris 1994; Marquand 1988). In addition, the significance of short‐run effects of public opinion on the government's attention to macroeconomic issues (ΔMIP1t), labor and employment (ΔMIP5t), and health (ΔMIP3t) corresponds to those issues subject to the greatest share of public attention over time (i.e., the first, second, and third topics ranked in terms of the mean value of MIP). The degree of attention‐responsiveness is also symmetrical to public attentiveness, consistent with theoretical expectations (see Wlezien 2004). The findings for effects of partisan control of government are consistent, in most instances, with the perceived issue ownership of Labour of health, education, housing, and employment and the Conservatives of defense and international affairs. The exception is the positive effect of Labour control on policymaking attention to law and order, which is observed in the rise of crime on the political agenda since the mid‐1990s.            "
"34","Second, this evidence adds to the growing literature on macropolitical responsiveness in the United States (e.g., Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Wlezien 2004) and elsewhere (e.g., Franklin and Wlezien 1997; Hobolt and Klemmensen 2005; Jennings 2009; Soroka and Wlezien 2004, 2005), at the same time as showing that attention‐based dynamics can exhibit responsiveness to public opinion. The significance of the error‐correction parameter (α*1) for each topic confirms the long‐run equilibration of attention of successive governments on the principal concerns of British politics since 1960. As such this provides evidence of negative feedback in dynamics of government attention in the United Kingdom. In some instances, policy makers overreact to divergence from the long‐run equilibrium. This is observed in values of the error‐correction parameter for immigration, health, and education that are equal to less than −1, as well as in stochastic fluctuation in content of the Queen's Speech around a longer‐term trend illustrated in Figure 2.            "
"35","Third, the leptokurtosis of both the aggregate input and output distributions (see Table 3) suggests that the British public is subject to acute cognitive friction in its attention to the MIP, while government is subject to a degree of cognitive or institutional friction in its formulation of the Queen's Speech. Note that in some instances the kurtosis scores for individual input and output series do not suggest the presence of punctuations in government or public attention. While the format and political function of the Queen's Speech statement are not subject to formal or restrictive constraints (i.e., institutional friction), it is nonetheless surprising that public responses about the MIP tend to be far more punctuated than policymaking attention. That notwithstanding, the leptokurtosis of the aggregate distributions is consistent with the presence of positive feedback in changes in government and public attention (Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen 2003; Jones and Baumgartner 2005a, 2005b).            "
"36","Fourth, the punctuated distribution (where the kurtosis score is equal to more than 3) of residuals from the estimated error‐correction models of agenda‐opinion responsiveness for immigration (QS2), health (QS3), housing (QS14), international affairs (QS19), and territorial issues (QS21) suggests that there is an element of drift and error‐accumulation in long‐run equilibration of government attention in response to public opinion. These do not correspond in all instances to topics where both the input and output series are leptokurtic, though this is the case for the immigration, health, and territorial topics. As such, the error‐accumulation processes that are identified here are not interchangeable with punctuations in the source distributions."
"37","These empirical findings reinforce the theoretical difference between the composition of positive feedback diagnosed with the error‐correction framework and that implied in the punctuated distribution of political attention. The former is a continuous process, where feedback between public concern about the MIP and content of the Queen's Speech is estimated for the duration of the entire period between 1960 and 2001. The latter is an intermittent process manifested in short episodic bursts of positive feedback. Thus empirical claims about the relative strength of error‐correction or error‐accumulation are a function of this particular specification and measurement of feedback. The former detects negative or positive feedback in the long‐run parameter of the error‐correction model while the latter infers positive feedback from fat tails of nonnormal, leptokurtic distributions of government attention and/or public opinion. Moreover, error‐correction models refer to a multivariate moving equilibrium whereas punctuated models refer to a univariate movement between multiple equilibrium states. The evidence for the United Kingdom is therefore consistent with accounts both of equilibration (Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Wlezien 2004) and error‐accumulation (Jones and Baumgartner 2005a, 2005b).            "
"38","This article contends there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to represent the dynamic interrelationship between public opinion and government attention in the form of an error‐correction model. The data presented here on 10 of the dominant topics of government and public attention in the United Kingdom for the period between 1960 and 2001 provide a test of attention‐based macroresponsiveness: that is, the effect of public opinion concerning the most important problem facing the country (the MIP) on British government's attention to specific issues in the legislative agenda it sets out in the Queen's Speech. There is evidence of responsiveness of political attention in the United Kingdom: short‐run effects of public opinion for the macroeconomics, health, and labor and employment topics and sustained long‐run effects (as estimated from the long‐run multiplier) for macroeconomics, health, labor and employment, education, law and order, housing, and defense. While the long‐run equilibration of political attention is observable from significance of the error‐correction parameters, there is evidence of drift and disequilibria in leptokurtic distribution of the estimated residuals for immigration, health, housing, international affairs, and territorial issues where the errors accumulate and are absorbed into the long‐run equilibrium. These counter‐opposed forces of equilibrium and disequilibrium are not perfectly symmetrical according to topic since the error‐correction parameters remain significant even when the residuals are punctuated and therefore reveal drift in the long‐run equilibrium. At the same time, leptokurtosis of aggregate input (public opinion) and output (government attention) distributions suggests the presence of positive feedback due to extreme disturbances in the fat tails."
"39","These findings demonstrate how negative and positive feedback, and equilibrium and disequilibrium, are relevant, coexistent, and important characteristics of the relationship between public opinion and government attention in a modern democracy. While institutional characteristics of the parliamentary system in the United Kingdom might be expected to generate some differences in responsiveness to public opinion as well as punctuations of attention in comparison with other political systems, extant research suggests that both macropunctuations and macroresponsiveness are a matter of degree (see Baumgartner, Foucault, and François 2006; Breunig 2006; Soroka and Wlezien 2004, 2005), rather than direction.         "
"40","Models and methodologies that incorporate equilibrium and disequilibrium are ideal for the analysis of attention‐based political responsiveness. The error‐correction framework is appropriate for modelling feedback and equilibrium relationships in stationary as well as nonstationary data (Banerjee, Dolado, and Galbraith 1993; Davidson and MacKinnon 1993; De Boef and Keele 2008). This model specification enables investigation of short‐run and long‐run effects and measures negative or positive feedback through the value of the error‐correction parameter. It draws further inferences of negative or positive feedback from leptokurtosis of the aggregate input and output distributions, as well as from the model residuals. For the aggregate distributions, negative feedback processes are exhibited in incrementalism in a tall slender peak while positive feedback processes are observed in punctuations in the fat tails. For model residuals, drift and disequilibrium are manifested in accumulation of errors as responses of government or the public become volatile at particular points in time. The combination of an error‐correction framework with tests for leptokurtosis enables diagnosis of different forms of positive feedback, providing a sophisticated theorization of sources of both equilibration and punctuations in macropolitical models. This provides insight on different feedback processes through which governments adjust in a corrective fashion to short‐run or long‐run movements in public opinion or otherwise lurch between different equilibrium points as errors accumulate as a result of institutional or cognitive friction.         "
"41","This model specification provides new insights on distinctive implications of accounts of macroresponsiveness and macropunctuations that have to date tended to operate in separate spheres. While punctuated equilibrium in government attention and public opinion might, at first, seem at odds with notions of macroresponsiveness and processes of continuous equilibration, the error‐correction framework illustrates how both policy makers' and public attention can coexist in a moving equilibrium, despite the presence of punctuations. The longstanding differences between these models of macropolitics therefore appear to arise because of a number of factors. First, it is plausible that there are empirical differences in the degree of error‐accumulation and error‐correction for dynamic representation of leftward or rightward shifts in the public mood (e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002) relative to government allocation of attention (e.g., Jones and Baumgartner 2004, 2005a). This might be attributed to differences in the electoral consequences of effective processing of information signals about public preferences compared with issue attention. Second, these conceive negative and positive feedback in different forms: as a continuous process for models of macroresponsiveness and an intermittent process for the punctuated equilibrium model. This contrast in these accounts of macropolitics might therefore be attributed to the particularities of model specification and empirical measurement. Third, studies of macroresponsiveness consider a multivariate moving equilibrium between government policies and public opinion whereas studies of macropunctuations consider univariate movement between multiple (punctuated) equilibrium states. For these reasons, and in light of the empirical evidence presented here, further comparative investigation is required into the degree of responsiveness of political attention in the presence of nonnormal input and output distributions in contexts outside the United States and United Kingdom.
