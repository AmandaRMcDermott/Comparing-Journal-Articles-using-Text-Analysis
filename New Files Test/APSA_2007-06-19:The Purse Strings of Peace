"1","The commercial peace literature exhibits great variation in identifying which characteristics of commerce restrain war. One strand focuses on the aggregate benefits of international trade as an important cause of peace. Because military hostilities often constrict this exchange, high levels of international trade promote peace either by deterring a government from entering a war or by enabling political officials to send costly, but credible signals of resolve in a diplomatic crisis (e.g., Gartzke, Li, and Boehmer 2001; Oneal and Russett 1997, 1999; Reed 2003; Russett and Oneal 2001).         "
"2","This segment of the literature has frequently been criticized for its failure to examine how domestic interests and institutions filter the pressures of competitive international markets before producing foreign policy outputs (Barbieri and Schneider 1999; Mansfield and Pollins 2003; McMillan 1997; Schneider and Schulze 2003; Simmons 2003; Stein 1993, 2003). By focusing on the aggregate consequences of commerce, such explanations of commercial liberalism rely to a varying degree on the unitary actor assumption that neglects processes within the state and concentrates instead on how external constraints, such as the degree of national economic integration into the global economy, shape foreign policy choices.         "
"3","Partly in response to this criticism, a second strand of this literature looks inside states to examine the domestic process by which economic exchange within or between societies leads governments to pursue more peaceful foreign policies. Brawley (1993) maintains that mercantilist policies associated with imperialism and military conflict are much less likely to arise in democracies. Free‐trading interests tend to defeat imperialists in open domestic political competition. Drawing on the selectorate model (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 1999, 2003), Gelpi and Grieco (2003) argue that democratic leaders are more sensitive to the economic costs of trade disruption in the event of conflict and thus more likely to avoid military disputes. Consequently, economic interdependence promotes peace only among democratic states. Similarly, Papayoanou (1999) claims that the constraining effects of interdependence depend on whether institutions, such as democracy, integrate the median voter—who is likely to gain from international trade—into the domestic policymaking process. McDonald (2004) links the domestic distributional implications of trade to the potential for peace. International trade promotes peace when free‐trading interests enjoy more domestic political influence. Mousseau (2000, 2005) and Mousseau, Hegre, and Oneal (2003) argue that as economic behavior becomes more regularized over time, norms based on trust and mutual respect for contractual obligations evolve within developed societies helping to resolve disputes through negotiation and compromise. By supporting democratic consolidation and societal constraints on executive authority, these contractual norms restrict the democratic peace to developed states.1 Similarly, Weede (1995) argues that the prosperity caused by capitalism leads to democratization, which in turn builds a zone of peace among democratic states.         "
"4","Both of these internal and external variants expect profit‐maximizing firms or business organizations to play an important role in the process by which market exchange pushes governments to adopt peaceful foreign policies. In the opportunity costs model, states opt for peace to avoid the economic losses associated with a halt in international commerce. In the bargaining model, the economic costs imposed by profit‐oriented firms responding to the threat of war enable governments to signal resolve and reach a negotiated compromise."
"5","What happens if many firms, or at least those in key sectors or industries, are state‐owned and thus not subject to the same budget and cost constraints as envisioned in capitalist economies? State‐owned corporations often act as political firms that do not face hard budget constraints and are responsible for maximizing employment and social stability rather than profits. Should the fear of lost profits lead these firms to advocate peace or do they instead expect that their ties to the state will generate compensation for any lost market opportunities following from war? The rest of this article explores these questions by investigating whether an alternative source of domestic variation—the structure of ownership inside the domestic economy—influences the capacity of commercial exchange to reduce military conflict between states."
"6","If Kant's Perpetual Peace provides the classical foundation for much of the contemporary work on the liberal peace, these insights can be extended with the writings of David Ricardo. In his Essay on the Funding System, Ricardo's concern over the size of the British public debt in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars led him to explore the links between financing war and the potential for peace.2 He wrote, “There cannot be a greater security for the continuance of peace, than the imposing on ministers the necessity of applying to the people for taxes to support a war ([1820] 1951, 197).” Upon the onset of conflict, the immediate imposition of an income tax would carry important economic and political consequences. Anticipating the economic costs of international conflict, citizens would begin to save for war. Consumed in wartime, these savings would minimize the postconflict costs of repaying war debt and allow the economy to reach normal consumption levels when military hostilities ceased. Politically, it would prevent the citizenry from passing the costs of war onto future generations while depriving the state of a discretionary reserve that could be tapped for aggressive conquest.         "
"7","These arguments suggest an important extension of the contemporary liberal peace literature. A government's need and ability to secure private sector resources to finance the construction of a war machine capable of defending territory, projecting national power, and even conquering other states can shape its decisions for war and the character of its foreign policy. By forcing the state to rely on the private sector for revenue and simultaneously restricting its ability to tax or seize these assets, individuals in society can be empowered to establish a more pacific foreign policy."
"8","A wide variety of scholarship in comparative political economy argues that public revenue needs shape the structure of domestic institutions and the character of state‐society relations. Neoclassical theories of the state (e.g., Eggertsson 1990; Levi 1988; North 1981) claim that governments can extend their authority in both the domestic and international environments as their ability to mobilize the wealth of society increases. Margaret Levi writes:         "
"9","                        "
"10","One major limitation on rule is revenue, the income of the government. The greater the revenue of the state, the more possible it is to extend rule. Revenue enhances the ability of rulers to elaborate the institutions of the state, to bring more people within the domain of those institutions, and to increase the number and variety of collective goods provided through the state. (1988, 2)"
"11","For example, states possessing large natural resource endowments, such as oil and minerals, often derive substantial revenues upon nationalizing these assets and avoid demands for accountability associated with alternative systems of public finance that rely instead on the imposition of taxes (Weinthal and Jones Luong 2006). Ross (2001) finds that oil and mineral wealth are associated with authoritarian regimes. Conversely, Bates (2001) and Ross (2004) link the presence of democracy to government demand for revenue. Citizens request and receive greater representation and influence over policy as governments rely on more of their wealth to fund public expenditures.         "
"12","Large quantities of public property serve as an independent source of revenue that strengthens the state and insulates it from societal pressures. If a state owned all of the resources within an economy, it would not need to surrender authority or subject itself to greater societal oversight to generate revenue. Privatization necessarily reduces the amount of resources owned by the state and forces it to extract more wealth from society to hold expenditures constant. Kiser (1986/87) argues that relative distribution of resources between public and private actors is the crucial determinant of state autonomy. Examining the absolutist era in European history, he notes that expanded property holdings empowered monarchs by decreasing their reliance on parliamentary approval for funding public policies like war. Similarly, Barnett writes:         "
"13","                        "
"14","Because the state is institutionally separated from organized production, it does not produce its own source of revenue. Therefore, all state managers must be attentive to and are constrained by the flow of resources upon which the deployment of the state's means depends. The state's ability either to develop alternative sources of financial means or to loosen its dependence on the capitalist class substantially increases its autonomy. (1990, 538)"
"15"," Levi (1988, 19) echoes the logic of these arguments by noting the relative bargaining power of a ruler attempting to raise revenue is enhanced as its dependence on the economic resources of its constituents is reduced. In short, the ability of the state to rely on sources of wealth that its citizenry does not own increases its autonomy and limits societal influence over public policy.         "
"16","If large quantities of publicly owned property create fiscal autonomy for governments and fundamentally shape how governments interact with their citizenry, they should simultaneously influence policymaking. Here I explore these possibilities through the selectorate theory developed by Bueno de Mesquita et al. (1999, 2003, 2004). It attributes the peace among democratic states to their selective engagement in war. Dependent on large winning coalitions to remain in office, democratic officials are often removed for policy failures, such as defeat in war. Consequently, democracies enter wars only when extremely confident of victory. Instead of exploring how policies vary with the size of winning coalitions, I utilize their insights to explore how policies may respond to different systems of public finance. I show how heavily privatized economies create incentives for politicians to act as if they depended on large winning coalitions to remain in office. Just as Bueno de Mesquita et al. argue that politicians with small winning coalitions (autocrats) are more likely to engage in military conflicts, I argue that politicians relying on substantial public assets to fund their policies are more likely to engage in military conflicts.         "
"17","Selectorate theory assumes that politicians value retaining their hold on domestic power above other goals. An incumbent accomplishes this by disbursing a larger combination of resources to members of his or her winning coalition than can be credibly promised by a political challenger. Incumbents distribute two types of benefits: public goods, such as security from external threats, which are consumed by all members of the polity; and private benefits, such as subsidies, direct payments, or privileged access to government contracts, which flow only to those members of the government's winning coalition.         "
"18","Winning coalition size (W) shapes the cost that leaders must pay for private goods (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 91) and helps determine their relative spending decisions. Assuming a fixed pool of resources (R) controlled by an incumbent that can be used to supply public and private benefits, the fraction (R/W) influences the size of potential equal disbursements of private benefits to each member of the winning coalition (W). As (W) grows larger (i.e., as the polity grows more democratic), this fraction shrinks and the quantity of private goods received by any single member of the winning coalition declines. Declining private benefits raise the relative importance of public goods consumption in the decision calculus by members of the winning coalition as to whether to continue supporting an incumbent. Consequently, larger winning coalitions shrink private goods receipts and encourage incumbents to devote more resources to the provision of public goods in their efforts to remain in power.         "
"19","These pressures linking winning coalition size to public goods provision shape decisions on the use of military force as an instrument of foreign policy. Victory on the battlefield creates opportunities to provide public benefits, such as eliminating an important threat to national security, that are consumed by all members of the polity. However, ensuring victory often requires an incumbent to divert discretionary resources to the war effort and away from private benefit spending, which subsequently jeopardizes an incumbent's ability to remain in office.3 Leaders with small winning coalitions generally forego additional investments in military victory and instead opt to reward their supporters when facing this dilemma. By doling out large quantities of private benefits, their capacity to remain in office depends less on the war's outcome and more on continuity in the delivery of these benefits. This domestic strength reduces the risks of being deposed after military defeat and encourages leaders with small winning coalitions to enter more wars. These domestic incentives simultaneously encourage them to divert fewer resources away from private benefits spending to achieve victory. This lower war effort then influences the strategic game with international adversaries. Hesitation to expend extra resources in war makes leaders with small winning coalitions attractive targets to predators in the international system.         "
"20","Political officials with large winning coalitions are more attuned to the provision of public goods and public policy failures. Expecting to be removed from office after being defeated in war, democratic leaders only enter wars when extremely confident of victory. And once participating, they devote more public resources to the war effort to ensure victory. Peace among democratic states, i.e., those with large winning coalitions, flows from their relative hesitation to wage war against powerful adversaries and the unwillingness of many states to attack democracies because of the latter's tendency to contribute more resources to victory."
"21","Winning coalition size (W) is just one component in the size of private benefits flowing to members of the winning coalition. The total pool of resources (R) controlled by an incumbent also shapes private benefit payouts (R/W) and, along with them, variations in public policy. Bueno de Mesquita et al. assume that revenues (R) are generated by taxing the economic activity of polity members. Total revenue (R) equals the taxation rate (r) multiplied by the overall level of economic activity (E) in an economy (R = rE). Governments face a dilemma when setting the tax rate. If the marginal tax rate is too high, citizens devote more time to leisure activities, reduce their individual contribution to aggregate economic activity (E), and simultaneously shrink the total pool of resources (R) that governments rely on to fund public expenditures. However, not all governments face this dilemma in the same fashion. Many governments possess large quantities of publicly owned assets that relieve them of having to tax the incomes of private individuals directly. As the previous section discussed, these differences in public finance can shape such domestic political characteristics as autonomy and regime type, and subsequently influence decisions for war and peace."
"22","The addition of a component (P) to indicate government revenues derived from public assets illustrates how this fiscal autonomy eases the difficulty of remaining in office and alters the mix of spending between public and private goods. For example, if the relative size of private benefit disbursements to the winning coalition no longer equals (R/W) but instead equals (R + P)/W, we see how state‐owned assets (P > 0) increase the total pool of discretionary resources available to government officials. Public assets are unique in that they are already owned and controlled by the government. Unlike decisions on taxation, government officials do not withhold a portion of private sector wealth to gain access to the pool of societal resources. As public resources grow, governments can increase private benefit payouts without increasing taxation rates on private economic activity. This financial autonomy enables governments to continue to supply large private benefits to members of the winning coalition and simultaneously insulates them from pressures to expand public goods production to remain in office.            "
"23","The state's control over key resources allows it to redistribute wealth within the economy toward political supporters (members of the winning coalition), tie significant portions of society to their survival in office, and prevent the emergence of active opposition to its policies. For example, in a study of state‐owned enterprises in Egypt, India, Turkey, and Mexico, Waterbury (1993) argues that such public resources strengthen regime stability by building broad‐based coalitions of support, including labor, which depend on such benefits as lifetime employment and guaranteed supply contracts. When publicly held firms constitute a large portion of national product, even private firms come to depend on business transactions conducted with them.            "
"24","One recent example of these dynamics can be seen in Venezuela. Rather than forcing Hugo Chavez to resign, a general strike in December 2002 led by management at PdVSA, Venezuela's state‐owned oil firm, instead allowed him to reorganize the firm, purge management that had opposed his regime, and establish his control over it. Chavez has successfully funneled oil profits into massive social spending programs that expanded his base of support among groups struck by poverty and previously left out of Venezuelan politics. These programs helped Chavez achieve victory in a recall referendum of August 2004 (Gott 2005). Moreover, control over these revenues has enabled Chavez to cultivate regional and global influence by subsidizing oil sales to neighboring states in the Caribbean and South America, modernizing the military with significant arms purchases, and building a new reservist army that could eventually number two million.4"
"25","How does such financial autonomy influence decisions for military conflict? Bueno de Mesquita et al. argue that coalition size determines how hard politicians try to achieve victory in war. Small‐coalition leaders are hesitant to divert resources from private goods spending to the war effort because their ability to remain in office depends less on victory than on the continued ability to provide these benefits. In comparing the limiting cases of whether to spend all of their discretionary resources on the war or spend it all instead on private benefits, they show that politicians choose an all‐out effort when W > R (2003, 234). As coalition size grows (W), politicians devote more discretionary resources to outlays that increase the probability of military victory. This increased effort level simultaneously makes large coalition states less attractive targets."
"26","Given this relationship between winning coalition size and the total pool of resources controlled by government officials, the converse proposition also holds. As (R) increases, politicians are simultaneously less willing to engage in an all‐out effort in war. Large quantities of state‐owned assets increase the total pool of economic resources controlled by politicians and enhance their ability to provide private benefits to members of their winning coalition. These domestic dynamics decouple the regime's capacity to remain in office from its performance in war and lead it to spend less on the war effort. Reduced effort levels render these states more attractive targets for military conflict.5"
"27","Because autocratic survival in office depends largely on their ability to provide private benefits and not on their performance in war, they require lower thresholds of victory before entering a war. These thresholds are again shaped by the size of (R/W) (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 269–72). Large private benefits payments (high R/W) reduce the risk of being ejected from office after a foreign policy failure. Governments with large quantities of resources (R) can distribute large private benefits to members of the winning coalition. This helps them hold office even after defeat in war and subsequently reduces the threshold of victory they need to reach before entering a conflict. Just as small winning coalitions make leaders more willing to gamble on war, large quantities of public resources that increase revenues (R) make governments more willing to gamble on war and initiate military conflicts.            "
"28","Egyptian foreign policy under Nasser illustrates how public property can simultaneously strengthen a regime and enable it to pursue aggressive foreign policies. Upon removing King Faruk from power in 1952, Nasser's Revolutionary Command Council pursued a sustained policy of nationalization until 1966 that led to massive redistribution of land holdings, limited the political influence of the old landowning elite, placed major industrial firms and most of the banking sector under state control, and substantially reduced foreign holdings, including the Suez Canal, in the Egyptian economy. Waterbury writes, “Dismantling the upper reaches of the private sector therefore contributed directly and commensurately to regime strength by placing the levers of economic control in its hands. With this control he (Nasser) could better defend Egypt's stature among Arabs through a regional policy founded on aggressive Arabism and socialism” (1983, 78).6 During his reign from 1952 until 1970, Nasser's attempts to curtail the influence of imperialist powers and extend his influence in the Middle East would contribute to Egyptian participation in three wars: the war over the Suez in 1956, the Yemeni civil war of 1962 to 1967, and the Six‐Day War of 1967. During this same period, Egypt participated in 39 new militarized disputes, 10 of which involved at least one battle death.7 The near constant militarization of Egyptian foreign policy illustrates what selectorate theory would identify as a low threshold for entering conflict. Finally, the links between risk acceptance toward war and Nasser's efforts to build a strong base of domestic support that enabled his political survival are perhaps best demonstrated by his capacity to remain in office following the disastrous defeat of 1967.            "
"29","In sum, governments possessing large quantities of public property will behave like those responsible to small winning coalitions. As the pool of public property grows, governments possess more resources to bolster their domestic political position. Such financial resources decouple survival in office from foreign policy performance and encourage governments to initiate military conflict. Moreover, these same pressures lead governments with substantial public assets to reduce their efforts in wartime and make them more attractive targets in international contests. In short, governments with large quantities of publicly owned assets are more likely to engage in military conflict. At the same time, governments overseeing heavily privatized economies should be more pacific."
"30","This article began with a critique of the commercial peace literature. The capacity of market‐oriented exchange to promote peace depends crucially on the extent to which governments control this exchange. Instead of focusing on international trade to test how commerce promotes peace, these arguments suggest the need to look inside the domestic economy to see how the relative balance of public and private property alters state‐society relations and government decisions to use military force. The remainder of this article tests whether the scope of public property in an economy alters the propensity of states to engage in military conflict."
"31","The use of selectorate theory here leads to a focus on how internal economic structure shapes a government's foreign policy, particularly its willingness to deploy military force to promote its national interests. The domestic political insulation created by fiscal autonomy heightens the risks of deploying military force relative to all states in the international system. These domestic pressures operate independently of the domestic political or economic conditions in other states. Consequently, the hypothesis that greater quantities of public property increase the probability of a state's participation in interstate conflict is tested with a monadic research design. It utilizes the state‐year, or each year that a state is a member of the international system, as the unit of analysis.8 All states in the international system are included in the sample. The temporal domain spans from 1970 to 2001.            "
"32","High levels of public property raise a government's willingness to deploy military force by influencing the domestic political process by which it mobilizes economic wealth and then uses these assets to implement policies and strengthen its rule. To construct a valid measurement that captures this link between public ownership and public finance, I rely on data that distinguishes among different sources of government revenue for a wide range of countries across time. The IMF's Government Finance Statistics and the World Bank's World Development Indicators (IMF 2001; World Bank 2002) both carry information on the distribution of public revenue. Their breakdown of revenue sources includes categories for income taxes, sales or consumption taxes, tariffs, foreign aid, and public property. One class of revenue is labeled nontax revenue. It measures the proportion of annual receipts that are derived from a government's sale of its property, profits from state‐owned enterprises, interest from financial assets owned by the government, dividends from public ownership in corporations, rents from leasing natural resources, and administrative fees.9 I utilize this statistic to measure the size of public property within a domestic economy. Higher values of nontax revenue are taken to indicate a greater availability of public enterprises in the domestic economy that can be tapped to fund public policies. While this variable is not a direct indicator of the distribution of assets in a domestic economy between the public and private sectors, it directly measures the state's dependence on its own property to implement its public spending priorities. Given the use of selectorate theory and my subsequent focus on public revenues as shaping incentives for military conflict, this measurement provides a crucial indicator of variation in public finance regimes. Higher values of nontax revenue indicate relatively lower private contributions to the state's treasury and thus more autonomy for the government in the policymaking process.            "
"33","I construct the variable named PUBLIC from this data on nontax revenues. It measures the annual proportion of public revenues generated from publicly owned assets.10 As is generally standard in the quantitative literature in international relations, economic correlates of conflict are measured in the year prior to which the presence or absence of military conflict is observed to account for any potential endogeneity. I expect PUBLIC to be positively related to military conflict.            "
"34","The size of the sample under investigation is largely a function of data availability for both PUBLIC and the indicator for military conflict. Data for nontax revenue are available beginning in 1970. The sample spans until 2001, the last year with data on military conflict. Over this period, the number of states in the international system for any given year ranges from 139 to 191. Because some states have ceased to exist (e.g., Czechoslovakia, East Germany, South Vietnam) over this same period, there are potentially 197 states that could have entered this sample at least once. Within the sample, 144 countries have at least one annual observation. There are a total of 2782 annual observations in subsequent regression models. For the countries that are completely absent from the sample, this missing data is most pronounced for two regions—the Caribbean and Oceania. Of the 53 countries in the sample that do not have any data for PUBLIC, nine come from the Caribbean (out of a potential 13 countries in the region) and 10 come from Oceania (out of a potential 15 in the region). Thus while data problems make it difficult to test for any relationship in the Caribbean and Oceania, other regions in the world have relatively strong data coverage.11 As shown in the appendix, the average value for PUBLIC is 0.16 and the median value is 0.116.            "
"35","The primary dependent variable, a government's propensity to use military force, is measured by drawing on the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data set.12 By enabling a government to deflect domestic political opposition to risky foreign policies, higher quantities of public property raise the likelihood that a government will participate in military conflict. This proclivity should also operate even if the government is already engaged in another military dispute or has already participated in a separate military dispute in the same calendar year. Many studies of the liberal peace literature utilize the dyad year as the unit of analysis in which the presence of a single militarized dispute between two countries in a given year is quite rare and multiple disputes within that same dyad are even less frequent. When switching the unit of analysis to a state year, annual participation in a dispute is a much more common event. A state participates in at least one militarized dispute in over 30% of the observations in the sample. States participate in multiple disputes annually in approximately 10% of the cases. To avoid throwing out this information that is partly a function of the focus on states as the unit of analysis, the primary dependent variable (MIDONSYR) counts the number of new military disputes a state enters in a year.13"
"36","To ensure the robustness of any significant relationship between public property and conflict, I also add a series of control variables to the baseline regression models. Given robust support in the liberal peace literature for a democratic distinctiveness in the decision to engage in military conflict (e.g., Benoit 1996; Russett and Oneal 2001), I control for the regime's level of democracy. Drawing on the Polity 4 data set, a democracy value for each state is constructed by subtracting the autocracy score from the democracy score of regimes (Jaggers and Gurr 1995). Ranging in value from 10 to –10, DEMOCRACY is measured at time t−1.14"
"37","Most variants of commercial liberalism hold that increasing levels of international trade between states tend to reduce the onset of military conflict. I include OPEN in the regression models to control for the potential role played by large flows of international trade in constraining military conflict. OPEN equals the total quantity of a country's exports and imports divided by its gross domestic product. The data for OPEN is measured at time t−1 using constant prices and is taken from version 6.1 of the Penn World Tables (Summers and Heston 1991; Heston, Summers, and Aten 2002).15"
"38","Numerous realist arguments suggest power is a key determinant of national influence and willingness to use force in international politics. Consequently, we should expect that the most powerful states in the international system should have more broadly defined interests, be more capable of defending these interests, and more likely to engage in military disputes. I control for this possibility by including GREATPOWER—a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 when a state is defined as great power by the COW project. I expect its relationship to conflict will be positive."
"39","I also include a control variable for geographic conditions that might contribute to the outbreak of disputes. As states become closer to each other, they are more likely to have territorial disagreements and have more opportunities for interactions that can become conflictual. CONTIGUOUS COUNT counts the number of states that a given country directly borders by land or by water.16 The source of this definition and data are Stinnett et al. (2002).            "
"40","The following baseline model was tested in the initial set of monadic tests:17"
"41","               "
"42","Because the central hypothesis examines how public property shapes the likelihood of a state's decision to use military force, I draw on and blend the estimating choices of Benoit (1996)18 and Reiter and Tillman (2002), two examples of monadic research designs in the liberal peace literature. Because the dependent variable cannot take on negative values, ordinary least‐squares estimation would be inappropriate. It would likely predict occasionally negative counts over the entire range of the independent variables. Like Benoit, I employ a regression model for event counts. I also adopt the general estimating equation (GEE) techniques followed in Reiter and Tillman (2002). GEE allows the modeling of a number of sources of correlation, including temporal and within panel (states in this case), common to time‐series cross‐sectional designs (Zorn 2001). The combination of these two research designs yields a general estimating equation with a negative binomial functional link.19 To account for the possibility that the count of disputes in one year affect the count in subsequent years, I model the data as following a first‐order autoregressive process (AR1). Moreover, robust standard errors clustered by country were estimated and subsequently used for tests of statistical significance.            "
"43"," Table 1 displays a series of statistical tests drawing on this basic framework. The baseline model (1) is displayed in the first column. These results confirm the hypothesis linking higher levels of public property in an economy to a greater willingness by governments to engage in military conflict. The positive and statistically significant coefficient on PUBLIC in column 1 indicates that larger quantities of public assets in an economy increase the number of militarized disputes a government enters in a year. Alternatively, as the size of the private sector increases (and PUBLIC declines), governments enter fewer military disputes annually.            "
"44","The coefficients on the control variables largely conform to previous findings in the quantitative IR literature. CONTIGUOUS COUNT exhibits a positive effect on a state's involvement in military conflict. As a country borders more countries, it has more opportunities to engage in territorial conflict and is likely to be involved in more disputes. The positive and significant coefficient on GREATPOWER illustrates that the most powerful states enter more military disputes each year than all other states."
"45","The results for the traditional liberal peace variables—democracy and trade—are mixed. While the coefficient on DEMOCRACY is negative, it fails to achieve statistical significance. Democratic states are just as likely to engage in military conflict as other regime types.20 The negative and consistently significant coefficient on OPEN confirms the findings of Domke (1988) that integration into the world economy also limits conflict. Despite the empirical literature's focus on dyads, the commercial peace generated by trade is not restricted to pairs of states. Greater quantities of imports and exports as a percentage of GDP reduce a state's participation in military disputes.            "
"46","To ensure that these results linking public finance to conflict are robust to alternative estimating choices, omitted variables from the baseline model, and different operationalizations of the dependent variable, I also ran an additional set of regressions. These can be seen in the final four columns of Table 1.            "
"47","The second model of Table 1 controls for temporal correlation in the onset of disputes. The outbreak of a large number of disputes in one year may increase the number of disputes a state enters in the following year. It adds a lagged endogenous variable to the right‐hand side of the equation that equals the count of military disputes a state entered at time t−1. This coefficient on previous conflict (MIDONSYRt‐1) is positive and statistically significant. Its inclusion has very little impact on the remaining independent variables. All the variables that were statistically significant in the first model are again significant. With the exception of GREATPOWER, most remaining coefficients retain the same size as when the lagged endogenous variable is dropped from the model. Most importantly, even while controlling previous military disputes, greater quantities of public property again increase a state's participation in military conflicts.            "
"48","Recent studies (Boehmer and Sobek 2005; Mousseau 2000, 2005) focusing on development identify a third set of mechanisms (in addition to international commerce and the relative distribution of property in an economy) linking commerce to peace. To ensure that the findings linking the distribution of property rights to conflict are not explained by development levels, I add DEVELOPMENT to the baseline regression. This variable is calculated by taking the natural log of a country's annual gross domestic product divided by its total population.21 These results are displayed in column 3 of Table 1. The coefficient on DEVELOPMENT is positive but insignificant. The coefficient on PUBLIC again remains positive and significant. Even while controlling for this third mechanism linking commerce to peace, high levels of public property still independently increase the likelihood that a government will enter military conflict.

"49","This regression is particularly important in rejecting an alternative hypothesis often associated with capitalism. If private ownership of property is associated with economic growth and higher levels of national wealth, then governments overseeing capitalist economies could face fewer hurdles to mobilization because they possess greater pools of societal resources with which to implement a bold or aggressive foreign policy. Even while controlling for these possibilities by incorporating a variable measuring economic development, large quantities of public property still independently raise the likelihood of military conflict.22"
"50","To ensure that these results are robust to alternative estimation techniques, model 4 alters the coding of the dependent variable to indicate whether any level of military conflict is present and tests the relationship of PUBLIC on conflict with logistic regression.23 Instead of counting the number of new disputes a state enters, the dependent variable here, MIDON, simply takes on a value of 1 if the state enters a new dispute in a year. If the state does not enter any new disputes, MIDON receives a value of 0. Apart from testing the effects of PUBLIC with a method of estimation that is more common to the recent liberal peace literature, this alternative specification offers another benefit. It insures against the possibility that the significant results in the count models are driven by a small number of outlying cases in which a few states with high quantities of public property engaged in a large quantity of disputes in a year. Here these instances in which states enter a large number of disputes are treated the same as if a state entered a single dispute. The positive and significant coefficient on PUBLIC demonstrates again that greater quantities of state‐owned assets increase the likelihood that a state will engage in military conflict in a given year.

"51","Another potential criticism stems from any relationship between public property and regime type. If democracies have lower quantities of public property, the statistical relationship between public property and conflict may result from indirect links between democracy and peace. To ensure the presence of an independent effect of public property on military conflict, I tested for this possibility by using residual, rather than observed, values for PUBLIC. I first ran an OLS regression (not shown) utilizing PUBLIC (measured at time t) as the dependent variable and DEMOCRACY (measured at time t−1) as the only independent variable. The predicted values for PUBLIC from this initial regression were then subtracted from the observed values for PUBLIC. These residuals were used to operationalize PUBLIC in the baseline regression. This specification allows me to purge any indirect links between democracy and military conflict from the PUBLIC score and the subsequent regression. The remaining value can thus test for any direct link between PUBLIC and military conflict.24 These results are shown in model 5 of Table 1. The positive and significant coefficient on PUBLIC strengthens confidence in the general result linking public property to higher levels of military conflict. The pacifying effects of private property are not solely explained by democracy's capacity to promote economic liberalization.            "
"52","This article extends the commercial peace literature by examining how the structure of the domestic economy shapes a government's decision to engage in military force. It utilizes the scope of public property to assess government capacity to restrict the role of markets in allocating scarce resources and organize social behavior within the domestic economy. Drawing on selectorate theory and work in comparative political economy, it examined how large quantities of public property could strengthen government discretion in foreign policy by creating fiscal autonomy. By increasing the pool of resources that governments do not extract from the private sector, public property serves as an important source of revenue that can enhance a government's capacity to remain in office and achieve its policy goals. Governments possessing substantial quantities of public property can build domestic coalitions of support behind aggressive foreign policies or deflect political opposition to the use of military force. In a fashion similar to autocracies that are responsive only to small winning coalitions, governments possessing substantial quantities of public property enter more military disputes than governments with more liberal property rights regimes."
"53","These arguments carry broader implications for the role played by capitalism in shaping the foreign policies of states (Gartzke 2007). Comparative economists (e.g., Kornai 2000) often assess the level of capitalism in an economy according to three institutional traits: the allocation of scarce resources through competitive markets, rather than bureaucratic authorities; the presence of a government commitment to respect private property; and the predominance of private ownership of property within an economy. If the absence of large amounts of government‐owned property is one of the defining attributes of capitalism, then these results suggest that capitalism generally pacifies a country's foreign policy and consequently promotes peace in the international system.
