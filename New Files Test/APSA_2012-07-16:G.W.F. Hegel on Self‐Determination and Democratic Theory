"1","The three contemporary theories of democracy disagree about all manner of cultural and political goods and policies, but they agree about one foundational issue. Grounding each view is that individual and collective subjects should have the right to determine for themselves their own good. The aggregative conception, for instance, presumes that the “preferences” of subjects are valuable and should serve as the foundation for competitive elections. Deliberative democracy prizes, in Habermas’ terms, collective “will‐formation” alongside individual autonomy, while agonistic democracy upholds the liberation of marginalized subjects to determine their own fates.9 In other words, these theories share a view that the subject is the basis or ultimate authority grounding the norms governing the subjects themselves, and that the people as the collective subject should determine the laws binding on them.         "
"2","It is no accident that self‐determination grounds these theories ultimately, as it is, Hegel argues, the cardinal feature of modern life simply.10 When properly articulated, self‐determination consists of such perennial modern goals as (a) the self‐liberation of humanity from an excessive dependence on nature and on self‐made conventional illusions and (b) the creation of a human world in which humanity can be self‐reliant and self‐determining.11 Hegel contrasts this view of the modern subject with the ancient understanding.12 For the ancients, tradition, God, or nature was the authority grounding the norms binding on subjects, and these very same authorities established an objective purpose for subjects to live up to. For the ancients, then, the task of government was to cultivate the good life for its citizenry according to some objective principle of the good life. Accordingly, the ancient polis engaged in a rigorous form of education, understood in the comprehensive sense of the shaping of the individual soul to fulfill a part within the common whole to help realize an objective good. The moderns reject the notion that there is an objective good dictated by nature, God, or tradition.13 Instead, the human subject is free from such external determinations and rather determines for itself what its good is. Of course, Hegel does not mean that all individuals actually do engage in such self‐determination—there are plenty of regimes and individuals in the contemporary world that fall under the “ancient” category—but rather that this is the normative principle that founds modern orders and serves as the ideal immanent to our political culture that we aspire to live up to.14"
"3","Despite this shared commitment to subjective self‐determination, the three democratic theories presuppose three very different kinds of subjectivity. Hegel describes these kinds of subjectivity as the empiricist, formalist, and Romanticists views, and he argues each succeeds the previous.15 As I bring out each contemporary theory's debt to the corresponding view of subjectivity, I will also highlight Hegel's developmental logic of the progression of these shapes. What we will see is that Hegel anticipated the contemporary critiques of each successive theory of democracy in the different critiques of subjectivity. There is a unified logic of development: each view of subjectivity (a) highlights the way its predecessor failed to live up to the modern longing for subjective self‐determination and (b) overcomes this problem and thereby becomes ever more self‐determining.         "
"4","It is important to note initially that the notions of “subject” and “self‐determination” are ambiguous. They are ambiguous, first, because the “subject” can refer to a particular individual, such as me, Sue, or Barack Obama, or can refer to a collective subject, such as the Egyptian people or humanity as such. As Hegel puts it, the “I” can refer to this particular “I” or the universal “I”—a “we”—utterable by all human beings.16 Yet “subject” is ambiguous in a second way, that is, it is either conceived in “atomist” or in “expressive” terms. An “atomist,” according to Hegel, conceives of the subject as self‐sufficient and separate from all other subjects.17 For instance, aggregative democrats conceive of citizens’ subjectivity in “atomist” terms, in that citizens’ preferences are taken as given, distinct from the preferences of others, and hence the genesis of preferences is irrelevant from the perspective of the theory. By contrast, an “expressive” understanding conceives of subjects as parts of a larger whole, such that a subject is not self‐sufficient but only comes to be and understands itself in its relationship with others and its role within larger practices. For instance, agonistic democrats conceive of subjects as “expressions” of larger power relationships and practices and seek to transform these practices so as to create subjects able to shape the practices they are shaped by.18"
"5","We can understand each concept of subjective self‐determination based on which elements of the ambiguity each emphasizes. They can be summarized on a two‐by‐two grid (see Table 1).         "
"6","The first form of subjectivity, the empiricist, was conceived by early modern thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. In response to the ancients who argued that there is an objective good binding upon us in virtue of a distinctive feature of our human species, the early modern thinkers, under the sway of the new modern science, argued that categories or “universal” norms—like the idea of a “species”—were not fixed features of nature but products of the observing human subject (HP.3.299, 308).19 What is indeed given by nature is a set of material passions and desires, yet which desires we opt to seek and in what order differ from human to human (HP.3.317). And indeed, since material pleasures and pains are multitudinous, there is no single “summum bonum” that we all seek.20 Particular subjects are, moreover, the best judges of which pleasures we should seek and which we should avoid, since we are “closest” to our own desires. Accordingly, this empirical subjectivity involves a sovereign rule over the construction of our idea of our own particular good, and hence is a type of “atomism” in the sense that my sovereign subjectivity can shape my notion of the good independently of other subjects. This “atomism” grounded the juridical norms of classical liberalism in thinkers like John Locke, who argued that the purpose of government was to protect a rightful space for the free self‐determination of particular subjects (HP.3.313).21 Yet this self‐determination consisted not just in the particular construction of an idea of personal happiness, but also in the laboring transformation of nature so as to produce material goods suitable for human needs. John Locke argued that in a commercial society of laboring, self‐interested individuals are better than any society in securing material welfare and liberty for all.22 Locke's argument is of a piece with the broader early modern claim that human beings are little different from animals, animated by passions and desires, and hence not able to be educated to transcend our self‐interested natures to pursue the common good as the ancients desired. By relying on the sturdy, predictable foundation of human self‐interest, we can build a solid social and political foundation. Though the ancient imperative seemed nobler, human nature is made of much baser stuff, and hence the noble aims of ancient education inevitably became and will become perverted by our base natures.23"
"7","The contemporary “aggregative” conception of democracy is grounded on this model of subjectivity in several ways. First, this conception is called “aggregative” (mostly by its detractors) because it conceives of democracy as the aggregation of the preferences of subjects. This notion of subjectivity stems from the empiricist, “atomistic,” particular subject as having a pregiven set of pleasures and pains that particular subjects develop and pursue independently of other subjects. The notion of a “common good” or “general will” is an immediate nonstarter, since a common good would have to be a consensus of all the particular preferences of the multitude, just as much a chimera as the notion of a “summum bonum” was for Hobbes and Locke.24 Second, there is a strongly economic character to the “aggregative” model—the competitive struggle for votes in Schumpeter's model, the competitive bargaining of self‐interested actors in Dahl's pluralism—that hence this model finds its basis in the materially self‐interested and laboring early modern subject. Just as the early moderns thought this society of self‐interest seekers was a more solid foundation than the moralized ancient approach, so too do the aggregative theorists emphasize the stability achieved by “lowering our sights” to self‐interest in comparison with the ambition for widespread political participation and political virtue.25"
"8","However, subsequent critics of the empiricists argued that this view failed to achieve the modern promise of free self‐determination. Immanuel Kant, for instance, argued that the “empiricist” conception turned human beings into clever animals, that is, beings moved by natural desires with only instrumental reason to discern the best means to satisfy these desires.26 This view of subjectivity provided no way to freely determine whether we ought to pursue these natural desires or not without appealing to some more basic natural desire or sentiment. Instead, Kant defended a rationalist conception of subjectivity that, he thought, restored dignity to human beings.         "
"9","Instead of looking to the self‐determination of particular subjects, Kant defended the self‐determination of the universal subject of reason. Following our natural passions is not freedom but actually a kind of enslavement to nature; only when we abstract ourselves from our particular desires and subject them to rational scrutiny by expanding the scope of our subjectivity can we be self‐determining. Reason is self‐determining because it answers to no court external to itself, not nature, God, or tradition, but rather generates principles of action immanent to itself, and so “determines itself within itself” (HP.3.457). Acting rationally consists in elevating myself to the perspective of a universal subject, what Kant thinks of as a legislator in the “kingdom of ends.”27 Elevating myself to this perspective means deliberating about what the common good for all of humanity consists in. Since in this perspective we cannot appeal to natural ends or “impulses” to justify our action, we must appeal merely to the formal nature of reasoning as such, the “universal conformity of actions to law as such”—namely, is my action consistent with the “universal conformity … to law” or principle as such (Kant 1981, 402)? Is the “maxim” animating my action a possible law that all purely rational individuals would pass in a hypothetical “kingdom of ends?” If so, then one's action is rational and morally permissible. In elevating myself to the rational subject, I become self‐determining in that I (as a particular, embodied subject) follow a law that I (as the universal rational subject) have given myself.28 Both particular and the universal subjects are “atomistic” in the sense that the universal subject is external to, and independent of, nature and natural desires. “Reason” is conceived of as a capacity or faculty that a subject free from all external determinations can choose to act on or not.29"
"10","Kant's view of subjectivity underpins the “deliberative” model of democracy in a few ways. First, the critique of the “aggregative” conception of democracy is similar to Kant's critique of the empiricists. That is, the deliberative democrats charge the aggregative democrats with an inattention to the common good and general principles of right, an inattention that reinforces unequal practices that shape the supposedly “given” individual preferences and collective preference structures.30 Second, deliberative democracy is motivated by a similar urge as the Kantian formalist conception, to restore dignity to the democratic process, that is, to cultivate citizen autonomy, participation in decision making that is binding on ourselves yet that is aimed at the general good. Deliberative democrats encourage citizens to set aside personal preferences to deliberate based on a generalized “public reason.” Rawls, for instance, brackets individual identities and natural endowments in a hypothetical “original position” in order to reason about what laws purely rational subjects would legislate for themselves.31"
"11","For the Romantics, Kant also betrayed the impulse of the modern age to liberate human subjectivity to self‐determination. By identifying the particular subject with the universal rational subject, Kant abstracts from what is unique and individual about particular subjects. The universalization procedure threatens to homogenize and even annihilate our individual subjective identities by insisting that each subject transcend the “contingencies” of empirical circumstance.32 In response, the Romantics defended individual diversity and particularity, or, as John Stuart Mill would later put it, “experiments in living.”33 Yet the Romantics did not ground their view on an empirical “atomistic” self of the early moderns. Rather, they defended an “expressive” conception of the individual subject. That is, the good for each individual is not constructed like a building out of material given in advance, as for the “atomists.” Rather, the good grows out of the very process of seeking the good.34 The good is an expression of this individual subject's unique choices in life, which are themselves expressions flowing from a historically contingent practice and set of relationships. Since the flowering of individual self‐determination is the goal for the Romantics, they seek practices that serve as the right kind of preconditions for the “expression” of individual uniqueness. Laws, norms, and institutions normalize individuals and hence are obstacles to and distortions of subjective self‐determination. Instead, the Romantics celebrated bonds of friendship and love which feed on and foster individual uniqueness.35"
"12","This Romantic view of subjectivity underlies the “agonist” conception of democracy. First, the “agonists” bristle as the Romantics did at the homogenizing rationalism of the deliberative democrats that suppresses and distorts marginalized ways of life.36 Second, the “expressive” subjectivity grounds the agonists’ defense of both individual subjects’ and group subjects’ self‐determination. For the agonists, this self‐determination does not occur in the “private” sphere as for the liberal aggregative model, but rather is expressed through the relationships individuals and groups have with others.37 Just as the Romantics prize forms of relationships that will foster unique individual expressiveness, so too do the agonists call for competitive relationships that prompt subjects to express their identities through negotiating their differences with other subjects in public. Finally, the agonists share with this Romantic subjectivity a repudiation of a foundation for expressive self‐determination. On the one hand, contemporary agonists follow the Fichtean strand of Romanticism in enjoining a constant and penetrating reflective critique of all norms and institutions in society, even its most basic, that may reveal obstacles to the expression of new forms of individuality.38 On the other hand, the affirmation of subjective expressions or ways of life is based on principles internal to those ways of life. Yet the validation of a way of life as a whole is ultimately founded on an affective approbation of it, while the pluralism of ways of life is founded on the Schellingian concept of nature as giving rise to a plurality of different ways of life.39"
"13","However, Hegel argues that this Romanticist view also fails to live up to the subjective longing for self‐determination. For Hegel, the Romantics fail because they surrender the rational universal subjectivity, Kant's pursuit of a self‐grounding subject. As a result, the Romantics are stuck with (what later theorists would call) “language games,” practices, and other conventions without any foundations.40 The best way that we can ground them, Hegel argues, is through some kind of positive affective indicator. However, such a “pro‐emotion” is either manufactured by the convention or stems from some natural passion; in either case, the subject is being determined by some external authority and hence cedes its own authority (PR 140A).41As a result of the “emotive” basis of Romanticism, the Romantics fail to recognize the rational self‐determination of the political community; that is, the Romantics regard the political community with suspicion, as an external agent that distorts identity, rather than as the expression of collective self‐determination.42"
"14","Hegel seeks to complete the modern project of liberating the subject by synthesizing the previous three views of subjectivity into one general view.43 As we will see, Hegel's view is not a radical alternative, nor is it a utopian or revolutionary view that seeks to topple its predecessors.44 Rather, Hegel seeks in his view of subjective self‐determination and in the institutional theory that embodies it to make a home for the gains modernity itself has already made rather than generate something entirely new.45"
"15","Hegel adopts the “expressivist” type of subjectivity from the Romanticists. This “expressive” subjectivity is important, because, unlike the “atomistic” conception that rigidly sustains a separation between particular and universal subjectivities, the “expressivism” views particular and general subjects as interdependently related.46 As such, the identities or “substance” of these subjects is not given in advance nor discovered deep within the subject, but only comes to be through their interaction. The model for this relationship, according to the Romantics, was the organic body in which the whole organism only emerges through the reciprocal interaction among parts, and the interaction among the parts is guided by the inchoate aims of the whole.47 Hegel applies this model to the “spiritual” world of norms and practices of human reasoning and interaction.48 For Hegel, the identity and purposes of a general subject—the family, group, nation, or “Volksgeist”—give rise to a functional differentiation of roles governed by customs and institutions (VPR17, 130). Particular subjects staff these particular roles and so by performing their roles well, particular subjects bring to life the collective identity and help realize the common aim or good (VPR17, 132).49"
"16","Since these particular subjects are humans and not bees or ants, they have a self‐consciousness about what they are doing. By this Hegel means that we human beings do not act based on “instinct,” but based on reasons. These reasons are the product of the collective subjectivity or practice that I belong to, not discovered by pure practical reason or instrumental utility‐calculation (PHI 80). For instance, if I were a doctor, I would reason in this way: in virtue of my role as a medical doctor, I have a reason to keep my patient alive to the full extent of my abilities. This reason is not a universal principle of justice nor is it an expedient reason for me to get a biweekly paycheck. Rather, this reason stems from the Hippocratic Oath, a product of a collective self‐legislation renewed in every generation of new doctors. As a doctor properly fulfilling my role in this practice, I will not see this Oath as an external imposition or determination of my will. Rather, it is in some deep way my own will—it is something that I have agreed to, it is foundational to my self‐understanding as a doctor, and my practical activity as a self‐determining subject will be in service of this collective goal. As such, for Hegel, particular and universal subjectivity need not be “atomistically” separate, but can be “expressively” interdependent (PR 156Z). The collective subject's purposes can be “expressions” of my own deep‐seated beliefs and desires. At the same time, my own beliefs and desires are themselves the “expressions” of the collective subject's purposes in the sense that how I understand myself is as a contributing part of a whole. Hence, Hegel argues that the “I” can at the same time be a “we”—that I can determine myself and live according to my own law, the Hippocratic Oath, for instance. The “I” need not transcend its self‐interest, in other words, to live up to its own better self. In fact, what animates my “self‐interest” most deeply just is the common good of a collective subject.50 I determine myself here in both senses of my particular subjectivity—what makes me uniquely me as a doctor, say—and my universal subjectivity—living up to some principled purpose “higher” than one's own welfare.         "
"17","Hegel, of course, recognizes that the expressive intertwining of particular and collective subject may not be the average experience in all situations. Indeed, many might regard the collective subjects they belong to in “atomistic” terms—a teenage worker at Burger King might not recognize the rule about wearing hairnets as an expression of his own will, nor, perhaps, the collective goal of providing good “customer service.” Rather, the teenager might regard these collective rules and goals as external impositions or determinations of his will and hence might relate to his employer in purely instrumental terms. Another example: one democratic citizen might regard paying his taxes as an expression of his own self‐determination, that his will helped shape the collective self‐determining law for a certain set of services, and so he recognizes he should do his duty in support of his own will. Another democratic citizen might despise taxation and see it in atomistic terms as an imposition of a collective subject on an individual subject. The tempting Romanticist way of sorting out good human practices from bad is to see the parochial and cultural associations as deep expressions of my own will—friendship, family, town, Gemeinschaft, for instance—while the general, mechanistic, Gesellschaft modern associations command my will and hence alienate me from my own self‐determination—economic community, mass society, and the state. For Hegel, however, this Romantic expressivism will not do, as we have seen. For Hegel, there must be a rational basis for our practices in order for them to have a self‐determining foundation rather than being rooted in emotion.         "
"18","Hegel's argument, in short, is that associations that cultivate individual labor and self‐government realize subjective self‐determination. Through labor, the subject transforms nature and creates a human world that is the product of his own will. Through self‐government, the subject shapes a practice whose rules and aims thus become his own. Hegel looks to modern civil society for the resources to incorporate and realize the different forms of subjective self‐determination we explored above. For Hegel, modern civil society is the best way to combine these forms of self‐determination because they emerge out of our laboring, material self‐interest, fundamental to the modern age since Machiavelli and Locke. First, the openness and freedom of civil society accords individuals with the “particular self‐determination” of the empiricists, in which individuals are accorded the freedom voluntarily to seek out whichever occupation and fancy they desire. Second, the economic associations of civil society can become the basis for the “individual self‐determination” of the Romantics, in which individuals can pursue their unique calling through their labor and fellowship with other workers. Finally, Hegel envisions that these economic associations will themselves have a crucial voice in the self‐determination of political society as such.51 The individual's vocational self‐determination hence takes on a universal and rational significance.         "
"19","These three “moments” of the modern subject's self‐determination—particular, individual, and universal—refer in Hegel's Logic to the structure of subjective thought and to thought's embodiment in the human world. Hegel adopts these terms from traditional Aristotelian logic, but he argues that each logical term is interdependently or “expressively” related to the other (EL 163).52 In the social world, Hegel conceives of “particulars” as material desires, “universals” as general goods of community and state, and “individuals” as citizens or associations that synthesize self‐interest and common good, desire and duty. For this reason, Hegel considers civil society to be so important, since within civil society particular desires are elevated into the universal or common good through the medium of individual citizens and their associations (PR 187A). For Hegel, these “moments” each find embodied form in interrelated ways in civil society and the state (see Table 2), and these “moments” will be the topics of the next three sections.         "
"20","As such, I argue in what follows that Hegel indeed recognized an important role for democratic political participation. However, I am not arguing that Hegel was himself a defender of popular sovereignty (which he rejects in PR 279A) or of democratic government. Nor is this to overlook or minimize the role of the state in governing the country and in correcting the excessive and self‐destructive character of civil society.53 Far from a democrat, Hegel defends a constitutional monarchy, which contains a landed aristocratic upper house and an expansive state bureaucracy. My focus, however, in what follows, is on Hegel's view of civil society, because in Hegel's view of economic associations we see the mediation between economic self‐interest and the political common good through the “democratic moment” of self‐government. Such participation, Hegel argues, occurs both at the local level but also at the national level with the Estates Assembly, because, for Hegel, “by virtue of this participation, subjective liberty and conceit … can show themselves palpably efficacious and enjoy the satisfaction of feeling themselves to count for something” (ES 544). Though Hegel may have had an overly rigid conception of the state institutional structure, we must not overlook, I argue, the dynamic, self‐governing character of civil society, as these associations illuminate most clearly Hegel's structural scheme for realizing these three basic forms of subjective self‐determination.         "
"21","First, Hegel incorporates the “empiricist” model of subjectivity through the freedom and openness of modern civil society. This “practice” is structured so as to promote individual freedom to pursue whichever aims, exchanges, and pleasures we choose, “to develop and express [ourselves] in all directions,” and to protect individual “negative” liberty to choose, exit, and advance in our occupations (PR 184, 206). Hegel accordingly agrees with empiricist thinkers that the rightful foundation of modern political life is the voluntary will of individual subjects (PR 260Z).Yet this foundation is also a solid one—individual subjects, as we will see, are much more likely to protect and defend an association that they have chosen, rather than one foisted upon them (PR 260). Finally, this foundation is also a source of material progress. In civil society, individual subjects engage in labor and material accumulation and exchange. Hegel follows Locke and the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers in arguing that labor and the division of labor transform useless nature into valuable tools and objects for human use and satisfaction.54 Indeed, the signal contribution of modern political economy, for Hegel, is to show that the individual pursuit of self‐interest actually produces benefit for the whole, while moral sacrifice and transcendence of self‐interest harms the whole. The “subjective selfishness turns into a contribution toward the satisfaction of the needs of everyone else” (PR 199). Particular subject and universal subject are married through the structure of the market.         "
"22","Hegel's view that any modern political regime must be grounded on commercial self‐interest aligns him with the “aggregative” conception of democracy and differs from the “deliberative” and “agonistic” conceptions. The deliberative and agonistic conceptions tend to consign commercial self‐interest to a fundamentally different and often lower sphere of human activity in comparison with our political or cultural activities.55 Yet this view is a mistake, since, as Hegel argues, the very foundation of the modern social world is the laboring particular freedom of individuals. The deliberative and agonistic theorists appear then “utopian” in the sense that they expect individuals—who spend ever more time every year invested in their occupations, ever less time in political and cultural affairs—to transcend this self‐interest in order to engage in the big political and cultural issues of the day. Without a strong foundation in self‐interest, the “state must hang in the air” (PR 265Z), because people, for Hegel, “take no share in the universal unless it is in their own self‐interest” (VPR17 132A, cf. PW 98).         "
"23","Hegel moves beyond the empiricists, however, in grasping the “expressive” or self‐determining nature of human labor. For Hegel, labor not only transforms nature, but also the laboring subject itself. Through my labor, I invest something of myself in the product of my labor, such that this product appears as an extension of myself.56 When I build a chair or table with my hands, I have a stronger connection with these objects of my labor than when I buy a premade chair from a department store. At the same time, the activity of laboring transforms me in the process—I may learn something unexpected about myself through my labor, say, in fixing up my house. In this way, labor is self‐determining because the laborer comes to “express” himself through his work—he shapes the natural world but is also at the same time shaped in unexpected ways by the process itself.         "
"24","This “expressive” agency through labor introduces a problem, however, in that if my labor is transformed by an agency outside of my control, I lose the sense that I am determining myself through this process. In his famous master‐slave dialectic, Hegel argues that by laboring for the master, the slave transforms the given matter of nature into something usable and consumable. By transforming nature and shaping an object, he imposes his own will in the world, such that the object comes to bear the image of his free subjectivity. The slave then feels satisfaction in seeing “in the independent being [of the object][his] own independence” (PhG 195). However, at the same time, the meaning of his labor, the purpose of the produced object, is dictated by the master (PhG 196). The slave's own laboring subjectivity is directed by an alien will and hence loses the self‐determination inherent in labor itself."
"25","The empiricist commercial society does not solve this problem. Admittedly, there are no longer masters to direct my will from the outside in such a society, but there are social and political wills that can create a deeper, more intangible form of unfreedom. In commercial society, individual labor produces a product whose meaning and purpose is no longer intrinsic to the object itself. In simpler societies, the purpose of a product of labor stemmed from nature—food was cultivated to serve bodily needs, for instance. But in developed societies, these same objects take on a general “social” or “spiritual” character shaped by potential customers and the market in general (PR 192). Food does not simply mean and serve the purpose of sating bodily needs, but different foods express status, identity, wealth, power, religious affiliation, and so forth. Accordingly, how I understand the product of my own labor—and hence myself—will be shaped by public desires and meanings outside of my control. In addition, my labor may be directed and given significance by centralized political forces, a “mechanized hierarchy” and bureaucracy, beyond my control. In both cases, a collective subject appears as an alien will colonizing the consciousness of the laborer. As we will see in the next section, Hegel argues that when economic associations take on a self‐governing communal character, such that we come to have a voice in this collective subject, we will hence come to see this collective subject shaping the significance of our labor as our own."
"26","Second, Hegel incorporates the “Romanticist” model of self‐determination through the associations of our vocational lives. Hegel does not diminish the importance of Romantic associations of friendship and romance, but he thinks that vocational associations can supply human beings with self‐determined meaning for the labor we discussed in the previous section. As we have seen, Hegel looks to our voluntary, economic, material life as the foundation of good, lasting government. But he thinks that our economic lives need not only be about self‐interest narrowly understood. Rather, as many of us experience, individuals forge strong ethical bonds with their coworkers, derive much of their identity from the customs and work of their occupations, and understand the social and political world more generally through their “education” within these occupations (PR 187, 201).57 For Hegel, when properly shaped to cultivate individual self‐determination and self‐government, the economic associations of civil society can serve as a powerful foundation to unify particular and collective self‐determination. Our economic lives are fundamental to our very identities—we identify most fundamentally in accord with our chosen occupation, and we all seek work that brings our lives meaning, in part, Hegel thinks, because it is in our occupations where we understand how to transform the world in accordance with our own subjectivity and hence exercise self‐determination. Accordingly, Hegel argues, to bring meaning to labor, our economic associations ought to be shaped such that we can feel and see our own contribution to the common good of this economic association, such that we come to identify with this common subject. In such a case, both collective subject and individual subject assume an expressive interdependence.         "
"27","Let us examine how this expressive interdependence develops. For Hegel, modern freedom destroys all forms of association of the ancient régime into which people were “born” or with which they were expected to identify without choice or a stake in its government. But instead of leaving individuals adrift on a sea of competing impulses, modern commercial society has an intrinsic rationality connected to the nature of how goods are produced and consumed by human beings (PR 184). For Hegel, human labor transforms nature into usable human products in a series of discrete stages—those of (1) farming and producing raw materials, (2) processing them, shaping them into usable tools, making complex objects, exchanging these objects for others, and (3) managing the total laboring process. Different “estates” and “corporations” emerge out of this division of labor that structure labor output and are the public face responsible for the different market functions (PR 200–5). For Hegel, the associational divisions of modern commercial society are not the effects of feudal imposed order, but the spontaneous result of the division of labor. For Hegel, a functional rationality pervades and structures these associations. The common good of material welfare for the community must be divided into several estates with their own tasks. This fundamental division of labor means that different associations have different basic aims or purposes. The farming association, for instance, is responsible for cultivating fruits, vegetables, and grain for the community to consume, for instance. In turn, then, each association must divide its own labor so as to most efficiently produce its own common purpose. In this way, the common good precedes and structures the roles that, when performed properly, will cohere into producing the common good.58 These roles, then, bring with them certain duties and virtues for performing a job well done, as well as the benefits of having one's labor recognized as something meaningful within an association with which one identifies.         "
"28","Individuals come to be self‐determining within these associations through their labor and through self‐government. As we saw above, voluntary labor provides a way for the individual to express his subjectivity and hence determine himself by transforming some part of the world. This transformed product hence reflects back to the subject his own identity so as to remind him he is not dominated by his appetites but can habituate himself to follow common human purposes that are at the same time his own purposes. Accordingly, the subject finds that he has helped promote these common purposes through his labor, such that these common purposes also become in some small way products of his own will. To employ the above example, the devoted doctor performs his “labor” by following the Hippocratic Oath. By committing himself to this common purpose of upholding the Hippocratic Oath, the doctor reveals that he is determined not by appetite, but by principle. And since by upholding this principle he has helped embody and realize it in human relationships, it becomes his own principle. In meaningful labor, the subject follows his own principle and hence is self‐determining."
"29","Just as the subject transforms, so too is the subject transformed by labor. One's labor has a social meaning, as we have seen. The subject and his labor are shaped by this social meaning. For Hegel, by embedding this social meaning in an institutional structure of which the individual is a member, the individual can come to claim this social meaning as his own. The individual does this in two ways. First, the individual becomes a “member” of an association, such that he is officially recognized as belonging to a collectivity that all members share (PR 207). Accordingly, whenever the individual acts, he is at once acting as a member or part or “expression” of the collectivity to which he belongs. That is, the meaning of his labor takes on the meaning of the purposes and goods of his community, a community that he has a share in making—his activity is “raised to a conscious activity for a common end” (PR 254). For instance, the “meaning” of the police officer's actions—say, arresting a criminal or patrolling a neighborhood—flows from the collective purpose of the police force as a whole. To understand this police officer's actions requires understanding the whole and then this officer's part in the whole. By contrast, the rogue vigilante's actions—say, arresting a criminal or patrolling a neighborhood—have a very different meaning, indeed, a meaning quite the opposite of what the vigilante intends (the criminal would not recognize the vigilante's authority, the neighborhood would respond with fear, not with trust, etc.). Since the vigilante is not a “member” of a collective subject, his actions are not the “expressive” result of his own collective will.         "
"30","Second, individual subjects can claim social meaning as their own by living up to their functions or roles, that is, by performing these functions well. Each practice contains roles that themselves are constituted by institutional rules and customs. The individuals staffing these roles can fail to live up to these roles with laziness or selfishness. Both police officers and doctors can act selfishly and betray the principles structuring the proper execution of their duties—yet in so doing, these workers betray their vocation and are punished by it for failing to live up to the collective self they had chosen for themselves. By acting selfishly, these individuals cease to be self‐determining, but rather are seized by some appetite. Yet individuals may succeed in living up to their roles and sometimes can succeed magnificently, with “arête,” a virtue or excellence of function (PR 150). In so doing, such individual subjects make the principles and common good of the collective subject real. For Hegel, “virtue” means that “individuality, by self‐determination, endows itself with a specific character” and principle (VPR17 107A). They show to the world that living according to one's own principle, rather than being externally determined by natural desire or social custom, is possible.59"
"31","Finally, for individuals to be fully self‐determining in their roles, they must have some say over the customs and rules governing them. This does not mean that individual subjects must be able to transform customs and practices ex nihilo—such an “atomistic” view is far from the truth. But just as the customs, rules, and common good of their practice shape subjects, so too must subjects be able to shape them in turn to make them their own. Otherwise, if the individual subject has no say whatever over the structure and aim of the practice she is a part of, such a practice ceases to appear as an “expression” of her own will and begins to resemble an alien will. For Hegel, then, the economic practices of civil society—and, as we will see, the political practices—must thus involve some self‐government.60 As Hegel puts the point, the subject must “know itself as active; for the requirement of freedom is that the subject should know that it possesses it and is playing its part, for it is in the subject's own interest that the thing itself should be realized” (PW 215). When I participate in the deliberations about the common good of my association, when “reciprocity” is the structure of communal associations, the self‐governing outcome bears the image of my own subjectivity (ES 436). As in the case of physical labor, in which the self transforms nature to resemble its subjectivity, so too in this political “labor,” the self transforms the common self by investing it with its own subjectivity. Individuals come to see the community as their own and hence build bonds of solidarity with their fellows insofar as the latter are also contributing members of the whole. Since this self‐government is rooted in the subject's laboring self‐interest, we need not be concerned to offer a theory of how the individual subject can transcend his self‐interest to deliberate for the common good. The individual's self‐determination is already intimately bound up with the collective subject's fate.         "
"32","Hegel describes this self‐government most explicitly not so much in terms of the internal governance of the economic policies of the economic association, but rather in terms of the political functions that Hegel attributes to these associations. For Hegel, these associations ought to play a crucial role in local politics, for the “particular common interests which fall within civil society, and which lie outside the universal interest of the state” (PR 288). Local administration ought to be handled by those closest to the locality, because they will have the most concrete knowledge of what is required (PR 301A).61 Hegel envisions a kind of political subsidiary, according to which political administration is distributed to the most local agent possible (VPR.4.690–1).62 Though such local self‐government will undoubtedly be “inept,” it must be “indulged” because it brings with it benefits of the development of subjective self‐determination (PR 289A). For Hegel, the “self‐administration also has the ethical aspect that individuals see their proximate, particular interest become a universal matter in which they find reflected the state as a whole” (VPR17 141). By engaging in local political projects and deliberation about what policies to adopt, the members of this association come to identify themselves with the association as a whole as the collective body, the “general will,” they are participating in. Hegel argues that the “fact that the particular spheres are necessarily self‐governed constitutes the democratic principle” in his state (VPR17 141A). Hegel recognizes how important it is for the “people” to “take part in the making of laws and in the most important affairs of the state” (PW 94).         "
"33","We can see the importance of self‐government for Hegel by examining the dissatisfaction on the part of the poor or the “rabble” in civil society, those who are excluded from self‐government. For Hegel, the poor are dissatisfied and resentful not because the rich have material wealth they do not have. Rather, the propertied are self‐determining in a way that the poor are not. The poor are not “recognized” as part of any occupation and hence are dependent on fortune and the grace of others for their well‐being. They have no status and “someone with no status is nothing” (VPR17 107A).The “feeling of right, integrity, and honor which comes from supporting oneself by one's own activity and work is lost,” and one feels shame instead (PR 244). The work of the day‐laborer takes on a meaning beyond the day‐laborer's agency, and hence the laborer outside of associations seeks all forms of external or material worth in order vainly to accord social meaning to himself that members of associations automatically have (PR 206A). Since the poor are not members of any association, they are subject to rules that they have not deliberated about or chosen. These rules, and the rules of the larger society, represent an alien will, a will that they come to hold responsible for their dismal fate. The rabble, in other words, are certain they deserve freedom of self, but the community fails to accord them such freedom and rather treats them as if they were subhuman. The rabble hence does not just feel alienated from the common will, then, but feels resentment, an “inward rebellion against the rich, against society, the government” (PR 244Z)."
"34","Hegel's view of economic associations as the foundational ethical associations provides a useful counterweight to all three contemporary theories of democracy. The three theories agree about the nature and logic of economic associations. The “aggregative” democrats see these economic associations as “atomistic” in nature. That is, individual subjects’ preferences are formed independently of their participation in these associations, and they join one or more of these associations and accept a job as an instrument to satisfy these pregiven desires. Similarly, the “deliberative” democrats regard economic associations themselves as having a Marxist capitalist logic of self‐interest. Economic associations use individuals as means to ends and regard other associations always as bargaining chips. For Habermas, for instance, the market always threatens to distort communicative rationality with the former's instrumental rationality.63 Accordingly, individuals ought to transcend their economic self‐interest and engage in deliberation in the “public sphere” separate from the market.         "
"35","The problem with these views is that they assume an atomistic, instrumental rationality at work in economic associations. Associations may be “atomistic” in improperly structured associations—the kinds in which laborers do not have a stake in, and hence they feel their roles are an imposition on them rather than an expression of their own will. In administratively centralized economic associations, and in forms of labor that are excessively mechanized or repetitive, the individual subject ceases to have a connection with the collective subject, and both adopt a means‐end rationality toward the other. However, the relationship need not be this way—an expressive, rather than atomistic, relationship is possible. Furthermore, contemporary “deliberative” and “agonistic” democratic theories essentially divide the subject's life in half. That is, the individual subject can be free and self‐determining in his cultural and political life, but is essentially unfree and externally determined in his economic life.64 Since, as we have seen, modern life is thoroughly dominated and pervaded by commerce, the realm of unfreedom for these theorists expands day by day. Hegel's theory has the advantage that it liberates individuals to self‐determination in the core feature of their modern lives, their labor, and brings a unity to this self‐determination, as we will see, by bringing together, rather than segregating, the modern spheres of economic and political association; moral duty and material welfare are hence unified in these institutions (PR 261A).         "
"36","Finally, Hegel incorporates the “formalist” model of self‐determination as the rational basis for civil society. Hegel shares with Kant and Kant's many successors in the deliberative democracy school the rationally grounded goals of (a) collective self‐determination based on a common vision of the good and (b) the protection of individuals as free and equal moral beings (PR 260).65 In service to these goals, Hegel argues that the state must ensure associations understand their own role in terms of participation in securing the common good, rather than looking out for their own self‐interest. Hegel's worry here is that associational life will devolve into a “miserable guild system” in which each association is a world unto itself and individuals have no rational authority to appeal to for redress (PR 255Z; VPR 4.628). Yet Hegel departs from the deliberative democrats in that he does not call for a break between the egoism of civil society and the altruism of the state. Rather, Hegel argues that the public reasoning should emerge out of our economic lives and be of a piece with it.66 These associations will concern themselves with the public good, Hegel thinks, insofar as they are given a self‐governing stake in the task of government and hence consider the whole their own. In other words, Hegel argues that the above analysis of entangling particular and collective subjectivity through self‐government is at work here—just as individuals responsible for self‐government come to understand their selves as implicated in collective aims, so too do associations come to take on a public political role when they are accorded responsibility for self‐government.         "
"37","In other words, despite Hegel's commitment to collective self‐determination and individual autonomy, Hegel is no supporter of Rousseauian direct democracy. Indeed, Hegel is often criticized precisely on the ground that he does not allow for such greater Rousseauian freedom.67 Yet Hegel's critique of democracy is often misunderstood. It is not a criticism of public participation in collective will‐formation per se, but rather a critique of an “atomist” understanding of democracy, an understanding that underlies most contemporary forms of democratic theory.68 According to the “atomist” view, each individual is entitled to an equal say in the collective decision‐making procedures of the state. Each individual's arguments are formed, moreover, independent of the rest of their social and economic lives in a “public sphere” (as in deliberative democracy), or their preferences are brought to the table and unaffected by public deliberation (as in aggregative democracy). The gold standard for the deliberative account is a direct democracy in which each individual decides which concerns and arguments to bring to the table and is accorded an equal speaking time with all other individuals. Of course, no modern democracy could actually create the conditions for such a direct democracy, yet theorists nonetheless take it as a regulative ideal for designing institutions to approximate the deliberative conditions of direct democracy (public spheres and “deliberative polls”) or to fairly represent individual perspectives on the big issues (party systems).         "
"38","For Hegel, the problem with the “atomist” view is that the “demos” produces nothing but “generalities and one‐sided declamations,” absolutely no policy prescriptions of rational substance usable for modern states (PR 303A). This is not because Hegel is an elitist, but rather because he sees that determinate and rational policy views are not formed by average citizens in their free time detached from all their other interests that constitute their identity.69 Rather, the average democratic citizen's views tend to be rather shifting, amorphous, and shallow, precisely because they have no material basis on which to craft an opinion, and the combination of shallow wills produces nothing but more shallowness. Furthermore, as we know in contemporary political science, political activists who do form determinate policy views have disproportionate power in the collective will‐formation, because in “mass elections,” where the public cannot grasp the issues or see how they are relevant, the public “fails to make use of” their right to vote (PR 311A). In response to such problems, democratic theorists have long turned to political parties as mediating institutions that inform and structure the people's arguments and preferences. Yet two‐party systems often project a vague, undifferentiated ideology that does not cohere into a common will with which the people can identify. Multiparty systems, though they are better at producing determinate, concrete policies and express more diversity of choice, are too fragmented to come together around a sense of the common good.70"
"39","For Hegel, the “atomist” view is problematic because it abstracts from the common good and fails to offer a mechanism for how to retrieve it.71 As Hegel puts it, the         "
"40","                        "
"41","idea that those communities which are already present … can be split up again into a collection of individuals as soon as they enter the sphere of politics … involves separating civil and political life from each other and leaves political life hanging, so to speak, in the air; for its basis is then merely the abstract individuality of arbitrary will and opinion and is thus grounded on contingency rather than on a foundation which is stable and legitimate in and for itself. (PR 303A, cf. 308)"
"42","For Hegel, there is an existing rationality of a social organization that emerges spontaneously in civil society and that forms the foundation of the modern political order. Labor was and is divided in service of a common good, and the resulting economic associations form the natural fault lines of modern civil society. These associations have the best understanding of what they can contribute to the common good and what they require from others. Accordingly, Hegel argues, we should invest political judgment and agency in those associations whose labor already produces the common good. Any attempt to structure political judgment around individuals divorced from their existing economic lives or around parties partially related to certain occupations merely abstracts from, and threatens to undermine, existing agents of the common good.72"
"43","However, in the contemporary United States in which interest groups and corporations expend a great deal of time and money pushing their “self‐interest” in politics, it is difficult to imagine that economic associations could themselves be concerned with the common good. To overcome the problem of associational self‐interest, Hegel applies the same logic of individual expansion of self‐interest to that of associations. Associations can be shaped to have a concern for the common good so long as the state invests associations with the task of self‐government. Many Hegel scholars think of the “universal estate” of civil servants and governing administration to be the governing body, whereas the economic associations are concerned simply with their economic matters.73 Yet Hegel is concerned with investing economic associations with some political power and encouraging their political participation in conjunction with state officials. By engaging in self‐government, the “common self” of the association will come to see the “national self” of the political community as its own.         "
"44","For Hegel, the economic associations of each vocation are themselves divisions from larger structures or estates which are responsible for the more comprehensive products of labor—farming, manufacturing, or merchandising. These estates together “form the constitution”; they are the “developed and actualized rationality” of the state, the “firm foundation of the state and of the trust and disposition of individuals towards it,” and the “pillars on which public freedom rests, for it is within them that particular freedom is realized and rational” (PR 265). Accordingly, Hegel argues that these estates should constitute the self‐governing, legislative power of the state in the form of the lower house of the national government (PR 301). These estates already have a large “stake” in the fate of the political whole, given that each serves a laboring function for the common good. Each contributes labor to the common good and hence invests its own subjectivity in the production of what is common, and each relies on the oversight by the state legal authority for a fair distribution of the common good to all associations equally (PR 235). In addition, Hegel argues that the estates ought to be given “active participation” in the self‐determination of the collective will as a whole (VPR17 147), a “rational deliberation” about what the common good is and how to apply it in this circumstance (PR 308A). Though the Estates Assembly is “only one branch” of the “legislative power,” by articulating a notion of the common good and having its “voice” incorporated in common policy, the association's particular subjectivity is expressed through the general, national subjectivity (ES 544). Finally, just as these groups express themselves in the common will, so too in Hegel's mind should the associations of civil society be the expressions of a national will, such that each association understands the significance of its labor in terms of its participation in a collective interest (PR 263).74"
"45","This expressive interdependence of group and state subjectivities forges an interdependence between individual and state subjects. It is through the Estates Assembly that “the state enters into subjective consciousness of the people, and that the people begins to participate in the state” (PR 301A). Hegel suggests that the selection of delegates to this assembly is done by the members of the estates (PR 309, 311A). Such a representative will be the expression of the common self that each member takes to be his own, and each delegate is to express the “interests of particular circles and individuals,” while also being talented and wise enough to connect particular associational interest with the common good (PR 302, 309Z).75 Moreover, since each member had a say in who is to be his representative, the member will come to have a kind of ownership over this representative, to see the representative as “his own” (VPR17 142A).76 Since the representative is representing the interest of the individual that is central to the individual's own life, the individual will be much more knowledgeable about which candidate to choose and what policies he should enact. For instance, the average citizen does not have an informed opinion about how best the country ought to handle health care—and encouraging individuals to be well versed on these sophisticated matters seems a pipe dream—however, members of a farming association do have context‐specific knowledge about how the country ought to oversee its agricultural output.77"
"46","The delegate to the national assembly focuses the attention of all the associations in a common will, thereby elevating the individual selves to the whole—in Hegel's terms, the Estates Assembly is the “subjective moment of universal freedom” (PR 301A). Moreover, since individuals have come to identify themselves with their representatives, they will see themselves in the political self‐government of their representatives (VPR17 148A). Individuals see that the activities of the national government have implications for their own activities at home and that their own activities in their locality are intended for the common good of the nation as a whole. Hegel argues that individuals should “knowingly and willingly acknowledge this universal interest as their own substantial spirit, and actively pursue it as their ultimate end” (PR 260A). Such “patriotism” does not involve “extraordinary sacrifices” or unthinking trust; on the contrary, it involves the “consciousness that my substantial and particular interest is preserved and contained in the interest and end of an other (the state)” (PR 268, cf. VPR.3.797)—in other words, patriotism consists in seeing the state as your own, as an extension of your own self, that it is the “end and product” of your own “activity” (VPR17 123; cf. PhG 500).78 The wise institutional design of creating a “chain” of associations from the locality to the lower house demonstrates to individuals the mutual interdependence between their own selves and the self of the nation.         "
"47","This “neo‐Aristotelian” self‐determination is supposed to supply individual subjects with complete self‐determination. How so? Individual subjects possess a “particular” self‐determination within the practices of modern commercial society—we can pursue whatever goods we wish and design a life unique to ourselves. Yet individual subjects also express an “individual” self‐determination through the practices of modern commercial society. The economic associations that are the bedrocks of our modern commercial lives become at the same time expressions of our ethical identities, in which the participation in these practices (ideally) involves the pursuit of my deepest individual calling. Finally, individual subjects also reveal a “universal” self‐determination through their participation in the political features of their economic associations. Since we participate in those associations that in turn shape the course of our political lives, we come to see the state as an expression of our own ethical identities. Since the state has a larger purpose than my own particular calling, and the state represents the common good of which my calling is a part, my own calling comes to be invested with a larger, rational significance that, given my own participation in guiding it, becomes at once my own purpose. Individuals hence come at the same time to possess within them a universal self‐determination because they “discover their essential self‐consciousness in [economic‐social] institutions as that universal aspect of their particular interests which has being in itself, and by obtaining through these institutions an occupation and activity directed towards a universal end within a corporation” (PR 264). These three forms of self‐determination occur at the same time, not in separate spheres of the individual's life, such that different actions I perform can have significance as part of a whole self‐guided life lived in concert with my fellows in group and state associations."
"48","This article has aimed to make a case for returning to the normative foundations of democratic order. Such a return to foundations does not mean, as antifoundationalists claim, that we must try to access transhistorical truths external to the political community itself. Rather, as we have seen, Hegel's view is that the normative claims emerge immanent to the modern state itself, which is founded on the bedrock principle and aim of subjective self‐determination.79 Self‐determination happens to be the foundational norm all contemporary democratic theorists take for granted, even those who claim to be nonfoundational. By examining the different forms that self‐determination has taken in the modern age in this article, we grasped the basis of the disagreements among the different camps of contemporary democratic theory and have also seen that each of these views expresses something true about self‐determination, but in a partial way. Hegel's view is so appealing because it synthesizes the three different forms into one unified view of subjective self‐determination.         "
"49","Hegel is able to synthesize these different views because, he argues, they are themselves already synthesized in the objective social world. The different democratic theories defended in the contemporary world are not theories developed in a vacuum but expressions of different structures of modern political society responsible for embodying certain forms of subjective self‐determination. The problem with each of these views is that they isolate one structure of modern politics and exclude the rest—the “aggregative” democrats emphasize the economic structures of civil society at the expense of the rational, political structure; the “deliberative” democrats focus on the political structure at the expense of individual economic “self‐interest”; “agonists” focus on “identity” disconnected from material “self‐interest.” A proper democratic theory, in Hegel's view, would take its cue from all the several forms of modern self‐determination and develop ways in which each form can help realize the others; how, for instance, economic self‐government can help prepare the way for political self‐government."
"50","Hegel's admittedly institution‐centric political theory is bound to sound restraining to American individualists. But I want to suggest in closing that a theory like this does help restrain the perennial temptation in a democracy to free the democratic self‐determining will from existing institutions; or to see it, hovering like a god, divorced from material self‐interest. For Hegel, it is crucial for citizens to recognize their own identities and agency expressed in these institutions, institutions which have histories and deep problems, but institutions which establish the meaning in which we can be self‐determining in the first place. In opposition to the spontaneous voluntary associations championed by Robert Putnam, Theda Skocpol (2003) has recently documented the benefits of an earlier model of large‐scale civic associations with federated structures that articulated complex, materially based interests. Similarly, Hegel envisions a federated, materially based structure, since individual workers within this structure will come to be educated better about the common good and will better be able to express their agency through a structure in which they recognize their own occupational “calling.” For Hegel, it is through laboring and deliberating within existing modern structures of meaning which I have a part in shaping that I can most fully be self‐determining.
