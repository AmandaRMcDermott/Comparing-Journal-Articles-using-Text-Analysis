"1","Incumbency advantage, generally defined as the returns from holding office, has long been regarded exclusively as a personal affair. The early literature focuses on the role of the officeholder as the driver of the incumbency effect, offering several reasons for its existence, such as name recognition and media exposure (Erikson 1971), the performance of constituency services (Fiorina 1989), the control over relevant resources and institutional privileges (Mayhew 1974), the conviction that incumbency works rather as a voting cue (Kostroski 1973), the ability to scare off high‐quality challengers (Jacobson 1978) or the officeholder's quality and experience (Cox and Katz 1996).         "
"2","This “direct officeholder benefit” (Levitt and Wolfram 1997) or “personal vote” (Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2000) is referred to in the following as the personal incumbency advantage. A number of scholars repeatedly tried to credibly identify it, often running into issues of selection on observables and endogeneity. While early estimates of the effect rely on variants of two popular measures, the sophomore surge (Erikson 1971) and the retirement slump (Alford and Brady 1989), simply opposing vote margins in open versus incumbent‐contested seats, testing and controlling for each of the different explanations above eventually led to the use of increasingly more sophisticated methodologies.1 Still, only recently was the nonrandomness of incumbency advantage systematically addressed, with Lee (2008) applying a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to the analysis. This methodological breakthrough came, however, at the expense of an abstraction from the standard concept of incumbency advantage. Rather than analyzing the extent to which a candidate benefits by virtue of being the incumbent, the new framework tries to assess the benefits that accrue to a candidate from running for the incumbent party, that is, the partisan incumbency advantage.         "
"3","Despite the breach with the previous literature, exploring the existence of a partisan incumbency advantage is of relevance.2 Just as parties benefit from running an incumbent officeholder, it is also reasonable to assume that a candidate benefits from running for an incumbent party. In fact, many of the explanations for the existence of a personal incumbency advantage may also justify a partisan one. Parties are likewise in control of institutional resources and may have access to privileges, as well as benefit from media exposure and attested quality. Moreover, studies show that parties introduce strategic changes to the political system in order to maximize their electoral success (Baskaran and Lopes da Fonseca 2016; Trebbi, Aghion, and Alesina 2008). In addition, it is well established that parties enjoy loyalty from voters (Aldrich and Rohde 2001) and their relevance as political representatives is latent in the main role they play in Downs's (1957) theory of democracy. Still, only putting the emphasis on the candidate can explain certain phenomena such as the successful reelection of candidates who “cross the floor.”3 These can be found even in the setting at the genesis of the incumbency advantage literature: the U.S. House of Representatives.4"
"4","Therefore, instead of focusing on either the candidate or the party, credibly estimating the incumbency effect implies that both sources of incumbency advantage are taken into account. By overlooking this aspect, Lee's (2008) framework fails to provide an unbiased estimate of either. Hence, the objective of this article is to causally estimate the personal and partisan effects that contribute to an incumbent's advantage at the ballot box. Put differently, this article measures to what extent being the incumbent officeholder, or alternatively, being the incumbent party, has a causal impact on electoral success.         "
"5","The identification strategy relies on two quasi‐experimental methods, the RDD and the difference‐in‐discontinuities (diff‐in‐disc) design, and on a natural experiment, the introduction of mayoral term limits in Portuguese municipalities. In Portugal, mayoral elections correspond to the proportional elections for the local council, the municipality's executive organ, with the first name on the winning list becoming the mayor. As each mayoral candidate represents a party, there is a need to dissociate the two in order to assess their independent returns to incumbency. This is only possible due to the recent introduction of term limits. The diff‐in‐disc design captures the second source of variation resulting from the exogenous heterogeneity in the implementation of term limits and combines it with the exogenous variation in incumbency status captured by the RDD focus on close elections. Finally, a system of equations relating partisan to personal incumbency advantage in the spirit of Fowler and Hall (2014) provides credible estimates of the two quantities.         "
"6","This article primarily contributes to the incumbency advantage literature, by providing one of the first causal estimates of both the personal and partisan effects, and to the literature on voting behavior to the extent that it provides evidence on the relative importance of party versus candidate for electoral success. To my knowledge, the only study offering causal evidence on the disentangled partisan and personal incumbency effects is Fowler and Hall (2014). Their findings, based on a sample of U.S. state legislative elections, show that incumbency is personal.         "
"7","The main differences of this study consist of its reliance on a recent natural experiment that introduces a second source of exogenous variation into the analysis and on a novel identification strategy that uses the diff‐in‐disc design to disentangle the personal and partisan effects. In addition, this article contributes to the discussion by extending Fowler and Hall's (2014) result in three ways. First, this study looks at a different country in what is a very American‐centric topic. Second, it investigates an executive rather than legislative position. Despite the greater visibility of an executive position, most explanations for a positive personal incumbency advantage are usually linked to the role of a legislator. Third, it deals with a proportional representation (PR) system. Even though a significant partisan effect is more likely in a PR system, as the focus is most often directed to the parties and the cost of updated political information increases with increasing electoral candidates, results still support the early focus on candidates.         "
"8","While it may simply convey an electorate's satisfaction with the elected representative, the existence of an incumbency advantage can also pose a threat to equality of opportunities, jeopardizing the competitiveness of electoral races and political accountability (Carson, Engstrom, and Roberts 2007). Identifying the source of the incumbency effect not only unveils who is held responsible in the eyes of the voters but also provides a better general understanding of voting behavior, eventually leading to better policy choices.         "
"9","The literature on voting behavior offers four standard explanations on how people vote: retrospectively, according to partisan affiliation, based on candidates' issue positions, or likeability. Evidence on the first is largely inconclusive. Peltzman (1987), for example, shows that voters in U.S. gubernatorial elections respond to economic conditions, whereas Oliver and Ha (2007) find no relation between voters' ratings of government performance and actual votes for a sample of U.S. municipalities. It is often argued that, at the local level, retrospective voting is made difficult by the wide range of responsibilities accruing to the officeholders. In general, evidence suggests that retrospective voting hinges on the extent to which information is available to the electorate (Berry and Howell 2007; Brender 2003).         "
"10","Also, scant evidence shows voters basing their decisions on candidates' issue positions (Oliver and Ha 2007). Indeed, information on candidates' stances is arguably hard to obtain (Conover and Feldman 1989), and assuming an at‐large informed electorate is unlikely to hold in most political contexts (Downs 1957). Therefore, information may well lie at the core of voting behavior, with better‐informed voters being less likely to be swayed by party loyalty or incumbency status (Bartels 1996), and the average uninformed electorate relying heavily on partisan or incumbency cues.         "
"11","Accordingly, several studies across different levels of government demonstrate the importance of party affiliation and partisan endorsements for voting behavior (Lee, Moretti, and Butler 2004; Snyder and Groseclose 2000), as well as the relevance of candidates' characteristics and likeability (Lieske 1989). The latter is important to the extent that inferences of competence from candidates' facial appearance correctly predict actual election outcomes of French parliamentary and U.S. congressional elections (Antonakis and Dalgas 2009; Todorov et al. 2005). This is in line with evidence in Oliver and Ha (2007), which shows that, contrary to the standard view that incumbency is an advantage particularly in smaller settings due to increased visibility and familiarity, incumbency rather becomes more important with increasing population size as access to detailed information diminishes.         "
"12","Yet, there is no conclusive evidence on whether the partisan or the candidate cue holds a higher electoral strength. Inasmuch as incumbency shapes voting behavior, identifying the driver of incumbency advantage can provide the means to infer upon the relative importance of each. A significant personal (partisan) effect means the candidate (party) is guiding voters' decisions by being ultimately held accountable at the ballot. The effect can be either positive or negative, and any but a similar personal and partisan effect implies an uneven balance of powers between the officeholder and the party."
"13","Whether the incumbency advantage is personal, partisan, or a combination of the two has different implications for politics at large. If the personal effect overrides the partisan one, parties have an incentive to renominate officeholders as well as to acquiesce to their demands. This may result in political dynasties and the capture of the political system by individual politicians. Electoral mechanisms such as term limits may be useful in this case to stimulate competition."
"14","If, on the other hand, parties benefit solely by virtue of their incumbency status, this means they retain a political advantage even when officeholders retire, allowing for more room to nominate candidates conditional on their alignment with the party and to impose the partisan ideals, leading to a centralization of political decisions. Just as before, electoral competition is threatened, in particular taking into account the evidence on the endogeneity of political institutions. In this context, term limits do not imply an increase in political competition, but electoral rules benefiting minority parties could be a solution."
"15","The institutional setting encompasses all 278 municipalities in continental Portugal for increased comparability.5 Municipalities have two local political institutions: the municipal council and the municipal assembly. The former and subject of the analysis is the collegial executive organ accountable to the assembly, the legislative organ with decision‐making power. It is composed by the mayor and 4–10 other council members, depending on the municipality's population size.6 With regard to electoral proceedings and term responsibilities, the mayor may be regarded as a local prime minister and the municipal council as a small parliament. Elections occur simultaneously countrywide every 4 years. A PR system of closed lists is in place, with seats distributed according to the D'Hont method. The first name on the winning list becomes the mayor.            "
"16","Local politics are dominated by the four largest national parties that generally run a list in every municipality. From left to right in the political spectrum, these are the Communist Party (PCP), the center‐left Socialist Party (PS), the center‐right Social‐Democratic Party (PSD), and the right‐of‐center Popular Party (CDS‐PP). Winning on average over 100 municipalities each, the two major parties, PS and PSD, are responsible for over two‐thirds of the municipal mayorships. Despite the high level of centralization and party discipline, municipal electoral campaigns are locally oriented, featuring the regional branches of the different political parties, and are led by the mayoral candidates themselves."
"17","For decades, there were no limits to the number of times local politicians could run for reelection. This changed on January 1, 2006, upon the entry into force of Law no. 46/2005.7 This law establishes a term limit of three consecutive terms for incumbent mayors, after which they cannot rerun for the municipal council.8 It was introduced as a means to avoid unconstrained overstays in office, not unusual at the Portuguese local level, and was first implemented in the 2013 local elections and binding for 150 municipalities.            "
"18","Table 1 shows that reelection rates are very high at the Portuguese local level, rendering a particularly interesting setting to investigate the magnitude and source of incumbency advantage. Before 2013, parties were reelected on average in 81% of the municipalities. On the other hand, the absence of term limits enabled a rerunning rate of mayoral candidates of 83%, of which over 86% were on average reelected. In 2013, while only 75% of the municipalities reelected the incumbent party, 83% out of 91% of the mayors who stood for reelection won.9 In addition, there is considerable interparty mobility, with candidates changing parties or running as independents, with relatively few costs of shifting allegiances. In fact, 24 municipalities have consecutively reelected mayors upon their crossing the floor.            "
"19","The analysis is based on the electoral results of all 278 municipal councils in mainland Portugal in the past 20 years. Data on local elections are available at the National Electoral Commission (Comissão Nacional de Eleições) and the General Directorate for Internal Affairs (Direcção Geral da Administração Interna) websites.10 The identity of mayoral candidates, obtained in the Official Map from the National Electoral Comission published in Diário da República, is only available from the 1993 local elections onward. As such, the underlying data set collects complete information on electoral results at the party and mayoral candidates level for the past six elections taking place in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2013.            "
"20","The two effects that this study quantifies can be formally defined as follows. The personal incumbency advantage is the difference in vote share received by a candidate running for the incumbent party as an incumbent and as a non‐incumbent in an open‐seat election in the same municipality i at the same time t. The partisan incumbency advantage, in turn, is the difference in vote share received by a non‐incumbent candidate running in an open‐seat election for the incumbent party and for the same party but with a non‐incumbent status in the same election (i.e., same municipality i at time t).            "
"21","As can be understood from the above definitions, assessing incumbency advantage is a classical example of an attempt of causal estimation with missing data, as in the context of a Rubin causal model with potential outcomes (Holland 1986; Rubin 1974). In an ideal setting, one would be able to compare the above outcomes; in reality, only part of these are observable. Lee (2008) proposes the implementation of an RDD due to its focus on close elections in order to overcome this difficulty. The rationale runs as follows. Characterized by a small vote margin (i.e., difference in vote share between the winner and runner‐up), close elections can be thought of as a mechanism simulating a randomized experiment. Parties with a positive vote margin run as incumbents in the next election, whereas parties with a negative vote margin are non‐incumbents. The zero threshold splits the treatment and control group. In a neighborhood of this threshold, comprising bare winners and bare losers, all variables determined prior to the election are independent of the resulting incumbency status. Consequently, any discontinuous jump in the vote share in the neighborhood of the threshold is entirely attributable to the change in treatment assignment and interpreted as a causal effect of the treatment (i.e., incumbency).            "
"22","However, the focus on party‐level variables does not by itself imply an unbiased estimation of the partisan incumbency effect, as suggested in Lee (2008). Let the treatment dummy  denote whether a specific party i is the incumbent at time t. Underlying this dummy variable is the party's vote margin in the preceding election, the running variable , with treatment deterministically depending on the value of the running variable as follows: . According to Fowler and Hall (2014), estimating the following general RDD model               "
"23","Since the incumbency status is always working for one party while harming the other, the RDD estimate double counts both sources of incumbency advantage (Erikson and Titiunik 2015).11 Additionally, the personal incumbency advantage is multiplied by the probability that the incumbent reruns, as this is often, but not always, the case. Parties, on the contrary, always field a candidate and therefore their probability of rerunning equals 1.            "
"24","As a starting point, it is useful to assess this combined effect. For this purpose, inference is based on two estimation methods. First, a nonparametric local linear regression restricts the sample in intervals  to estimate Equation 1 (Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw 2001). For transparency, in addition to the use of the optimal bandwidth h, selected as in Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012), two other intervals are considered: [ − 5, 5] and [ − 10, 10].12 Second, a spline polynomial approximation of order p in  as in Equation 3 estimates the effects using the full sample (Van der Klaauw 2008).               "
"25","The reliance on both estimation methods attempts to reinforce the robustness of the results and balance the usual trade‐off between precision and bias.13 Nevertheless, results should be interpreted with caution as observations move away from the zero threshold.            "
"26","Unlike the United States, there are a myriad of parties in Portugal, which poses a challenge in defining the variables at large. The strategy employed attempts to take into account regional heterogeneity and relevant political developments. As such, the 18 Portuguese districts are treated as 18 independent regions. Upon assessing the strongest party within each district over the entire sample period, the outcome and the running variables are constructed accordingly. In practice, different municipalities have a different baseline party i against which incumbency is measured. This approach not only maximizes the number of observations around the zero threshold but also enables a similar interpretation of the coefficient estimates as in a bipartisan system. Even though the identity of the two major parties differs significantly by region, it is quite homogeneous within a district and particularly within a municipality. In fact, it is rare that a municipality has more than two different parties in control of the municipal council during the sample period, and elections are usually effectively fought between these two.            "
"27","Following the literature on incumbency advantage, the main outcome variable is the baseline party vote share, and a second outcome variable measuring the probability of winning conditional on the incumbency status—a dummy variable indicating whether the party wins the election at time t—serves as a robustness test. The latter is only indicative of the direction of the effect, as the dichotomic nature of the winning probability variable makes it very sensitive to the small number of post‐reform observations. This should not bias the effect, but it affects the precision of the estimates. The interpretation of the results is therefore based on the more reliable vote share outcome variable.            "
"28","In a second step, it is necessary to disentangle the partisan from the personal effect given by the RDD estimates. Partisan and personal incumbency are, often and nonrandomly, jointly assigned, but term limits are a reliable instrument in disentangling the two (Fowler and Hall 2014). The following approach relies on the implementation of term limits as a natural experiment that keeps the incumbency status of the party constant but creates an exogenous variation in the incumbency status of the candidate. Using a diff‐in‐disc design to capture this variation provides for a new method to separate the personal from the partisan incumbency effect on electoral success.            "
"29","The reform introduces a difference‐in‐differences (diff‐in‐diff) aspect to the analysis, with term limits as a second treatment applied in 2013 to municipalities whose incumbent officeholder has served as a mayor for the past three consecutive terms, loosely defining a pre‐ and post‐reform period.14 Given the heterogeneity in treatment assignment, it is possible to rely on both between‐ and within‐municipality variation in estimating the treatment effect of introducing term limits on electoral success.            "
"30","Combining this diff‐in‐diff setting with the RDD methodology in the previous section results in an extended version of the RDD known as the diff‐in‐disc design (Grembi, Nannicini, and Troiano 2016). As the name suggests, the diff‐in‐disc design estimates the difference between the two discontinuities in the observed outcome, the one after and the one before the reform. In its essence, it applies a diff‐in‐diff to two RDD estimations.            "
"31","Formally, let  and , with , define the potential outcomes before and in 2013, respectively. The parameter  indicates a binding term limit and  indicates incumbency as before. The RDD estimator in the previous section is defined as  and identifies the average treatment effect of incumbency at the threshold as in Equation 2. The diff‐in‐disc estimator, in turn, explores the two discontinuities in the outcome variable as follows:               "
"32","Empirically, the treatment effect is obtained simply by adding the second treatment variable, , and the appropriate interactions to Equations 1 and 3 above. Likewise, it is estimated in the context of a local linear regression model as the following:               "
"33","restricting the sample to the same bandwidths h around the zero threshold as before, and resorting to a spline polynomial regression as in Equation 7.               "
"34","As is standard in the literature, a first assessment of the results is based on graphical evidence on the treatment effects. All graphs are constructed by first dividing the running variable into bins of size 1% within a bandwidth of [ − 40, 40]. The outcome variables—vote share and probability of winning—are then averaged within each bin for the pre‐ and post‐reform period (i.e.,  with the subscripts n and p indexing bin and period). The RDD graphs display these observations fit by a local polynomial plot of quadratic degree on each side of the threshold, relying on a triangular kernel. To obtain the diff‐in‐disc graphs, it is necessary to first calculate the difference within each bin between the post‐ and pre‐reform period, , to then plot these differences against the running variable and fit the observations with a polynomial plot in the same fashion as before.            "
"35","Figure 1 provides the RDD and the diff‐in‐disc graphs depicting the vote share and probability of winning in period t against the vote margin in . All graphs show a sizable jump around the zero threshold, providing evidence of a significant incumbency effect. For the main outcome variable, the RDD graph suggests a combined personal and partisan incumbency advantage of around 8–10 percentage points, whereas the diff‐in‐disc graph shows a negative discontinuity amounting to 15 percentage points for municipalities affected by the term limit. The latter plot suggests that in case there exists a partisan effect, it is not as large as the personal one. The graphs depicting the probability of winning at time t against the vote margin at  are in line with this assessment.            "
"36","Vote Share and Winning Probability"
"37","Note: Graphs plot the vote share and winning probability at time t against the vote margin at . Observations in a bandwidth of [−40, 40] are averaged within bins of size one. In the RDD graph, observations are plotted and fit by a second‐degree polynomial plot constructed using a triangular kernel. In the diff‐in‐disc graph, the difference between pre‐ and post‐reform observations is plotted and fit by a second‐degree polynomial plot constructed using a triangular kernel. The 95% confidence intervals are indicated in gray.                        "
"38","Coefficient estimates in Table 2 support the graphical evidence. Estimates follow a similar pattern across specifications with the ones for the spline polynomial approximation, which were obtained relying on a cubic specification of the running variable in the models in Equations 3 and 7, suggesting in general larger treatment effects.15 The choice of which estimates to substitute into the expressions quantifying the personal and partisan incumbency advantages is therefore inconsequential. In the following, results are discussed for the specification relying on the bandwidth selected as in Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) due to its conventional use in the RDD literature.            "
"39","In addition to the RDD and diff‐in‐disc estimates, a third input is necessary in order to obtain the personal and partisan incumbency advantages: the probability that an incumbent reruns. This is obtained by simply regressing a dummy variable indicating whether the incumbent officeholder is running for reelection on a linear function of the running variable."
"40","The first three rows of Table 3 show the estimates of the three inputs required to compute the incumbency effects. These are substituted into Equations 9 and 10, and 95% bias‐corrected confidence intervals are obtained relying on a nonparametric bootstrap with replacement clustered at the municipal level. This involves repeatedly reestimating the three inputs and substituting them into the equations in a simultaneous fashion using different random samples from the original data set.            "
"41","The last two rows of the table provide the estimates for the personal and partisan incumbency advantage with and without fixed effects. The personal effect has a consistently significant positive causal impact on electoral success. A party benefits by over 15 percentage points from running an incumbent officer. The impact of the incumbency status of the party is negative and, despite its magnitude, only statistically significant for the fixed effects model. The results for the probability of winning, in turn, identify statistically significant positive personal, and negative partisan, effects. Their magnitude is, however, too large to be plausible and is likely an artifact of the small post‐reform sample size, as previously discussed."
"42","Overall, results suggest a large positive personal incumbency advantage and possibly a smaller partisan incumbency disadvantage. The latter is, however, presumably rooted in the high magnitude and significance of the personal incumbency effect and should thus more accurately be interpreted as the disadvantage of not running an incumbent rather than a partisan incumbency disadvantage. Arguably, based on the descriptive evidence in Table 1, being the incumbent is a sure win. By ascribing this effect to the candidate rather than the party, it follows that running a new candidate undermines a party's electoral prospects. The absence of a personal incumbency advantage could thus by itself explain the considerable reduction in party reelection rate in the 2013 elections.16 The next section tests two possible mechanisms to identify what lies behind the seemingly negative partisan effect.            "
"43","This section tests two possible explanations for the baseline results. First, it tests whether a party suffers from ruling costs, as suggested by a strand of the literature on the effects of political representation on electoral outcomes (Paldam 1986). Second, it tests whether the fact that a challenger is rerunning for the election matters. Results are based on reestimations of the diff‐in‐disc models, with the dummy variable  indicating mayors who did not run for reelection after at least three consecutive terms in office in the first case, and municipalities with a binding term limit where no challenger is rerunning for the election in the second.            "
"44","Coefficient estimates collected in Table 4 suggest no consistently significant ruling costs despite the almost professionalization of the mayor‐career that characterized the pre‐reform period. On the other hand, incumbent challengers appear to be driving part of the effect. The diff‐in‐disc estimates remain negative and mostly significant, but their magnitude is markedly lower than that of the baseline estimates. This result is presumably due to the fact that the major opposition party nominee running as an incumbent challenger is not unknown to the electoral district. In fact, he was most likely part of the municipal council and the closest to the mayor figure in terms of public recognition. Accordingly, in more than half of the 2013 term‐limited elections where the incumbent challenger or a former mayor reran, they won the mayorship. The relevance of the candidates thus transpires even through the success of rerunning challengers once the incumbent mayor is excluded from the electoral race. This result lends increased support to the thesis that incumbency is personal and parties play only a secondary role.            "
"45","The validity of an RDD hinges on fulfilling the continuity assumption that implies no sorting around the zero threshold. This assumption is satisfied as long as individuals are unable to precisely manipulate their location relative to the threshold. This is plausible in the context of competitive elections, as parties cannot precisely manipulate their vote shares, and even to a lesser extent, the resulting vote margin between winner and runner‐up. Two methods can be used to validate this assumption: testing for discontinuities in the density of the running variable through a McCrary (2008) plot, and checking for any significant differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment and control groups (i.e., incumbents and non‐incumbents). The McCrary (2008) plot in Figure 2 and the graphs collected in Figure 3 testing for differences on six predetermined characteristics—the parties' vote share and winning probability in , whether the party is one of the two major center‐left or ‐right parties, if it is a coalition, whether the candidate is male or female, and his or her previous experience—show no significant discontinuities around the zero threshold, implying no manipulation and no selection bias.         "
"46","Density of the Running Variable"
"47","Note: The McCrary plot on the left graphs the density of the running variable. The McCrary‐style plot on the right graphs the change in the density of the running variable from the pre‐ to the posttreatment period. The 95% confidence intervals are indicated in gray.                     "
"48","Selection Bias"
"49","Note: Graphs test for selection into treatment for six different predetermined characteristics indicated on the y‐axis. Observations in a bandwidth of [−40, 40] are averaged within bins of size one, and second‐degree polynomial plots are constructed using a triangular kernel. The 95% confidence intervals are indicated in gray.                     "
"50","The diff‐in‐disc design, in turn, is superior to the RDD, as it captures a second source of variation combining diff‐in‐diff and RDD methodologies. The diff‐in‐diff aspect of the approach addresses any concerns with the continuity assumption described above. The RDD aspect controls for differential trends and unobservable municipal characteristics. Still, one assumption must be fulfilled in order to validate a diff‐in‐disc design: that the ability or incentives to manipulate the vote margin did not change from the pre‐ to the posttreatment period. This is tested relying on a variant of the McCrary (2008) plot that depicts the change in the number of observations around the threshold from one period to the other. There is no reason to suspect that parties are now able to manipulate their vote shares, as the right‐hand graph in Figure 2 shows no discontinuity in the change in the number of observations close to the cutoff from pre‐ to posttreatment period.         "
"51","In addition, in order to be able to identify the partisan and personal effects relying on the proposed approach, these two effects are assumed unchanged from the pre‐ to posttreatment period. There is no obvious reason why this should not be the case. This assumption can be verified by restricting the analysis to the 2005 and 2009 elections, when the law establishing term limits already existed but was not applied, to compare expiring to non‐expiring mayors.17,18 This test involves restricting the sample size; therefore, inference relies on the three data‐driven bandwidth selectors suggested in the literature (Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik 2014; Imbens and Kalyanaraman 2012; Ludwig and Miller 2007).         "
"52","Results are collected in Table 5 and are obtained relying on a local linear regression as in Equation 1 for all bandwidths above, including half and two times the bandwidth selected as in Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). The RDD estimates suggest a positive and significant combined partisan and personal effect for all incumbents, in line with the baseline estimates. The diff‐in‐disc estimates, obtained by defining  in Equation 6 to indicate expiring officeholders, provide no evidence of a significantly different incumbency effect between the two groups.         "
"53","Overall, this section validates each of the assumptions underlying the proposed approach. There exists no manipulation at the zero threshold in either the pre‐ or the posttreatment period, there is no evidence of selection bias, and both the personal and partisan incumbency advantage are unchanged by the electoral reform introducing term limits. Baseline results are, therefore, susceptible to causal interpretation."
"54","The aftermath of a constitutional reform introducing term limits in local‐level elections is the perfect laboratory to identify the personal and partisan returns to incumbency. The institutional setting, comprising 278 homogenous municipalities, an exogenous constitutional reform, heterogeneity in treatment resulting from the law ruling the application of term limits, and the verified comparability between bare winners and bare losers allows for the implementation of both RD and diff‐in‐disc designs, providing coefficient estimates suitable for causal interpretation."
"55","Results show that the original definition of incumbency advantage purposely focuses on the candidate rather than the party. Positive returns accrue to the rerunning officeholder by virtue of his or her incumbent status independently of the incumbency status of the party. Even though it would be reasonable to assume that parties play a significant role in attracting and retaining votes, particularly in a multiparty context with a PR system of closed lists (Shugart, Valdini, and Suominen 2005), the fact is that there is no evidence of a partisan incumbency advantage. In fact, the effect is negative and appears to be driven by the identity of the challenger in the sense that rerunning challengers hold a sizable political strength.         "
"56","The magnitude of the effect conditional on the institutional setting in which it emerges, together with the evidence on the importance of incumbency and personal characteristics in explaining voting behavior at various levels of government, motivate the external validity of the results. These reinforce the relevance of candidates vis‐à‐vis parties in politics at large."
"57","Conceivably, both voters and politicians will over time adapt to the new institutional setting. Preliminary assessments show, for instance, an increase in candidates' mobility between municipalities, whereas traditionally it followed a bottom‐up pattern. This is in line with the theory of political ambition and its interaction with the political structure in shaping incentives and provides an interesting avenue for further research (Black 1972; Schlesinger 1966).
