"1","A simple conceptual overview of the process illustrates how the strategic choices of potential candidates create problems in assessing the links between candidate experience and fundraising. The theoretical and empirical focus is on those potential candidates who are motivated by a desire to win the seat, and they will be referred to throughout the text as “serious candidates.” These are the type of candidates who are often described in the literature as being of “high quality” or “strong candidates” whether or not they have prior political office experience (see, for example, Bond, Covington, and Fleisher 1985; Canon 1990; Krasno and Green 1988). For the purposes of this analysis the relevant distinction lies in motivation rather than specific personal or candidate qualities. Candidates who are “serious” are in the race to win and campaign accordingly. Financing a winning U.S. House campaign often exceeds $1 million, so it is reasonable to assume that those motivated to win make a concerted effort to raise money. Such an assumption is untenable for candidates who enter for personal or nonstrategic reasons because they are not driven to raise money in order to win. They may choose to skip fundraising or exert only minimal efforts to fundraise. Accordingly, the appropriate test of the experience bonus is the comparison of experienced and inexperienced candidates who actively seek contributions to the best of their ability and the analysis is restricted accordingly. The empirical definition is detailed in a later section.         "
"2","Serious candidates strategically self‐select into more competitive races, and their assessments of their prospects of winning dominate that decision (Stone and Maisel 2003; Stone, Maisel, and Maestas 2004). Fortunately, since candidate entry temporally precedes active fundraising, we avoid the problem of simultaneity in estimating the effects of candidate experience on campaign receipts. However, the analysis is subject to a different type of problem—selection biases that arise from candidates' use of private information in deciding whether to enter a race.         "
"3","Serious potential candidates assess their prospects of winning by evaluating a number of factors likely to influence the race, including the strength of the incumbent, whether the incumbent will run, the district party balance, and the national or local political tides. Although most of the conditions that potential candidates take into account are readily observable by political experts and analysts, some of the information is private and unobservable. Private information, such as backroom discussions with party leaders or interest groups, private polling information, and other candidate‐based research might reveal to potential candidates a set of conditions that make their odds of winning appear favorable. Potential candidates' use of private information when making strategic entry decisions, however, leads to errors in any analysis of fundraising because analysts cannot fully control for the information potential candidates use to assess the competitive context that shapes their strategic entry decisions.1 Moreover, if private information is in any way correlated with the experience levels of the candidates and with their net receipts, then fundraising could be attributed, spuriously, to experienced candidacies because the decision to enter the race is based on that same private information. Such an expectation is reasonable since those with experience are likely to have a better idea of the type of information needed to decide whether to run and may use different strategies to collect information about the upcoming race prior to making their entry decisions. Since the unmeasured features of the environment are also most likely correlated with other indicators of competitiveness, models that do not account for strategic entry will misestimate the effects of those conditions included in the model as well (see Figure 1).         "
"4","                 Selection and Outcome Stages of Serious Candidates                      "
"5","This problem can be dealt with by using a Heckman selection model to address the selection biases associated with the correlation of errors that results from private or unobservable information influencing strategic entry and fundraising. The selection model simultaneously estimates the parameters for the strategic entry stage, the fundraising stage, and the correlation of the errors between the two stages that stem from omitted variables or private information. The resulting estimates are unbiased and consistent (see Green 1997, 978–81; Heckman 1979).         "
"6","The primary outcome of interest is candidate fundraising, so the main dependent variable for the analysis is nonincumbent candidates' net receipts for U.S. House races from 1994 to 2000, and the unit of analysis is a single candidate. Because the goal is to explain total fundraising, we deduct from the Federal Election Commission's (FEC's) report of total receipts any amount loaned by the candidate to his or her own campaign. The measure of “net receipts,” then, captures the total contributions from individuals, political parties, political action committees, and transfers from other candidate committees as reported in the end of cycle candidate summary files.2"
"7"," Table 1 provides an overview of the median net receipts by type of candidate. Incumbents are far better able to raise money than other types of candidates in all categories. But, Table 1 also shows evidence of an “experience bonus” that accrues to candidates with prior office experiences. This is not surprising since previous research finds that challengers who have previously served in elective office and who have run professional campaigns raise more money than those who are inexperienced (Biersack, Herrnson, and Wilcox 1993; Herrnson 1992). They typically have databases of potential donors and networks of friends in the financial community, and they are experienced in hosting fundraisers and soliciting money (Squire and Wright 1990). However, Table 1 also shows that the gap between the experienced and inexperienced narrows considerably when looking at more competitive races. This leaves open the question about the degree to which experience advantages some candidates over others. Comparing experienced candidates to all inexperienced candidates is clearly inappropriate, but comparing only those in the more competitive races creates problems of selection bias outlined earlier. Thus, we must first model the strategic entry of serious candidates and develop an appropriate dependent variable to do so.         "
"8","To create an empirical measure of seriousness, it is necessary to rely on some key assumptions about the relationship between motivation and personal investment in a campaign. First, we assume that all candidates who have held political office previously are serious candidates. This is a conventional assumption that lower officeholders do not take lightly the decision to invest the political capital, name recognition, or other resources they have earned in lower office in a run for higher office. Indeed, for many, the decision to run for higher office means giving up the lower office. Thus, the proportion of officeholders who run as a lark is likely to be quite small."
"9","The more challenging problem lies in identifying serious candidates from among the pool of inexperienced candidates who run in each election cycle. Canon (1990) finds that many inexperienced candidates are plausible, goal‐seeking candidates for office who behave much like experienced candidates. Canon labels these challengers “ambitious amateurs” and notes that they perform significantly better than other amateurs when they choose to run. We classify these amateurs as “serious candidates.” They enter a race because they believe that they have a reasonable chance of winning and sit on the sidelines when their chances appear dim. Because their motivation is winning the seat, “serious amateurs” can be expected to exert the same efforts to solicit contributions as experienced challengers. That is, they are expected to make a concerted effort to raise funds, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful.         "
"10","In contrast, inexperienced challengers that Canon classifies as “experience seeking” amateurs do not enter with hopes of winning the office. They are classified as “nonserious” candidates because they run to gain visibility for themselves or an issue, or perhaps, run as a favor to party leaders to fill the ballot. Because it is not certain that they put forth full effort at fundraising, they are not an appropriate group for comparison to experienced challengers."
"11","Although it is easy to conceptualize the difference between the two types of amateurs in terms of their motivations, those motivations cannot be directly observed. Instead, it is necessary to look to an empirical indicator of motivation, the candidate's financial investment in his or her own campaign. Unlike experienced candidates, who have visibility and connections from a prior office to establish credibility with potential donors, amateur candidates purchase credibility through committing their own funds to the race, particularly early in the race (Biersack, Herrnson, and Wilcox 1993: Herrnson 1992; Wilcox 1988). In contrast, nonserious amateurs typically invest little money in a run for office because they need not field a professional campaign, and they expect little or no return from running. Thus, willingness to commit substantial personal funds to a run for office should be indicative of the intent to campaign to win office and, therefore, indicative of a strategic, serious amateur candidate.         "
"12","Amateurs' financial investments in their campaign are measured by summing two items from the FEC summary reports: candidate contributions to the campaign and personal loans to the campaign.3 Descriptive statistics show that personal investment ranged from nothing to a high of just over $5 million. Although 10% of amateurs invested more than $110,000, 58% invested $10,000 or less. For most amateurs, the investment was quite small—28% invested nothing at all in their own campaign. It is not surprising to find that the level of candidate investment is higher in open‐seat races than in challenger races. The median personal investment of amateurs in open‐seat races was $26,137, while the median personal investment of amateurs who challenged incumbents was only $4,317. This is precisely the pattern expected if this measure taps candidate motivations and strategic behavior.         "
"13","To run the Heckman model, we need a dichotomous measure to classify serious and nonserious candidates. There is not a clear criterion for selecting a cut point, but we are guided by the principle of setting a relatively high threshold, $31,833 (75th percentile of nonincumbents) to minimize the erroneous inclusion of nonserious candidates (see Appendix A). Our goal is to restrict our comparison group to those who are motivated by the desire to win the seat, but some nonserious amateurs may be willing to invest their own money in the race simply to further alternative goals such as promoting a policy position or boosting their name recognition for business purposes. Setting a higher threshold reduces the chances of including these individuals in the analysis, though it may cause us to miss some serious candidates who invested little or no money. From the standpoint of estimating the experience bonus, erroneous inclusion of nonserious candidates would bias the estimates upward and toward rejecting the null hypothesis. Erroneous exclusion of serious candidates would simply reduce the number of inexperienced serious candidates in the comparison group. Table A1 reports results from models using different cut points.         "
"14","Amateurs who invested at least as much as $31,833 were coded as 1 and all others as 0. Following Canon (1990), the measure of serious amateurs also included those who ran a second time for the House seat and who received at least 40% of the vote in the prior election. Many amateur candidates on their second run may already have a campaign team and funding pipeline in place and, therefore, need not invest personal money to get their campaign up and running. The overall measure of serious candidates scored experienced candidates and serious amateurs as 1 and scored nonserious amateurs as a 0. Slightly more than half (51%) of the nonincumbent candidates who ran during the time period from 1994 to 2000 are classified as serious candidates by this measure.         "
"15","The first stage of the model involves estimating the probability that the party nominee will be a serious candidate. District party vote, incumbent strength, incumbent war chests, and national political tides shape the prospects of winning the general election and, therefore, affect the quality of challengers who run for office (Bond, Covington, and Fleisher 1985; Box‐Steffensmeier 1996; Jacobson 1989; Krasno and Green 1988). Accordingly, these same types of measures should predict whether the nominee was a serious candidate.            "
"16","Several different measures capture the dimensions of competitiveness at the district level, all of which represent information readily available to prospective candidates prior to the filing deadlines in their state. It is their performance as a group in predicting fundraising that is of interest rather than their independent effects, so the moderate collinearity among the measures is not a concern. The incumbency dynamic is captured by two dichotomous variables, one to indicate that the candidate is running against a “marginal incumbent” who won by less than 60% of the vote in the previous election and the other to indicate the candidate is running in an open seat.4 For candidates running against a nonmarginal incumbent, both variables are 0. District party vote is measured by taking the value of the difference of presidential vote for each party, averaged over the decade (1992–2000). Strong potential candidates are most likely to be nominated in a district with a favorable party balance, so the party balance variable is coded to reflect the party of the candidate. Because a favorable party balance in an open seat is likely to be especially attractive to strong candidates, an interaction between the open‐seat variable and the party‐balance variable is included. Also included is a measure of whether the incumbent (if running) was serving a first term, and a measure of the incumbent's war chest, his or her cash on hand at the beginning of the FEC's reporting cycle for the campaign year.5 Finally, national tides are estimated by including a series of year and party dummies and their interactions along with the change in public perception of the economy in the quarter prior to each candidate's filing deadline.6 Change in consumer sentiment is interacted with the party of the candidate to capture any reward or punishment of the president's party for economic conditions.            "
"17"," Table 2 shows the results for the selection portion of the Heckman selection model. The coefficients are from a probit model predicting the nomination of serious candidates that was estimated simultaneously along with the outcome portion of the model predicting net receipts.7 With the exception of the group of party and year dummies, the results are consistent with expectations: district conditions that appear favorable increase the odds that a serious candidate will be nominated. Open‐seat races, particularly those with a party balance that favors the candidate, are quite likely to attract serious candidates. Likewise, districts with marginal incumbents are more likely to have strong challengers.            "
"18","As expected, national tides play a role as well. When consumer sentiment is on an upswing in the quarter prior to the candidate filing deadline, a race is more likely to contain a serious Democrat and less likely to contain a serious Republican. The reference category for the series of year‐party dummies and interactions is Republicans in 1994. The negative Democrat coefficient indicates that a serious challenger in 1994 was less likely to be a Democrat than a Republican. The reduction of error in prediction for this model is 46%, and the model correctly predicts 74% of the cases. Moderately strong predictive power is consistent with the expectation that district and national conditions provide substantial information about prospects, but we also miss important private information that potential candidates glean from individual research efforts or local political activists. Likewise, the set of variables in the model cannot capture variation in the way that candidates judge (or misjudge) information about the election environment."
"19","Finally, the estimate of ρ, the correlation between the two stages of the model, is statistically significant, indicating that a selection model is warranted, although the negative coefficient shows that private information is negatively associated with fundraising.8 In other words, when serious challengers are more likely to be nominees than the model predicts based on competitive conditions, they tend to raise less money than expected in the second stage of analysis. This type of correlation is consistent with a process where candidates overestimate their prospects based on private information, such as might happen if local party leaders strongly encourage candidacies or if personal ambitions cloud judgments, making candidates overly optimistic. Failure to control for the correlated errors between the entry and fundraising stage would lead to biases in estimating the experience bonus in fundraising because inexperienced potential candidates are more prone to errors of overestimation than experienced potential candidates (see, for example, Maisel 1986).            "
"20","The outcome portion of the model explores the relative importance of competitive conditions and candidate qualities in predicting fundraising. In addition, the analysis permits a direct test of whether there is an experience bonus, a gain in fundraising that is attributable to the prior office held by a candidate, independent of the strategic entry decision or competitive conditions of the race. To assess this, the model includes a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive dummy variables representing different prior offices held by candidates, and uses, as a comparison group, serious amateurs. Because net receipts were modeled simultaneously with strategic entry of serious candidates, the estimates for net receipts apply only to those candidates who are classified as serious. Campaign context is controlled for in the outcome model by including many of the preexisting conditions that shaped strategic entry as well as by including indicators of campaign competitiveness during the general election campaign period, well after the entry decision has been made."
"21","Theoretically, the roots of the experience bonus stem from how prior campaign experience benefits candidates in U.S. House races. Offices at the highest level of the state hierarchy require professional campaigns that raise hundreds of thousands of dollars while most local offices are dominated by nonprofessional campaigns and little fundraising. Further, contributors are strategic when donating money: they seek the strongest candidates in the best races. Individuals—particularly large donors—often receive multiple solicitations and must decide to which of several candidates to donate money. While ideology plays an important role, so does viability (Francia et al. 2003). PACs seek to maximize their access to politicians, thus they give to those nonincumbents they see as likely to win (Box‐Steffensmeier and Grant 1999; Eismeier and Pollack 1986). Political parties select among the races to determine which candidates are most likely to make good use of scarce party dollars (Dwyre 1996; Hernnson 1992).            "
"22","There is already some limited evidence that candidates with certain types of prior office experience perform better than others. Squire and Wright (1990) find that state legislators with large constituencies perform better at fundraising than those with smaller constituencies. Berkman and Eisenstein (1999) find that candidates with experience in professional legislatures garner greater contributions from PACs. Although both studies demonstrate differences among some types of officeholders, neither compares them to the baseline of serious amateurs, nor do they take into account the problem of strategic entry based on unobservable information.            "
"23","To capture the variation in the experience bonus by the level of office, we develop a set of empirical expectations based on a hierarchical ordering of prior office held.9 A set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive dichotomous variables represents each candidate's background in the analysis: statewide or federal officeholder, appointive officeholder, mayor, nonprofessional state legislator, professional state legislator, and local officeholder.10 These data were collected for all challengers and open‐seat candidates during the 1994–2000 campaigns from issues of CQ, The National Journal, and various local newspapers.11 Other control variables include whether the candidate had run previously and received 40% of the vote and whether a state legislator was term‐limited out of office just prior to running.            "
"24"," Competitive Context. Because PACs, parties, and individual contributors assess the competitive context of a district as part of their decision to invest in a particular candidate, it is essential to control for the competitive context, and we include a series of competition variables described in the previous section. In addition, we include whether the party vote was closely balanced in the district and the level of competition during the campaign cycle.12 The latter is captured by a folded competitiveness ranking drawn from CQ and The National Journal during the campaign cycle and coded so that higher values reflect races of greater expected competitiveness.13 This measure ranges from 0, safe for one party, to 3, neither party favored. Contested primaries may also foreshadow a competitive general election race and prompt candidates to increase their fundraising efforts. The dichotomous measure scores one for all candidates who ran in a nomination contest with one or more candidates. Finally, the number of days between the primary and general elections represents a constraint on the time available to raise funds for the general election and thus may affect overall net receipts.14"
"25"," National Conditions.               Jacobson (1989, 1990) and Jacobson and Kernell (1981) argue that political elite—party leaders and key contributors—make strategic decisions based on the national political climate. Contributors weigh the likely impact of presidential elections and their associated “coattails,” the national economy, political scandals, and the like in determining whether it is useful to invest in candidates from each party. Since national tides, by definition, are constant across candidates of each party in each election cycle, the model includes a set of dichotomous variables for the year of the election, the party of each candidate, and an interaction between year and party to capture these effects.            "
"26","We contend that failure to account for strategic candidate entry and serious amateurs when modeling fundraising leads to biased results, and Table 3 shows evidence of this bias. The first model (Model 3.1) includes all amateur candidates without making distinctions among them. This model suggests that all experienced challengers perform better at fundraising than do amateur candidates, regardless of office held. The magnitudes of the coefficients are scaled as we would expect, with the largest coefficients attached to the top of the career hierarchy (statewide or federal office) and the smallest at the bottom (local office). All coefficients for experienced challengers, including appointive office, are statistically significant.         "
"27","Model 3.2 excludes candidates classified as nonserious. Not surprisingly, the coefficients show a sharp drop in the estimated “experience bonus” across all categories of experience. For example, Model 3.1 predicts that local officeholders raise $70,255 more in net receipts than inexperienced candidates, all else held constant. But, the coefficient drops to −3,019 and is statistically insignificant when comparing local officeholders to only those amateurs classified as serious (see Model 3.2). Even in cases where the experience coefficient remains statistically significant, such as for state legislators in highly professional institutions or statewide or federal candidates, the magnitude drops considerably. For statewide/federal officeholders and state legislators in highly professional institutions, the drop exceeds $100,000. In all, these models suggest that including nonserious amateurs when estimating the effects of experience on fundraising leads to a substantial upward bias in the estimated size of the experience bonus."
"28","Regardless, Model 3.2 still shows evidence some—not all—experienced candidates outperform serious amateurs. However, as discussed earlier, some of these gains from experience may simply stem from strategically selecting the best races, and this needs to be accounted for in the analysis. Moreover, failure to account for the role of competition in drawing strong challengers can lead to biases when estimating the effects of competition on fundraising. To deal with this problem, Model 3.3 presents estimates of net campaign receipts from a Heckman selection model.15 The coefficients in this model represent the direct marginal effect of each variable on fundraising given the strategic entry of a serious candidate. The results show that failure to account for the selection stage results in an upward bias for all experience coefficients, but the bias is not nearly as large as the bias that results from comparing experienced candidates to all inexperienced candidates. However, this model apportions much of the effect of competition to the candidate selection stage so the coefficients for the competitiveness variables drop substantially. The portion of fundraising that is attributable to competitiveness, independent of candidate entry, is much smaller than the estimates in standard OLS models.         "
"29","A central concern among scholars and observers of congressional elections is whether nonincumbents can raise enough money to compete effectively against incumbents. Indeed, this concern is well founded. News accounts of successful House challengers often show spending upwards of $1 million, but most nonincumbents raise only a fraction of that amount. Over the period of this study (1994–2000), the median spending by successful challengers to incumbents was just under $850,000 (in constant 2000 dollars) while the median spending for all challengers was only $76,487. Clearly, challengers must raise and spend substantial sums of money to compete, and we know that the successful ones do.16"
"30","But, is it typical for serious challengers to raise enough money to field a credible campaign?Table 4 examines predicted net receipts of candidates under different district conditions and with different types of prior experience, based on Model 3.3. The first column represents the “typical” race with a serious candidate: a slightly competitive district held by an incumbent. The lowest level of predicted fundraising by amateurs and local officeholders falls just shy of $400,000. Candidates with the greatest fundraising experience—statewide officeholders and highly professional legislators—are predicted to raise more than $600,000 in this type of race. The second and third columns show that expected receipts for competitive incumbent races and competitive open seats jump appreciably, with open seats yielding the greatest predicted receipts. Ambitious amateurs in competitive races against incumbents are predicted to raise almost $800,000—just slightly less than nonprofessional state legislators and slightly more than local officeholders. Legislators from highly professional state legislatures are predicted to raise slightly more than $1 million and those who have previously held statewide office are predicted to raise even more. To put these numbers in context, the median amount of incumbent spending for all campaigns was $542,549 and the median spending by incumbents in races classified as competitive by CQ Press was $1,000,430.            "
"31","Substantively, the findings from this model are significant because they suggest that both experienced and inexperienced candidates in competitive situations can raise sufficient funds to mount a credible campaign. Challenger spending is seen as the most important determinant of vote share in U.S. House elections, thus the findings from this model offer an optimistic view of the prospects for fundraising and spending, among serious candidates. Granted, this model only applies in situations where serious candidates have already deemed the races sufficiently attractive to enter. But, even candidates in slightly competitive districts raise enough money to buy visibility among voters. When analyzing vote intentions in the 1986 elections, Jacobson (1990, 350) estimated that candidates needed to spend above a threshold of $204,000 to begin to reap net gains in vote support—an amount that translates to $320,518 in 2000 dollars. Our model predicts that all candidates in races that score at least 1 on the 0–3 competition measure, regardless of their experience, would exceed that threshold.17"
"32","It appears that both experienced and inexperienced candidates can raise ample funds when conditions are ripe for competition, but how much does experience from a previous office help? The analysis suggests not much unless the candidate previously held a highly professional legislative seat or a statewide or federal office. The differences between serious amateurs, local officeholders, moderate or nonprofessional state legislative seat holders, and appointed officeholders are statistically indiscernible. Appointive officeholders and state legislators in moderately professional or nonprofessional state legislatures are predicted to raise little more than ambitious amateurs, ceteris paribus. The coefficient for local officeholders is negative but insignificant. Based on a series of Wald chi‐square tests of equality of coefficients, only state legislators in the most professional institutions and candidates who held statewide or federal offices have coefficients that differ, statistically, from every other office category. All else held constant, highly professional state legislators are predicted to raise $233,128 more than ambitious amateurs, $126,817 more than former mayors, and $189,014 more than their counterparts in less professional legislatures. Former statewide or federal officeholders are predicted to raise $375,602 more than ambitious amateurs, $269,293 more than former mayors, and $331,490 more than nonprofessional legislators. The difference of coefficients between highly professional legislators and statewide/federal officeholders is $142,476, but is significant at p = .051. Although mayors are predicted to raise $106,310 more than ambitious amateurs, the standard error around the coefficient is quite large. This is not surprising given the heterogeneity of fundraising requirements for cities of different size and media costs. But, this makes mayors statistically indistinguishable from ambitious amateurs and other lower officeholders."
"33","This research echoes previous work that shows professional state legislators perform better than other lower officeholders at raising money. Likewise, candidates with experience in offices with large constituencies, such as statewide officeholders, also perform much better than other officeholders and amateurs. However, our research diverges on one important respect—we show that ambitious amateurs perform on par with many other types of experienced candidates. Once strategic candidate entry is accounted for in the model, and the baseline for comparison is set to include those who are expected to seriously solicit contributions, the “experience bonus” essentially evaporates for several categories of experience."
"34","This is not to say that experience is irrelevant. Those holding a position that provided substantial fundraising experience and a large constituent base are obviously advantaged over other candidates. Accordingly, it is worthwhile to think about what this means in terms of representation and accountability. There are at least two possible reasons that candidates with previous experience in highly professional offices raise so much more than those with lower‐level and nonprofessional experience. First, it is possible (indeed likely) that high‐profile and professional state‐level offices select on the skills that are also best suited to U.S. House races. Those who advance to the top of the political career ladder have the skills to run professional campaigns and eek out contributions from individuals, PACs, and party leaders. Their superior campaign skills combined with ample fundraising experience make them especially strong in raising money for their House campaigns."
"35","The second possibility, however, has potentially troubling implications for representation in lower office. It is possible that the experience bonus occurs because officeholders with ambitions for a House seat actively cultivate relationships with the financiers of U.S. House elections. Those holding high state‐level offices might have a greater share of policy “goods and services” to exchange for the expectation of future support, thereby making it easier to cultivate those relationships compared to lower or less professional officeholders. This type of mechanism might lead to outside interests exerting a disproportionate influence in offices and institutions that breed ambitious politicians. Previous research shows clear links between certain types of offices and the formation of ambition for a House seat (Maestas et al. 2006). Thus, lower offices that foster ambitions might skew representational outcomes toward interests willing to fund future campaigns for higher office. Our analysis cannot distinguish between these two mechanisms, and it is possible that they work in tandem. But, the question of links between lower office fundraising, higher office ambitions, and policy influence of moneyed interests deserves scholarly attention.            "
"36","Finally, it is worth speculating about the potential effects of recent campaign finance reform based on findings related to our model. Following the general election of 2002, a new campaign finance law known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BiCRA) went into effect. The centerpiece of the law was a ban on soft money to national parties, but it also increased the individual contributions to congressional candidates from $1,000 per election per year to $2,000. How is this likely to affect nonincumbents? An analysis of net receipts from large contributors ($750–$1,000) during 1994–2000 can provide some evidence of the role of competition and candidate experience is securing large donations. Results from an explanatory model that is identical to Model 3.3 but uses large contributions as the dependent variables are quite consistent with the earlier findings. Former statewide or federal candidates are most advantaged in raising money from large contributors compared to lower‐level officeholders and ambitious amateurs.18 These findings suggest that the increased individual contribution cap contained in BiCRA disproportionately enhances the prospects of the strongest challengers. At the same time, the level of competitiveness of the race easily outdistanced prior experience in predicting receipts from large donors. All else constant, serious candidates in the most competitive races were predicted to raise nearly $140,000 more in large contributions than those in noncompetitive races. Doubling the contribution cap could prove to be a boon to all experienced and inexperienced candidates in hard‐fought races. The degree to which it enhances their prospects, though, would depend on the marginal gains from each additional dollar of spending compared to their opponent. Since incumbent House members do not receive the same boost from increased spending as their challengers, the electoral gains from spending the additional large contributions raised under BiCRA should accrue almost entirely to challengers.            "
"37","Incorporating concepts of strategic entry and political amateurism into models of fundraising improves predictions of nonincumbent net receipts and distinguishes among the different paths of influence. The analysis yields findings that diverge from conventional wisdom and from previous research. Experience matters in the money chase, but only for a small subset of candidates. Only 15% of all serious candidates in this study fell into the top categories of experience. Most had low‐level or no political experience. But, they still raised substantial funds, especially in competitive races. Indeed, this finding is quite striking and offers a more optimistic view of the prospects for nonincumbent candidates. Competitive conditions are much more influential in shaping net receipts than candidate background because competitiveness operates through direct and indirect channels. Indirectly, competitive conditions draw motivated candidates into the ring. More directly, competitive conditions put those races on the radar screens of parties, PACs, and individual donors. When motivated candidates in competitive elections call for cash, contributors respond."
"38","This research reiterates and amplifies the importance of focusing scholarly attention on the electoral institutions that shape the level of competitiveness in U.S. House races. Laws that determine redistricting processes and campaign finance regulations set expectations for potential candidates and donors alike. Jacobson (1990, 357) notes that while spending may not be a sufficient condition for gaining votes, it is certainly a necessary condition. Likewise, favorable local and national conditions may not be sufficient to guarantee a hefty campaign chest, but such conditions are certainly necessary to draw motivated and capable candidates into the race, and they are necessary to help propel candidate fundraising to the levels needed in contemporary high‐dollar campaigns.         "
"39","The consequences of spending for citizen engagement in elections are far‐reaching and, therefore, so are the implications of this analysis. In a study of voter engagement in the 2002 congressional elections, Huckfeldt et al. state, “Lavish campaign spending is one of the few devices demonstrated to yield returns in terms of engaging citizens in the collective deliberations and dramas of politics…” (2007, 810). But who is doing the spending also matters. Challenger spending in legislative elections has a much greater marginal effect on voters than incumbent spending (Gerber 2004; Jacobson 1990, 2006). Challenger spending stimulates voters' awareness and their knowledge of candidate issue positions and helps to reduce traditional knowledge gaps between socioeconomic groups in society (Coleman 2001; Coleman and Manna 2000). But none of these benefits accrue unless challengers successfully raise money. Motivated challengers tend to spend every dollar raised and then some in an effort to win the election. So, any increase in challenger net receipts is likely to translate into immediate benefits to voters in the district. Once we take into account the strategic entry of motivated candidates, it is evident that underlying competitive structure is the most important feature of the electoral landscape.         "
"40","Finally, our study draws an important distinction between the concepts of candidate experience and candidate motivation in the study of congressional elections. If the theoretical mechanism of interest is tied to resources or experiences unique to holding office, then experience is the correct empirical measure. But, the comparison group in testing such theories must be only those inexperienced candidates who have analogous motivations to win office. However, if the causal mechanism is tied to the likelihood a candidate will run a hard‐fought race, then the appropriate empirical measure is whether the candidate is a “serious” challenger rather than prior experience. We offer a straightforward approach to measuring this concept. Often, theoretical models fail to identify the candidate‐level mechanism beyond the concept of “quality” or “strength” and most conflate both concepts with experience. But, this conflation is inconsequential only if we assume that serious amateurs and experienced officeholders respond identically to the strategic environment, and this simply may not be true. Motivated amateurs, for example, might be more responsive to short‐term national forces than experienced candidates who face high opportunity costs of giving up their current office. In this case, any model that assumes “experience” is a proxy for motivated candidacies would overlook the entry of serious amateurs and, perhaps, underestimate the effects of short‐term forces in congressional elections. Distinguishing between the concepts of experience and motivation permits scholars to look carefully at similarities and differences among all serious candidates, experienced or not, and to explore whether variation in candidate‐level factors lead to differences in key outcomes of interest such as vote share, turnout, and voter engagement."
