"1","Analogy is the logic of relations. Studies show that humans have the ability to create mental maps of structural relationships from an early age and that analogy is pervasive in the way we think about the world (Gentner 1998; Lakoff and Johnson 1993). Analogy is also important in legal reasoning. Attorneys shape legal arguments by citing precedent, or prior judicial decisions, as authority for the outcomes they seek. Norms dictate that judges must use prior judicial opinions to guide their reasoning in current disputes. The Latin phrase expressing the authoritative force of previous case law is stare decisis, literally “let the decision stand.” The phrase embodies one of the central tenants of legal decision making: to the extent previous case law involves similar facts, litigants, and/or legal issues, judges are bound to follow the rules and logic set forth in prior judicial pronouncements when adjudicating current disputes.         "
"2","Judges use analogy not just to structure their decision making; it is also a way they legitimize it. Legal scholars have delineated some of the benefits of reasoning by analogy (Sherwin 1999; Sunstein 1993). Deciding disputes in this manner ensures equal treatment of similarly situated litigants; it also helps create expectations about the consequences of future behavior. Finally, the use of analogy is important because it allows for gradual evolution of doctrine based on the reasoned application of legal principles to new situations as they arise.         "
"3","Ironically, the central role of analogy in American jurisprudence has been alternatively characterized as a virtue of our democratic system and as a force that works to undermine it (Sunstein 1996). At the center of these different characterizations is a fundamental disagreement between legal and behavioral scholars about whether or not analogical reasoning acts as a meaningful constraint on the decisions of judicial actors. The debate, born out of the subjectivity inherent in case‐based reasoning, is fundamentally important given the special role judges play in our constitutional democracy.         "
"4","Case‐based reasoning involves a complex form of analogical thinking where decision makers reason between situations that share some features, but differ with respect to others. Expert decision makers may reasonably differ about which features of a situation are most important when choosing among alternative analogies. Even if decision makers agree about which aspects of a situation are important, they may disagree about whether or not these features are, in fact, similar across cases. Thus, the decision to accept a proffered analogy as authoritative in any given case is subjective, suggesting that the differential perception of precedent by people with distinct policy views may serve as a mechanism of motivated reasoning in the context of legal decision making—a kind of “wishful thinking” in which the desirability of the conclusion guides the perception and judgment of the antecedents (McGuire 1990).         "
"5","We argue that such motivated perception is not boundless. We hypothesize that objective case facts will limit motivated cognition. Where cited precedent involves case characteristics that are very similar to facts in pending litigation, all decision makers, regardless of policy views, should judge the cases to be similar; where case facts are very different, all decision makers, regardless of policy views, should conclude the cases are dissimilar. It is in the middle range of cases that the policy predispositions of decision makers should influence perceptions of similarity. Under these circumstances, decision makers should judge cases with outcomes that support their preferences in pending litigation as more similar to current case facts than cases that do not support their preferences. This prediction echoes studies of motivated perception and judgment in other domains, where predispositions leave their clearest mark on ambiguous stimuli. Hodson, Dovidio, and Gaertner (2002) studied the effects of racial prejudice on evaluations of black and white college applicants. Racial discrimination was most apparent when applicants presented mixed academic records (good grades but poor test scores, for instance). Black and white applicants with uniformly good or bad credentials were treated equally.         "
"6","Norms in the legal profession proscribing judgments based on personal political views should also constrain motivated perceptions. Taking seriously the notion that legal training and socialization should weaken the influence of attitudes on such judgments, the model of analogical perception we propose predicts a weak effect of personal opinion on judgments by decision makers with legal training. Figure 1 illustrates the model of analogical perception we propose and test in this article.         "
"7","                 Model of the Role of Policy Predispositions in Shaping Perceptions of Precedent                      "
"8","Our model of analogical perception posits three broad types of cases, defined by their resemblance to the pending litigation: cases that are very similar, cases that are very dissimilar, and cases that fall between these two extremes. This scheme simplifies an actual continuum of case resemblance, but this simplification assists the explication and testing of our model. By systematically manipulating the identity of parties and the nature of relationships between litigants in cases cited as precedent in relation to a specific “target” dispute, we can create a rough metric of objective analogical distance. By manipulating the outcome of cases cited as precedent, we can also examine how participants' attitudes on the issue influence perceptions of similarity. Finally, by conducting experiments with untrained participants as well as those with formal legal education, we can test the proposition that legal socialization inhibits this sort of motivated perception."
"9","Most of the legal writing on analogy in legal reasoning borrows from linguistic, philosophy, or philosophy of law traditions. There are precious few studies that take advantage of empirical findings from cognitive psychology about how people actually recognize and/or distinguish analogical features (e.g., Holyoak and Simon 1999). This is somewhat ironic given the strong influence of behaviorist psychology on studies of judicial decision making to date. Most studies of judicial behavior have employed statistical techniques to analyze judges' case votes, explicitly borrowing from behaviorist traditions conceiving of case votes as the primary “response” to different classes of case “stimuli” (e.g., Schubert 1962; Segal and Spaeth 1993, 2002). While such analyses have contributed greatly to our understanding of various factors influencing judges' voting behavior, they cannot explain how those factors come to bear on the cognitive processes involved in legal reasoning.         "
"10","There are several reasons judicial scholars never made the transition from behavioral to cognitive approaches to studying legal decision making. First, investigating mental processes requires researchers to “get inside the heads” of individuals they are interested in studying. Judges, as elite decision makers, pose a knotty problem of access. Moreover, they are notoriously secretive about how they go about reaching decisions. Finally, strong norms discouraging judges from divulging policy views and rendering decisions in hypothetical cases make it highly unlikely they would be willing participants in the kind of experimental studies widely utilized in cognitive psychology.2"
"11","The failure to account for cognitive processes in the domain of legal decision making is especially problematic because we have not resolved the tension between doctrinal and behavioral approaches to understanding judicial behavior. Attorneys, judges, and many legal academics still function largely as interpretivists, conceiving of the law as it is portrayed in statutes and casebooks as a meaningful constraint on judges; many do not accept findings from behavioral studies or attitudinal theories of decision making (e.g., Cross 1997; Edwards 1998). In contrast, political scientists act more like critical theorists. They stand somewhat removed from the domain they are studying, but insist it is supported by a kind of false consciousness—if legally trained academics, judges, and practitioners actually believe the law matters, they are woefully misguided about what drives decisional behavior.         "
"12","As Rowland and Carp have argued, “if the study of political jurisprudence is to move beyond its current comfort zone, we must develop a theory of judicial behavior that can accommodate political and jurisprudential influences without assuming away the judicial reasoning process” (1996, 136). Experiments offer unmatched power for isolating causal mechanisms and making valid inferences about their effects on observed behavior (Kinder and Palfrey 1993). The systematic, controlled manipulation of conditions is the chief virtue of experimental research. By measuring how participants with different policy views perceive identical case facts, we should gain leverage in explaining how those attitudes influence complex cognitive processes involved in legal decision making (Braman 2006).         "
"13","Obviously, the decision processes involved in making simple judgments of similarity are somewhat different than those involved in choosing which adversarial party is entitled to relief in a lawsuit, but they are not unrelated. Defining the zone of cases where attitudes operate in shaping simple perceptions may help us to understand where the law can serve as a meaningful constraint on the behavior of judicial actors and where policy predispositions are likely to have the greatest impact in decision making. Moreover, we believe our design strikes an appropriate balance between real‐word feasibility and the isolation of causal variables hypothesized to influence legal decision making."
"14","Experiments also have their liabilities, of course. Examining the decisions of undergraduates and law students in an experimental setting is not the same as seeing how judges or other experienced practitioners would make such decisions in real‐life situations. Ideally we would ask judges to participate in our experiments; realistically, they would likely decline our invitation. Therefore we are forced to rely on proxies with varying levels of legal knowledge to test our model. We purposefully chose two samples that vary considerably in their legal expertise. Undergraduate students have no legal training and are, therefore, unlikely to be familiar with complex decision rules judges and practitioners use when thinking about cases. We firmly believe, however, that the sample of undergraduate participants is appropriate to test the model of analogical perception put forth in this study. The decision task used as the dependent variable involves making a simple judgment about the similarity of previous case law in relation to pending litigation. It does not require any special knowledge of complex decision rules. Moreover, we do not believe that such decisions are completely unfamiliar to lay subjects. When reading media accounts of judicial decisions, citizen observers make similar judgments in assessing the quality of judicial outcomes."
"15","Moreover, testing the model on lay participants gives us a baseline to compare results with our legally trained participants. Drawing contrasts between lay and legally trained decision makers will help us determine whether legal education and socialization make a difference in the role attitudes play in similarity judgments.3 We believe that our law student participants are an appropriate sample to use to draw such comparisons. Law students are familiar with decision‐making norms actively used and subjectively experienced by practitioners in the legal community. Starting in their first year of training, law students are socialized to understand that attitudes should not play a role in legal decisions. They are specifically trained to apply tools of legal reasoning that all practitioners use to guard against the influence of inappropriate biases in decision making.         "
"16","While there are many differences between law students and judges, looking at law students is an appropriate way to start investigating how attitudes affect the cognitive processes involved in legal decision making. The effects observed are no less “real” because participants are law students. Moreover, finding effects in the law student sample is not wholly without significance. Throughout our legal system a significant number of law clerks, many of whom are fresh out of law school, are given substantial influence in shaping judicial outcomes through the roles they play advising and assisting judges in decision making. Finally, subsequent studies can be conducted with other legally trained decision makers to see if (and how) findings translate to more experienced populations (e.g., Becker 1964, 1966).         "
"17","Our experiments drew on two distinct samples: undergraduates and law students. The design of the two experiments was identical. Both experiments focused on a case of alleged discrimination. Participants in each experiment read a manufactured journalistic account of a discrimination dispute pending in the court system (“target case”). Embedded in the article was also the description of a “source case,” a prior judicial decision which the article stated “may guide the judges' reasoning” in the target dispute. Subjects in each study were asked to indicate how similar they thought the target case was to the source case cited in the article. Case facts and the outcomes of source cases were manipulated to test their effects on judgments of similarity."
"18","In the real world, cases vary on any number of factual dimensions, meaning that the decision about which facts to experimentally manipulate is somewhat arbitrary. Broadly speaking, cognitive models of similarity judgment (e.g., Tversky 1977) emphasize the relative number of common to distinctive features in the compared items. Analogical judgments differ from simple object comparisons in that one makes inferences about relations between features of the target case from corresponding relations between features of the source analog. Holyoak and Thagard (1995) argue that the acceptance of an analogy therefore depends on three factors: (1) the similarity of the features in the target and source domains; (2) the similarity of the relationship between the features in each domain; and (3) the goal of the decision maker making the analogy, or the purpose for which the decision maker wants to use the analogy.            "
"19","Applying this theory to the realm of legal decision making provides a useful way to consider how case facts and policy predispositions may interact to influence perceptions of precedent. First, one legal criterion judges consider in assessing the applicability of precedent to a pending matter is whether the cited case involves similar victims of discrimination. For instance, if a discrimination claim involves a gay man, all else being equal, precedent cited involving other gay plaintiffs should be more influential than cases involving litigants complaining of other types of discrimination. Second, the relationship between the parties to a dispute is another important legal consideration. A claim of discrimination by a gay man against his employer is not the same as a claim of discrimination against a government agency or a private membership organization. Even though each is accused of the same wrongful behavior (discrimination) toward the same type of individual (gay male), the legal obligations of each potential defendant are different because each has a different relationship with the claimant.            "
"20","Holyoak and Thagard's third insight about how the goals of the decision makers shape perception suggests how attitudinal factors come into play. For instance, if a decision maker favors the plaintiff's position in a discrimination case and precedent is cited that involves a finding of discrimination, the decision maker should judge the cited case as similar to the current dispute. Conversely, someone who favors the defendant's position in that same instance will be more likely to focus on factors distinguishing the cases and judge them to be dissimilar.            "
"21","Our experiments manipulated characteristics of litigants as well as the relationship between them to create three broad levels of objective similarity between the target and cited source case. We also manipulated the outcome of the source case so that the cited authority was either consistent or inconsistent with participants' preferences in the target dispute. Table 1 shows how the manipulations used in this study explicitly map on to Holyoak and Thagard's theory of analogical reasoning.            "
"22","All else equal, objective similarity should influence subjective perceptions of similarity. Moreover, source case outcome should interact with policy predispositions such that participants should view cases that support the outcome they prefer in the target case as more similar to the target dispute than those that do not. Because objective case similarity is expected to act as a constraint on motivated perception, however, this interaction should occur only in the middle range of cases. Finally, because legal training and socialization should inhibit the influence of attitudes on such judgments, we predict weak effects of predispositions in the middle range of cases among legally trained participants. Stated more formally, the experimental hypotheses are as follows:            "
"23","                              "
"24"," H1 (Role of Legal Considerations): Manipulations of case facts regarding the victim of discrimination and the relationship between the parties will each significantly influence participants' judgments of similarity. Subjective similarity should positively correlate with objective similarity.                  "
"25"," H2 (Role of Attitudinal Considerations [Motivated Perception]): Participants will be more likely to find cases that support their predispositions as similar to the target case than cases that do not. Specifically, there will be a significant interaction between the outcome of the source case and the policy predisposition of decision makers such that participants will be more likely to find cases that support their views as analogous to the target case than those that do not.                  "
"26"," H2A (Limits on Motivated Perception [Case Facts]): Motivated perception will be apparent in cases falling in the “middle” range of objective similarity.                  "
"27"," H2B (Limits on Motivated Perception [Legal Socialization]): Participants with formal legal training will exhibit weak effects of personal policy attitudes on judgments of similarity.                  "
"28","The purpose of Experiment 1 was to test whether judgments of analogical similarity are affected by personal attitudes and also to see if the degree of bias would be most apparent for analogies that are moderately distinct from the target case in objective terms."
"29","We presented our case information in a mock newspaper article about a dispute pending in the court system. We selected a case that was newsworthy and, we hoped, compelling to our participants. In June 2000 the U.S. Supreme Court decided Boy Scouts of the United States of America v. Dale, 530 US 640 (2000). The case involved a clash of civil rights and civil liberties where a gay male claimed to be the victim of unlawful discrimination by the Boy Scouts. James Dale was relieved of his duties as youth leader and dismissed from the Boy Scouts because of his sexual orientation. Dale claimed the conduct of the Boy Scouts was illegal under a New Jersey statute prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals in places of public accommodation. The Boy Scouts argued the Court should declare the New Jersey statute unconstitutional as applied to them, claiming it violated their right to free association under the First Amendment. Their main argument was that despite its focus on civic values and its close connection with the public education system, the Boy Scouts was not a public organization but a private membership organization. The Court, via an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, agreed. It decided the case in favor of the Boy Scouts, holding that as a voluntary organization, members had a right to “expressive association” which included the power to exclude people who did not share the values they sought to promote.            "
"30","We manipulated the facts and outcome of the source case cited as legal authority to create a 3 × 3 × 2 between‐participants factorial design. Specifically, the victim of discrimination was a gay male, a female, or a black male. To vary the relationship between the litigants we manipulated the entity accused of discrimination: another scouting organization, an employer, or an insurance company.4 Finally, the outcome of the source case was a finding of unlawful discrimination or a finding that the defendant “acted within its legal rights.”5"
"31","The victim and entity manipulations created nine source cases with distinct fact patterns. We classified each source case as close, medium, or far in objective distance to the target dispute based on the specific combination of facts. In employing this scheme we adopted a “gestalt” conception of analogical perception. There is currently a debate about exactly how individuals combine features to make analogical judgments (Taber 1998). The gestalt view holds that judgments are a reaction to the entirety of the analog that cannot be explained by simple combinations of component features. In contrast, the “feature matching” view maintains that judgments of similarity are more or less an additive combination of the extent to which individual features match (or do not match) across situations (Tversky 1977).            "
"32","The fact that psychological theory is not clear whether the process is “gestalt” or “feature matching” presents a problem for an experiment seeking to map analogical perception theory onto a very specific type of legal controversy to create theoretically based categories where preferences should operate in different ways. Our inclination was to go with the gestalt view based, in part, on legal norms about the most persuasive cases to cite as precedent. Generally cases involving an identity of victim and relationships are most desirable, but having either in the legal world means you have a case you can use to argue your client's position. As explained further below, in the first experiment the theoretical categories worked well. We classified each source case as “close,”“medium distance,” or “far” in objective distance to the target dispute based on the combination of facts.            "
"33","Our gestalt approach in creating distance categories was, in fact, informed by a relative ordering of features. We expected that participants would see source cases involving gay males and/or scouting organizations as most similar to the target case. We also expected that cases involving female victims of discrimination would be seen as more similar to the target dispute than those involving black male plaintiffs.6 Finally, we expected that cases involving employment discrimination would be seen as more similar to the target case than cases involving claims of discrimination against an insurance company for denial of benefits. Keeping this ordering in mind we considered how particular combinations of facts would influence similarity ratings to create distance categories. Based on prior research demonstrating that the identity of relationships across analogs plays a predominant role in perception (Gentner 1998; Kroger, Holyoak, and Hummel 2004), we emphasize the relationship manipulation in our classification scheme. For instance, two of the three cases in our “closest” category involve discrimination by scouting organizations (the specific entity accused of discrimination in the target dispute), and one involves discrimination by an employer. The case involving an employer in the closest category, however, involves a claim by a gay male (the specific victim of discrimination in the target dispute). Thus, we specifically hypothesize it is the combination of features that shapes judgments. Table 2 summarizes the a priori classification scheme. As one moves down the chart and to the right, relevant manipulations make it likely cases will be viewed as dissimilar.            "
"34","Two hundred and eight undergraduates took part in Experiment 1. Participants were told they were taking part in a study investigating how clearly news media presented information about legal disputes. A computer program presented the stimulus materials and also recorded participants' responses. The newspaper article described the Boy Scouts of America v. Dale case, stating that the matter was currently pending before the Supreme Court.7"
"35","After reading the article, participants judged how similar the source case was to the target case, using a 4‐point scale. We measured participants' predispositions about the policy issue raised in the case by asking how acceptable it is for a gay man to serve as a Boy Scout. This question was asked on a 6‐point scale anchored at 1 (“completely unacceptable”) and 6 (“completely acceptable”). We split the sample at the median (4 on this measure) to compare the responses of participants who expressed substantial support for the relevant policy statement with those who did not. We also measured participants' political ideology, party identification, and political interest."
"36","Full‐sample analysis We conducted univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) on participants' judgments of similarity. We tested the effects of four factors: (1) the victim of discrimination in the source case; (2) the relationship between parties in the source case; (3) the outcome of the source case; and (4) the predisposition of the decision maker. As predicted, changing the victim of discrimination in cases cited as authority had a significant effect on participants' judgments of similarity [F(2, 206) = 3.6, p= .03]. Altering the relationship between the victim and the entity accused of discrimination also influenced similarity ratings [F(2,206) = 8.08, p < .001]. These results support our basic proposition that, regardless of prior attitudes, objective case facts influence impressions of similarity between the source case (analog) and the target.               "
"37","The influence of prior attitudes on similarity judgments would be revealed by a significant two‐way interaction between outcome and policy predispositions. This interaction was not significant in the full sample [F(1,207) = .37], meaning that when judgments of objectively close, medium, and distant cases were aggregated, there was no evidence of motivated reasoning. This was not unexpected, as we predicted the interaction would be present only in the middle range of cases.               "
"38","To adequately test this hypothesis we conducted a three‐way ANOVA testing the influence of outcome, predisposition, and our a priori classification of distance on similarity ratings. Objective distance remained significant, albeit marginally so [F(2,206) = 2.68, p= .07], while the two‐way interaction between outcome and predisposition was not significant, simply confirming the prior finding of no motivated reasoning in the full sample [F(1, 206) = .27]. Most telling, however, was a significant interaction among distance, outcome, and predisposition [F(2,206) = 3.29, p= .039], indicating motivated reasoning in one of the objective distance groups.               "
"39","Findings for close, medium, and far cases Our a priori classification of cases as “close,”“medium,” and “far” matched participants' judgments, with those cases receiving average similarity ratings of 2.68, 2.53, and 2.34, respectively. We therefore ran separate two‐way ANOVAs for similarity judgments for each of the three categories of objective distance. Each ANOVA analyzed similarity judgments as a function of participant predisposition and source case outcome. The results of these separate tests should reveal where motivated reasoning was most prevalent.               "
"40","In close cases neither the outcome nor the policy predisposition of decision makers significantly affected judgments of similarity [F(1,78) = .58 and F(1,78) = .03, respectively]. Moreover, the interaction between the two was not significant [F(1,78) = .69]. Thus, case facts seem to be driving the high similarity ratings in this category.               "
"41","The pattern of results for medium distance cases is as predicted. The interaction between predisposition and outcome is statistically significant for judgments of similarity [F(1,60) = 4.61, p= .036]. Participants who favored gay scout leaders perceived source cases with findings of discrimination as more similar to the target case than cases with findings of no discrimination. The opposite pattern emerged for participants who did not favor gay scout leaders. Figure 2 shows the observed interaction.               "
"42","                 Similarity Ratings by Predisposition and Source Case Outcome, Medium Cases Only (Experiment 1)                            "
"43","In the distant category of cases we expected that all participants would judge cases in the same manner, as relatively dissimilar to the target case. As predicted, there was no significant interaction between outcome and predisposition [F(1,67) = .75]. Two unexpected main effects occurred in this category, however. All participants, regardless of policy preferences, saw analogs with findings of no discrimination as more similar to the target dispute than analogs where there was a finding of discrimination [F(1,67) = 4.14, p= .046]. Furthermore, people who stated they supported gay scout leaders tended to judge all cases as more similar to the target dispute, regardless of outcome [F(1,67) = 18.59, p < .001].               "
"44","Legal criteria matter in judgments of similarity, even among these laypeople. Manipulations of case facts involving the victim of discrimination and the relationship between parties influenced participants' ratings of source cases in predictable ways. It is equally clear that attitudes also played a role in similarity judgments. Participants' preferences concerning the policy matter in dispute led them to see cases that reinforced those preferences as more similar to the dispute than cases that did not. The biasing power of predispositions was not unlimited, however. As expected, the interaction between policy predisposition and case outcome was only evident among cases that were neither very similar, nor very dissimilar, to the target dispute."
"45","Attitudes appeared to influence judgments in unanticipated ways as well. Cases that we designated as “ distant” were seen as more similar to the target dispute when it was reported that there had been a ruling of no discrimination. Perhaps our choice of a highly sympathetic defendant in the target dispute contributed to this effect; specifically, people who like the Boy Scouts may be more likely to find cases that support the organization's position as similar to pending litigation. Unfortunately, we did not test participants' identification with, or liking for, particular defendants used in the study. Also, those who expressed favorable attitudes toward gay scout leaders were more likely than those opposed to gay scout leaders to see cases in our distant category as similar, regardless of outcome. Perhaps supporters of gay rights are more likely to see judicial outputs as a legitimate source of rights, and so perceive similarities among all cases of alleged discrimination."
"46","The purpose of Experiment 2 was to test our model with a different case and find out if legal training further constrains motivated reasoning. Legal norms proscribing judgments based on personal political views should weaken the impact of personal opinions on judgments of analogical similarity."
"47","For our second experiment we found a case that closely resembled the key aspects of Dale. Wazereud‐Din v. Goodwill Homes and Missions Inc. 737 A.2d 683 (N.J Super. AD 1999) involves the same New Jersey public accommodation statute that was initially at issue in Dale. The case concerns the right of faith‐based treatment services to exclude clients who do not share their religious views. Plaintiff, Wazereud‐Din, was an Islamic man denied admission to a Christian‐administered drug treatment program. Although the program received no direct government assistance, it did accept money from social security checks and food stamps issued by the government to its clients to subsidize costs. Wazereud‐Din argued the program's failure to admit him on the basis of his religious beliefs was a violation of his right to equal treatment under New Jersey's public accommodation statute. Defendant Goodwill Homes argued that as a religious‐based program, it had a right to exclude individuals who did not share the organization's views. It also pointed out that successful participation in the program required an openness to Christian teachings, which the plaintiff did not demonstrate. The Court ultimately held in favor of the defendant, ruling that under the specific facts of the case, the organization qualified for a statutory exemption as an “educational facility operated by a bona fide religious institution.”            "
"48","Undergraduate and law student participants in our second experiment received a journalistic account of what they were told was a dispute pending in the legal system.8 Manipulation of the victim of discrimination involved telling participants that the plaintiff in the source case was an Islamic man, a gay man, or a black man. We varied the relationship between the parties in the disputes again by manipulating the entity accused of discrimination (a religious treatment program, a community service organization, or an insurance company). Last, we manipulated the outcome of the source case so that half the participants were told that cited authority returned a finding of discrimination and the other half were told that cited authority returned a finding of no discrimination.            "
"49","Once more we classified the nine fact patterns created by manipulations, a priori, into three categories based on their objective analogical distance from the target case. A summary of this classification scheme appears in Table 2. Our greatest challenge was ranking the victims of discrimination in terms of their relative similarity. Because the target conflict involved religious discrimination closely related to belief systems and moral values, we expected participants would view claims involving sexual orientation as more closely related to the target dispute than claims of discrimination on the basis of race. We also hypothesized that participants would view cases involving community service organizations as more similar to the target dispute than those involving insurance company defendants.            "
"50","Ninety‐six undergraduate participants took part in the second experiment in December 2004; their recruitment paralleled that of the undergraduate participants in Experiment 1. Additionally, 77 law students at (university name omitted) were offered twenty dollars to take part in this study and another experiment. Willing participants set up an appointment to do both studies, which typically took less than an hour. Each was administered through traditional paper and pencil techniques. Although we made a special effort to recruit students further along in their law school careers, we accepted all students who had completed at least one year of training. Sessions with the law student sample were conducted in May 2003."
"51","Undergraduate and law student participants were told they were participating in two distinct studies. Predispositions were measured via a pretest questionnaire. Participants were told we were conducting a study to compare the views of professional (and undergraduate) students on campus. We embedded the critical measure of policy views concerning the relevant issue in the target dispute in a survey with other political questions. Using a 6‐point scale anchored by “disagree strongly” and “agree strongly,” participants indicated their agreement with the claim that faith‐based organizations should have the right to restrict treatment or charitable services to clients who share their religious beliefs."
"52","We then gave participants the article containing the manipulations, telling them that the purpose of the “second study” was to investigate how clearly legal periodicals reported cases pending in the judicial system. After reading the article, participants judged how similar the cited authority was to the target case, using a 7‐point scale. We measured participants' political ideology, party identification, and level of political interest. We also asked participants how often they attended organized religious services."
"53","Full‐sample analysis As with Experiment 1, the analysis began by examining the similarity judgments of all participants in all cases as a function of the three manipulated features of the source case (victim of discrimination, discriminating entity, and case outcome) as well as predispositions. The latter variable was created by dividing the sample at the median (three on this measure), producing one group favorable to faith‐based charitable groups' right to restrict treatment to members of the faith, and another group opposed to such restrictions. Legal training (law student versus undergraduate) was also included as a factor in the full‐sample analysis. Its influence was highly significant [F(1,172) = 26.52, p < .001]. Undergraduates (Mean = 4.78) were more likely to judge the cases as similar (law students Mean = 3.55). At minimum, therefore, our results suggest that law training sharpens attention to distinctions among cases, regardless of political attitudes.               "
"54","Changing the victim of discrimination in cases cited as authority did not have a significant effect on judgments of similarity [F(2,171) = .82, p= .44]. Undergraduates and law students responded to the victim manipulations in different ways. The relative perceptions of undergraduates conformed to our hypotheses. They rated cases involving Islamic victims most similar to the target dispute (mean similarity = 4.88); cases involving gay victims of discrimination next in terms of similarity (mean similarity = 4.79); and cases involving black victims of discrimination least similar (mean similarity = 4.24).               "
"55","Law students, on the other hand, rated cases involving Islamic plaintiffs and black plaintiffs much the same way in relation to the target dispute (mean similarity ratings for cases with Islamic and black male victims were 3.74 and 3.62, respectively). Although contrary to our expectations, this finding is not too surprising for law student participants when viewed with the benefit of hindsight. As ascribed characteristics, religion and race are each subject to “strict scrutiny” for the purposes of discrimination analysis. Thus, the fact that law student participants rated Islamic and black victims of discrimination similarly could be taken as evidence that they were using legally relevant criteria appropriately. Classifications on the basis of sexual orientation are subject to a different “rational basis” test. Yet law students rated cases involving gay men as only slightly less similar than the other categories (mean similarity rating of 3.38). Perhaps this is because, as predicted, participants viewed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as substantially similar to claims based on religion because both involve an organization excluding individuals based on their “values.”"
"56","Altering the entity accused of discrimination did significantly affect similarity ratings in the pooled sample [F(2,171) = 5.95, p= .004], reaffirming the notion that relationships among features loom large in analogical perceptions. The relative position of the three entities was as predicted, with cases involving religious treatment programs judged to be most similar (mean rating of 4.52), followed by cases involving civic organizations (mean rating of 4.42) and cases with insurance company defendants (mean rating of 3.59). The relative ratings were the same in the undergraduate and law student samples.               "
"57","The interaction between outcome and predisposition was highly significant in the full sample [F(1,172) = 8.90, p= .004]. As Table 3 demonstrates, participants rated source cases with outcomes congenial to their predispositions as more similar than cases with outcomes that challenged their predispositions. Recall that this key interaction was not significant in the full sample analysis in Experiment 1. The interaction emerged from the undergraduate sample [F(1,95) = 2.58, p= .11], but was considerably more powerful among the law students [F(1,76) = 7.83, p= .008]. This pattern of results runs contrary to the prediction that legal training should check motivated perceptions.               "
"58","The varying responses to the victim manipulations across our two samples raise concerns about using our a priori classification scheme as a measure of distance. Indeed the scheme works among undergraduates (similarity ratings for close, medium, and far cases were 5.20, 4.68, and 4.17, respectively), but the ratings of law student participants do not match our predictions (Mean similarity ratings for close, medium, and far cases were 4.04, 3.15, and 3.54, respectively). Therefore, we decided to forego our a priori predictions which incorporate the problematic victim manipulation. Instead we treat the entity manipulation as our measure of distance for the disaggregated analyses. Under this revised scheme all cases involving religious treatment services are classified as close, cases with civic organizations as defendants comprise the middle category, and cases with insurance company defendants are most distant from the target dispute."
"59","A four‐way ANOVA on the pooled sample examined the effects of the relationship manipulation (as our measure of distance), case outcome, predisposition, and legal training (undergraduate versus law student). As reported in previous analyses, the effect of relationship was significant [F(2,171) = 5.45, p= .005], while the interaction between outcome and predisposition (motivated perception) was also highly significant [F(1,172) = 10.88, p= .001]. The interaction among the three was not significant [F(2,171) = .098, p= .90], indicating that motivated perception was not tempered by objective distance in the full sample.               "
"60","Findings for close, medium, and far cases To get a better picture of how undergraduates and law students judged cases at the varying levels of objective distance, we disaggregated the sample by legal training and objective distance and conducted six two‐way ANOVAs, testing the influence of outcome and predisposition on similarity judgments. The means appear in Figure 3. There is evidence of motivated reasoning in both samples, but the pattern is stronger and more consistent among the law students. While the previous analysis did not turn up a statistically significant moderating effect of objective distance, the pattern of results among law students does match our expectations. Motivated reasoning is apparent at every level of objective distance among the law students, but the effect is strongest in the middle category [F(1,27) = 7.55, p= .01], mirroring the results of Experiment 1. Indeed, this is the only category that returns a statistically significant interaction between predisposition and outcome. Thus, case facts constrain motivated judgments in a manner consistent with our hypotheses for law students in this experiment. The overall impact of attitudes is, however, contrary to our prediction that legal socialization attenuates motivated judgment.               "
"61","                 Similarity Judgments by Training, Predisposition, and Outcome, Experiment 2                            "
"62","The pattern of results for undergraduates in this experiment is different than predicted. The interaction between outcome and predisposition is only significant in the most distant category of cases [F(1,36) = 4.11, p= .05], and rather weak in the other categories. Also emerging from the distant category was a marginally significant main effect for predisposition, with those opposing restriction of benefits more likely to judge cases as similar [F(1,36) = 3.79, p= .06]. These results, while not predicted, resonate with findings from Experiment 1. In the previous experiment, supporters of gay scout leaders saw more similarity between analogous cases and the Dale case, regardless of outcome; in Experiment 2, it is once again the opponents of restrictions (in this case, on religious grounds) who saw greater similarity between the analogues and the target case.               "
"63","This study advances our understanding of how and when political preferences influence legal reasoning processes. The finding that opinions influence legal decision making may not be news to some, but we now have evidence that points to one of the avenues by which such biases arrive. Our results support the proposition that the differential perception of precedent by decision makers with varying policy preferences serves as a mechanism of motivated reasoning in legal decision making. Participants in both studies saw similarities in cited authority that supported outcomes consistent with their preferences in pending matters. In other words, participants with diverging opinions saw the very same cases in systematically different ways."
"64","Objective case facts constrained motivated perceptions as predicted in Experiment 1 and for law student participants in Experiment 2. In each instance the interaction between predisposition and outcome was only significant in the critical middle range of cases. Contrary to our prediction, undergraduates in Experiment 2 evidenced motivated perception in the most distant category of cases. The familiar scenario raised by the Dale case may have enabled undergraduates to make finer distinctions between categories than in the less familiar case involving restriction of benefits on the basis of religious orientation. In our second experiment it could be that undergraduates saw the first two categories as substantially similar to the target dispute and the third as moderately similar. In essence our operationalization of distance did not go “far enough” to effectively capture what undergraduates would categorize as distant in relation to this relatively novel scenario. Indeed there was evidence that law students were more skeptical in making similarity judgments for all cases in Experiment 2, suggesting they were more sensitive to distinctions between cases. This, of course, is part of the difficulty in running an experiment with participants with different levels of expertise, but the possibility that each sample was using a different “metric” of distance is an intriguing notion that could lend itself to future systematic investigation."
"65","Law students as well as undergraduates demonstrated motivated perception. While these results invite cynicism about legal decisions, we hasten to add that nothing we have found suggests a conscious effort to twist the law to serve one's preferences. In fact, participants were probably unaware that their views shaded the judgments we asked of them. Across the board, law students saw less similarity than the undergraduates between the target case and the analog, suggesting that, at a minimum, legal training attunes the student to subtle but meaningful distinctions among cases. Our results further suggest, however, that these heightened sensibilities can serve political preferences.         "
"66","In this study we were looking for one very specific type of motivated perception—an interaction between case outcomes and policy predisposition. Findings indicate, however, that attitudes influenced judgments in ways we were not anticipating. In our sample of lay decision makers there were significant and marginally significant main effects for both outcome (in Experiment 1) and predisposition (in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2); interestingly, these effects were most evident in cases that were farthest away from the target dispute. Significantly, neither of these unexpected main effects was present in our sample of legally trained decision makers. This could be because legal training helps to prevent such biases, but it could also be a function of the particular cases we used in the study."
"67","Taken as a whole, our research demonstrates the utility of adapting theory and methods from cognitive psychology to studies of legal decision making—for both disciplines. From a psychological perspective our findings are noteworthy in at least two respects. First, the observed influence of policy attitudes in this context provides empirical support for Holyoak and Thagard's (1995) argument about the effect of decisional goals on analogical reasoning. Second, consistent with previous studies of analogical reasoning (Gentner 1998), both experiments demonstrated that manipulations of the relationship between the parties affected judgments more powerfully than manipulations of the parties' superficial features. Tversky's (1977) influential cognitive model of similarity judgments focuses on the ratio of common to distinctive features in the source and target. Holyoak's model of analogical reasoning, however, stresses higher order relations between features in the target and the analog. Judging the similarity between a target case and a legal analog therefore demands a relational level comparison, not merely a feature level comparison (Kroger, Holyoak, and Hummel 2004). While this seems to be the most plausible model for judging the similarity between legal cases, we do not claim to have ruled out the importance of feature level comparisons. In principle, feature similarity and relational similarity are independent, so a target and analog case could resemble one another at either level, or both. A more definitive test between alternative models would require manipulating feature and relational similarity independently (see Kroger, Holyoak, and Hummel 2004). Needless to say, we have no such strict test in our experiment, but it would be worth doing.         "
"68","Broadly, the results reinforce our contention that research regarding perception of legal precedent can be informed by findings from psychology concerning analogical perception processes in general. The study also contributes to our knowledge of the forces underlying findings of directed judicial behavior. It not only tells us analogical perception is a potential avenue of attitudinal influence in legal decision making: it suggests there are real limits on motivated decision processes, a proposition most judicial scholars have thus far failed to consider. Specifically, findings advance our understanding of how (and when) motivated reasoning can influence legal decision processes, a matter that has not been seriously undertaken since Segal and Spaeth first mentioned the concept. Finally, we hope our findings will be of note to political scientists who study decision making in other contexts where biases may operate and that they will interest those who study the role predispositions can play in the decisions of elite actors who invoke seemingly objective criteria. We believe that these are important questions that go to the heart of the efficiency and legitimacy of decisions made in our constitutional system. Legal decision making is only one of many “expert” domains where motivated decision processes may have important, democratically relevant, implications.         "
