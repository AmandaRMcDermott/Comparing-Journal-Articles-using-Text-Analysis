"1","The empirical model tests the effect of television advertisements that favor and oppose passage of propositions on various outcome measures. Television markets encompass one or several counties, and these counties constitute the unit of analysis. The model is written as                "
"2","The point estimates on campaign advertising are biased when factors in the error term ɛij are correlated with campaign spending. This is the case when unobserved or omitted variables are correlated with election outcomes and campaign advertising. Suppose the likelihood of success is not fully accounted for in the regression model. Then, if a sponsoring group campaigns heavily when a ballot measure is in danger of failing, but does not spend many resources when defeat is certain, ordinary least‐squares estimation underestimates the effect of campaigning. In this study, I control for the overall popularity of a ballot proposition through an indicator variable (αi) for each ballot measure. This indicator controls for the degree of popularity across all counties.6 Since popularity of measures and advertising also differs across counties, I further include an indicator variable for each county (μj).            "
"3","This fixed‐effects approach (Mundlak 1963) solves the endogeneity issue when all counties have the same willingness to support each measure. If some counties are more likely to favor passage of some proposition than others, some bias remains.7 Interacting county and indicator effects would allow for a different response in each county for each measure, but introducing these interaction terms is impossible because the model would contain insufficient degrees of freedom. One way of allowing county responses to differ from one group of propositions to another is to categorize ballot propositions into conservative and liberal and to estimate separate regressions for both categories.8"
"4","I implement the latter approach by including one set of county indicators for ballot propositions favored by conservative groups and another set of county indicators for ballot propositions favored by liberal groups. The classification of propositions is based on endorsements by the Los Angeles Times. Although the LA Times is an independent newspaper, there is evidence that it tends to favor the liberal view on issues (Groseclose and Milyo 2003). Ballot measures supported by the LA Times tend to be supported by liberal groups and issues opposed tend to be supported by conservative groups. I will examine whether the regression results from this specification are similar to the specification described in equation (1).            "
"5","Given that I use these county indicators, I cannot include county population, income, education, and other socioeconomic variables from the 2000 Census in the regression because the county fixed effects are perfectly co‐linear with socioeconomic variables that do not change within the county over the time period examined in this article (2000–2004)."
"6","However, before reporting results from the fixed‐effects regressions, I will present estimates without fixed effects, using partisanship and socioeconomic characteristics as explanatory variables. Scholarly work has documented that partisanship is the most important predictor of individual voting on initiatives and referendums (Bower, Nicholson, and Segura 2006; Bowler and Donovan 1998; Branton 2003; Hero and Tolbert 1996; Smith and Tolbert 2001), as well as aggregate voting (Smith and Tolbert 2001; Tolbert and Hero 1996). The partisanship measure employed in this article is the percent of registered Republicans in a county in each election.            "
"7","Among the socioeconomic variables I include are annual countywide unemployment rates as a measure of the economic conditions in a county (Smith and Tolbert 2001; Tolbert and Hero 1996). Further, as in Hero and Tolbert (1996), Tolbert and Hero (1996), and Smith and Tolbert (2001), I include one index measuring racial diversity and one index measuring ethnic diversity.9 I also include education; median income; a measure of age, namely percent of the population above 65; and urbanization as determinants of voting decisions. All of the socioeconomic variables except the unemployment rate are from the 2000 Census and thus do not vary over the examined time period. They therefore cannot be included in the fixed‐effects regressions because the nontime varying county characteristics are perfectly collinear with fixed effects. The source for county‐level unemployment data is the California Employment Development Department.            "
"8","Since partisanship varies from election to election, I also include this variable in the Xij vector in the fixed‐effects specification of equation (1). If campaign advertising is a function of changing partisanship within counties, omitting this variable may result in biased coefficients.            "
"9","An alternative to the fixed‐effects approach, proposed to address the endogeneity of campaigning, is removal of the bias though instrumental variable estimation. This method produces unbiased coefficients if the instruments are uncorrelated with the error in equation (1), but are correlated with campaign advertising. As a robustness check for the fixed‐effects approach, I will estimate the model using instrumental variables. Instruments chosen are the number of measures on the ballot, number of undecided voters, and the price of advertising per voter. Price of advertising and number of measures on the ballot are predicted to be negatively correlated with campaign spending. Number of voters undecided is predicted to have a positive effect on spending because advertisers have an incentive to spend more in areas where voters are undecided. The price of advertising is obtained from SQAD, and the number of undecided voters is obtained from the California Field Poll.            "
"10","For the proposed research design it is most promising to analyze ballot propositions in California, where television advertising occurs for several ballot propositions within the same television market. A television market is defined by the boundaries of the Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA). The California television markets included are Fresno‐Visalia, Los Angeles, Sacramento‐Stockton‐Modesto, San Diego, and San Francisco‐Oakland‐San Jose.10 According to equation (1), the unit of observation is a county, and I am including counties that lie completely within one of these DMAs. The Fresno‐Visalia DMA has six counties, Los Angeles has five counties, Sacramento‐Stockton‐Modesto has 14 counties, San Diego has one county, and San Francisco‐Oakland‐San Jose has 10 counties.11"
"11","Included in the sample of ballot measures are those for or against where at least one television advertisement was aired in one of the California markets. From March 2000 to March 2004 a total of 46 propositions appeared on California ballots.1 This study includes only those ballot propositions where one can clearly link a television ad to a specific ballot proposition. Ads that favored or opposed the passage of several ballot propositions and the corresponding ballot propositions were excluded.14 This leads to the elimination of six ballot propositions. The California governor recall in the fall of 2003 was also excluded because the recall was more like a candidate election than a vote on a proposition that can lead to a change in legislation.15"
"12","Data on vote returns at the county level come from the California Secretary of State (http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections) and data on advertising come from the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which collects data on political advertising in the major television markets. The data cover ballot proposition advertising in California from the primary in 2000 to the primary in 2004.            "
"13","The election results from the counties analyzed count for roughly 80% of the overall votes cast in California (Appendix Table A3). The margins of victory in this sample are very similar to the margins of victory in the state. The data selection criteria mentioned previously result in 18 ballot propositions with television advertising expenditures in this time period. These propositions account for 70% of total ballot proposition spending. Nine of these ballot propositions passed and nine were defeated. The supporting interest group outspent the opposing group on all nine ballot measures that passed, and the opposing side outspent the supporting side on three of the measures that were defeated.            "
"14"," Table A1 in the appendix describes total and average campaign spending as well as advertising on California ballot measures from March 2000 to March 2004. The data show that close to a half‐billion dollars was spent in this period advocating either passage or defeat of 46 ballot propositions.16 Twenty‐seven of these ballot propositions passed. Examining the sample of ballot propositions where at least some spending is reported, average spending per ballot proposition was $14 million.17 Spending by the supporting groups outweighed spending by the opposing groups. Parallel to the spending numbers, the number of TV spots supporting passage outweighed the number of spots opposing passage.            "
"15"," Table A2 of the appendix describes the means and standard deviations of the main variables used in this study. The average vote share in favor of passage was 45.4 percentage points, and in 35% of the county‐proposition observations a majority voted in favor of passage.            "
"16","An alternative to television advertising as a measure of interest group activity is the use of total campaign expenditure. Unfortunately, this measure is not available at the county level, so it is impossible to attribute a certain amount of spending to mobilizing and informing voters in a county. However, regional data are important to introduce indicators for voter preferences and ballot propositions, which will allow identification of a causal effect of campaigning on ballot proposition outcomes."
"17"," Waters (2002) estimates that paid advertisements, which include TV, radio, and mass mailings, constitute about 55% of total campaign expenses in a typical ballot campaign. Price (1988) notes that electronic media spending is often the largest single campaign expense. In California, interest group filings show that for the ballot measures analyzed in this study, campaigns that engaged in television advertising expended 38% of their total budget on this type of advertising (California Secretary of State, http://dbsearch.ss.ca.gov).            "
"18","If advertising costs are the same for each voter, one could use total advertising expenditure, as long as the fixed costs of running a campaign, such as lawyer fees, are equal across ballot proposition campaigns. This then would require one to obtain advertising spending by television markets in order to control for endogeneity of voter preferences and ballot proposition characteristics. However, the cost of reaching a voter differs by the advertising market and thus spending does not map directly onto the advertising airtime to which voters are exposed."
"19","In the third quarter of 2000, the cost‐per‐point measure, an estimate of the advertising price that has to be paid to reach 1% of the audience, was $97 in Fresno‐Visalia, $234 in Sacramento‐Stockton‐Modesto, $302 in San Diego, $735 in San Francisco‐Oakland‐San Jose, and $1,676 in Los Angeles. Prices are not solely determined by population size, and doubling the households does not double the price. For example, the number of households in the Fresno DMA in the year 2000 was 500,000 while the Los Angeles DMA had over 5,200,000 households. Thus, prices in the Los Angeles DMA were 17 times more expensive than those in Fresno‐Visalia, even though the Los Angeles DMA had a population approximately 10 times larger. Thus, per voter, a given amount of advertising spending bought fewer advertisements in Los Angeles than in Fresno‐Visalia. Prices are not regulated by the government and are thus set by supply and demand, which in turn depends on local programming choices and local economic conditions."
"20","Before estimating the fixed‐effects specification in equation (1), I estimate pooled OLS regressions, using partisanship and socioeconomic county characteristics as explanatory variables.18Table 1 reports the results using the percentage of voters supporting the ballot measure as the dependent variable. The first two columns report the result for the linear and log specifications when pooling all ballot measures.19"
"21","To test whether the variables have a different effect on voter support for a ballot measure depending on whether a measure is viewed as conservative or liberal, I distinguish between ballot propositions opposed and favored by the LA Times.20 Of the 18 ballot propositions analyzed in this paper, the LA Times endorsed the opposing side seven times and the supporting side 11 times. Columns 3 and 4 of Table 1 are based on the subsample of ballot measures supported by the LA Times, and columns 5 and 6 are based on the subsample of ballot measures opposed by the LA Times.         "
"22","The point estimates on supporting and opposing advertisements have the anticipated signs and are statistically significant in all but one of the specifications in Table 1. As in previous work, the point estimates on opposing advertising are significantly larger in absolute value than those on supporting advertisements. This finding may be due to the endogeneity of advertising, which is an issue that I will address in the next tables. Among the control variables, partisanship is statistically significant for five of the 6‐point estimates. The percent registered Republican has a negative and statistically significant effect both on the percent of voters favoring passage in the full sample and in the sample of measures supported by the LA Times. The effect of the partisanship variable is positive and statistically significant in the subsample of ballot measures opposed by the LA Times. These findings show that Republican registered voters oppose passage of liberal measures and support passage of conservative measures.         "
"23","Among the other variables, higher unemployment and urbanization rates tend to increase the likelihood that voters favor passage of overall ballot measures, and this finding is driven by the positive effect of these variables on liberal measures. College education and the percent above age 65 increase the percent of voters favoring ballot measures supported by the LA Times.         "
"24"," Table 2A presents these results when controlling for the endogeneity of advertising via both county and proposition fixed effects. In the first two columns the dependent variable is the percent of individuals supporting passage; in the next two columns the dependent variable is the difference in votes supporting and opposing passage; and in the last two columns the dependent variable is a binary indicator measuring whether the ballot proposition received a majority of votes in the county.         "
"25","All campaign‐spending point estimates have the anticipated sign and, with one exception, the estimated coefficients are statistically significant. Overall, there is strong support for the hypothesis that advertising has an effect on ballot proposition outcomes. In one specification, the marginal impact of opposing advertising is significantly larger than the impact of supporting advertising (using the 5% level as a criterion). In all other specifications, supporting advertising is at least as productive as opposing advertising."
"26","The partisanship variable in Table 2A has a negative sign in all specifications and four of the point estimates are statistically significant.21 Since the partisanship coefficients are identified by changes over time within a county, it suggests that as counties become more conservative, they are more likely to oppose ballot measures.22"
"27","The point estimates on advertising in Table 2A, column 1 imply that an additional 100 supporting advertisements increase the vote share by 1.1 percentage points and a one standard deviation increase raises the vote share by 4.4 percentage points. A corresponding increase in opposing advertising lowers the vote share by 0.6 percentage points and 2.2 percentage points respectively. Conditional on nonzero (i.e., positive) advertising amounts, the mean for supporting advertisements in a county is 578 advertisements, and for opposing advertisements 489. Thus, the point estimates imply that the supporting side must increase advertising by 18% relative to the mean in order to obtain a 1.1 percentage point increase in the percent of voters favoring passage, and that the opposing side must increase its advertising by 20% to obtain a 0.6 percentage point increase in voter support.         "
"28","The log estimates, which allow for diminishing returns to advertising, also reveal that campaign spending is effective in affecting vote shares. The estimates (Table 2A, column 2) imply that a one standard deviation increase in log advertising leads to a 9 percentage point increase in voters favoring passage, and that a one standard deviation decrease in opposing advertising leads to a 3 percentage point decrease in support for the ballot measure. Further, the point estimates on log advertising in Table 2A, column 2 imply that supporting advertising was able to secure a majority in 37% of all counties where advertising occurred, and that opposing advertising secured defeat in 1% of all counties where advertising occurred. Aggregating over all counties, the estimates imply that supporting advertising was able to change the outcome from defeat to passage in seven of the 18 ballot measures examined. While opposing advertising had an effect on the margin of defeat of propositions, the estimates suggest that it did not swing from passage to defeat. Thus, while the marginal effects of supporting and opposing advertising are roughly equal, supporting spending affected outcomes because average supporting spending was higher than average opposing spending.1"
"29"," Table 2B presents regression results when allowing for separate‐county fixed effects depending whether a ballot measure was supported or opposed by the LA Times. Thus, the regression includes one set of county indicators for ballot propositions supported by the LA Times and another set for those opposed by the LA Times. This specification allows voters' preferences for or against the ballot measure to differ across these two ballot proposition types. The new regression results show that the previous results are robust with respect to this new specification. For example, 100 advertisements increase the vote share by 0.74 percentage points for the favoring side and 0.52 percentage points for the opposing side (Table 2B, column 1). Both point estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level. The productivity differential between supporting and opposing advertising is narrower in Table 2B than in the corresponding regressions in Table 2A. In five of the six specifications, supporting and opposing advertising have equal marginal effects, using the 5% significance level. In the sixth specification, the difference is statistically significant at the 5.4% level. These results suggest that the supporting and opposing advertising are not significantly different from each other with respect to their ability to influence ballot measures. As one would expect from the inclusion of county indicators by ballot proposition type, relative to Table 2A the R‐square increases in all specifications.         "
"30","The previous estimates are based on counties that lie wholly within one television market. There are, however, counties that lie only partially in a television market. For example, only approximately one‐third of Kern and Riverside counties lie within the Los Angeles DMA.25 If some individuals in these counties cannot watch these advertisements because they are not part of the Los Angeles DMA, then one predicts that in these counties the marginal impact of advertising should be smaller than the marginal impact in those counties that lie completely within the DMA boundaries. For the regression equation (1), this hypothesis implies that counties that lie only partially in a DMA have a lower responsiveness to advertisements than those which are located fully within a DMA. Support for this hypothesis enhances the confidence in the previous results.         "
"31"," Table 3 presents the results for various specifications that have the vote share as the dependent variable. Results for the other two dependent variables are similar to those reported here and can be obtained from the author upon request. In each specification in Table 3, the impact of advertising on voting behavior is smaller in counties that lie only partially in a DMA. For example, Table 3, column 1 suggests that 100 additional supporting advertisements lead to a 1.13 percentage point increase in votes from counties that are fully within a DMA and a 0.41 percentage point increase in votes from counties that lie only partially in a DMA. Opposition advertising leads to a 0.63 percentage point decrease in the percent of votes supporting the ballot measure if the county lies completely within a DMA, and to a 0.09 percentage point decrease if the county lies partially within a DMA.         "
"32","One concern regarding the endogeneity of advertising is that there may be heavy advertising in those counties where there is initially low support for the positions of advertisers. Without explicitly accounting for the initial support levels, the regressions may be subject to an omitted variable bias. The previous regressions addressed this by including county and proposition fixed effects. An alternative way to address the omitted variable concern is to explicitly include a measure of initial support in the regression equation. Including such a measure also allows for testing the hypothesis that political advertisements change citizens' voting intentions relative to an initial baseline."
"33","The California Field Poll asks respondents whether respondents intend to vote yes or no on ballot measures. This question is asked for most ballot measures analyzed in this article. Using these responses, I constructed a measure of voting intention, which is defined as the percent of respondents in a California county favoring passage of the measure. To obtain this measure, I only used Field Polls prior to the beginning of television advertising in support of or opposition to ballot measures."
"34"," Table 4 reports results from these regressions. The dependent variable is the share of voters supporting passage. Since the voting intentions variable is a summary measure of a county's preference to support or oppose the measure, I excluded county fixed effects.26 The number of observations is lower than in previous regressions because the Field Poll does not obtain voter opinion for each ballot measure. The point estimate on voting intentions is positive and statistically significant, indicating that the higher the initial support for a measure, the higher the support at the polls. All but one of the advertising coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level when controlling for voting intentions prior to the airing of advertising. The magnitudes of the coefficients are similar to those in the previous tables. The results lend support to the hypothesis that both supporting and opposing ballot measure advertising alter voting decisions.         "
"35","As a final robustness check, I estimate the model that explains the percent of voters favoring passage using instrumental variable estimation, applying the instruments discussed in Section II B. In the first (unreported) stages for supporting and opposing advertising, the instruments price of advertising and number of measures on the ballot have the predicted negative and statistically significant effects on the amount of advertising. The sign on the number of undecided voters is positive and statistically significant in one of the first stages. The set of instruments meet the typical criteria for valid instruments. In the second stage, the coefficient on log positive advertising is 10.7 and on log negative advertising −9.8.27 Both point estimates are statistically significant and the hypothesis that both coefficients have equal magnitude cannot be rejected. In the linear specification, the point estimate on positive advertising is 1.80 and on negative advertising −3.1. In this specification, both point estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level. Therefore, the results from the robustness test are broadly consistent with the findings from the fixed‐effects model.         "
"36","Previous work on ballot measures has argued that money is ineffective in passing initiatives and that campaign expenditures have little influence in determining outcomes. These studies have found that when campaigning has an impact, it is in defeating initiatives. Contrary to previous work in this research area, this article documents that interest groups on both sides can influence policy outcomes in the direct legislation process."
"37","This study addresses the endogeneity of advertising by suggesting a research design that allows for controlling of voter preferences and initiative particulars. This research design leads to different conclusions with respect to the effectiveness of advertising than those reached in the previous literature because both opposing and supporting campaigning have a statistically significant impact on voting outcomes. Further, the results do not support the claim that opposition advertising is much more effective than supporting advertising. Instead, this study shows that in several specifications the supporting side's campaigning has a larger marginal impact than that of the opposing side. For example, one set of estimates suggests that an additional 100 supporting advertisements increase the percent of votes in favor by 1.1 percentage points and a corresponding change for opposition advertising lowers this percentage by 0.6 percentage points. In 2000, the average cost of a TV spot purchased by a supporter or opponent of a California ballot measure was estimated at $1,550 (Wisconsin Advertising Project). This implies that an expenditure of roughly $155,000 can purchase between a 1.1 percentage point increase when spent by supporters, and 0.6 percentage point decrease in support when spent by opponents. However, the influence of interest groups is mitigated because these groups compete. Although money spent on campaigning is important to outcomes, resources spent to support and oppose at least partially offset each other. Competition among interest groups restricts the influence of an individual group."
"38","The evidence that interest groups' resources can influence ballot measures does not imply that campaign advertising serves no useful role in making collective decisions. The welfare implications of these findings depend crucially on the functions of campaign advertising. If ballot measure advertising primarily informs voters, as suggested by some (Bowler and Donovan 1998; Lupia 1994), then advertising may increase voter welfare. Future research may want to examine why supporting interests in California have outspent opposing advertising in recent years, and to examine other states to study whether interest group pressure is equally likely to overturn the status quo as the findings in this article indicate.
