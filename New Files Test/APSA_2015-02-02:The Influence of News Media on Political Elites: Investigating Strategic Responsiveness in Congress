"1","A simple model of democratic representation draws a direct line between the public and elected officials, with elections acting as the mediator. Elections keep career‐minded politicians connected to those they represent. If they want to stay in office, elected representatives must heed their constituents' preferences. On balance, the system appears to work. There is indeed a correlation between public opinion and policy outputs in the United States (Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995) and in other democratic countries (Soroka and Wlezien 2010). Nonetheless, evidence of congruence between citizen preferences and public policy also hides a great deal of variation in responsiveness. In the context of the United States, members of Congress are not equally responsive across issues (Miller and Stokes 1963; Soroka and Wlezien 2010). They are also not equally responsive to all constituents, giving more attention to politically active and attentive voters (Arnold 1990; Bergan 2009; Fenno 1978; Griffin and Newman 2005).         "
"2","Part of the explanation for gaps in responsiveness lies in the fact that even if elected representatives want to be faithful delegates to their constituents, they operate with considerable uncertainty regarding the preferences of their constituents (Broockman and Skovron n.d.; Butler and Nickerson 2011; Kingdon 1989). As a result, they construct a belief about constituent preferences from readily available information. Attentive voters tend to have strong opinions (Zaller 1992), are more likely to contact elected officials about pending legislation (Schlozman and Brady 1995), and are more willing to withdraw their support for legislators who deviate from their preferences (Ansolabehere and Jones 2010). Consequently, legislators are more likely to move in the direction of constituent preferences when the given issue is salient to attentive publics (Gilens 2012), since they tend to have a more coherent sense of what attentive constituents prefer (Bergan 2009; Fenno 1978).         "
"3","Nevertheless, uneven responsiveness cannot simply be attributed to information asymmetries. Members of Congress are forced to consider multiple competing principals in an effort to achieve their various goals (Kingdon 1984; Maltzman 1997). Career‐minded legislators are not simply interested in being faithful delegates; they also possess their own policy goals and institutional ambitions. By cooperating with their party leadership, legislators increase their chances of achieving goals through repeated coordination (Aldrich 1995; Schwartz 1989) and institutional advancement (Coker and Crain 1994). Consequently, ambitious members of Congress must balance their constituents' preferences (or at least their perceptions of them) with the demands of their legislative party (Carson, Koger, Lebo, and Young 2010; Lebo, McGlynn, and Koger 2007).         "
"4","From this balancing act emerges a pattern of strategic responsiveness. Legislators are more likely to consider constituent preferences when voters are paying attention. Highly salient pieces of legislation offer one example in which members have cause to be particularly conscientious about voter preferences (Arnold 1990; Grose and Oppenheimer 2007; Nyhan, McGhee, Sides, Masket, and Greene 2012). Yet, such instances are relatively rare (Binder 2003; Howell, Adler, Cameron, and Riemann 2000) and therefore cannot be responsible for motivating most legislative decisions. In contrast, elections provide key focal points for voters, drawing their attention as Election Day approaches (Gelman and King 1993). Elections elevate the visibility of legislative behavior and thereby reduce the monitoring costs incurred by voters (Kalt and Zupan 1990). When elections are distant, legislators are freer to pursue other goals, casting votes they would be unlikely to cast if elections were near (Ahuja 1994; Elling 1982; Lindstädt and Vander Wielen 2011). Voting patterns in the U.S. House of Representatives reflect this sort of strategic thinking. Fixed two‐year terms create a predictable cycle of voter attentiveness wherein House members are more likely to cast party‐line votes early in their election cycle and shift their voting behavior toward constituent demands late in the election cycle, when elections are proximate (Lindstädt and Vander Wielen 2014).         "
"5","Because legislators are often uncertain about what their constituents want, news media can shape their beliefs about constituents' preferences in at least two ways. First, elected officials and their staff consume a variety of news and often infer citizen preferences directly from the content of news coverage (Herbst 1998; Linsky 1986; Yanovitzky 2002). Second, by motivating attentive constituents to communicate their preferred positions to elected representatives, news coverage can also influence legislators through an indirect route (Paek, Yoon, and Shah 2005).1 Whatever the pathway, extant research demonstrates that the quality of local newspaper coverage can induce members of Congress to be more responsive and active legislators (Besley and Burgess 2001; Campbell, Alford, and Henry 1984; Cohen, Noel, and Zaller 2004; Snyder and Strömberg 2010). We contend that news coverage need not be local in nature in order to affect members' perceptions of their constituents' preferences. After all, congressional legislation often addresses national issues—issues that attract national news coverage and go beyond the parochial interests of their district. Same‐sex marriage, tax policy, matters of national defense, and the like can influence voting behavior in congressional elections as much as or more than the decision to build a new post office (cf. Gronke 2001; Stein and Bickers 1994).2"
"6","During the latter half of the 20th century, most Americans learned about national news from broadcast television networks (Chaffee and Frank 1996). Because broadcast signals were relatively consistent across the country and broadcast news programs offered similar content about national political issues (Williams and Delli Carpini 2011), members of Congress were confronted with essentially uniform media environments. However, technological and regulatory changes of the last 30 years have transformed the television landscape, giving viewers nearly limitless options.3 More channels have afforded media companies the opportunity to “narrowcast” television content (Hamilton 2005), resulting in cable television networks tailored to different segments of the public. Partisan news networks emerged from this fragmented media environment (Webster 2005), giving people ideologically slanted alternatives to mainstream news (Stroud 2011).         "
"7","The spectrum of partisan news media did not emerge simultaneously. Conservative news got a considerable head start. Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corporation, conceived of a 24‐hour cable news channel in the early 1990s to compete with CNN. The new station, Fox News Channel, began transmitting on October 7, 1996, and offers a consistently conservative point of view, at least relative to other television news stations (Groseclose and Milyo 2005). Because cable service providers in the United States are decentralized, Fox News did not appear simultaneously in every cable news market. Instead, Fox Broadcasting had to negotiate with each cable company to include Fox News in its lineup. Consequently, Fox News Channel was rolled out between the late 1990s and mid‐2000s in a fashion that was unrelated to key political characteristics of the audiences (DellaVigna and Kaplan 2007).         "
"8","Treating the incremental rollout of Fox News as a natural experiment, previous researchers have found that the introduction of the conservative outlet into media markets likely increased turnout among Republican voters and induced Independents to vote for the Republican presidential candidate in the 2000 election (DellaVigna and Kaplan 2007; Hopkins and Ladd 2014). Likewise, Clinton and Enamorado (2014) find evidence that Fox News caused members of Congress to marginally reduce their support for President Clinton. We use the introduction of Fox News and the exogenous shock to the media environment it created to investigate the ways in which strategic responsiveness moderates the influence of national news media on legislative behavior.4"
"9","On balance, Americans—and congressional election voters in particular—dislike displays of partisanship and punish members of Congress who exhibit high levels of party loyalty. Not only are these members more likely to encounter quality challengers (Carson 2005), but they are also more likely to experience electoral repercussions (Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Carson, Koger, Lebo, and Young 2010). Because toeing the party line helps members attain policy and career advancement goals, they must balance the need to demonstrate party loyalty with the need to be responsive to their constituents' desires for partisan independence. Consistent with the strategic responsiveness theory, elected representatives are more likely to exhibit partisanship early in the election cycle and less partisan voting as elections approach (Lindstädt and Vander Wielen 2014). If the national news media influence members' perceptions of their constituents' preferences, then the introduction of Fox News should alter this pattern of “dynamic partisanship.”         "
"10","Like other news media outlets, the effects of Fox News on member voting behavior could operate via direct or indirect routes. Members watching Fox News may infer that it will cause more voters in their district to prefer that they support Republican positions, especially on issues that divide the two major parties (see Brock, Rabin‐Havt, and Media Matters for America 2012). Alternatively (or additionally), Fox News may have mobilized Republican voters to contact their representatives and urge them to back the Republican Party on particular pieces of legislation (see Levendusky 2013). Consequently, even if Fox News reached a small fraction of members' districts, it could still alter those members' perceptions about their constituents' preference for partisanship (Arceneaux and Johnson 2013).         "
"11","We introduce Figure 1 to aid the illustration of our hypotheses. The x‐axis represents the proximity of the general election, and the y‐axis represents the probability that a member casts a vote with his or her party. The lines convey the predicted pattern of partisanship across the election cycle: the dotted line for members in districts without Fox News and the solid line for districts with Fox News. We ask that the reader ignore, for the moment, the notation appearing in the figure; we will return to this in our discussion of the empirical model (see p. 8). Members of Congress who serve districts without Fox News should behave as extant research predicts, by operating under the presumption that their constituents will punish them for excessive displays of partisanship. Early in the election cycle, when they feel free to pursue policy and career goals, they are more likely to support their party. In order to ward off the entry of quality challengers, who have the best chance of defeating them in the general election (Jacobson 1989), members should begin moderating their party support over the first year of the election cycle (Carson 2005). We expect to see additional movement away from partisanship as the general election approaches, when voters are paying the closest attention to elite behavior. We expect to see roughly the same pattern for both Democrats and Republicans without Fox News in their districts.         "
"12","Theoretical Predictions: Strategic Responsiveness in Districts with and without Fox News"
"13","Note: Refer to Equation 1 for discussion of notation.                     "
"14","Because the introduction of Fox News should alter members' perceptions about their constituents' preferences for partisanship, we expect to see Democrats and Republicans make different strategic calculations in the run‐up to elections. Since media signal (directly or indirectly) constituent preferences, the presence of Fox News in the district should not alter their behavior when electoral considerations play a comparatively small role in their legislative decision‐making—when elections are distant. Early in the election cycle, members in Fox News districts should feel just as free as those without Fox News to pursue policy and career goals. In the middle of the term, they should keep an eye toward deterring the entry of quality challengers. As elections approach, however, members should perceive a Republican shift in their district. Accordingly, Democrats in Fox News districts should moderate their partisanship even more sharply than Democrats without Fox News (Figure 1a). In contrast, Republicans with Fox News should increase their level of partisanship relative to Republicans without Fox News to demonstrate their Republican bona fides (Figure 1b).         "
"15","Drawing on the theory of strategic responsiveness, we can refine our predictions further. While the composition of news media in congressional districts offers members one signal of their constituents' preferences for partisanship, other sources of information exist. Specifically, through observation and experience, members have some sense of the partisan contours of their district (Griffin 2006). Consequently, not all members represent districts that exhibit uniform contempt for elite partisanship (Carson, Koger, Lebo, and Young 2010). Some represent relatively homogenous districts of partisans who might actually want their representative to toe the party line. Accordingly, we expect the partisan composition of districts to moderate the effects of Fox News's presence. As districts become increasingly populated with Republican voters—those most influenced by Fox News (Hopkins and Ladd 2014)—we expect Fox News to induce members to cast more votes for Republican positions as elections approach. In contrast, the presence of Fox News should have little discernible effect on the behavior of members who represent districts heavily composed of Democratic voters. Therefore, we expect to observe the divergent behavior illustrated in Figure 1 across members with and without Fox News for predominately Republican districts, but anticipate negligible divergence for members representing predominately Democratic districts. If the partisan composition of districts moderates the effects of Fox News, it would suggest that electoral considerations motivate legislators to respond strategically to news media. Conversely, if the effects of Fox News are not contingent on constituency dynamics within congressional districts, then this provides some evidence that news media influence legislative behavior via alternative mechanisms.         "
"16","To evaluate empirically our predictions shown in Figure 1, we draw on the sample of cable markets constructed by DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007), which records the geographic expansion of Fox News Channel across the country between 1998 and 2002. The data are at the town level. We aggregate these data to the congressional district level, creating two types of districts: those without Fox News and those in which at least some portion of the district had access to Fox News.         "
"17","We follow previous researchers (Clinton and Enamorado 2014; DellaVigna and Kaplan 2007; Hopkins and Ladd 2014) in treating the patchy rollout of Fox News Channel as a natural experiment. The introduction of Fox News creates exogenous variation in the partisan composition of national news media across congressional districts. Assuming that members representing districts with Fox News are not otherwise different from members without Fox News in their district allows us to identify the effects of national news media on members' voting behavior. Because the legislative agenda is the same for members with and without Fox News in their district, this design ameliorates the concern that temporal patterns of elite partisanship are merely an artifact of the particular bills slated for consideration at different points during the election cycle. If the legislative agenda were, indeed, responsible for patterns of elite partisanship, then we would not expect to see co‐partisans exhibit different levels of party support as a function of the presence of Fox News in their district.         "
"18","Of course, we do not possess a true randomized experiment, as we did not randomly assign Fox News to some districts and not others. A natural experiment is an observational study in which the researcher can make a credible claim that the “treatment” unfurled in an “as‐if” random fashion (Dunning 2008). Dunning (290–91) offers three criteria with which to evaluate claims of as‐if randomness:            "
"19","Do subjects plausibly self‐select into the treatment and control groups, in ways that are unobserved or unmeasured by the analyst but are correlated with the outcome of interest? Have policy makers or other political actors possibly made interventions in anticipation of the behavioral response of citizens, in ways that are correlated with these potential behavioral responses? Are treatment and control groups unbalanced with respect to other variables that could plausibly explain differences in average outcomes across groups?"
"20","In our study, the research subjects are members of Congress. At the advent of Fox News, it is unlikely that members of Congress lobbied their local cable news stations to include or exclude an unknown news channel from their lineups. At the very least, we have found no evidence to suggest anything of the sort. With respect to the second question, although it is plausible that Fox Entertainment Group may have attempted to target “friendly” Republican‐leaning towns, DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) find no evidence that Fox News rolled out in a systematic fashion of this sort. The presence or absence of Fox News in the late 1990s is uncorrelated with the distribution of the two‐party vote in the 1996 or 2000 presidential elections and uncorrelated with 24 demographic characteristics of the towns. It appears that if Fox Entertainment Group had any strategy in rolling out Fox News, it was to maximize its penetration rather than target particular audiences.         "
"21","Because we aggregate the town‐level data to the congressional district level, we take the added precaution of assessing whether imbalances exist between districts with and without Fox News on covariates that correlate with congressional voting behavior. The results are displayed in Table 1 for the full sample and separated by Democratic and Republican districts. It does not appear that the rollout of Fox News is correlated with the party of congressional members, their ideology, seniority, campaign spending behavior, the quality of challengers, the viability of incumbents, or the districts' presidential vote (these measures are described in greater detail in Section 2 of the Supporting Information). The one exception is the seniority of Republican members of Congress. Fox News entered districts in which Republicans had approximately 1.4 years more seniority than Republicans in non–Fox News districts. This is a small difference and, if anything, should insulate members from Fox News effects, since seniority tends to coincide with electoral safety (e.g., Collier and Munger 1994). The joint tests of significance also fail to reject the null hypothesis that these covariates, together, are uncorrelated with the emergence of Fox News. Nonetheless, it is important to remember that, as with any observational study, we cannot make claims about the balance of unobserved covariates (Arceneaux, Gerber, and Green 2006). Although we believe that the extant evidence supports the assumption that we meet the as‐if random assumption, it remains an assumption.         "
"22","We explore whether the introduction of Fox News had a meaningful effect on House members' time‐dependent partisan behavior during the rollout of Fox News in the 105th–107th Congresses (1997–2002). We test the proposition that the influence of Fox News on elite partisanship will be most pronounced when elections are proximate by comparing the temporal patterns of partisanship for members who represent districts with Fox News to members without Fox News (hereafter referred to as “Fox News members” and “non–Fox News members,” respectively). We examine members' voting behavior on party votes, a widely used method for analyzing elite partisanship, to capture the partisan dynamics of House members during the time period under investigation (see Cox and McCubbins 2005, 2007; Rohde 1991; Smith 2007). Party votes are those roll‐call votes on which a majority of Democrats vote in opposition to a majority of Republicans. This subset of votes is useful for our purposes because it is generated by the core interparty differences that weigh heavily in collective party reputations (Poole and Rosenthal 2007). These votes produce distinct party positions and figure prominently into voters' assessments of their member's partisan loyalty (Carson, Koger, Lebo, and Young 2010). Other votes (i.e., “nonparty votes”) do not present members with the same tensions between party and constituent preferences. While members strategically adjust their party support relative to elections on party votes, they do not engage in strategic temporal adjustments to their voting behavior on nonparty votes (Lindstädt and Vander Wielen 2014). As such, the presence of partisan news in members' districts should have little, if any, meaningful influence on members' nonparty votes, and we therefore focus our analysis on party votes. Conveniently, this theoretical distinction between party and nonparty votes sets up a useful placebo test, which we describe in more detail below.         "
"23","We directly map our theoretical predictions (see Figure 1) into our empirical model (see Equation 1). In particular, we model each member i's propensity to support his or her party on party vote v as a function of the number of days to the election and presence of Fox News in i's district. We include cubic polynomial terms for time to election to capture systematic variation in members' partisanship across the election cycle (Carter and Signorino 2010). We test whether Fox News influences members' dynamic partisanship by interacting the polynomial terms with an indicator variable for the presence of Fox News in the district.5 Finally, we estimate the empirical model separately for Republicans and Democrats in order to test our expectation that Fox News caused Republican members to become more partisan as elections approached, while causing Democrats to become less partisan.6                        "
"24","We include all party votes during the period of analysis (), coding party support as 1 and defection as 0.7 DaysToElection measures the number of days between each vote v and Election Day.8 We use DellaVigna and Kaplan's (2007) data to identify districts with Fox News and the timing of Fox News's entry into the district.9 Conceptualizing the presence of Fox News in each congressional district as a dichotomy is an admittedly coarse approach. After all, the underlying data were collected at the town level and drawn from a sample of cable markets.10 Therefore, using a dichotomous measure of Fox News in districts surely overlooks variation in the penetration of Fox News across districts. Moreover, there is a small (but positive) probability that we falsely classify a district as not having Fox News, since it is possible that a town within the district has Fox News but does not appear in the sample. Fortunately, these sources of error are functionally equivalent to treating the control group, furnishing a conservative test of our theoretical predictions by biasing against finding differences between Fox News and non–Fox News members. As a robustness check, we later measure the district‐level penetration of Fox News as the proportion of cable subscribers in the district with access to the channel and arrive at substantively identical results to those using the dichotomous measure. While this is a useful robustness check to be sure, we have some reservations about relying upon this measure of Fox News's presence given that the assumption of as‐if randomness pertains to whether Fox News is present in the districts and not necessarily the concentration of its presence.         "
"25","We also include several covariates to account for additional sources of variation in member i's party support (denoted by vector  in Equation 1 with corresponding vector of coefficients, ). The inclusion or exclusion of these covariates does not substantively affect our results (see Section 1 of the Supporting Information), but we report the models with covariates below to allay concerns about spuriousness. Members should strategically alter their voting behavior as a function of the relative costs and benefits of party loyalty across time. Consequently, we include several standard measures of electoral vulnerability and district competitiveness (see Section 2 of the Supporting Information for a complete discussion).         "
"26","Because roll‐call votes vary in their likelihood to generate interparty disagreement (Crespin, Rohde, and Vander Wielen 2013), we also include fixed effects for vote type categories, represented by vector  in Equation 1 (with corresponding vector of coefficients, ). We account for the six vote type categories—regular passage bills, passage under suspension of the rules, miscellaneous passage, amendments, partisan procedural votes, and miscellaneous procedural votes—that Crespin, Rohde, and Vander Wielen (2013) show to be systematically related to observed inter‐party division across time.11 For instance, members are more inclined to vote with their party (and against the opposing party) on partisan procedural votes than on final passage even for the same underlying bill (Sinclair 2002). Since the primary goal of this analysis is to compare voting behavior across members, who are exposed to the same votes at any given time, this research design minimizes the effect that variation in the legislative agenda has on our inferences. Nonetheless, as an added precaution, we include the vote type fixed effects so that we can examine legislative voting behavior in the context of agendas that are temporally comparable. We note that omitting the vote type fixed effects does not substantively alter the results (see Section 4 of the Supporting Information).         "
"27","Table 2 presents the results for the model shown in Equation 1 for both Democrats and Republicans, using all available data.12 Because the data consist of several votes for each member, we adjust the standard errors by clustering on congressional districts.13 Recall that, in our empirical model, the interactions between the Fox News indicator and the polynomial terms test for temporal differences in partisanship across non–Fox News and Fox News members. The constitutive terms (and their corresponding coefficients  for ) provide information regarding the temporal behavior of non–Fox News members, whereas the interacted terms (and their corresponding coefficients  for ) provide insight into the temporal behavior of Fox News members. Note that because we measure time as days to election, with higher values of time indicating greater distance to election, positive coefficients indicate increasing party support as elections become more distant (i.e., decreasing party support as elections approach), with negative terms indicating the opposite. In line with our theoretical predictions, we expect the constitutive polynomial terms to exhibit a general pattern of declining party support as elections approach for both Republicans and Democrats, consistent with the notion that members strategically temper party loyalty when elections are proximate.14 Conversely, we expect the interacted polynomial terms to show that Fox News Republicans become more partisan and Fox News Democrats become less partisan than their partisan counterparts without Fox News as elections draw near. The predictions for the coefficients that follow from our theoretical propositions are presented in Figure 1.15"
"28","The patterns of coefficients on the constitutive and interacted polynomial terms are consistent with our theoretical expectations (see Figure 1). In both the Democratic and Republican models, the constitutive polynomial terms exhibit alternating signs, with positive first‐ and third‐degree coefficients (, p < 0.05) and a negative second‐degree coefficient (, p < 0.05). In short, the constitutive terms point to a general pattern of declining party support over the election cycle for non–Fox News members across both parties, as predicted. More importantly, we find support for our central hypothesis: Fox News members strategically alter their partisan voting behavior as the general election approaches in ways that systematically diverge from non‐Fox News members. Specifically, we find that the interacted first‐degree coefficient in the Democratic model is positive (, p < .05). Therefore, Fox News Democrats exhibit a faster rate of declining partisanship as elections approach than do non–Fox News Democrats. Conversely, the interacted first‐degree coefficient in the Republican model is negative (, p < .05) and sufficiently large (i.e., ), demonstrating that Fox News Republicans exhibit an increasing rate of partisanship as elections approach while non–Fox News Republicans moderate their partisanship. Moreover, we find that the Fox News indicator (θ) is negative and statistically significant in the Democratic model and positive and statistically significant in the Republican model, suggesting that Democrats who represent districts with Fox News have a lower baseline level of party support and Republicans with Fox News have a higher baseline level of party support than their partisan counterparts without Fox News in their district, ceteris paribus.16 This finding alone is of considerable interest, as it provides evidence that the introduction of Fox News generated greater underlying support for Republican positions across both parties.17"
"29","These results are displayed graphically in Figure 2. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the 83.5% confidence intervals of predicted probabilities of party support over the course of the election cycle for Democrats and Republicans, respectively.18 Since we are interested in identifying statistical differences between the predicted probabilities of party support for non–Fox News and Fox News members using confidence intervals, 83.5% confidence intervals are appropriate for achieving a Type I error rate of 5% (i.e., 95% confidence; Goldstein and Healy 1995; Maghsoodloo and Huang 2010). As predicted, there is a general pattern of decreasing party support over the election cycle among non–Fox News members—Democrats and Republicans alike. We also observe divergence in the predicted probabilities of party support between non–Fox News and Fox News members when elections approach, but not during periods of the election cycle when elections are distant. Specifically, Fox News Democrats become statistically less supportive of their party when elections are near, and Fox News Republicans become statistically more supportive. On average, the difference in the predicted probabilities of party support for Democrats with and without Fox News in their district is approximately 8.3 percentage points when elections are proximate, and 4.1 percentage points for Republicans. To better illustrate these effects, Figures 2(c) and 2(d) offer magnified perspectives of the divergence that occurs at the end of the election cycle for Democrats and Republicans, respectively.19"
"30","Although the pattern of partisan behavior shown in Figure 2 is statistically significant and consistent with our theoretical model, it is also important to demonstrate that these effects are substantively significant. In an effort to better understand whether these gaps in predicted probabilities of party support across non–Fox News and Fox News members are substantively meaningful, we simulate the change in size of Republican coalitions at election time when transitioning from a House with no Fox News districts to one in which all members represent a Fox News district. We first set the party division of our hypothetical House to the one that existed at the beginning of the 113th Congress (2013–14), with 202 Democrats and 233 Republicans.20 We then draw 202 Democrats and 233 Republicans from separate uniform distributions with bounds equal to their respective non–Fox News confidence intervals at election time. This procedure gives us the probabilities that 435 non–Fox News members will vote with their party when elections are proximate. By taking the complement of each Democrat's probability (i.e., one minus their originally drawn probability), we assign them a probability of voting with the Republican coalition (i.e., defecting from their party). We simulate each member's support for the Republican coalition on 500,000 roll calls, in which each member votes with the Republican coalition on a given roll call according to his or her assigned probability. For each iteration (i.e., roll call), we sum the number of Republican votes across all 435 members. This yields a probability distribution for Republican coalition sizes over 500,000 roll‐call votes conducted in the absence of Fox News. We then perform the analogous steps, but instead draw members' probabilities of Republican support from the Fox News confidence intervals at election time.         "
"31","Figure 3 shows the distribution of differences between the vectors of non–Fox News and Fox News coalition sizes. On average, the Republican coalition size with Fox News is 26.59 votes larger than without Fox News, which is statistically discernible from zero at 95% confidence. Therefore, while the gap in predicted probabilities across non–Fox News and Fox News members at election time may at first glance appear quite small at the individual level, this difference in predicted probabilities has considerable implications for Republican coalition sizes when aggregated to the entire membership. The advantages reaped by the Republican party are of particular substantive interest when one considers that, during the period of analysis (1997–2002), the Republicans won 26.4% of all party votes by 20 or fewer votes and 10.3% by 10 or fewer votes.         "
"32","Predicted Change in Size of Republican Coalition Across Pre– and Post–Fox News Eras"
"33","Note: Figure shows the change in predicted Republican coalition sizes from the pre– to post–Fox News eras using the party division present at the outset of the 113th House (2013–14).                     "
"34","We theorize that Fox News influences elite behavior by affecting legislators' electoral calculations. Fox News shapes members' beliefs about constituent preferences, whether by merely altering the media landscape that members rely upon to assess voter sentiments or by actually motivating attentive constituents. If electoral considerations are, indeed, the pathway through which Fox News exerts the influence documented above, then surely the partisan composition of districts should play a central role in determining the extent of Fox News's influence. After all, certain voters are more receptive to Fox News's messages than others, with the effects of Fox News largely confined to those voters who are already aligned with the Republican Party (Arceneaux and Johnson 2013; Hopkins and Ladd 2014). Therefore, as the number of Republican voters in a district increases, we should observe increasing divergence in partisan behavior between members with and without Fox News as elections approach. Conversely, there is little reason to expect such divergence in behavior among members representing heavily Democratic districts, since the presence of Fox News has little bearing on their electoral considerations.         "
"35","We therefore examine elite partisan behavior as a function of district partisan composition and the presence of Fox News. We do this by introducing a slight modification to the model in Equation 1. Specifically, we include a continuous variable measuring the Democratic proportion of the two‐party House vote in the district (Democratic Vote Share), and interact this variable with the cubic polynomial of days to the next election.21 To facilitate the interpretation of this model by avoiding excessive use of interaction terms, we exclude the Fox News indicator variable and its interactions, and instead estimate the model separately for Republicans and Democrats both with and without Fox News in their district.22"
"36","The results of this analysis are presented in Table 3. Since Democratic Vote Share is continuous and interacted with the polynomial terms, direct interpretation of temporal effects and statistical significance is considerably more complicated than in the previous analysis. Thus, to aid in interpreting these results, we simulate the probability of party support for Democrats and Republicans representing districts that are comparatively Democratic and Republican (relative to their co‐partisans). For Democrats and Republicans alike, we simulate the effects of a relatively Democratic constituency by setting the Democratic Vote Share variable to the 90th percentile, and a relatively Republican constituency by setting the variable to the 10th percentile. The results of these simulations are shown in Figure 4.23 As predicted, we find statistically discernible divergence in election‐proximate behavior across members with and without Fox News in their district when the district is composed heavily of Republican voters. However, such divergence is not present in districts with a comparatively high presence of Democratic voters. This finding holds for members of both parties.         "
"37","Predicted Probability of Party Support by Party, Presence of Fox News, and Partisan Composition of District"
"38","Note: To simulate the effect of a “relatively Democratic district,” we set the Democratic Vote Share variable to the 90th percentile for each party, respectively. Conversely, we set the Democratic Vote Share variable to the 10th percentile for each party to represent “relatively Republican districts.” Reasonable variation in the percentiles does not substantively alter the results.                     "
"39","As robustness checks, we estimate a series of alternative models intended to test the validity of the findings above. One concern is that our balance tests are incomplete and Fox News actually did enter conservative districts first. If so, it could be that the members of Congress whom we identify as representing districts with Fox News always adjust their partisan voting behavior in a Republican direction as elections draw near. We address this concern by restricting the estimation of Equation 1 to the subsample of those members who had Fox News enter into their district during the period of analysis.24 The resulting interrupted time‐series design offers additional and compelling evidence of a causal link between temporal partisan behavior and the entry of Fox News. It constitutes a more demanding test of our theory, since it significantly reduces our sample size and requires that a nontrivial amount of the variation in behavior across non–Fox News and Fox News members observed in the above analysis stems from individual members updating their behavior after the introduction of Fox News to their district. Our expectations remain the same as those for our core analysis, and we again account for repeated measures by using clustered standard errors (on unique districts).25"
"40","The results of the interrupted time‐series analysis are shown in Table 4, and they are substantively similar to our core results in Table 2. The Fox News indicator is statistically significant and in the predicted direction in each of the party models—negative in the Democratic model and positive in the Republican model. Thus, we still find evidence of strong baseline effects for the average Fox News member. Moreover, we observe similar relationships on the interacted polynomial coefficients. The interacted first‐degree coefficient in the Democratic model is positive and statistically significant (, p < .05), while this term is negative and statistically significant in the Republican model (, p < .05). Again, when jointly considering the first‐degree constitutive and interacted terms in the Republican model, we find that Fox News Republicans exhibit increasing partisanship as elections approach (i.e., ). Figure 5 graphically presents the predicted probabilities, offering confirmation of divergence in predicted probabilities across non–Fox News and Fox News members when elections are proximate.         "
"41","We also consider an alternative measure of the presence of Fox News. Specifically, in lieu of the indicator variable used in the above analysis, we instead use a continuous measure of the proportion of cable subscribers in the district with access to Fox News (Proportion of Subscribers).26 While this measure offers some information regarding the penetration of Fox News in the districts, we reiterate our concern that this measure may not meet the central requirements for as‐if random treatment (e.g., cable consumption patterns within districts may introduce selection bias), and thus may jeopardize the internal validity of the study. As mentioned above, the use of an indicator variable to measure the presence of Fox News not only meets the criteria for as‐if randomness but also provides a demanding test for media effects. Nonetheless, we see this robustness check as a valuable exercise, because it allows us to gauge whether our findings hinge on our particular measurement approach. The results of this test can be found in Table 5, along with the corresponding predicted probabilities in Figure 6. We set the Proportion of Subscribers variable to the 10th percentile to simulate low levels of Fox News penetration in a district, and to the 90th percentile to simulate high levels of Fox News penetration.27 The results are strikingly similar to our core results.         "
"42","We further address the concern that Republicans and Democrats in Fox News districts simply behaved differently than their counterparts in non–Fox News districts before the advent of Fox News by performing a placebo test in which we test whether dynamic partisanship differed between these districts in the era just before the introduction of Fox News (i.e., the 102nd, 103rd, and 104th Congresses, 1991–96). We keep all model specifications the same as those shown in Equation 1, save for changing the dependent variable to party votes during the pre–Fox News time period. If the presence of Fox News is responsible for the dynamic partisan behavior observed in the main analysis, then members representing these districts should not exhibit the same temporal partisan patterns we find in the post–Fox News period. As shown in Table 6, we do not find any statistically discernible differences between the placebo Fox News districts and all others. Specifically, the Fox News indicator variable, with coefficient θ, is not statistically significant in either of the party models, nor are any of the interacted polynomial terms, with coefficients δ1, δ2, and δ3.28 Thus, it stands to reason that there are no innate features of these districts that generate the findings we observe.29"
"43","In order to demonstrate that the introduction of Fox News motivated members to alter their behavior in strategic ways, as our thesis asserts, Table 6 also reports the results of the model shown in Equation 1 estimated over all nonparty votes during the period of analysis. As discussed above, nonparty votes are less central to both constituents and parties, and therefore members do not experience the tensions between these actors' positions that they do for party votes. Consequently, we would not expect to find systematic differences in partisan support on nonparty votes across members with and without Fox News in their district. We find that the presence of Fox News does not result in the statistically discernible differences in behavior documented above. Notably, the Fox News indicator variable again fails to achieve statistical significance in both party models, and none of the interacted polynomial coefficients, except the third‐degree coefficient in the Republican model, are statistically significant (predicted probability figures are available upon request).30"
"44","The Supporting Information reports additional sensitivity analyses showing that our findings are unperturbed under alternative parametric and nonparametric model specifications (see Sections 6 and 7 of the Supporting Information), including a simplified model that uses an indicator variable to capture end‐of‐cycle effects (see Section 8 of the Supporting Information). Taken together, these robustness checks offer considerable support for our contention that, during its advent, Fox News induced strategic Democratic defection and Republican loyalty on party votes as elections approached."
"45","We find that members of Congress respond to shifts in the media environment within their district. The introduction of the conservative Fox News Channel in the late 1990s caused both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives to shift toward the Republican Party on divisive votes in close proximity to general elections. Fox News appears to have altered legislators' strategic calculus, inducing different patterns of dynamic partisanship for members in districts with Fox News compared to those representing districts without it. The evidence illuminates how strategic politicians are in balancing competing goals. At the beginning of the election cycle, when elections are distant, members maximize partisan goals by supporting their party on party votes at high rates. In the middle of the term, members moderate their party support, ostensibly reflecting the desire to deter the emergence of quality challengers. It is at this point in the process that members are most concerned that the entrance of a quality challenger may mobilize unfriendly constituents. As elections approach, members shift their attention to the subset of their district's voters that they anticipate will turn out on Election Day. Here, the media composition of the district plays a particularly pronounced role. Members with Fox News in their district behave as if they believe that more Republicans will turn out at the polls by increasing their support for the Republican Party."
"46","Whether Fox News actually induced the attentive public to take action or merely led members of Congress to believe it would is not a matter that we can adjudicate with this analysis. In other words, it is possible that legislators and their staff may draw on media reports as a measure of voters' opinions (Herbst 1998), with the emergence of Fox News shifting members' estimates of constituent opinions to the right. Alternatively, the emergence of Fox News may have motivated members of the attentive public to contact their representatives and advocate conservative positions (Levendusky 2013). A third possibility, of course, is that some combination of these mechanisms could be at work. Although we are unable to discern among these possibilities, our analysis does point to voters as the mediating factor in the relationship between media messages and elite responses. We find evidence that the extent of media influence on elite behavior is significantly dependent on the voter composition of the district, with those members representing heavily Republican districts being most responsive to Fox News's messages and those representing heavily Democratic districts exhibiting little discernible evidence of influence. Therefore, these findings suggest that electoral considerations are paramount to media influence on elites, and cast doubt on alternative mechanisms that posit a trivial role of voters in this relationship (e.g., media directly influencing members' preferences).         "
"47","Importantly, these results underscore the contingent nature of democratic responsiveness. Textbook theories of democracy implicitly presume that elections are sufficient to induce responsiveness across the entire term of office. A more descriptively accurate account of elite behavior takes into consideration levels of public attentiveness as well as retrospective myopia. Simply put, elected officials are less likely to be responsive to constituent opinion when they perceive that either voters are not paying attention or will be forgetful. Our findings imply that legislators are less sensitive to their constituents' opinions when elections are distant. Consequently, the correlation between public opinion and public policy may be less consistent and uniform than previous research suggests (see also Druckman and Leeper 2012; Gilens 2012).         "
"48","Our findings also call into question claims that the emergence of right‐wing media in the late 1990s polarized American politics (Jamieson and Cappella 2008), at least within the U.S. House of Representatives. To the contrary, Fox News shifted both Democratic and Republican members towards the Republican Party. If anything, Fox News may be responsible for a rightward shift in politics at the elite level (Hacker and Pierson 2005). That said, our data do not speak to the later emergence of left‐leaning news channels, such as MSNBC. Perhaps, the emergence of a liberal counterweight to Fox News induced Democrats to move leftward. If this is the case, the combination of left‐ and right‐leaning news channels may promote party polarization in Congress. We leave this question to future research.         "
"49","We also leave to future studies the matter of whether the introduction of Fox News had significant effects on legislative elections. Hopkins and Ladd (2014) find that Fox News increased turnout among Republicans in presidential elections. Is the same true for House elections? And if so, does the increase of Republican turnout in House elections validate Fox News members' decision to adjust their partisanship in the run‐up to elections? Finally, aside from voting behavior on party votes, it is of considerable interest whether the introduction of Fox News altered legislative behavior in other meaningful ways, such as the willingness of members to introduce controversial legislation, hold committee hearings, and engage in obstructionist behavior.
