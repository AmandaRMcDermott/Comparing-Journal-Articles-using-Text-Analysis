"1","Scholars and advocates have long argued that schools play an important role in fostering democratic politics. As Smith writes, one of the main justifications for creating universal public education was to “perpetuate the dominant political values and beliefs of society and to promote a civic culture” (2005, 293). It is therefore not surprising that scholars have studied how schools influence the creation of social capital. Coleman (1988) was one of the first scholars to develop the concept of social capital and he originally considered it in the school context.         "
"2","From Putnam's (1993) viewpoint, social capital is the necessary societal foundation on which successful democratic politics can be built. Other scholars dispute the notion that social capital organically emerges from society. Building on the work of scholars such as Levi (1996), Schneider, Teske, and Marschall argue that “the opportunity for associational groups to generate social capital are affected by the structure and policies of government” (2000, 225). Schneider et al. (1997, 2000) argue that school choice programs are a policy that can create social capital based on their study of parental participation in school activities in four school districts in New York City and northern New Jersey. They consider both the individual‐level act of choice and the influence of the broader institutional choice context (i.e., type of choice program) on parental involvement. In the New Jersey school districts it is not possible to separate out how the broader choice context and the individual act of choosing influences the creation of social capital because one district does not permit choice, and the other mandates universal choice. However, in the New York school districts they find that the individual‐level choice variable (i.e., whether the parents actively chose their child's school) is a stronger and more consistent predictor of participation than the choice program context, which is only a significant predictor of participation in one of four multivariate models examining parental involvement. Looking at aggregate school‐level data, Bifulco and Ladd (2006) find higher participation by parents in charter schools. It appears then, that there may be something about the act of choosing a school for his or her child that makes a parent more likely to participate in school activities.         "
"3","The positive relationship between choice and parental involvement does not receive support in all studies, however. For example, in a study of Washington, DC schools, Buckley and Schneider (2003) find that parents who have successfully chosen, or unsuccessfully attempted to choose, a charter school‐had more favorable attitudes toward their child's school but were not any more likely to participate in school‐related activities than other parents. These different findings may simply stem from the different school choice contexts under examination, or they may reflect that there is a weak or nonexistent relationship between choice and parental involvement. While their empirical analysis is generally well done, the individual‐level causal process is not very clearly explicated in Schneider and colleagues' (1997, 2000) work. Buckley and Schneider write that “charter schools are likely to create a milieu in which parents are better treated and in which they are encouraged to be active ‘coproducers’ of their children's education” (2003, 11) and that this may in turn change attitudes and behavior.         "
"4","Other studies indicate that the school context can be more or less favorable to parental involvement, but not necessarily that school choice alone can provide such a context. As noted by Campbell (2001), Coleman and Hoffer (1987) argue that Catholic schools outperform public schools on parental involvement because of the differences in the school‐community relationships in the two types of schools, rather than the act of choosing a private school. According to these scholars, schools can be thought of as either values communities, where people come together out of shared belief systems, or functional communities, where there is “closure” between adult and youth communities, with close intergenerational contact and the reinforcement of adult rather than peer group norms. They argue that social capital will be strongest when communities have both shared value systems and functional communities, which Coleman and Hoffer (1987) claim is generally true of Catholic schools. Supporting this view, they found that after controlling for demographic factors Catholic school parents were still more likely to participate in school activities, but there was no statistical difference between public school parents and non‐Catholic private school parents. Campbell (2001) finds a similar pattern for the creation of civic engagement among Catholic school students, but not for other types of choice schools.         "
"5","According to these scholars, while some schools do seem to create more social capital, it is not created by choice per se, but rather other attributes of the school context. In Coleman and Hoffer's (1987) language, school choice is unlikely to create a “functional community” with strong intergenerational contact and the enforcement of adult norms of the type that they state used to be found in rural communities or ethnic neighborhoods. Discussing magnet schools, Coleman and Hoffer state that they' “attract students on the basis of their own and their parents' values concerning schooling; but they seldom constitute a functional community” (1987, 9). The school market envisioned in a full choice program appears to favor the creation of a values community and diminish the creation of a functional community which requires greater stability, perhaps of the type that is more often present in the local public school. Coleman and Hoffer (1987) argue that in values communities, involvement and engagement are even more dependent on individual resources. It is perhaps possible to create new public schools that are organized along functional community lines, but again, this would go beyond choice per se. Furthermore, by their very intergenerational nature, functional communities would tend to defy easy admittance and can therefore perhaps not easily be created from above.         "
"6","If the above is correct, then the relationship between choice and participation observed by Schneider et al. (1997, 2000) is spurious. It is simply an artifact of the reality that those parents who “care” enough to actively choose their child's school also care enough to participate at their child's school. Schneider et al. (1997, 2000) have attempted to control for this selection problem using a two‐stage nonrandom assignment model to control for the fact that choosers are not randomly distributed among the parental population. Other scholars, noting the shortcomings of multi‐equation approaches, have used different methods to control for this selection problem (Buckley and Schneider 2003). Regardless of the statistical method employed, however, it is inherently very difficult to control for whatever it is that makes some parents actively choose their child's school and others who are similar not choose (Bulman 2004).         "
"7","A better approach is to observe the same parents over time, both before and after actively choosing their child's school, something that the ECLS‐K data allow. The selection problem that parents who choose schools are atypical is no longer a statistical problem, but is treated as a research design problem, which can be easily overcome using panel data. Indeed, Buckley and Schneider argue that the use of panel data will “better measure change and causality” (2003, 21). Panel data are useful in this context because unobserved individual‐level variables (e.g., concern for child's education, ability to navigate bureaucracies, etc.) that may drive both choice and participation, and therefore produce spurious statistical relationships in cross‐sectional studies, are held constant because we compare the behavior of the same individuals over time. Thus, if we observe an increase in participation rates after choosing a school, this can more conclusively be attributed to the choice itself rather than to some unobserved variable that may influence both choice and participation. If Schneider et al. (1997, 2000) are correct that choice leads to the creation of social capital, we should observe that once parents actively choose, their participation increases. If they are incorrect, it may still be the fact that active choosers participate more than nonchoosers, but this should be the case both before and after the active school choice decision and once past participation is controlled for, the act of choosing schools should not have any significant influence on participation.         "
"8","We are not arguing that institutions and policies cannot influence individual participation in political or social groups, for there is an abundance of evidence that they do. For example, Rosenstone and Hansen (1993) demonstrate that political party mobilization efforts have an important influence on political participation. Moreover, Schlozman, Verba, and Brady (1999) argue that recruitment plays a key role in all forms of political participation. This suggests that schools can develop rules, institutions, and practices that may promote parental involvement. For example, some charter schools have rules requiring parents to volunteer their time, and such rules can be expected to increase parental involvement (Buckley and Schneider 2003). However, in this case it is not school choice that is increasing participation, but rather the rule requiring participation.         "
"9","This leads us to the question of what factors may help to create additional social capital. Coleman and Hoffer (1987) argue that social capital is likely to be greatest where there is a strong values community and a strong functional community, which they argue is present in most Catholic schools. If this is correct, then we should observe that Catholic school parents have higher levels of participation and that non‐Catholic schools with functional communities and values communities should also spur additional parental involvement. Though the data is not ideal for assessing the presence of values and functional communities, we are able to examine indicators of the presence of a values community and a functional community. Values communities exhibit a strong consensus on educational values and goals, and one question from the ECLS‐K administrator survey allows us to consider the relationship between shared educational goals and expectations in the school and parental participation. Coleman and Hoffer (1987) argue that shared values alone are probably insufficient to create additional social capital, however, and therefore it is necessary to consider how the presence of a functional community may influence parental involvement.         "
"10","Regular public schools should perhaps be more likely to have a functional community than schools of choice because they usually draw from specific neighborhoods, and we may therefore expect that, counter to Schneider et al., parents keeping their children in regular public schools should have higher rates of participation than similar parents who have chosen their child's school. But even within the public schools, functional communities were historically preponderant in small rural and urban ethnic schools (Coleman and Hoffer 1987) because these schools were embedded within a community unified by something other than educational values. We therefore consider whether small schools and schools with a stable student population reflecting a stable community create higher levels of parental participation. Research on political participation has shown that recruitment is important and administrators can also attempt to create community by encouraging parental involvement and offering opportunities for parents to be involved in school activities. Some research has shown that these administrator efforts can increase parental involvement (Bifulco and Ladd 2006). Therefore we examine whether administrators' hosting more school events to which parents are invited increases involvement. Creating schools with a functional community and values community is probably not an easy task, but there may be simple institutional choices like maintaining smaller schools or providing more opportunities for parents to participate which can help to create social capital.         "
"11","Individual‐level attributes have consistently been found to be an important predictor of political participation (Schlozman, Verba, and Brady 1999). Thus in keeping with past research on the effects of school choice, we also consider the effects of several parental variables on involvement in school activities. One factor that we examine is parental dissatisfaction with the school. Many studies have found a connection between dissatisfaction and a lack of participation by parents (Schneider, Teske, and Marschall 2000). Education and church attendance have both been found to be highly correlated with participation (Putnam 2001; Schneider, Teske, and Marschall 2000), and we examine these influences as well. We also consider both the race/ethnicity of parents and whether the parent belongs to a group that is a significant minority in the school. If participation in schools is like other types of participation, minority groups should participate less. We also consider whether parents belonging to a small minority at their child's particular school are less likely to participate because to the extent that a functional community exists it may be structured partly along racial/ethnic lines, which may exclude parents from a minority group. Finally, Putnam (2001) argues that the relationship between working women and civic engagement is complex, but the predominance of full‐time working mothers probably has had some negative impact on participation rates in civic organizations. We therefore control for whether the parent is a working mother.         "
"12","There are limitations to assessing the effect of different choice regimes since the ECLS‐K data do not distinguish among all types of choice schools. We are able, however, to distinguish between the effect of switching to a public school of choice and choosing different types of private schools. At any rate, in Schneider and colleagues' (1997, 2000) study, it was the individual‐level choice variable which was shown to be the most consistent predictor of increases in participation.         "
"13","In this section, we assess the influence of choice on parental participation using the restricted data from the ECLS‐K panel study to examine changes in participation for parents between their child's kindergarten and third‐grade year. The ECLS‐K is an ongoing panel study following parents, schoolchildren, teachers, and administrators from the fall of kindergarten through the spring of third grade. In our study, we use data from interviews with parents in the spring of kindergarten and spring of third grade to examine changes in participation over time. The original base‐year study consisted of a multistage probability sample. In the spring of the kindergarten year 18,907 parents were interviewed. All third‐grade students who participated in the base‐year study and were at the same school were contacted, but only a sample of those switching schools was contacted. In the spring of third grade 13,504 parent interviews were completed. Weights were calculated to correct for oversampling and panel attrition."
"14","There are a couple of advantages in using the ECLS‐K data. As we discussed above, one of the advantages of panel data is it allows us to track changes of those parents who chose to exit their public kindergarten school. This allows us to compare behavior over time to see if exiting parents increase their participation at greater rates than those parents who stayed in their same school. Moreover, the ECLS‐K panel data have over 11,000 respondents and all of our models contain at least 8,000 observations. The large sample allows us to break down choice among different types of schools to see how school type affects participation. Other studies examining parental participation rely on sample sizes of less than 1,000 people."
"15","The ECLS‐K data include several questions about parental involvement in schools, but we chose to focus on four types of participation. The first type of participation is whether parents said they “attended a meeting of a PTA, PTO, or Parent‐Teacher Student Organization.” Our second dependent variable is whether parents “acted as a volunteer at the school or served on a committee.” Third, we also include a measure of whether parents have “attended a school or class event.” Finally, we consider whether choice leads to more involvement in the school community by increasing communication with other parents. Parents who regularly talked with more than four other parents were coded 1, while those parents speaking to three or fewer fellow parents were coded as a 0.1 We choose these four behaviors because each of them represents some aspect of community involvement and civic engagement. Therefore, they are different than just contacting a teacher about your child. Also, involvement in the PTA and volunteering are the same forms of behavior examined by Schneider, Teske, and Marschall (2000), allowing for a more direct comparison of results.2 These four forms of behavior would also appear to require different levels of resources and commitment (with attending a school event requiring the lowest) and thus represent a good cross‐section of participation.            "
"16","Our main independent variables consist of parents who chose options other than their local public school either at the beginning of their child's schooling or between kindergarten and third grade. First, we examine those parents who exited their original public kindergarten. These types of choosers are divided into two types. The first category includes a dummy variable for parents who started their child in a public kindergarten and exited to a private school by the time he or she reached third grade. The second dummy includes parents who switched their child from the regular public school to a public school of choice (i.e., open enrollment, charter, magnet, etc.) between kindergarten and third grade."
"17","We also have parents in the sample who actively chose private schools beginning with kindergarten and continuing through third grade, and we include dummy variables for these parents as well. Since the ECLS‐K has such a large sample of private school students, we created three different dummy variables for different types of private schools in order to assess the effect of school context on parental involvement. These include Catholic, other types of religious private schools, and nonreligious private schools. The breakdown of the private school variable will help us assess whether the act of choosing or the context of the school chosen leads to increased participation. Religion is correlated with social capital (Putman 2001) and previous research has found that parents are more involved in Catholic schools, which have both a functional and values community (e.g., Coleman and Hoffer 1987). If the act of choosing leads to increased participation, then we should see no difference between participation among religious and nonreligious private school parents.            "
"18","We compare these categories of choosers with parents whose children remained in the regular public school, which is represented by a dummy variable. Parents of all other types of children not included in one of these dummy variables are the baseline category in the multivariate analysis and are referred to as “other” in Table 1.3"
"19","To assess the influence of the institutional and social context, we used data derived from the school administrator questionnaire of the ECLS‐K. Specifically, we consider the influence of school size (student enrollment in hundreds); student turnover (the number of students who left and did not return divided by the total school enrollment); whether administrators believe consensus exists between administrators and teachers on goals and expectations; and the frequency of school events that parents are invited to. The use of the school administrator items reduces the total number of parents included in the sample, but the substantive results regarding the influence of school choice were robust without these variables included and with the larger sample of parents."
"20","As we discussed, several parental variables should also influence participation. There is no question in the ECLS‐K that asks about general school satisfaction, but there are several questions asking about satisfaction with specific elements of the school. Four questions were used to create an index of dissatisfaction. These questions asked parents how well the school performed the following tasks: (1) the school lets you know between report cards how well the child is doing; (2) the school helps you understand what children at your child's age are like; (3) the school makes you aware of chances to volunteer at the school; (4) the school provides workshops, materials, or advice about how to help the child learn at home. The Cronbach's alpha for these items is less than ideal at 0.65. However, we were able to assess whether these questions captured general dissatisfaction because the exact same questions were asked on the National Household Education Survey (NHES) of 2003, which also contains a general satisfaction question. We found that the correlation between our dissatisfaction index and the general dissatisfaction question was 0.5."
"21","We include several variables that have been found to affect participation in civic organizations in general and schools specifically. We included variables for the highest education level of any parent or caregiver, their income, and church attendance. The church attendance variable asks how often the family attends church: never, several times a year, once a week, or several times a week. This question was only asked during the spring of the first grade. Although this was two years before the participation we are examining, we do not think this will have much impact on the model because religiosity is probably fairly constant over time. The model also includes dummy variables for children who are Asian, black, or Hispanic. We also include a variable denoting whether the parent is a member of a significant racial or ethnic minority in the school (defined as the parent's racial/ethnic group comprising less than 20% of the student body). Some schools may have a close‐knit functional community, but if it is partly built on race or ethnicity then it may exclude individuals who are not of that group. The final variable we examine is whether mothers work full time, which is represented by a dummy variable."
"22","Initially we present mean rates of participation for various types of parents. Since we are using panel data, which allow us to track the same parents between time 1 and time 2, these bivariate relationships are more instructive than would be the case using cross‐sectional data. However, we also estimate multivariate models allowing us to straightforwardly assess whether parents who have chosen their child's school are statistically more likely to participate in school activities, controlling for their own past participation and a number of other factors thought to influence parental involvement in school activities, which may mediate the relationships between choice and participation. This analysis also permits an examination of how the social and institutional context of schools may influence parental involvement. If Schneider et al. (1997) are correct, then the public school exiters should have larger increases in participation rates than parents who remained in the regular public schools and in the multivariate analysis the coefficient for this dummy variable should be positive and statistically significant.            "
"23","In Table 1 we present the mean participation levels in the four types of activities by various groupings of survey respondents for both kindergarten and third grade. Since these are dummy variables, the mean simply represents the weighted proportion of respondents in a particular category that participated in each type of activity. Bar charts of participation at time 1 and time 2 are presented in Figures 1–4. For ease of presentation we restricted the bar charts only to those parents who actively chose between kindergarten and third grade and the parents whose children remained in the regular public school. The percentage change in participation between the two times allows us to most directly examine the influence of choice on participation. Private exit and public exit refer to parents who have removed their children from their assigned public school to private schools and public schools of choice, respectively. The other categories denote a child's enrollment in a Catholic school, other non‐Catholic religious private schools, secular private schools, and parents who kept their child in the regular public school, with the final category (other) containing all parents not in one of the previous categories.         "
"24","                 Proportion of Parents Participating in PTA by School Choice, Times 1 and 2                      "
"25","                 Proportion of Parents Volunteering by School Choice, Times 1 and 2                      "
"26","                 Proportion of Parents Attending a School Event by School Choice, Times 1 and 2                      "
"27","                 Proportion of Parents Talking to More Than Four Parents by School Choice, Times 1 and 2                      "
"28","As you would expect, parental participation varies depending on the type of activity in question. The lowest levels of participation are for what are probably the most demanding activities, routinely talking to many other parents and attending a PTA meeting. Compared to merely attending a school event or volunteering, which can be occasional and sporadic, being active in the PTA, for example, implies ongoing and repeated involvement in school activities, as does regularly speaking to many other parents. In addition, it is clear that there are substantial differences among the various groups of parents in terms of their participation in school‐related activities. In general, parents who have chosen religious private schools for their children participate at higher levels than nonprivate school parents, and this is especially so for Catholic school parents, as previous research has found. The relative participation of nonreligious private school parents varies substantially by activity. In contrast, public school parents generally have lower initial levels of participation than these private school parents, whether they eventually exit the assigned public school or not."
"29","These patterns are interesting but they tell us little about the main concern of this study—how choice influences subsequent participation. If Schneider et al. (1997, 2000) are correct, that choice increases participation, we should anticipate that parents who exit their default public school (whether for a different private or public choice school) are more likely to participate after choosing. It is notable that for most forms of participation, most categories of parents increase their involvement over time. Thus, the percentage changes in participation between kindergarten and third grade are almost all positive, and the relative magnitude of the positive change needs to be considered.         "
"30","It seems fairly clear from Table 1 that private school exiters demonstrate a greater increase in participation than both nonexiters and public school exiters. For three of the four categories of participation, private school exiters have a larger percentage change in participation than parents who kept their children in the regular public school. The exception to this was for attending a school event where private school exiters had nearly identical increases. It seems that there may be something about switching to a private school that increases parental involvement, but it is not yet clear whether this is related to the choice itself, or if it has something to do with the private school context as scholars like Coleman and Hoffer (1987) argue. Of the private exiters, 92% left for Catholic or other religious schools, so the change in participation may reflect the context of these schools rather than the choice itself. It is notable that private exiters have very similar levels of participation to those parents who began in private schools, despite having lower initial levels of participation.         "
"31","Comparing the parents who moved their child from the assigned public school to a public school of choice demonstrates a different pattern than that observed with private school exiters. For both PTA involvement and attending a school event, public school exiters had larger percentage increases than parents who left their children in the regular public schools. For the talk variable and volunteering at school the percentage increase for public exiters was smaller, and in the case of volunteering, public school exiters were less likely to do so after actively choosing a public school. In addition, for all behaviors except for attending an event, parents who selected a school of choice had lower absolute levels of participation in third grade."
"32","Disaggregating these different types of choosers demonstrates that certain types of choice do increase participation and some school contexts, specifically religious schools, appear to be associated with higher levels of participation. This could, of course, be an artifact of the composition of the different groups of parents, and therefore it makes sense to examine the influence of choice controlling for parental characteristics. We also wish to examine what other school‐level factors may influence parental involvement. Thus, we use logistic regression to estimate the impact of different types of choice and aspects of the institutional and social environment of the school on each of our four participation variables, while examining the influence of the school context and controlling for parental characteristics.4 Each variable takes the value of 1 if a parent participated during the third‐grade year of the panel and 0 if the parents did not participate. Our model also includes a variable for whether the parents reported participating during the first year of the panel, which was their child's year in kindergarten. The lag variable is useful for controlling for factors that may predispose particular parents to participate, but are not controlled for by the other variables in the model. We are also able to see whether the choice variables have a statistically significant influence on participation, after controlling for other variables and past participation.         "
"33","The results of our multivariate models are reported in Table 2. When examining the school dummy variables it is important to keep in mind that the baseline category is all parents who are not covered by one of the mutually exclusive dummy variable categories included in the model. We chose to use this group as the baseline rather than parents who kept their child in the default public school since we wanted to see whether this choice itself may have had a statistically significant influence on participation. As expected, previous participation is a strong and consistent predictor of participation in third grade. Also as expected given previous research (e.g., Coleman and Hoffer 1987), Catholic school parents were significantly more likely to participate in school activities. Parents with children in other religious schools were more likely to participate in the more demanding activities, PTA and talking to other parents. Parents with a child at a nonreligious private school were significantly more likely to talk to other parents, but were no more likely to engage in other activities than the baseline category of parents. Thus it seems that sending one's child to a religious school generally has a positive impact on participation, even controlling for a variety of factors.         "
"34","Turning our attention to the exiters, we can see that private school choosers demonstrate a statistically significant increase in their propensity to participate in three of the four activities (excluding attending an event). The significance of the coefficient for this variable, even after controlling for individual‐level religiosity, reinforces the conclusion that the religious school context spurs additional social capital. The results for the public school exiters indicate that choosing a public school does not lead to a statistically significant increase in participation for any form of behavior, though the coefficient for the variable in the attending‐an‐event equation is nearly statistically significant at the 0.05 level. For the more demanding forms of parental participation the coefficients for the public exit variables did not approach significance."
"35","In contrast to public exiters, parents whose children remained in the regular public school were statistically more likely to attend an event and talk to more than four parents and nearly significantly more likely to be involved with the PTA (p = 0.061). These results suggest that in some ways stable communities based on regular public schools are more conducive to building social capital than allowing public school choice."
"36"," Coleman and Hoffer (1987) argued that values communities alone would probably not be sufficient to create additional social capital. This expectation is confirmed by the null result for the public exit variable and received further confirmation with the null result for the consensus variable in Table 2. The coefficient for this variable is not significant in any of the models, indicating that a consensus on goals and expectations for students between teachers and administrator does not increase parental involvement. We also use two indicators of a functional community in the analysis: student turnover and school size. We expected that each variable should be negatively related to parental involvement. The coefficient for the student turnover variable has a negative coefficient in two models but is not statistically significant in any of the models. The enrollment variable has a negative coefficient in three of the four models and is highly significant for attending an event and talking to other parents. The results for this variable are not entirely consistent, but it seems that overall larger schools discourage parental involvement. Schneider et al. (1997) did not find a statistically significant negative influence of school size on participation, but this result confirms Bifulco and Ladd's (2006) finding that larger schools have less parental involvement.         "
"37","Since recruitment and the opportunity structure of participation may influence parental involvement, we also examined whether having a larger number of events at school to which parents were invited would create additional participation. The coefficient for this variable is positive in all models; however, it only approaches statistical significance in the model for attending a school event (p = 0.08 two‐tailed). Therefore, simply having more events to which parents are invited does not seem sufficient to create additional parental involvement."
"38","The results for the other control variables were largely what we expected given previous research. Parents who participated when their children were in kindergarten were more likely to participate later. Education, income, and church attendance were generally positively and significantly associated with participation, while full‐time work by mothers led to decreased participation in two of the types of behavior. Parents of Asian, black, and Hispanic students were less likely to volunteer and blacks were less likely to attend school events and talk to other parents, but black and Hispanic parents were more likely to attend PTA meetings. We are not exactly sure why black and Hispanic parents would be more likely to attend PTA meetings. Previous researchers have found that once you control for other variables blacks participate in some community activities at higher rates than whites (Verba and Nie 1987), but we know of no similar findings for Hispanics. The coefficient for the variable indicating whether the parent is a member of a minority in that particular school is negative and significant for PTA involvement, indicating that parents who are a member of a group that comprises a small minority of the student body are less likely to participate in this relatively demanding activity. This might indicate that if parents are not part of the broader school community, which is often founded on racial or ethnic lines, they are less likely to participate.         "
"39","It is clear from the figures presented in Table 2 that actively choosing a public school does not make participation in school activities more likely. There is support for the idea that private school choice makes individuals more likely to participate, but given the findings for public school exiters and the generally higher levels of participation for private school parents across all activities, it seems that this increase in participation is a result of the specific private school context, especially a religious dimension, rather than a product of the choice process itself.         "
"40","The results show that private exiters are significantly more likely to participate in three of the four types of participation. This result is probably driven by the high proportion of individuals who exit to a religious context, which consistently produces higher levels of participation. However, exiting one public school and choosing a new public school of choice does not have a statistically significant influence on subsequent behavior. In contrast, individuals whose children remained in the same public school demonstrated higher participation for two forms of behavior. Taken together, these results suggest that the act of choosing a school in and of itself has little impact on the creation of social capital and that in some instances simply staying put in the regular public school can lead to higher rates of participation in the future."
"41","Most of the difference between choosers and nonchoosers is due to individual predispositions to participate that are associated with the usual demographic variables found in political participation studies and the characteristics of religious schools. Though choice per se appears to have little effect on parental involvement, the results suggest that the school context can have an impact on parental participation. We see that parents in religious private schools have more parental participation even when you control for previous participation and demographic characteristics including religiosity. As we discussed above, Coleman and Hoffer (1987) argued that Catholic schools have more participation because parents have communal connections through the church, which creates a functional community in addition to the values community that exists by virtue of the agreement on what constitutes an appropriate education.         "
"42","Another reason that religious schools may have higher participation rates than nonreligious private and public schools is that among the factors associated with participation, religiosity is the one most equally dispersed among the public (Schlozman, Verba, and Brady 1999). Well‐educated and high‐income parents are already more likely to participate in schools regardless of the social context. Increasing participation in any large way requires recruiting lower SES parents because they are often less connected to the community. Church attendance, especially if it is connected with the school, is one activity that is likely to lead to larger patterns of civic engagement. Therefore, it is not surprising that we see more participation in a religious context. Simply put, whether a school is religious or not is an important predictor of the amount of social capital that is likely to be produced at a school.         "
"43","In terms of reforming schools to produce better outcomes, the fact that religious schools seem to produce such outcomes is not very useful. The whole point is to reform the secular public school system. Even for those people who may prefer to abolish the public school system, the influx of large numbers of individuals who are not part of the functional community associated with a particular religious group would likely change these schools in important ways. While many non‐Catholics currently go to Catholic schools, the numbers are probably such that these individuals can be assimilated into the broader school community relatively easily."
"44","Given our current knowledge, creating strong communities outside of religious schools is likely to be quite challenging with the tools that are at the disposal of education policy makers, and it does not appear that choice alone can accomplish this goal. As Campbell (2001) argues, choice mechanisms may create value communities, but are less likely to create functional communities and our analysis shows that schools with higher levels of agreement on educational goals do not spur additional parental involvement. Our research suggests that one simple institutional design that should generally increase parental involvement is ensuring that schools have smaller enrollments. It is intuitive that it is easier to get to know people and feel part of a community if that community is smaller. In addition, people may feel that their participation makes more of a difference in a smaller group setting.         "
"45","We expect that other school characteristics besides size have an impact on parental involvement. We found that school choice did not increase participation among public schools, but the ECLS‐K data did not allow for a detailed examination of different types of public schools of choice. It may be that some types of schools of choice are more effective in creating parental communities than others. Many researchers have found that private schools are less bureaucratic and have more autonomy, which may lead to a more inviting environment for parents. Perhaps public schools of choice with more autonomy look more like private than public schools. We would also gain insight by examining variance within school types. For example, it would be useful to compare differences in parental participation among Catholic schools, especially for those parents who are not Catholic. This would help us to understand whether participation levels among religious schools are due to design or because the people who send their children are already part of a community. Another factor that may be important is the choice context. Parents with more choices may behave differently than those who have fewer choices. The ECLS‐K data do not allow us to control for the types of choices available to parents, but future research should consider this issue."
"46","Since parental involvement has been found to influence student achievement (Fan and Chen 2001; Sui‐Chu and Willms 1996), understanding why some schools have higher parental participation than others is of interest to educational reformers as well as political scientists concerned with social capital. Choice does not seem to have large negative impacts on social capital as some critics would predict. However, it is unlikely that choice itself will create much additional social capital.         "
