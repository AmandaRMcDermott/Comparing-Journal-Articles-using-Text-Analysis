"1","At the center of our theory is the concept of governance, which refers to the package of centrally provided state services that support a complex decentralized market economy. Charles Tilly (1985) and others have argued that the main service that rulers provided their subjects in the late Middle Ages was protection, and Konrad and Skaperdas (2012) explain how the threat of expropriation by local bandits or distant robbers gave rise to economic insecurity, creating a market for protection. According to Konrad and Skaperdas (2012), early states emerged as participants in this market, providing protection in exchange for revenue.4 This package of services is paid for by taxation, which may be in cash, in in‐kind services (e.g., military service), or in valuable policy concessions (e.g., ceasing socially destructive activities).         "
"2","Our concept of governance builds on this literature, recognizing that over time, states provided a wider array of services than simply protection. With the rise of long‐distance trade in late medieval and early modern Europe, the demand for governed economic exchange grew, and later rulers started to provide greater market‐supporting services such as dispute resolution and economic regulation—services that had previously been provided privately by local institutions (Greif 1993; Milgrom, North, and Weingast 1990). Responding to the needs of an industrial economy, today's states provide an even wider array of public services; they also provide public goods, including public infrastructure, education, and research. It is this evolving package of state‐provided services that we refer to as “governance,” and like Konrad and Skaperdas (2012), we view states as the sellers of governance in a market where there is a demand for such a package of services.         "
"3","Building on this concept of governance, we develop a model in which the state system represents an economic cartel created by rulers to keep their revenues high by limiting competition in the governance market."
"4","Two rulers called A and B are located at the endpoints, 0 and 1, of the unit interval. A continuum of individuals of unit mass is distributed uniformly between them. We identify each individual with his location on the interval, . These individuals may be thought of as citizens or as chieftains, bishops, local lords, and other types of small‐scale authorities who exercise power within a given area.5"
"5","Each ruler i offers to sell governance to each individual by setting a location‐specific price . The cost to ruler i from providing governance to an individual at ℓ is . We assume that  is a strictly increasing function, whereas  is a strictly decreasing function, each with at most a finite number of jumps (see Figure 1). The value of governance to each individual is fixed at . Rulers simultaneously offer prices, and after looking at the prices offered, each individual decides whether or not to pay for the service, and if so, from which ruler. We refer to the set of individuals who purchase from a ruler as that ruler's subjects. Since no individual accepts a price larger than v, we interpret all offers  as indicating that ruler i chooses to stay out of the market for ℓ. Throughout the article, we study sequentially rational pricing strategies for the two profit‐maximizing rulers and buying decisions for the individuals.            "
"6","We interpret the environment geographically and depict it in Figure 1.6 The figure shows how the costs of providing the good may be discontinuous, reflecting the idea that geographic breaks such as mountains or rivers may cause abrupt changes in a ruler's cost of providing governance. We also maintain the following three assumptions:               "
"7","Because it takes spatial delineation as given, our model cannot explain why boundaries were set in geographic space rather than other spaces.7"
"8","In fact, the model can accommodate nonspatial interpretations as well. For example, distance in the model could be interpreted as social distance based on individual traits. Rulers may consider having sovereignty over people rather than territory, as in Africa, where labor was scarcer than land in comparison to Europe (Herbst 2014).               "
"9","However, at least in Europe, a spatial delineation system was the natural outcome, especially as improvements in transportation technology enabled individuals to move across space more easily. It would simply be too costly to exert control, provide governance, and raise revenue from subjects who inhabited distant lands. Rulers would have an interest in regulating human mobility, as they do today, through border control and visa requirements."
"10","That said, from the perspective of governance and revenue collection, the modern state system represents a hybrid of delineation over spatial and nonspatial boundaries. For example, tax treaties exist between modern states, suggesting that the division of control in the governance market can delineate control both over territory and over people."
"11","We say the rulers' markets overlap when  so that . When this is the case, there is an interval , depicted in Figure 1, in which rulers A and B compete to provide governance to individuals who live in the interval. We refer to the interval  as the overlapping area. Outside this area, only one ruler can profitably sell governance, making that ruler a monopoly provider. When markets overlap, assumptions (i) and (ii) and the monotonicity assumptions on cA and cB imply that .            "
"12","Our first result characterizes the subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the static model in the case of nonoverlapping and overlapping markets. It compares equilibrium profits to the joint‐profit‐maximizing levels of profit, which are               "
"13","Proposition 1.If markets do not overlap, then in equilibrium, ruler A sells to individuals in his market  at price , ruler B sells to individuals in her market  at the monopoly price , and individuals in  buy from neither A nor B. Consequently, the rulers maximize joint profit given demand.                  "
"14","If markets overlap, then in any equilibrium in which no ruler prices below cost, ruler A offers prices  to individuals in  and sells to individuals in , whereas ruler B offers prices  to individuals in  and sells to individuals in . Consequently, the profits of rulers A and B fall short of the joint‐profit‐maximizing levels of profits by, respectively,                     "
"15","The proof of (a more formal version of) this proposition is presented in the supporting information, along with all other proofs.9"
"16","When markets do not overlap, that is, when , the rulers are monopoly sellers in their respective markets and maximize joint profit. In this case, each ruler's cost of providing governance in the other ruler's market is higher than any individual's willingness to pay for it, so each ruler stays out of the other's market. No ruler can sell profitably to individuals in the interval , so we refer to the interval as ungoverned space.            "
"17","When markets overlap, each ruler can sell at the monopoly price only on the part of his or her market where the other ruler's cost exceeds each individual's willingness to pay. In the overlapping area , the rulers become Bertrand competitors, driving down each of their prices: Ruler A sells at a price equal to ruler B's cost to the west of the boundary , whereas B sells east of  at a price equal to A's cost. Consequently, the equilibrium outcome does not maximize the sum of the rulers' profits given demand, and as the proposition reports, the profits of rulers A and B fall short of their joint‐profit‐maximizing levels by  and , respectively. These are also depicted in Figure 1.            "
"18","In the discussion of our cases, we will interpret the shortfall in revenue from monopoly profits in our model as being the privileges that peripheral elites and other individuals can win from central governments by playing them off against their neighbors. Elites in an overlapping area will always have fewer taxes and more privileges than those in the core, since they have the option to be governed (e.g., buy protection) from the rival ruler, who is willing and able to provide them with governance."
"19","When the rulers' markets overlap, competition in the overlapping area drives down profits in the static game. In a repeated game, however, the rulers can improve their profits by setting up a cooperative agreement in which they divide territory at the partition point . In one such agreement, the rulers divide the overlapping market  at the joint‐profit‐maximizing boundary  and stay out of the market for the other's subjects. Territorial sovereignty emerges as a cartel agreement between rulers.            "
"20","Suppose that the rulers' markets overlap, the static game studied in the previous section is repeated indefinitely, and rulers discount future payoffs with a common discount factor . Several possible outcomes may be supported in an SPE. We consider two kinds of paths to be focal. The first is one in which a static game equilibrium of the kind characterized in Proposition 1 is played in every period of the supergame. We refer to this as a static game equilibrium path. The second is one that maximizes the joint profits of the two rulers, which is the infinite repetition of the outcome that maximizes joint profits period by period. In such a path, ruler A sells at the monopoly price v to individuals in , and B sells at the monopoly price v to individuals in . The rulers thus earn profits  and  each period. We call this the joint‐profit‐maximizing path.            "
"21","The proposition below characterizes a necessary and sufficient condition for the joint‐profit‐maximizing path to be supported by an equilibrium strategy profile of the repeated game in which the outcome path is played until and unless a deviation by either ruler has taken place, after which a static game equilibrium path is played forever after.10                              "
"22","Proposition 2.Suppose that markets overlap. The joint‐profit‐maximizing path is supported in equilibrium via the threat of reversion to any static game equilibrium path iff                     "
"23","Proposition 2 shows how the territorial state system can be rationalized as cooperation in a repeated game, and it therefore provides a “neoliberal” rationale for this system. The proposition also suggests that for cooperation to emerge, the gains from cooperation must be relatively even. Inequality 2 is more easily satisfied when the right‐hand side is low. The lowest value that this side can take is 1/2, which occurs when . This means that regardless of the magnitudes of the gains that the rulers can achieve from recognizing the limits of their authority, this recognition is most likely to emerge when the gains from cooperation are relatively even.            "
"24","Although our main contribution is to develop a new model of the territorial state system, the fact that Proposition 2 pins down the territorial boundary as being  relates (and contrasts) our work surrounding existing models of interstate borders. Alesina and Spolaore (1997), for example, study a model of state formation in which borders emerge endogenously as the outcome of majoritarian voting—an assumption that runs counter to historical development of states, which preceded democracy. In addition, Friedman (1977) develops a theory of borders based on rulers' maximizing tax revenue net of collection costs. As in our model, territory is allocated to maximize joint profit; but, unlike our model, this outcome is not based on cooperation between rulers in a cartel.            "
"25","Finally, because the cost functions may be discontinuous at geographic breaks such as rivers and mountains, the territorial boundary  is likely to occur at such a point of discontinuity. The model, therefore, provides a rationale for why many of the world's border demarcations correspond to such geographic barriers.            "
"26","Our explanation for the emergence of the state system relies on the comparative statics results stated in the proposition below. These follow directly from the environment. As usual, we say that for two functions, f and g,  when  for all x.               "
"27","Proposition 3. is weakly increasing in v and weakly decreasing in cA, whereas  is weakly decreasing in v and weakly increasing in cB.                  "
"28","The main implication of these comparative statics is that the rulers' markets are likely to overlap—and hence the impetus to develop a state system can only be present—when the value of governance, v, is large and when the costs of providing governance, cA and cB, are small. In light of this, we build on well‐known stylized facts in the literature on economic growth and armed conflict to argue that both “demand‐side” and “supply‐side” changes that took place in post–medieval Europe resulted in shifts from the situation of nonoverlapping markets to that of overlapping markets. On the demand side, increases in economic productivity led to increases in the value of governance, v. On the supply side, improvements in military and administrative technology that improved states' capacity to recruit, control, and supply effective armies lowered the costs, cA and cB, of governing distant areas. These changes resulted in increasingly overlapping markets and made rulers competitive providers of governance in these markets, also providing them with the impetus to coordinate on the cartel equilibrium above.            "
"29","Our model, therefore, provides a new explanation of the territorial state system that is grounded in the political economy of European growth in the post–medieval period.11 We are not aware of any prior work that has detailed the precise mechanism for how these economic forces shaped international organization, though some have alluded to the centrality of economic forces. Krasner (1993) simply asserts that the state system “can be explained primarily by material, not ideational, factors,” (235) and that “the development of long distance trade … advantaged larger units” (261). Osiander (2001) too is vague, writing that “the most significant transition occurred with the French Revolution and the onset of industrialization, not with the Peace of Westphalia” (281; emphasis added). Spruyt (1996) discusses economic development in the Middle Ages as a disrupter of feudalism but declares that the emergence of the sovereign state from this disruption was not necessarily inevitable. The literature nevertheless supports the idea that economic developments and material interests shaped the modern state system.            "
"30","Similarly, on the supply side, we are not the first to link military and administrative innovations (e.g., the invention of artillery and the creation of more effective means of disciplining and supplying troops at long distances) to the political changes of the early modern period. Several authors, of whom Tilly (1992) is perhaps the best known, have traced the institutional development of European states to the military and administrative demands of war.12 We differ from this work, however, in linking military and administrative innovations to the state system—that is, where states stop governing, rather than how their internal organization evolved over time with these changes.            "
"31","In the supporting information, we develop several extensions to show how the model can shed light on other aspects of international organization."
"32","Motivated by the comparative statics reported in Proposition 3, we develop a dynamic extension in which cooperation emerges in time as the rulers' losses from competition grow. Because our baseline model studies the static cases of cooperation and noncooperation separately, one might argue that it only rationalizes the state system without capturing the change in rulers' incentives across the transition from noncooperation to cooperation. By embedding the two cases of nonoverlapping and over‐lapping markets into a unified model, the dynamic extension captures these changes.13"
"33","We provide an extension that extends the bilateral setting above to a multilateral one with more than two rulers. This enables us to make the distinction between independent cooperation and interdependent cooperation. Under independent cooperation, the relationship between two rulers is unaffected by each of their relationships with other rulers. Under interdependent cooperation, it is not. If one ruler fails to cooperate with another, then the first ruler's relationship with a third ruler may collapse as well. This extension helps account for the survival of small states in the international system. States recognize less powerful neighbors because they fear that annexing the small, weak states may lead their other relationships to unravel as well.14"
"34","In this extension, the stability of the state system may be challenged not just by rulers, but also by opportunist subjects seeking to establish themselves as new rulers by entering the governance market. As in other cartel models, existing providers have an incentive to deter entry because it threatens their profits. The large fixed costs associated with starting a new state enable existing states to suppress entry by new potential rulers."
"35","In this extension, the joint‐profit‐maximizing boundary between two rulers may shift as governance costs change over time. When this happens, either the old (historical) boundary or the new joint‐profit‐maximizing one may be focal. We show that it is ambiguous as to whether the conditions needed to make cooperation self‐enforcing are stronger under the new joint‐profit‐maximizing boundary or the old, since the shift in the costs can make the gains from cooperation more or less even.15"
"36","Finally, while our model predicts stable borders and cooperation, history is replete with violent international conflict. Does this conflict not undermine the potential for long‐term cooperation? When we embed a standard model of conflict into our framework, we find that in equilibrium, cooperation can be reestablished after periods of conflict. Conflict serves as a mechanism by which a ruler credibly reveals any changes in his cost of providing governance when movements in this cost are private information."
"37","We now illustrate a key observable implication of our theory—that the creation of a boundary as the result of cooperation between rulers should be followed by greater state control and expanded revenue collection in border areas.16 We provide evidence for this in the case of England/Scotland, for which we have relatively high‐quality information on how cooperation took place. We discuss three other cases (Spain, France, and Sweden) more briefly in the supporting information.         "
"38","Administratively, the border area between England and Scotland was a weak area for both states into the seventeenth century, with powerful local families (e.g., the Percys and Nevilles on the English side, the Douglasses and Homes on the Scottish) building up fiefs that enjoyed considerably more independence from royal interference than vassals elsewhere (see, e.g., Fraser 2008). On the English side, this autonomy was sometimes formalized by the granting of “liberties,” by which certain areas were exempted from ordinary royal jurisdiction, with courts being answerable to the local lord.17 Some border families pressed their advantages even further, particularly those based in the “debatable lands,” a belt of territory on the western border claimed by both England and Scotland. The Armstrongs, the leading family in the area, maintained an armed force of 3,000 men in 1528, and they used them to raid cattle on both sides of the border, with the looted cattle being sold on the opposite side (Maxwell 1896, 161).         "
"39","During the course of the sixteenth century, however, the English and Scottish monarchies began to cooperate to assert their authority in the border region. The most prominent casualties of this process were the nobles who previously dominated the area. On the English side, the Percys and the Nevilles put aside their differences to lead a revolt against the court in 1569, but they were defeated and their lands seized. On the Scottish side, the Armstrongs were severely weakened by executions and punitive land redistributions. Administrative powers gradually passed from these lords to bureaucratic entities such as the Council of the North (reestablished in 1537). The liberties were gradually abolished; for example, Hexhamshire (see note 17) was merged with the crown in 1545 and abolished in 1572. Eventually, the border areas were fully merged into the general administrative structures of the two kingdoms. The area was renamed the “Middle Shires,” separate legal jurisdictions were abolished, hundreds of bandits were executed, and both governments issued a series of restrictions on armament and fortification (Fraser 2008, 361–9).         "
"40","In what follows, we provide detailed evidence for this process and a discussion of the rulers' motivations for carrying it out."
"41","The administrative integration of the border region was the result of a centuries‐long, gradually intensifying process of cooperation between England and Scotland. This cooperation involved three steps: (i) an agreement in principle to the existence of separate, territorially defined sovereign states, (ii) an agreement on the exact course of the territorial division, and (iii) the development of joint institutions to adjudicate disputes and frustrate the ability of local lords to play one side off against the other. We provide a brief account of these three steps as follows."
"42","During the early Middle Ages, the English kings had claimed feudal superiority (as “Lord Paramount”) over all of Scotland, and at various times attempted to annex and administer portions of southern Scotland and to serve as the arbitrator of legal disputes there (as in the “Great Cause,” 1291, where Edward I chose from among several competing claimants to the Scottish throne). As a result, the demarcation between the two kingdoms (and recognition of Scotland's sovereignty) was either nonexistent or highly fluid. Many lords held land in both kingdoms, and even the Scottish king held some lordships on the “English side” (Holford and Stringer 2010, 250).               "
"43","The confusion over the status of the two polities was resolved gradually over the next few centuries by a series of cooperative treaties. The Treaty of Edinburgh‐Northampton (1328), for example, elevated the status of the Scottish prince, Lord Robert, to that of sovereign ruler of Scotland, a land “separate in all things from the Kingdom of England, whole, free and undisturbed in perpetuity, without any kind of subjection, service claim or demand.” This recognition forced lords to choose masters, leading to a precipitous decline in cross‐border landholding (Holford and Stringer 2010). Despite this, however, the next quarter century saw continued English efforts to annex Scotland (whole or in part) with the help of disaffected Scottish lords. This conflict was ended by the Treaty of Berwick (1357), in which England returned to the Scots their captive king and recognized him once again as sovereign in return for a ransom demand and territorial concessions.               "
"44","No subsequent English ruler would question Scotland's status as an independent state, though they would periodically occupy portions of it or attempt to gain control of it through strategic marriages. In fact, even when they occupied Southern Scotland, the English never tried to annex it, and the areas they controlled “remained entirely separate from England, both legally and politically” (King and Etty 2015, 161). Remarkably, the two kingdoms remained legally separate for a century even after a single monarch (James VI of Scotland, and I of England) took power in both in 1603.               "
"45","Even after the Scots won full recognition of their independence, the boundary was not precisely demarcated and, instead, the Treaty of Edinburgh‐Northampton enigmatically defined Scotland's boundaries as “its own proper marches as they were held and maintained in the time of King Alexander” (as quoted in Maxwell 1912, 170). Particular bones of contention were the debatable lands, to which both sides held claim. The lawlessness of this region prompted one of Europe's first formal processes of border demarcation, a process especially remarkable because it took place between polities with a strong tradition of mutual hostility. In 1552, the two states appointed a five‐man commission to draw a border, with each party appointing two members and the French ambassador serving as a neutral arbiter. A mutually agreeable line was surveyed through the area, giving the Scots more territory but the English control of the main road. The new border was marked by the “Scot's dike,” an earthen mound with a ditch on either side (MacKenzie 1951).               "
"46","Even in places where the borders were clear, their proximity created opportunities for astute locals to play one ruler off against the other. The leaders of local “surnames” (the landowning clans of the region) robbed and murdered on one side, returning to sell their loot on the other. To control such raids, the two kingdoms developed a remarkable system of international law enforcement, the “March Law,” which attained full institutional development in the 1340s, though its roots were older (King and Etty 2015, 162). The law was administered by royal officials, the “Wardens of the Marches,” who worked closely with their opposite numbers on the other side of the border (Neville 1988).               "
"47","March Law was both customary and defined in “law books of the border,” which were periodically compared to each other to ensure conformity (King and Etty 2015, 166). A variety of crimes were covered, including murder, theft, kidnapping, seizure of castles, and illegal cattle grazing. While victims were allowed the (carefully defined) right of hot pursuit, reprisals were strictly forbidden (King and Etty 2015, 167). Instead, disputes were judged on specific “March Days” presided over by the two wardens, with juries chosen to be half Scottish and half English. Wardens were responsible for enforcing judgments against criminals on their side of the border, and they might pay out of their own pocket if they were unable to raise the fine from the criminal through their own court system.               "
"48","Interstate legal cooperation extended much further once the two kingdoms came under the rule of King James in 1603, though the proposals for such cooperation predate his accession. A joint border commission was established, even more independent of local elites than the warden's courts had been, but still representing both countries equally. The commission was responsible for the final “pacification” of the borders, disarming the surnames and executing hundreds of bandits (Fraser 2008).               "
"49","Why did the English and Scottish, bitter enemies in many other contexts, cooperate in their border policy? The surviving documents emphasize the desire to assert control over their territories by eliminating the border elites. This point was raised in the crucial Scottish Privy Council meeting of 1551, which agreed to the partition of the debatable lands with England. Instead of discussing the international situation and the gains to relations with England, the Council focused its attention on its exasperation with the area's residents, and the internal gains of partition. Burton (1877, 118–19) quotes the minutes of this meeting, which reflect exactly this exasperation:               "
"50","Having had consideration of the great and heavy crimes committed upon our sovereign lady's poor lieges by thieves and other malefactors, broken men, and the diverse murders and slaughters committed in the past, and especially by the inhabitants of the debatable land, who by night and day continually ride and make daily plunder and oppressions upon the poor … and no victim can get remedied, nor any criminal can be put to due punishment…"
"51","Similarly, the main reasons advanced for the division have less to do with the advantages for relations with England, or the international situation, but rather with the advantages that demarcation would bring to the internal political economy of Scotland:               "
"52","[We] have thought it good, necessary and expedient that the debatable land be divided with such restrictions and conclusions as shall be concluded by the Queen's Grace, my lord Governor, and council, for the common good of the realm, the rest and quietness of the lieges thereof, and the keeping of the peace in all times to come."
"53","Likewise, the correspondences of the English diplomats show another interesting aspect of the partition exercise: the fact that both governments were well aware that demarcation was in the interests of the central government and not that of border elites, and that many of the powerful locals would not look kindly on any such division. O'Sullivan (2016, Chapter 6) quotes one such letter:               "
"54","Wherefore if a map were to be truly made by the consent of some men to be appointed on both parts, it is though that there might be a reasonable and equal division made by men which should have indifferent respect to the quiet and concord of both the realms, and not to be led with any private affection to the people dwelling on either parts of the said debatable [lands]. And, indeed the less privy the Borderers be made to the division hereof, the more likely it is that the thing will take place."
"55","As the passage shows, the diplomats involved perceived themselves, in many respects, as having more in common with their fellow “indifferent” experts on the other side than with the border elites.18"
"56","Such documents, not intended for publication, provide the best available window into the motivations of early modern policy makers. They suggest that underneath the often tempestuous relationship between England and Scotland ran an important thread of common interest: the desire to control their turbulent border subjects."
"57","Perhaps the most influential ideational theory for the development of the modern state system is the Westphalia hypothesis: the idea that the Peace of Westphalia (1648) engendered the norm of territorial sovereignty, and therefore marked a critical juncture in the development of the modern state system. This particular ideational theory has been strongly critiqued in the literature by Osiander (2001), De Carvalho, Leira, and Hobson (2011), Krasner (1993), and many others.19"
"58","However, it remains possible that the territorial state system nevertheless developed as a result of an encounter with new ideas that resulted in a change in norms and ideology. This is a widely held view in international relations theory, supported by numerous authors. Ruggie (1993) writes, for example, that “the mental equipment that people drew upon in imagining and symbolizing forms of political community itself underwent fundamental change” and that “historians of political thought have long noted the impact on the emerging self‐image held by European territorial rulers of a new model of social order” (157). Philpott (2001) echoes this view, claiming that “revolutions in sovereignty result from prior revolutions in ideas about justice and political authority” (4).            "
"59","There are many theories of why and when these ideological changes occurred. Nexon (2009) discusses the role of the Reformation in changing the ideological basis of European politics in this period in a way that made the “composite” polities common in the early sixteenth century obsolete. Osiander (1994, 281) argues that the French Revolution represented the most important watershed, but only in the context of a gradual long‐term evolution of political ideas that led to the development of “a shared, rather elaborate code of structural and procedural legitimacy” (279).            "
"60","A closely related argument is that the ideas about territory and technologies for demarcating space changed in the early modern period, making “modern” territoriality ideologically possible. Political geographers have been especially active in examining the ways in which ideas about territory and territoriality evolved over time (Agnew 2009; Elden 2013; Larkins 2009). They argue that territory, and particularly the bounded, less hierarchical idea of sovereignty, was an idea that had to be constructed. However, relative to Philpott (2001), the geography literature is less explicit in stating that these ideational changes caused the state system to develop, instead focusing on describing the ideological changes that occurred.            "
"61","At the same time, other authors express skepticism about the primacy of ideas, suggesting that state building altered political theory rather than the reverse. Krasner (1993) is among the skeptics, arguing that ideas were simply “legitimating rationales” that rulers could draw on to provide legitimacy to actions that they undertook primarily in their material self‐interest. He writes:               "
"62","Initially, the ideas [of sovereignty] were just hooks to justify actions that were motivated by considerations of wealth and power, not by visions of justice and truth. European leaders were fortunate in having many hooks because of the diversity and richness of European intellectual traditions. (Krasner 1993, 257)                  "
"63","Even authors sympathetic to ideational arguments agree that self‐interested motives also played a role, at least for some actors. Osiander (1994, 260), for instance, believes that private correspondences of Cardinal Richelieu and his allies in the Thirty Years' War show a desire for self‐aggrandizement much more than they do a commitment to any ideal of political order. More subtly, Nexon (2009) argues that the ideological changes of the Reformation were important precisely because of the way in which they interacted with existing patterns of nonreligious political contestation.            "
"64","Evaluating the causal impact of new ideas is difficult. Nevertheless, our model does not exclude the possibility that the ideas that succeeded and spread were both shaped by material interests and in turn had an influence on the way rulers construed their interests. The interpretation of our model on this issue is that if new principles were the primary drivers of change, rulers should have an incentive to adhere to the principles; that is, those principles should be self‐enforcing. Otherwise, it becomes difficult to explain not just why these principles spread but also why the stability of a system built upon these principles would not gradually be undermined by rulers realizing their interests in violating them.            "
"65","The period of state building was a period of rapid change in the capabilities of states to make war, administer justice, and collect revenue (Gennaioli and Voth 2015). Spruyt (1996) argues that differences in capabilities across institutional forms were crucial for “the victory of the sovereign state” (154). The main portion of Spruyt's argument shows that variations in trade created alternative political forms in some parts of Europe during the Middle Ages. However, in chapter 8, he addresses our question: why these alternative political structures were eliminated during the early modern period.            "
"66","Unlike our theory, Spruyt's (1996) focuses on competition and selection among states rather than cooperation. For him, the sovereign, territorial state had “institutionally superior arrangements” (32) relative to city leagues and large empires, particularly in their ability to wage war.20 Moreover, the organization of territorial states was incompatible with other forms of political organization and authority, whose claims they did not respect. Spruyt (1996) holds that changes in the internal structure of states changed the state system, as “sovereign states selected out and delegitimized actors who did not fit a system of territorially demarcated and internally hierarchical authorities” (28). Combined with the superior resources of the sovereign state, over time this delegitimization would lead to nonterritorial polities' being selected out through “mimicry and exit” (171).            "
"67","One shortcoming of this argument is that improvements in the economics of coercion or taxation, even uneven ones, are not guaranteed to lead to a territorial state system. In fact, improvements in military and administrative capacity are compatible with both claims of universal empire and the practice of mixed sovereignty. This claim receives support from the fact that outside of Europe, the introduction of early modern military innovations such as gunpowder was not accompanied by the development of a sovereignty norm. In fact, the so‐called “gunpowder empires” of the Ottomans, Safavids, Mughals, and Qing used the new technology to repress local rulers and build large polities that explicitly claimed universal dominion (McNeill 1989). Some of these states, particularly the Qing, also made moves toward homogenous internal markets and administrative rationalization similar to what Spruyt (1996) describes in Europe.21"
"68","Therefore, while Spruyt's (1996) selection argument provides an explanation for why some polities (e.g., France and Spain) succeeded while others (e.g., the Hanseatic League) failed, it does not explain why the successful, institutionally superior states subsequently recognized each other's claims rather than continuing the process of “selecting out” the weaker states. Many states eventually ceased to claim all the territory that they could potentially have administered, or to which they might have laid claims. In particular, even if we accept that territorial polities are ideologically incompatible with city leagues, Spruyt's theory leaves unexplained why territorial polities would be compatible with each other in the long run. This is precisely where our model complements his.            "
"69","Another explanation for the development of the territorial state system is the development of national identities. According to this theory, as individuals formed strong ethnic, linguistic, and religious attachments to particular states, changes in the costs of governing these individuals dictated the location of borders and bolstered the development of the state system by making it costly to annex territories inhabited by populations who saw themselves as belonging to other states."
"70","While nationalism did coevolve with norms of territorial sovereignty, territorial divisions are likely to have reified national identities rather than the other way around. While the state system is typically thought of as originating in the early modern period (if not before), the classic accounts of nationalism describe the rise of the nation‐state as taking place largely in the nineteenth century with the growth of conscription and primary schooling (Anderson 2006; Weber 1976).            "
"71","In fact, it is possible to explain the emergence of nationalism in a way that reinforces our argument. States first agree on borders and then work hard to ensure that citizens on their side of the boundary identify with their institutions and not those of their neighbors (Laitin, Solé, and Kalyvas 1994). Over time, this increases the costs for the neighboring state of governing a disloyal population in the border region. The rise of national attachments could provide an explanation for why long‐established borders remain stable over time, even as the military capacities of the two states shift.            "
"72","The modern territorial state system is a remarkable institutional construction that did not always exist. While borders are certainly contested in some regions of the world today, they are stable and meaningful political demarcations in most of the modern world. The Canadian and American governments do not collect taxes from the residents of cities and towns just across their common border. This is a fact that requires explanation."
"73","We have offered a new explanation for this fact built upon the economics of competition between states. States in our model are natural competitors in the market for governance, and their competition drives down the revenues that each can collect from providing governance to their citizens. Like modern economic cartels, they divide the market to limit competition and keep revenues high. Occasional shocks may lead to conflict over parts of the governance market, but the system of geographically defined states has, by and large, been stable."
"74","In an alternative world where competition in the governance market is allowed, the residents of Neche, North Dakota, could presumably decide whether to pay taxes to the American government or to the Canadian government (or neither) for public goods and services. They may even decide which services to buy from which government, for example, public education from the United States and healthcare from Canada (or invite bidding as to which state would provide these services at the lowest cost). The same could be true for the residents of Gretna, Manitoba, just two miles north of Neche. This, however, is not the reality we live in, and our theory provides an explanation for why states have made sure that it is not."
"75","Our theory raises new questions about the development of the territorial state system. For example, it leaves open for further examination the exact mechanisms by which cooperation was achieved, the role of technological improvements such as the development of maps, and institutional developments such as the exchange of ambassadors. Further work is also needed on the exact ways in which changes in international norms impacted local‐level state behavior, and how the territorial state system spread first to the edges of Europe and later to the rest of the world.22"
"76","Finally, our assertion that the state system is supported by rulers' interests in keeping their revenues high (and consequently the welfare of their citizens low) raises the question of how long such a low citizen–welfare equilibrium could persist, especially after the institutional developments of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries—in particular, the advent of democracy and the rise of globalization. Research on these questions will help us further understand the changes in how political authority was organized over the last millennium, and may even provide clues as to how it may evolve in the future."
"77","Indeed, the territorial state system, now established, appears stable. But it will have to adapt to the modern technological changes, globalization, and new international institutions changing the way the world is governed."
