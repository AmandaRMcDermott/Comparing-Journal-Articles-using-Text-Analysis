"1","The model features a simple mechanism whereby a bureaucrat makes a binary allocation decision for each member of a set of citizens or clients, under the supervision of a political principal. While the model is intended to capture a range of possible bureaucratic decisions, the following discussion will refer to the product of an affirmative bureaucratic decision as a good."
"2","The set of potential recipients of the good is a large population of N citizens. Each has a private valuation or type drawn i.i.d. from the finite set Θ, where . Each type  satisfies  for all i, and . Let  denote the probability that a client is of type .         "
"3","The bureaucrat uses a means test to determine whether each client receives the good. Denote by  the level of bureaucratic testing effort. Testing generates a binary result corresponding to “fail” and “pass,” where  is the probability of passage. The good is allocated if and only if the client passes.5 The probability of passing is either increasing and concave or decreasing and convex, as follows:            "
"4","The sets  and  are nonempty and partition Θ. Set  is referred to as qualified and benefits from more testing, whereas  is referred to as marginal and benefits from less testing. The parameter  is a measure of bureaucratic expertise. Higher values of α generate higher probabilities of acceptance (respectively, rejection) for types in  (respectively, ). The parameter  is a measure of testing effectiveness, with higher values increasing the “default” probability of acceptance (respectively, rejection) at  for types in  (respectively, ). For example,  represents the most difficult testing problem, as all types pass with probability 1/2 when tested at the minimum level of 1. This functional form usefully eliminates most corner solutions. It will be convenient to denote by  and  the set of indices in  and , respectively.         "
"5","The bureaucrat maximizes the program's “quality,” or its weighted ability to deliver the proper benefit to each type.6 She receives  for any client of type  who receives the good, or any client of type  who does not receive the good. Thus,  serves as a measure for the extent to which the bureaucrat is interested in investigating a type‐ client. Combined with 1, these payoff assumptions implicitly represent the bureau's authority and expertise in designing its testing scheme: For each type, her desired outcome becomes more likely as testing increases.         "
"6","The bureaucrat chooses a direct mechanism or screen  that tests clients at level  for a report of type . Clients “arrive” at the bureaucrat in i.i.d. fashion, and so the probability of a type‐ client is always simply . Given truthful reporting, the bureaucrat's objective is then            "
"7","The politician moves first by specifying a pair  for the bureaucrat prior to her mechanism choice. The parameter s () is the size of the population that the bureaucrat is mandated to serve through means tests and allocation choices, where for analytical convenience I allow s to take on non‐integer values.7 The parameter  is the bureaucrat's budget, which constrains the ex ante number of clients she can test as follows:            "
"8","Clients care only about receiving the good. Testing does not impose any direct costs on clients, though the “Rejection Bias and Red Tape” subsection in the next section considers a variant of the model in which the bureaucrat can associate some type announcements with “red tape.” A client therefore only cares about his report insofar as they affect testing. A type‐ client who announces type  receives the following expected utility:            "
"9","Finally, the principal wishes to maximize the net surplus of citizens of some type , but he pays the cost of bureaucratic testing resources.8 This favored type may be either qualified or marginal. Given truth telling under the bureaucrat's screen, the principal's objective can be written as            "
"10","As is standard, attention can be restricted to direct and truthful mechanisms. Thus, clients optimally report their true types, and the bureaucrat commits not to use the client's revealed information ex post to extract her surplus. Optimal truthful reporting is captured by the client's incentive compatibility (IC) constraints, which require that each type  prefers reporting  to any :            "
"11","Additionally, each type  must be willing to participate in the allocation mechanism, as captured by her individual rationality (IR) constraint:            "
"12","I begin with the standard exercise of deriving the bureaucrat's solution under the assumption that client types are known. The bureaucrat then maximizes her objective 2 subject to her budget constraint 3, taking as given her budget b and population mandate s. Performing the straightforward constrained optimization problem yields the first result on the relationship between testing levels for different types. For notational simplicity, I hereafter abuse notation slightly and let .               "
"13","Lemma 1. ([First Best])Under the first best, at an interior solution the testing levels for any types  and  satisfy                     "
"14","               "
"15","Proof.All proofs are in the supporting information.                  "
"16","The lemma defines a system of equations that characterizes testing levels at an interior solution. Each  is a fixed proportion of every other testing level and is independent of b, s, and the distribution of types. This implies that there is a unique profile of testing levels that satisfies the budget constraint with equality. Corner solutions are sometimes possible.            "
"17","The comparative statics on testing are mostly intuitive. Type 's relative testing intensity is increasing in . This ratio, which measures the return to testing type , will be useful throughout the remainder of the article. A high value means that the bureaucrat cares greatly about the correct result, and testing has a relatively large effect in changing the probability of acceptance. The effect of expertise (α) depends on these expected returns: The testing level for  relative to  is increasing in α if , and decreasing otherwise. This reflects the greater impact of expertise on types with lower expected returns.            "
"18","For the principal's decision problem under the first best, the effects of the budget and population follow directly from Lemma 1 and the fact that the budget constraint binds. Since the ratio between testing levels is independent of b, a change in the budget produces a proportional change in all inspection levels. The effect of s is simply the inverse of the effect of b. A principal who favors a qualified type () would choose a large budget and client population if the returns from doing so were sufficiently high. This requires not only a bureaucrat who is willing to choose a high , but also a high client valuation  and a high proportion  of such types in the population.            "
"19","When types are private information, the principal faces the problem of offering a testing profile that elicits honest reporting in an incentive‐compatible way. The key implication of incentive compatibility is that the bureaucrat largely loses her ability to discriminate across types. Since all qualified types prefer higher testing, they would opt for the highest offered testing level. Similarly, all marginal types would opt for the lowest available testing level."
"20","Lemma 2 establishes that there can then be at most two levels of testing across the entire client population, with all qualified types tested at one common level, and all marginal types tested at another. Moreover, these two levels can be unequal in only one way: qualified types can be tested more stringently because more testing attracts them but deters marginal types. Compared to the first‐best solution, the optimal incentive‐compatible testing profile is relatively unresponsive to the bureaucrat's preferences.               "
"21","Lemma 2. ([Testing Uniformity]) for all ,  for all , and "
"22","The result is a consequence of the assumption that the bureaucrat has only one dimension—the level of means testing—to control each type's payoff. This contrasts with other common screening problems, where the uninformed player typically has the ability to impose different side payments on different types. As the “Rejection Bias and Red Tape” subsection in the next section shows, bureaucratic side payments would enable a a greater degree of discrimination across types."
"23","To characterize testing levels, it is useful to consider a version of the first best in which the bureaucrat tests all marginal types in  at one level and all types in  at another, but without the constraint that . If the derived  testing level is greater than the  testing level, then IC 6 is satisfied. Otherwise, IC is violated and the best the bureaucrat can do is to impose a “uniform” test of  on all types. In both cases, the screening mechanism is implementable if the testing levels are feasible (i.e., at least 1).            "
"24","The bureaucrat's desire to test qualified versus marginal types depends on  for each type . Recall that this ratio captures her expected return from testing. If these ratios are generally high for qualified types and low for marginal types, then she will be more interested in correct acceptances than in correct rejections. Accordingly, the bureaucrat will want higher testing for qualified types. The acceptance bias condition and its complement, rejection bias, capture the predilections for acceptances and rejections, respectively, and are formally defined as follows.               "
"25","Definition 1. ([Acceptance and Rejection Bias])The bureaucrat is acceptance biased (respectively, rejection biased) if                     "
"26","The next result then characterizes the optimal implementable screening mechanisms.               "
"27","Proposition 1. ([Testing])"
"28","Proposition 1 shows that acceptance and rejection biases play a central role in program implementation. Manipulating expression 9 reveals that acceptance bias implies  and . Acceptance bias thus implies that ; that is, the bureaucrat can discriminate by testing qualified types more intensively than marginal types. By contrast, rejection bias renders discrimination and the delivery of targeted benefits impossible, as each client is treated identically. From the bureaucrat's perspective, rejection bias maximizes allocative inefficiencies, as she is forced to overtest types in  and undertest types in .            "
"29","The final step is to characterize the principal's budget and population choices. The principal's maximization problem breaks down into two main cases, depending on the kind of group he favors. Each case produces distinct styles of program implementation and also generates basic measures of program performance. These measures are directly related to all of the administrative pathologies identified in the introduction except politicization, which is addressed in the following section. The outputs are as follows:               "
"30","Note that Type I errors are defined as approvals of the good to types in  (e.g., approving a bad drug), whereas Type II errors are denials of the good to types in  (e.g., rejecting a good drug). The errors therefore reflect the bureaucrat's preferences over approving different types. Both types of errors are conditional upon participation in the bureaucrat's mechanism, and therefore we do not count Type II errors arising from failure to serve eligible clients.            "
"31","When , the principal's problem is simple: members of his preferred group benefit from low testing (i.e., low t), and low testing has the additional benefit of reducing per capita costs. Testing is minimized at the corner . The principal can ensure this testing level with a budget exactly equal to the client population size, and thus . Substituting these expressions into expression 5 produces a simple objective that is concave in s:                  "
"32","Maximization of this objective produces the first main result.10 There exists a unique interior optimum if N is sufficiently large. Low testing costs allow the politician to make the program broad, but he may stop short of testing all members of society (including some members of his preferred type) because of the cost of testing types other than .                  "
"33","Proposition 2. ([Principal Favors Marginal Type])If , then at an interior solution, , and "
"34","The equilibrium is quite simple, as the principal deliberately “starves” the agency with a low per capita budget. The minimal testing of clients maximizes error rates and serves the politician's favored group, but without any meaningful targeting by either the principal or the bureaucrat. This case may be an apt description of recent developments in the IRS EO division, where Republican supporters of politically motivated organizations have also supported cuts in IRS funding that reduced service levels.11"
"35","Comment 1 characterizes program performance. The result follows straightforwardly from Proposition 2 and is therefore stated without proof.                  "
"36","Comment 1. ([Comparative Statics with a Favored Marginal Type])"
"37","Parts (i) and (iii) of the result imply that when a marginal group is favored, the bureaucrat's preferences are irrelevant: Any bureaucrat would subject all covered clients to the same, minimal treatment. Thus, replacing the bureaucrat can matter only when a qualified group is favored. Part (ii) states that the program is larger when the expected returns from testing the population are high. This will be the case if type‐ clients are common in the pool of possible clients, or if type  passes at a high rate when exposed to minimal testing due to a low cp. Similarly, a reduction in q generates a positive budget shock that boosts program size.               "
"38","When , the principal wants to use higher testing levels to help favored clients, but testing is costly and reduces the population that can be served. There are two subcases, depending on whether the bureaucrat is rejection or acceptance biased.               "
"39","By Proposition 1, rejection bias implies a common testing level . Since the bureaucrat's budget constraint binds, expression 3 implies that  is simply the per capita budget:                  "
"40","The principal then chooses b and s by trading off between testing costs and approvals for the favored group. Substituting  into his objective produces the following:                  "
"41","Proposition 3 describes the resulting budget, program size, and testing level.12                                    "
"42","Proposition 3. ([Principal Favors Qualified Type, Rejection‐Biased Bureaucrat])If  and the bureaucrat is rejection biased, then at an interior solution, , , and "
"43","Two comparisons with the favored marginal type case (Proposition 2) are noteworthy. Favoring a qualified type increases testing if , that is, if bureaucratic expertise is high. As  increases, the need for testing decreases and the politician responds by expanding the program. Additionally, rejection bias ensures that there is again no meaningful targeting of benefits, as all clients receive either no service or uniform treatment. This combination of expertise and nondiscrimination might be described as “neutrally competent” administration.               "
"44","In the second subcase, acceptance bias makes limited testing discrimination possible. Using Proposition 1(ii), the principal's objective can be written to reflect the increased testing () that type  receives as follows:                  "
"45","Conveniently, this objective is simply a weighted version of the rejection‐biased case in 14. Maximizing 15 produces the following result.                  "
"46","Proposition 4. ([Principal Favors Qualified Type, Acceptance‐Biased Bureaucrat])If  and the bureaucrat is acceptance biased, then at an interior solution:                        "
"47","Many of the comparative statics for budgets () and program size () in Propositions 3 and 4 are identical to those in Proposition 2, where the politician favored a marginal type. However, two significant differences are immediately apparent. First, as the expressions for testing levels make clear, the bureaucrat's testing ability (as measured by α and cp) matters. Second, if in addition the bureaucrat is acceptance biased, then her preferences () also affect equilibrium strategies through the parameters  and .               "
"48","Comparing Propositions 3 and 4, it is evident that acceptance bias produces implementation flexibility, a larger budget, lower per capita spending and testing, and a larger client population. Flexibility gives the principal the ability to offer a measure of favorable treatment for his preferred clients. The resulting form of administration might therefore be described as “responsive competence.” The larger client population implies fewer or smaller backlogs, or situations in which the program's capacity falls short of the client population. Notably, qualified types are tested identically across the acceptance bias and rejection bias subcases, producing an acceptance probability of .13 This implies that the cut in per capita spending under acceptance bias falls exclusively on marginal types, who benefit from the increased Type I errors due to reduced scrutiny. The main comparative statics on program outputs echo this comparison, as summarized by Comment 2.                  "
"49","Comment 2. ([Comparative Statics with a Favored Qualified Type])"
"50","Comment 2 has two nonobvious implications. The first lies in the contrast between Parts (i) and (ii): per capita spending moves in the opposite direction from the budget and client population. Budget increases caused by changes in some  result in larger client populations and lower average testing. By contrast, changing the principal's favored type can cause budgets and per capita spending to move in the same direction, since the smallest budgets and most error‐prone programs can result when the politician favors a marginal group. The second follows from the contrast between Parts (iii) and (iv): since bureaucratic flexibility results from acceptance bias, it is associated with lower average testing levels and in turn a higher frequency of only Type I errors.16"
"51","The comparative statics in Comment 2 are generally strict when the bureaucrat is acceptance biased, or roughly when she “agrees” with a politician who favors a qualified type on the distribution of testing effort. This produces an implication for the appointment of bureaucrats. Such a politician need not appoint a bureaucrat who cares about  in particular in order to induce acceptance bias. Because of the bureaucrat's inability to discriminate across qualified types, a high motivation for testing any qualified types is sufficient.               "
"52","Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between program outputs with a qualified favored type and both acceptance and rejection bias. An example of these biases is the evolution of drug approval policies at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the 1980s (Carpenter 2010). The FDA initially built a strong public reputation through an emphasis on scientific rigor, resulting most prominently from its refusal to approve thalidomide in the early 1960s. This conservatism was embedded in the FDA's rigid approval procedures, but in response to the AIDS crisis, the agency formalized policies for widespread “compassionate use” of drugs in the review pipeline that were intended for AIDS and other life‐threatening diseases. These policies probably increased the chances of Type I errors, but they also reflected a lower payoff from avoiding such errors. Thus, the agency moved from rejection bias to acceptance bias, which corresponded to an increase in bureaucratic discrimination.17"

The figure plots the budget  (top left), client population  (top right), per capita spending (bottom left), and acceptance probabilities (bottom right), as a function of w2. Note that the acceptance probability for type θ1 is increasing because testing levels are decreasing.                           "
"55","Many of the comparative statics results of the previous section held the principal's favored group constant. However, political transitions such as elections can generate important changes in bureaucratic behavior. The next result compares equilibrium parameters between the cases where the principal favors marginal and qualified types.               "
"56","Comment 3. ([Comparing Marginal and Qualified Favored Types])When the favored type is marginal:                     "
"57","The overall picture presented by Comment 3 is that oversight by a principal who favors a marginal group will generally result in an under‐resourced and poorly run program. Part (i) follows simply from the fact that a principal minimizes per capita testing resources when he favors a marginal type. Part (ii) shows that such a program will always have a lower budget, and sometimes a lower client population as well. Interestingly, overall enrollments are not always lower: it is possible to derive circumstances under which such a program can serve the broadest possible population when cp is low. Thus, the most error‐prone programs can actually have less backlogs than more expert or competent programs overseen by a politician who cared about a qualified type.            "
"58","A final but important contrast between politicians who favor qualified versus marginal groups is their incentive to politicize bureaucratic procedures. Politicization of the bureaucracy can take on many forms, including the appointment of particular personnel and pork barrel spending. In the model, politicization might also be interpreted as bureaucratic flexibility, since she is only able to discriminate across client types in a way that benefits a favored qualified type. Here, I consider whether the bureaucrat's testing technology cp can be manipulated to the benefit of the politician's favored group.            "
"59","Comment 1(ii) suggests that a politician who favors a marginal group might do better by forcing the bureaucrat to use a less effective test, or equivalently by making her classification problem “harder.” A lower value of  increases the probability that members of such a group pass the test, and thereby gives the politician an incentive to dictate less accurate procedures or technologies, or to use less competent personnel. As an example, since the 1980s, Congress has actively manipulated benefit‐cost analysis to limit the Federal Aviation Administration's ability to evaluate outsourced control tower services (Mills 2013).            "
"60","By contrast, a politician who favors a qualified type has the opposite incentive. In equilibrium, increasing cp secures greater benefits for the preferred group through both increased program coverage and higher passage rates. Additionally, since the bureaucrat cares primarily about the quality of her implemented tests, she generally prefers higher values of cp as well. This logic holds for both acceptance‐biased and rejection‐biased bureaucrats. Thus, any bureaucrat would welcome the intervention of a politician who favored a qualified type, and resist the intervention of a supporter of a marginal type.            "
"61","Comment 4 confirms these effects of cp on the principal's utility. I note without proof that a similar result would hold for α.               "
"62","Comment 4. ([Politicization of Testing Technology])At an interior solution:                     "
"63","The preceding analysis produced a stark outcome in situations where the bureaucrat is rejection biased. Incentive compatibility forces all types to be tested at the same level, and thereby places the bureaucrat at a tremendous disadvantage when she cares greatly about rejecting marginal types. In such settings, the bureaucrat has an obvious incentive to find ways to reallocate testing resources toward the most important types. How can she better discriminate across types, and how do the constraints of feasible mechanisms affect program performance?"
"64","To improve testing flexibility, I introduce a simple form of red tape, defined as costs imposed on potential program recipients that are incidental to their performance on the means test. Substantively, these costs might represent additional paperwork or procedures that are directed toward certain types. As noted in the introduction, several models of bureaucratic allocation have used red tape as a means of differentiating among types, and this extension uses it in a similar spirit. In particular, red tape exploits differences across types in marginal disutilities from testing. Among marginal types, one that gains greatly from reduced testing will be willing to suffer some red tape, whereas one with less to gain will prefer a higher testing level with no red tape. The bureaucrat then benefits from red tape if a type she wishes to test more extensively prefers high testing without red tape to low testing with red tape."
"65","To keep the analysis simple, the extension imposes some additional structure on the basic model. Let θ1 be the type that is least likely to pass the test for any given testing level (i.e.,  for all ). Suppose additionally that  for all , so that type θ1 is the worst of the low types from the bureaucrat's perspective. Recall that type θ1 has the lowest valuation for the good:  for all .19 The bureaucrat can impose a single level of red tape costing  on some set of announced types.20 Finally, red tape imposes a cost  on the bureaucrat, where . This cost does not come out of the testing budget supplied by the politician, and therefore it does not affect the aggregate level of testing.            "
"66","I derive perhaps the simplest mechanism that allows the bureaucrat to redirect testing resources toward θ1 from other marginal types. Specifically, the bureaucrat tests type θ1 and all qualified types at a uniform level . All other types incur red tape and are tested at level , with . As in the basic model, individual rationality is guaranteed by the fact that an option with no red tape exists for all types. Similarly, incentive compatibility for qualified types is straightforward, as they clearly benefit from higher testing. For the marginal types, incentive compatibility requires that r deters only type θ1 from choosing . Marginal types will choose  if red tape is sufficiently low:               "
"67","In choosing testing levels, the bureaucrat faces a trade‐off similar to that of the basic model. The budget constraint allows her to increase  for type θ1 and types in  only by decreasing  for all other types. The following comment shows that even under this constraint, it is possible to target type θ1 with higher testing.               "
"68","Comment 5. ([Rejection Bias and Red Tape])For  sufficiently high, there exists a mechanism with red tape that tests θ1 at a higher level than other types in .                  "
"69","The simple result is that if the bureaucrat cares enough about preventing acceptances of type θ1, then red tape allows her to “pull” its testing level up to that of the qualified types. The bureaucrat will often prefer this scheme to one without red tape, but its benefits are offset by two kinds of costs. The first is the direct cost of red tape. The second is that the increased testing of type θ1 reduces testing of other marginal types, compared to when no red tape is used. The extension more generally shows how nontesting costs like red tape facilitate the screening of marginal types. Analogously, red tape would also be necessary to deter qualified types from choosing higher testing levels, perhaps in an effort to conserve testing resources.            "
"70","The addition of red tape does not affect equilibrium outcomes when the politician favors a marginal type, as he continues to starve the bureaucrat of resources. Thus, red tape can make a difference only when the politician favors a qualified type. In a more general model, the bureaucrat can potentially implement as many testing levels as there are types. This may induce a more favorable distribution of Type I and Type II errors, but it cannot generally implement the first best for any profile of client type valuations."
"71","I next consider the model's robustness to an alternative principal objective. Suppose that instead of caring about the welfare of a group, the principal cared about a weighted sum of Type I and Type II error avoidance. This captures the idea that politicians may sometimes need to balance the relative costs of different types of error, just as bureaucrats must.21 The extension therefore gives the principal a policy utility function that is identical in form to the bureaucrat's.            "
"72","Let  denote the politician's weighting on error avoidance for each type . This objective introduces two basic changes in his incentives. First, he now always benefits from rejecting marginal types, as he avoids a Type I error with probability . By contrast, for qualified types,  plays a similar role to the type valuation  used in the basic model. Conveniently, this results in an objective function that is concave in testing levels for every type. Second, the principal is now also affected by the population of  clients who are unreached by the policy. By not receiving the good, marginal clients in this pool avoid Type I error with certainty, but qualified clients suffer Type II errors with certainty.            "
"73","The bureaucrat's problem is unchanged, and her policy choice is characterized by Proposition 1. Thus, any effect on the equilibrium operates through the principal's choice of b and s. The principal's revised objective can be written as               "
"74","The politician's weighting of errors across types produces a result analogous to Propositions 3 and 4, which follows.22                              "
"75","Proposition 5. ([Error Minimization])An interior solution must satisfy                     "
"76","Many features of the equilibrium strategies are similar to those of the basic model, but two comparisons stand out. First, because the politician benefits directly from testing all types for which  is strictly positive, interior testing levels are more common and the outcome of minimal testing seen in Proposition 2 becomes difficult to achieve. Second, the desire to avoid Type II errors (i.e., higher values of  for qualified types) creates an incentive to expand a program's budget and size. By contrast, a preference for avoiding Type I errors unambiguously shrinks both budget and population size, while increasing average testing levels. It therefore plays a role similar to that of removing bureaucratic acceptance bias.            "
"77","Dating back at least to Niskanen (1971), observers have posited budget maximization as a basic bureaucratic objective. Budget maximization captures the notion of bureaucratic agency heads as “empire builders” who accumulate power and resources at the expense of social welfare.23"
"78","With a simple modification, the model can incorporate this objective. Suppose that the bureaucracy consists of two actors. One acts as the bureaucrat in the preceding analysis, and the other begins the game by choosing the bureaucrat's payoff weight () parameters with the objective of maximizing . This second player might be considered an agency head or appointing official. Let  be the set of feasible values of  for all types.            "
"79","A first observation is that if the principal favors a marginal type, then by Proposition 2 the budget is independent of the bureaucracy's preferences and the weights of the subordinate bureaucrat do not matter. Focusing on the case where the principal favors a qualified type, it is easy to see from Propositions 3 and 4 that the equilibrium budget  is decreasing in  and is higher when the bureaucrat is acceptance biased. The following result characterizes the agency head's optimal configuration of weights.               "
"80","Comment 6. ([Budget Maximization])For  sufficiently low, a budget‐maximizing agency head chooses  for , and  for "
"81","From a budget maximizer's perspective, the optimal bureaucrat is one who is maximally biased toward approvals. The subordinate bureaucrat in this agency aggressively investigates declared qualified types and is lax toward marginal types."
"82","The result follows from the fact that a strong approval bias maximizes the bureaucrat's discrimination between the two type classes. This encourages a politician who cares about a qualified type to spend more, as no resources are wasted investigating marginal types. Thus, a budget‐maximizing agency will generate high allocations of the good even when the good itself is not costly."
"83","Suppose that, in addition to b and s, the bureaucrat was bound by a minimum or maximum testing level for all clients. In some educational settings, legislatures impose testing requirements that bureaucrats use for advancing students. In law enforcement settings, courts impose “due process” requirements on bureaucrats. One obvious trade‐off is that a principal could conceivably improve the payoff of a favored group through higher mandated testing levels, but at the cost of higher testing expenditures.            "
"84","Formally, suppose that testing levels for all types are constrained to satisfy , rather than allowing any . When the constraint is binding, its effect is easily calculated in the cases in which the bureaucrat does not discriminate across types. In these cases, it is clear that the bureaucrat will choose a uniform testing level , and any testing standard can only constrain the principal. For example, if the principal's favored type is marginal and , then by the same argument as in the basic model, he simply minimizes testing and chooses a budget to match: , , and .            "
"85","More generally, the following comment shows that the principal cannot benefit from a testing restriction. Such restrictions are too crude of a means of inducing higher testing for a favored client type. Because of the bureaucrat's budget constraint, for any given budget, ceilings and floors can only prevent the principal from enhancing the acceptance probability of a favored group.               "
"86","Comment 7. ([Testing Restrictions])The principal cannot benefit from a testing standard."
"87","What might explain the presence of testing standards? One possibility is that they are useful when the principal is unable to specify other parameters of the bureaucrat's behavior. For example, if the principal cannot feasibly designate s, then a mandated maximum testing level could establish a floor on the client population. A second possibility is that testing standards can be imposed by other principals. A second principal who cared about not approving too many marginal types could use a minimum testing standard to force more scrutiny upon types that the first principal and bureaucrat would otherwise neglect. This situation might be expected in programs with an exogenous (e.g., constitutional) requirement of broad participation, which may drive down per capita testing. The additional principal might be a court, a different level of government in a federal system, or another legislator whose support is necessary for enacting the program in question.            "
"88","Theories of political control of the bureaucracy have made considerable progress in recent decades, focusing in particular on informational problems between political principals and bureaucratic agents. Perhaps the canonical question in this area is the extent to which principals should delegate authority to more knowledgeable bureaucrats. A central rationale for this article is that bureaucrats face their own informational problems and design mechanisms to cope with them. In this setting, principals have great control over broad policy parameters but less control over the ways in which bureaucrats interact with potential program beneficiaries. Because the bureaucrat's mechanism is a conduit for group‐specific benefits, the politician will use crude policy tools like the budget to influence the distribution of goods. Thus, the model developed here bridges the classic divide between “policy” and “administration” by tying political control of the bureaucracy to the concrete problems of public administration. It also identifies a central role for the bureaucracy in distributive politics (e.g., Arnold 1979).         "
"89","The model begins with a foundation of incomplete information, bureaucratic expertise, resource constraints, and political control. There is a natural technological trade‐off between client populations and aggregate per capita spending (or equivalently, testing), but the model provides more specific guidance as to how other distributive issues are resolved. In particular, the politician's distributive concerns and the bureaucrat's testing preferences both generate stark predictions about implementation flexibility, budget size, errors, and whether policy implementation tends toward breadth or depth. These results will help to guide empirical inquiry by linking political variables with both granular administrative data and recently emergent data on the quality of governance."
"90","Three styles of programs emerge from the analysis. The largest and most error‐prone programs result when the politician cares about a marginal group and the bureaucrat uses an inaccurate testing technology. In this environment, the bureaucrat has minimal resources per client, and her preferences are irrelevant to the outcome. Perversely, the principal also has an incentive to weaken the bureaucrat's testing technology. By contrast, a principal who cares about a qualified group induces higher per capita spending and lower error rates. Here, the bureaucrat's preferences matter: Depending on her testing inclinations (i.e., acceptance and rejection bias), programs are either smaller and inflexible or larger and flexible, which correspond roughly to neutrally competent and responsively competent administration, respectively. Some nonobvious implications of this environment are that budgets are positively correlated with client populations and negatively correlated with per capita spending, and benefits can be targeted only with an acceptance‐biased bureaucrat."
"91","While the model addresses a broad set of bureaucratic outputs, it omits some important technological and institutional features. Perhaps most significantly, the purely distributive setting with costless goods has nontrivial implications. In policy areas such as regulation, allocation choices can generate externalities across clients, and other environments feature natural limits on the quantity of the good. Additionally, the model considers only a minimal set of player strategies. In reality, politicians may be able to provide performance incentives to bureaucrats, or they may impose procedural constraints such as burden of proof requirements. They would also be constrained by the bureaucrat's labor market alternatives and possible collusion with clients. Finally, the roles of other principals such as voters, courts, different levels of government, and legislative overseers deserve fuller consideration."
