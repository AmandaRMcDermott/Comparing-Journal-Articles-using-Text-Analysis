"1","Do large policymaking panels generate more accurate collective decisions? Proponents of larger panels presume that improving the quality of average or median decisions by increasing group size can be achieved by adding members of equal or greater competence, ceteris paribus (Gabel and Shipan 2004). Yet, this presumption omits a key aspect of organizational decision making—that collective judgments rely on a social process whereby the interdependence of persons in the organization with a common goal of accurate estimation of an unknown quantity has influence on the collective decision (Sniezek and Henry 1990, 66). That is, individual members’ competence does not fully determine the quality of a group's collective decision (Hong and Page 2001; Page 2007; Surowiecki 2005). This insight is empirically supported by monetary‐policy‐committee laboratory experiments showing that subjects primarily learn by direct observation of fellow members and not through deliberation or explicit communication (Lombardelli, Proudman, and Talbot 2005).         "
"2","Yet, are larger panels always better than smaller panels for enhancing the collective accuracy of policy decisions? Smaller panels contain critical advantages for making collective decisions since “social loafing” increases with panel size by leading individual members to engage in less effort by reducing their investment in information acquisition (Holmstrom 1982; Li and Suen 2009, 370–72). Recent experimental evidence from monetary policy committees proposes creating smaller decision‐making bodies as a solution for mitigating such moral hazard problems (Blinder and Morgan 2005, 2008; Sibert 2006). Coordination losses result from the inefficient pooling of expertise (information) among group members, according to both organizational economists (Holmstrom 1982; Li, Rosen, and Suen 2001; Li and Suen 2009) and social psychologists (Henningsen, Cruz, and Miller 2000, 168; Kerr and Tindale 2004, 632–40). This coordination dilemma arises since it is easier to ignore some perspectives when information is shared within groups as they become larger in size (e.g., Diehl and Strobe 1987).2"
"3","Panel diversity, defined in terms of heterogeneous expertise (i.e., knowledge and skills), also improves the accuracy of collective decisions. Heterogeneous groups are less likely to have individual members restrict useful information from both deliberation and decision‐ making processes within groups (Janis 1972). Diverse groups allow for greater weighting of superior individual judgments in relation to inferior individual judgments (Sniezek and Henry 1990). Group decisions benefit from cognitive diversity and varying decision heuristics among individual members possessing different skills and perspectives (Hong and Page 2001; March 1991; Page 2007).3 Group diversity thus entails a broader set of skills in tackling problems requiring collective judgments. Increasing panel heterogeneity, for example, can mitigate the adverse consequences arising from group polarization in small policymaking bodies (Sunstein 2000, 108–11). One remedy is to establish ideologically diverse judicial panels or to impose partisan balancing requirements on independent commissions. Such requirements can counter extremist views, allow the vetting of alternative viewpoints, and thus produce more informed collective decisions (Sunstein et al. 2006, chap. 9). Benefits arising from heterogeneous groups are more acutely realized in small‐group decision‐making environments (e.g., policymaking panels) vis‐à‐vis less structured decision‐making settings (e.g., economic markets or electorates) that reflect large numbers of decision makers (Surowiecki 2005, 29).         "
"4","Although the benefits of group diversity are obvious, existing studies fail to duly note the limitations of relying on diverse expertise to arrive at accurate collective decisions. These studies fail to consider the rising coordination costs associated with pooling heterogeneous expertise as panel diversity increases. Although panel diversity yields benefits through the adoption of creative solutions to shared problems when different perspectives are taken into account, it also imposes costs by making collaboration either difficult or ineffective when varying perspectives preclude a shared understanding of common problems (Page 2007, 293–95). Thus, a highly diverse policymaking panel can yield inferior collective policy decisions. This is because information transmission and collective problem solving become less efficient in the presence of greater differences between panel members (Li and Suen 2009, 379–81). This panel‐size diversity trade‐off logic is more fully developed in the next section.         "
"5","Different members possess different knowledge and skills (i.e., expertise) in attempting to solve a common problem. The presumed advantage of diverse panels in group decision making is attributable to each member contributing unique expertise to the group that enhances collective judgments (Sniezek 1990, 17). Unfortunately, coordinating heterogeneous expertise into accurate collective judgments becomes more difficult as panel size increases. Members must effectively collaborate to mesh their individual expertise together in a manner that produces an accurate collective decision. This process of pooling expertise, however, is made increasingly difficult as panel size increases because each additional member raises the cost of meshing heterogeneous knowledge and skills across panel members, as well as translating it into a coherent collective decision. Put another way, large heterogeneous panels comprise members who speak many “different languages” that make it more difficult to achieve a common goal compared to when only a handful of different languages exist (less diversity) on large panels.4 Therefore, panel members have an incentive to engage in less costly effort by relying on the expertise of others in large diverse panels so as to reduce the cacophony of heterogeneous knowledge and skills contained within the group. Conversely, the costs of pooling expertise into a collective decision are comparatively low in small panels. Moreover, the benefits associated with greater diversity in small panels yield greater marginal improvements in the quality of collective judgments. Large panels should thus limit the different types of expertise on the panel to mitigate the coordination problem, while small panels should exploit heterogeneous expertise as a means of avoiding a scarcity of knowledge and skills relevant for problem solving.         "
"6","The panel‐size diversity trade‐off is formalized for purposes of generating empirically testable implications that can be subject to statistical analysis using data. The theoretical discussion below is intended to formalize the parameters involving panel size and diversity for purposes of generating testable hypotheses consistent with this trade‐off that can be subject to falsification with empirical data. Let us assume that collective accuracy (π) is an additive function of panel size (n) and panel diversity (D), whereby larger groups and more diverse groups, in isolation, are commonly thought of as being desirable characteristics for small‐group decision making. Put another way, the quality of collective judgments is assumed to be increasing in panel size [panel diversity], independent of panel diversity [panel size]. This view is widely shared in the small‐group decision‐making literature. Yet, the panel‐size diversity trade‐off dilemma arises for the simple reason that panel size and diversity are inextricably linked to one another. Although a panel's collective accuracy is a positive function of the expertise benefits derived independently from increasing panel size and diversity that reflect a greater abundance of higher‐quality knowledge and skills, it is also inversely related to the coordination losses resulting from the pooling of expertise that is increasing in panel size and diversity.         "
"7","Given these assumptions, suppose a social planner treats a panel as an organizational design problem that requires her to select the optimal panel size (n) for a given level of panel diversity (D) to maximize collective accuracy (π) for a policymaking panel—i.e., [n*(D)]. By definition, maximizing collective accuracy for a specified level of panel diversity requires that marginal changes in panel size can neither improve nor worsen collective accuracy. Under this particular condition, the marginal expertise benefits and marginal coordination loss relating to a given panel size and corresponding level of panel diversity must be equal to one another. That is,  for  and thus it follows that:            "
"8","Implicitly differentiating (1) with respect to n, plus setting each additive component equal to one another and canceling out like terms, yields the following expression:            "
"9","The expression given by (2) constitutes the marginal rate of substitution between declining collective accuracy resulting from increasing panel size as panel diversity rises (numerator) in relation to the diminishing marginal net benefits of increasing panel size on collective accuracy (denominator). Because  and  it is necessarily true that the optimal panel size is decreasing in panel diversity—i.e., .6 That is, the first sufficiency condition states that increases in panel size result in reducing a panel's collective accuracy as its organizational diversity increases—i.e.,  must be decreasing in D (i.e., ). The second sufficiency condition indicates that increasing the number of panel members will yield diminishing marginal improvements in the accuracy of a panel's collective decisions (i.e., ). This result yields the following theoretical proposition.         "
"10","Panel‐Size Diversity Trade‐Off Proposition: The optimal panel size for any given level of panel diversity [n*(D)] is decreasing in the level of panel diversity (D)."
"11","The empirical implication derived from the above proposition is straightforward. Panel size and panel diversity will serve as organizational substitutes when these sufficiency conditions are valid. Small heterogeneous panels will produce more accurate collective policy decisions than large heterogeneous panels, while large homogeneous panels will generate more accurate collective policy decisions than small homogeneous panels. Optimal medium‐sized panels should thus exhibit moderate levels of panel diversity. Next, this proposition is tested with observational data analyzing forecast accuracy of general‐fund revenues conducted by consensus group independent policymaking commissions in the American states."
"12","The panel‐size diversity trade‐off proposition is empirically tested through a comparative analysis of general‐fund revenue‐forecast accuracy made by consensus group (CG) commissions in the American states. CG commissions are independent commissions in 26 American states that possess formal responsibility for producing official general‐fund revenue forecasts. CG commissions offer both a salient and representative empirical setting for testing the substitution effect between panel size and panel diversity for three main reasons. First, although politicians can influence CG commissions through statutory design and informal mechanisms, these independent policymaking panels operate independently from both the governor and legislature. CG commissions are quite similar to many other types of independent policymaking commissions insofar as they do not come under the direct institutional aegis of either the executive or legislative branch (Lewis 2003). Second, similar to most other independent policymaking commissions, CG commissions diffuse policymaking authority across several competing interests that constrain the types of individuals who can be appointed to these positions by elected officials (Lewis 2003). Nomination restrictions include factors such as experience, partisanship, and institutional affiliation in a way that further insulates commission members from political influence. CG commissions are thus preferable to political institutions, in part, because they represent a broader array of policymaking interests that are insulated from direct electoral pressures (Smith 2007, 478; Voorhees 2004, 652).         "
"13","Finally, analyzing CG commissions’ accuracy in predicting general‐fund revenues also offers a rich set of observational data to understand how organizational structure affects the quality of collective decisions. Although experimental data have unique advantages over observational data, existing studies of monetary‐policy‐committee experiments are limited by assuming perfect homogeneity across panel members reflected by identical loss functions and preferences over outcomes (Blinder and Morgan 2005, 2008, 143–44; Lombardelli, Proudman, and Talbot 2005, 201; Sibert 2006). The CG commission data thus naturally allow for organizational diversity among panel members that reflects both differential knowledge and skills resulting from varying appointment mechanisms, partisan orientations, and institutional representation. Accounting for various types of expertise exhibited on a policymaking panel is crucial since organizational diversity is often “hardwired” into these institutions via requirements related to partisan balancing, diffusing representation through institutional, geographic, gender, or ethnicity characteristics, staggered terms of appointment, and occupational background.         "
"14","Table 1 reveals that CG commissions exhibit considerable variation in organizational structure across 26 states during the 1987–2008 sample period. These policymaking panels effectively vary in size between three and nine members7 (excluding Delaware, which has 30 members),8 plus they vary in the extent to which they reflect appointee diversity, partisan diversity, and institutional diversity. All states, save Delaware, have CG commissions that are composed of at least two partisan‐appointed members. The range of institutional interests represented on these CG commissions lies between two to six distinct democratic institutions. Sixteen states possess a CG commission that is governed by a formal unanimity voting‐rule requirement, whereas 10 states possess a formal nonunanimity voting rule that relies on some variant of majority rule.9 Finally, individual members of the CG commissions in seven of the states possess their own independent staffs, as opposed to the remaining 19 states whose CG commissions rely on external staff resources (e.g., legislative or executive branch agency). The testable implication of the panel‐size diversity trade‐off proposition is noted below:         "
"15","Panel‐Size Diversity Trade‐Off Hypothesis: Increases (Decreases) in CG commission diversity will improve revenue‐forecast accuracy when CG commission size is decreasing (increasing).         "
"16","Panel size refers to the number of seats on each CG commission. Panel heterogeneity is operationally defined as the degree of organizational diversity exhibited by CG commissions that accounts for appointee type (partisan, nonpartisan), institutional type (legislature, governor, independent elected agency heads), and partisan type (Democrat, Republican, third party). The first component accounts for the extent to which professional norms differ on a CG commission between politicized (partisan) and independent (nonpartisan) forms of policy expertise. The second component captures the variety of expertise displayed on a CG commission in the form of varying institutional interests. Finally, panel diversity also reflects the extent to which the partisan composition of CG commissions is diffuse. Taken together, these three components of organizational diversity measure the level of heterogeneous expertise on a CG commission that is attributable to members’ varying knowledge and skills based on various formal membership‐selection requirements."
"17","Statistical testing of the panel size‐diversity‐substitution hypothesis must not only allow for the posited trade‐off between CG size and CG diversity in terms of accurate collective policy decisions (i.e., ), yet it must also account for the nonlinear diminishing marginal impact of panel size on panel accuracy noted earlier—(i.e., ). The general form of the statistical model specification is given by:            "
"18","Several covariates (denoted by δk coefficients in equation [3]) also appear in these statistical model specifications to account for factors other than organizational structure that may affect collective revenue‐forecast accuracy.13 Different formal voting rules can impact the collective accuracy of panels' revenue forecasts. The impact of unanimity formal voting rules on collective revenue‐forecast accuracy is specified in the statistical models since nonunanimity voting rules (e.g., simple majority, supermajority) produce similar outcomes under general conditions for small‐group decision‐making bodies (Gerardi and Yariv 2007). Although revenue forecasts requiring unanimity should benefit from fully incorporating all commission members' policy judgments (δ1 < 0), coordination costs attributable to absolute consensus may outweigh any information benefits by producing less accurate collective revenue forecasts (δ1 > 0). Also, CG commissions’ collective capacity to arrive at more accurate general‐fund revenue forecasts should rise (δ2 < 0) when these bodies possess their own independent staff, as opposed to relying on external staff drawn from either a legislative or executive branch agency.         "
"19","The relative level of fiscal slack, defined as the sum of a state's rainy day and surplus general funds as a percentage of actual general‐fund revenues (Douglas and Gaddie 2002), should yield less accurate revenue estimates since the costs associated with overprediction are mitigated (δ3 > 0).14 A binary indicator that equals 1 if the two branches of government share the same party and 0 otherwise accounts for the effect of joint executive‐legislative political pressure and should adversely impact revenue‐forecast accuracy (δ4 > 0; Bretschneider and Gorr 1992).15 Because incumbent governments are concerned with electoral sanctions associated with fiscal irresponsibility (Lowry, Alt, and Ferree 1998; Niemi, Stanley, and Vogel 1995), revenue forecasts should be more accurate in gubernatorial election years (δ5 < 0).16"
"20","The effects of changing state‐level economic conditions on revenue‐forecast accuracy are controlled for by including variables that represent lagged personal income growth (i.e., the percentage change in the state's real per capita income at year t–1) and economic growth volatility (measured as the three‐year lagged moving standard deviation in real gross state product growth).17 Higher levels of personal income growth should reduce the importance of arriving at accurate revenue forecasts that can be used to efficiently cut taxes or increase spending (δ6 > 0). Volatile state economies should similarly reduce revenue‐forecast accuracy since this task will become more difficult under adverse conditions (δ7 > 0). Forecasting slack, which requires that states appropriate less than 100% of expected revenues, should also reduce the incentives for generating accurate revenue estimates (δ8 > 0). This appropriation limit variable is coded as 1 when the legislature must appropriate less than 100% of expected revenues, 0 otherwise.18"
"21","States with legally binding revenue forecasts that set spending limits should produce more accurate revenue forecasts since the costs of forecast errors have larger fiscal policy costs compared to states that do not have such stringent fiscal rules (δ9 < 0).19 Also, the extent to which states possess balanced‐budget restrictions is controlled for in the model specifications, where stringent restrictions composed of both a zero deficit carryover restriction and either a constitutional or statutory provision for a balanced budget are coded as 1, and 0 otherwise.20 Greater balanced‐budget restrictions can force states to make arbitrary or politically costly fiscal decisions (e.g., across‐the‐board cuts) when budgets are shown to be out of balance (Cassidy, Kamlet, and Nagin 1989). To minimize these ex post fiscal costs, states possessing tighter budgetary restrictions should produce more accurate revenue forecasts so that the costs of fiscal adjustment are lower (δ10 < 0). States operating under a biennial budgeting cycle should have less accurate forecasts since they confront more uncertainty than under an annual budget cycle scenario (δ11 > 0).21 A state's revenue stream volatility is accounted for by incorporating a measure of relative reliance on sales‐tax revenue that is simply defined as the proportion of general‐fund revenues that come from the sales tax for each state in a given year.22 States with a greater dependence upon the sales tax should generate more accurate revenue estimates since this tax offers a stable revenue source that has little temporal variation (δ12 < 0).23 Because tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) effectively place a cap on increases in government revenue or spending to a fixed numerical target (Skidmore 1999), a binary indicator captures the presence of this fiscal rule in these models.24 TELs should yield more accurate revenue forecasts since they limit the discretion of elected officials concerning tax and spending issues (δ13< 0).         "
"22","Because the organizational structure covariates of central interest (Size, Size2, and Size × Diversity) change little through time, use of standard cross‐sectional fixed‐effects models is highly problematic (Hsiao 2003, 35; Wooldridge 2003, 269). That is, accounting for cross‐ sectional unit (fixed) effects will be highly collinear with a slow, temporally moving covariate, and thus will exhibit both inefficiency and unreliability (Pluemper and Troeger 2011). To address this dilemma, both temporal and spatial dynamics are modeled in equation (3) using a Hausman‐Taylor (1981) regression estimator that is equivalent to the FEVD estimator proposed by Pluemper and Troeger (2011), which incorporates a Prais‐Winsten AR(1) residual correction.25 This estimation approach treats time‐invariant covariates as being exogenous to the unit‐specific intercepts, whereas the time‐varying covariates are assumed to be endogenous to such unobserved heterogeneity (Breusch et al. 2011, 166).26 This particular identification assumption is valid in empirical settings with aggregated panels (e.g., nations, states) since time‐invariant covariates in aggregated panels are most apt to explain why states may systematically differ from one another with respect to revenue‐forecasting performance (e.g., see Beck 2011, 121–22).         "
"23","The panel regression results predicting revenue‐forecast accuracy by 25 CG commissions from FY 1987–FY 2008 appear in Table 2.27 Statistical models are estimated using both the untransformed APRFE dependent variable and one that decomposes organizational diversity into its constitutive components.28 Presence of a gubernatorial election year and a strong reliance on stable sales‐tax revenue sources each enhance collective revenue‐forecast accuracy by an average of about 1.05% and 7.98% ( =–31 × 0.2574), respectively. This former finding suggests that greater electoral pressure exists for not reducing revenue‐forecast conservatism in gubernatorial election years. Greater reliance on sales‐tax revenue results in reducing the volatility of the revenue stream and, hence, improves collective revenue‐forecast accuracy. States whose collective revenue forecasts are legally binding produce general‐fund revenue forecasts that are over 3% more accurate than those CG commissions whose forecasts are not legally binding. Neither differences in CG commissions' formal voting rule nor the presence of independent staff expertise notably impact the collective accuracy of these forecasts.         "
"24","The statistical evidence in the Aggregate Diversity model shows that larger CG commissions produce more accurate revenue forecasts when organizational diversity is at its lowest point (β1 < 0), but this improvement generally declines as CG commissions grow in size (β2 > 0). Yet, as organizational diversity rises, revenue forecasts become less accurate as CG size increases (β4 > 0). This particular result provides direct evidence supporting the panel size‐diversity‐substitution hypothesis. The Disaggregate Diversity model analyzing the individual components of organizational diversity is suggestive of institutional diversity (β8 > 0) as serving as the critical source of the panel‐size diversity trade‐off. Yet, this particular inference should be interpreted with considerable caution since it is largely driven by Wyoming, which has six different institutional interests represented on its nine‐member CG commission.29 Size × Partisan Diversity also possesses the correct sign (β10 > 0) yet fails to obtain significance at conventional levels. Taken in tandem, these results indicate that the amalgam of these individual sources of expertise reflected in the organizational‐diversity measure yields much more precise estimates of this trade‐off than any single component. Thus, capturing the full domain of organizational diversity will provide both a more accurate and precise portrait of the full breadth of opportunities and challenges that emanate from varying types of knowledge and skills being represented on these policymaking panels.30"
"25","The marginal conditional effect of CG diversity on collective revenue‐forecast accuracy, conditional on CG size in the Aggregate Diversity model, is portrayed in Figure 1A. Because absolute percentage revenue‐forecast error (APRFE) measures forecast inaccuracy, negative (positive) values on the vertical axis translate into improving (declining) revenue‐forecast accuracy. Positive increases in CG commission size result in organizational diversity having a less beneficial impact on revenue‐forecast accuracy. When CGs are small (N = 3, 4), organizational diversity yields at best a marginal improvement in revenue‐forecast accuracy (denoted by negative marginal changes in APRFE). As panel size becomes larger (N = 6, 7, 8, 9), organizational diversity exerts an increasingly adverse marginal impact on collective revenue‐forecast accuracy (denoted by positive marginal changes in APRFE).31"

"27","Note: In Figure 1A, the conditional marginal impact is computed as . In Figure 1B, all control variables are held fixed at their mean values.                     "
"28","Figure 1B displays the simulated impact of CG size and organizational diversity at each CG commission size observed in our sample and also the minimum, median, and maximum observed values of the organizational diversity variable on the predicted APRFE.32 This figure reveals the empirical nature of the panel‐size diversity trade‐off by allowing one to determine the extent to which observed panel size (n) deviates from its optimal panel size for a given level of panel diversity [n*(D)]. Panels exhibiting moderate levels of organizational diversity (Organizational Diversity= 29.11), for instance, are best served by having a moderate number of panel members (Size= 6)‐APRFE = 4.85%. A small heterogeneous panel (Size= 3, Organizational Diversity= 45.78) has a predicted APRFE = 5.60%, whereas a large heterogeneous CG (Size= 9, Organizational Diversity= 45.78) has a predicted APRFE = 12.22%. Conversely, large homogeneous panels (Size= 9, Organizational Diversity= 0) of typical collective revenue‐forecast accuracy is 8.95% superior than it is for a small homogenous group (Size= 3, Organizational Diversity= 0), i.e., 0.50% versus 9.45% per annum. The accuracy gap between small (Size= 3) homogeneous panels and small heterogeneous panels is 3.85% per annum, i.e., 9.45% versus 5.60% per annum. Inspection of large panels (N = 9) also reveals that homogeneous panels outperform heterogeneous panels by 11.72% per annum, i.e., 0.50% versus 12.22%. That is, increasing organizational diversity in large panels has slightly more than three times the detrimental impact on collective revenue‐forecast accuracy compared to decreasing diversity in small panels. This asymmetric substitution effect suggests that the meager expertise benefits associated with small homogeneous groups are preferable to the high coordination costs incurred by large heterogeneous groups for collective decision making.         "
"29","Finally, a performance comparison is undertaken to better understand the practical organizational design implications of this panel‐size diversity trade‐off. This comparison assesses the actual organizational structure of individual CG commissions in relation to the optimal structure that minimizes collective revenue‐forecast errors at various combinations of panel size and organizational diversity based upon the regression estimates obtained from the Aggregate Diversity model. The straight downward sloping line in Figure 2 reveals the optimal panel‐size diversity trade‐off path that maximizes revenue‐forecast accuracy (i.e., minimizes the absolute percentage of revenue‐forecast errors), while the circle dots represent the combination of modal/median CG commission size and organizational diversity for each state. States falling below (to the left of) the optimal trade‐off path can benefit from greater diversity and/or increasing panel size. The states farthest from this optimal path that are too small and homogeneous include Massachussetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Florida, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Vermont. States appearing above (to the right of) the optimal trade‐off path can benefit from less diversity and/or reductions in panel size. States exhibiting the most suboptimal organizational structures in terms of being too large and heterogeneous include Wyoming, Nebraska, Washington, Kansas, and New York. CG commissions that possess the best organizational structure are those closest to this optimal trade‐off path (Indiana, Maine, Alaska, Nevada, Kentucky, and Hawaii). This evidence underscores the fact that maximizing the collective accuracy of panel decisions requires treating panel size and panel diversity as organizational substitutes, and not organizational complements as posited by proponents advocating the salutary benefits associated with large heterogeneous policymaking panels.

"32","Collective decisions routinely afford additional and diverse voices to the policy process that bring different information and skills to bear in solving public problems. Policymaking by small groups, such as presidential commissions, judicial panels, independent commissions, and boards, constitutes a vital mechanism for collective decision making in democratic systems. These institutions serve to broaden the representation of policy interests when sufficient checks and balances are imposed by increasing the size and heterogeneity of policymaking panels composed of members with varying backgrounds and interests. While organizational diversity has salutary benefits for collective decision making, it can reduce the accuracy of collective decisions in larger panels since coordination of heterogeneous expertise becomes problematic. This is because the marginal coordination losses from inefficient pooling of expertise within the group will exceed its marginal information gains regarding accurate collective decisions."
"33","This study advances analytical conditions in which panel size and panel diversity represent substitutes and obtains empirical support for this trade‐off by showing that large homogeneous and small heterogeneous CG panels yield the most accurate official general‐revenue fund forecasts in the American states. This panel‐size diversity trade‐off stands in stark contrast to existing research that emphasizes the virtue of large diverse panels as providing ample synergistic opportunities for information and expertise sharing, while being insulated from being captured by any single faction (e.g., Hong and Page 2001; Lombardelli, Proudman, and Talbot 2005; Surowiecki 2005; Sunstein 2000; Sunstein et al. 2006; cf. Page 2007).         "
"34","Policymakers’ biases result from their information sources (Meltsner 1976), as well as of their own accord (Patty 2009). Therefore, expertise culled from diverse information sources that reflect heterogeneous knowledge and skills is reflected by membership criteria used to select panel members. Balancing varying types of expertise is an effective strategy for exploiting policymaker biases in hierarchical structures to enhance collective decision making (Hammond and Thomas 1989). Yet, such diversity can potentially yield adverse effects in flat structures, such as policymaking panels, if they consist of too many members. Perhaps this difference between vertical and horizontal structures can be attributed to the lack of a supervisor possessing formal mechanisms to reign in the adverse effects from too much organizational diversity in the latter type of structure.         "
"35","In closing, this study claims that the desirability of rich information content on policymaking panels must be balanced against the capacity to pool members’ varying types of expertise in an effective manner. This means that larger panels must offset coordination problems that they experience by limiting diversity, while smaller panels need to ameliorate the lack of rich information content by exploiting diverse sources of information and skill sets among panel members. Therefore, establishment of heterogeneous panels through various representational requirements can only be effective for collective decision making if panel size is kept small. Perhaps through a combination of incentives and rules, large diverse policymaking panels may be capable of performing effectively when making collective judgments under certain conditions. For example, incentives designed to both augment and exploit common expertise may prove more beneficial for collective decision making than emphasizing unique expertise because common information is more easily coordinated within the group than private information since members engage in “egocentric discounting” (Chernyshenko et al. 2003; Yaniv and Kleinberger 2000). Because this unique expertise problem pertains to a lack of trust regarding the intentions or abilities of fellow panelists (Schrah, Dalal, and Sniezek 2006, 58), one potential remedy to reducing this form of social uncertainty in large diverse panels is to ensure lengthier member terms so that mutual trust among panelists can be forged through repeated interactions (Axelrod 1984). Alternatively, a strict rule that permits only usage of common information culled from a commission's independent staff, for purposes of formulating policy positions, would be beneficial in large, diverse policymaking panels to cut down the severity of coordination problems. In policymaking panels that are suboptimally small and/or homogeneous, a less restrictive rule that allows for the use of both internal and external information sources may prove to be beneficial. Future research on this topic should seek to provide a better sense regarding how incentives and rules can be employed to enhance the quality of collective decisions made by policymaking panels that exhibit suboptimal organizational structures.
