"1","The analytical concept of rivalry has proven to be a powerful frame in which to analyze conflict. Goertz and Diehl (1993, 1995), among others, have shown that a small number of states fight more often than one would expect given a random distribution of conflict dyadically. Thompson (2001), Rasler and Thompson (2000), and Colaresi and Thompson (2002a) define rivalry as two states that single each other out as competitors and enemies and have illustrated that rival states are different on many dimensions when compared to nonrival dyads. For example, rival states not only have higher conflict propensities, but also react differently to exogenous factors such as the capability balance. The guiding principle of the rivalry research program has been that international crises cannot be treated as independent events. In short, history matters, trapping rivals into a cycle of threats if not violence. Seminal studies by Bennett (1996, 1997) and Goertz and Diehl (1995), building on work by Azar, Jureidini, and McLaurin (1978), argued that rivalries were fairly stable phenomena. This did not mean that they existed in perpetuity, but merely that there was some interrelationship between rivalry relations over time.         "
"2","However, the reasons for this stability and hostility over time have not been empirically identified. Goertz and Diehl (1993) implicitly assume that rivalries include a psychological component, whereby past conflict breeds distrust and the locking‐in of enemy images. While never empirically tested in the rivalry context, this psychological baggage explanation has strong roots in the work of May (1973), Lebow (1981), and Leng (2000). Bennett (1996) suggests that rivalries are perpetuated by the inability to solve or compromise on an international issue of interest to the rivals. In his empirical work, Bennett (1996, 1997) finds that rivalries endure longer when the issues are more important, for example when the rivalry stakes revolve around a state's continued existence.         "
"3","Both psychological and issue bargaining mechanisms are likely to play a roll in the perpetuation of rivalry hostilities, but they are unlikely to be the only factors. Little has been written about the domestic political circumstances that translate issues into a foreign policy toward a rival. In sum, a strong case has been made that rival states have higher conflict propensities than other types of states, but the reasons for both the continuation and escalation of rivalries has yet to be fully articulated."
"4","There are two criticisms of this rivalry approach that are relevant to maintenance processes. The first critique, levelled by Gartzke and Simon (1999), states that the links between conflicts have not been definitively identified empirically. From their perspective, if crises are not dependent on their historical context, the concept of rivalry, and rivalry maintenance, loses much of its meaning. Colaresi and Thompson (2002b) answer this critique by showing that past crises made future crises more likely, controlling for a host of other factors, including many possibly unobserved factors that could lead to a “first crisis.” While this justifies focusing on recurrent conflict, it remains to be seen whether there are domestic linkages between international events that can reduce the potential for compromise.         "
"5","A similar appraisal by Lemke and Reed (2001) remains largely unaddressed.1 These authors question the conception of rivalry as a dyadic level variable. The authors state that a “‘dyadic rivalry’ does not act …individual rivals and potential rivals do” (Lemke and Reed 2001, 468). While it is possible to disagree with the assertion that factors should be discounted because they do not “act,”2 it remains true that few studies of rivalry have analyzed the behavior of states individually. The exceptions to this rule include directed dyad research on rivalry by Colaresi (2002), and outside of a rivalry frame by Goldstein and Freeman (1990) and McGinnis and Williams (2002).3 As it relates to the current enterprise, Lemke and Reed (2001) are correct to point out that a maintenance mechanism is missing from previous work on rivalries and that dyadic level tests and theories need to be extended to include state actions. By breaking up rivalry z into the actions of states a and b, we can gain additional insight into the domestic pressures that may drive conflict. It is to domestic actions and reactions that I turn to in the next section.         "
"6","One important branch of scholarship on international conflict suggests that external conflict and threats affect the domestic political alignments within a state. In his step‐to‐war explanation of international conflict, Vasquez notes that, “external interactions produce those domestic consequences which encourage more hostile (and escalatory) steps to be taken within a rivalry and within a crisis” (1993, 198). Hostility from a rival, in the form of verbal threats or military actions, serves to reinforce the position of hawks within the government and helps to “create a constituency for hardliners” (Vasquez 1993, 199).4"
"7","Vasquez's steps‐to‐war theory suggests an explicit link between rivalry contexts and domestic leadership tenure. Rivalry generates some variable level of threat within a populace (Thompson 2000), and these threats in turn simultaneously increase the insecurity of the population and mistrust of the threatening state (see Figure 1). For example, as Washington perceived the Soviet Union as turning from an ally to a threat after World War II, the proportion of Americans trusting the Soviet Union declined from 50% at the Yalta Conference to 18% in December 1948. Likewise, as the Soviet threat seemed to grow more acute with the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, public trust that the Soviets Union would “help keep the peace” declined from 49 to 34% (Holsti 1996, 66–67).         "
"8","                 A Multilevel Model of Rivalry Maintenance and Leadership Tenure                      "
"9","As the public, and potentially elites, becomes more insecure and distrustful of a rival it may be more difficult to mobilize domestic support for cooperation. Any leader that attempts to offer concessions to a rival could be attacked as being weak, or accommodating a dangerous enemy. In the Cold War example, it is much more likely that campaigning for a stronger foreign policy vis‐à‐vis the USSR would be successful after 1948, than before. In the Soviet leadership, Snyder (1989) found that increased conflict from the United States buoyed the position of hardliners, while compromise and cooperation supported the dovish Soviet elites. Political accusations of weakness and even treason are more likely to be effective politically when the public mistrusts that any cooperation will not be taken advantage of by the rival.         "
"10","One of the only ways in which to sell cooperation with a rival would be to show the population some tangible form of reciprocation from the adversary. If this reciprocation was not forthcoming or was incomplete, other elites may negatively publicize these foreign policy shortcomings. Imagine, leader A and leader B are the power‐wielding executives in two rival states. Leader A's continued tenure in office depends on retaining the plurality of support in group S1, and leader B needs the plurality of support from group S2. Let us assume that both groups S1 and S2 have a specific interest in not giving up more than the other in any potential settlement of their international conflict. As an example, Barre in Somalia (leader A) relied on a coalition of clans, the MOD coalition (S1), to remain in power. The MOD clan had specific economic and kinship links to the Ogaden region, which was the central issue in the Somali‐Ethiopian rivalry (see Laitan and Samatar 1987). Leaders A and B then go about negotiating and threatening each other over the stakes at issue.         "
"11","To simplify the interaction process, we can categorize each leader's actions on a unidimensional scale from cooperation to conflict, normalized to some scale for the most and least cooperative actions. For example, an extremely cooperative action would be giving up the issue at stake in the rivalry without qualification, while a competitive event would be initiating a war with the rival state. Dovish strategies will remain very high on this scale, while hawkish strategies such as threats, will score lower.5"
"12","The difference between leader A's actions and leader B's actions on this scale represent the sum of over‐ or undercooperation in the rivalry. If leader A is offering more cooperation than leader B, then A > B, where A represents leader A's actions and B represents leader B's actions. Now, if leader A offers to cooperate with a rival, while leader B attacks instead (A > B), any other potential leader may be able to argue that they could have managed the same outcome or better (being prepared for the attack by B, or possibly deterring the attack) by offering less cooperation. The larger the difference D (A − B = D), the more room there is for any opposition to leader A (B) to persuade S1 (S2) that the current leader is too dovish to compete in the rivalry. Thus, the more overcooperation offered by a leader, the more likely they are to be replaced. This leads to the testable hypothesis that the greater the unreciprocated cooperation offered by a leader to a rival, all else equal, the more likely that leader is to be removed from power. A leader that fails to compete sufficiently in a rivalry is likely to be punished politically for that foreign policy neglect.         "
"13","In many ways, this result is the obverse of diversionary theory. Research by Mueller (1973), Brody and Page (1975), Kernell (1978), and Norpoth (1987), among others, have found evidence that citizens increase their support for a leader during international conflict. The leap in leadership support has been termed a “rally around the flag effect.” Yet, where diversionary theory hypothesizes that leaders will benefit from a rally‐around‐the‐flag effect if they use international force and compete intensely, the theory articulated above suggests that leaders who fail to adequately compete in a rivalry will face a political penalty.         "
"14","Overcooperation by a dove gives the potential rally‐around‐the‐flag effect to the domestic opposition. Where the leadership does not rally or mobilize the population against a rival, another elite may be able to capture the rally effect with more bellicose policies. There are several prototypical examples of this process: Churchill taking over after Chamberlain in Britain, Sharon after Barak in Israel, Igaal being replaced after a coup by Barre in Somalia, and Bethmann‐Hollweg being ousted in Germany after arguing against unrestricted submarine warfare in World War I (Fischer 1967, 288–93; Singer 1970; Vasquez 1993, 214).         "
"15","The same relationship between overcooperation and leadership tenure would not be expected outside of a rivalry context. Figure 2 represents a hypothetical distribution of public and elite support for variable levels of cooperation with a rival and nonrival. In a nonrivalry relationship there is less likely to be the same threat perception and mistrust, both by elites and the public. A U.S. president offering to settle a dispute with Canada, relating to fishing rights, trade, or some other issue, will not face the same intensity of domestic backlash as would be the case if that same offer was made to the USSR during the Cold War. Without the backdrop of mistrust, overcooperation is less likely to be seen as weak leadership or attacked by other elites. Therefore, we would expect that the relationship between overcooperation and leadership tenure is conditional on the rivalry context and may help to explain rivalry maintenance.6"
"16","                 Hypothetical Distribution of Support for Relative Cooperation in a Rivalry and Nonrivalry Context                      "
"17","A second mechanism for rivalry maintenance arises if a dovish leader becomes more hawkish, in anticipation of the electoral penalty for overcooperation. Nasser is quoted as saying that he avoided compromising with the Israeli leadership on various occasions due to the potential hostile response domestically and regionally (Colaresi 2003; Sachar 1981).7 It is possible that if leaders could perfectly predict the repercussions of overcooperation—and there really was a severe electoral penalty for overcooperation—we would see very little or no overcooperation within rivalry.         "
"18","A similar rivalry outcome results from either the replacement of a dove with a hawk, or if a dove dons hawkish feathers, the continuation of conflict becomes more likely. However, the empirical ramifications could be quite complicated. For example, it may be the case that we rarely see extreme overcooperation because leaders are anticipating the costs of such an action. The upshot of this is that we may be less likely to find an empirical relationship between unreciprocated cooperation and leadership tenure (see Schultz 2001). This is a similar problem to searching for the electoral cost of losing a war (Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson 1995; Goemans 2000) or backing down from a commitment (Fearon 1994). In each case a leader may have an incentive to avoid the outcome being tested.         "
"19","Yet there are several reasons to suggest that we still may observe overcooperation within rivalries and the possible leadership tenure repercussions. First, there may be external pressure from a third party to offer cooperation. This is best exemplified by the intermittent pressure placed on Israel by the United States to de‐escalate conflict with the Palestinian Authority. A leader may decide that the electoral penalty from losing external support would be greater than the penalty from cooperation. Secondly, leaders may not act solely on an electoral calculus. Even some formal models on government decision making assume that leaders act both for policy and job security concerns (Laver and Shepsle 1996). If a leader believes in cooperation, they may risk job security for a perceived policy benefit. Finally, it is possible that leaders will miscalculate the response of the rival. Leaders may offer cooperation expecting reciprocation and some domestic cover for their actions. Since the leader of country A does not have control over whether rival B reciprocates, we may expect some asymmetries in the action‐reaction sequence of rivals. Through third‐party pressure, mixed policy motives, and incomplete foresight, comprehensive equality in dyadic cooperation is unlikely.         "
"20","Also, the observable implications of imperfect leadership foresight and mixed policy/strategic motives are that the distribution of unreciprocated cooperation should be different between rivals and nonrivals. If leaders are able to predict that high levels of overcooperation will lead to their political downfall, they are likely to avoid this eventuality. As such leaders in rivalries may work to reduce the incidence of extreme overcooperation. If the same penalty was not perceived in the nonrival case, this can serve as a comparison group. We would expect that given incomplete foresight, third‐party intervention and mixed policy motives the mean level of overcooperation should be lower in rivalries than outside of rivalry, and the variance in unreciprocated cooperation should be lower. Therefore, we can test for the presence of the two proposed mechanisms of rivalry maintenance derived from Vasquez's steps‐to‐war theory. If leaders overcooperate with an arrival, are they thrown out of power, thus perpetuating rivalry? Secondly, if leaders anticipate being punished for cooperation with rivals, but not nonrivals, do they work to minimize the damage?8"
"21","In the next section I summarize the research design used to investigate the relationship between leadership tenure and overcooperation, as well as the distribution of overcooperation in rivalry and nonrivalry contexts. If empirically verified, this may explain why issues within a rivalry go unresolved and conflict is perpetuated. In short, leaders may be afraid to risk cooperation or be overtly punished for compromising with a rival."
"22","In order to test the relationship between unreciprocated cooperation and leadership tenure, I utilize Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson's (1995) list of leaders. This includes all leaders of countries for the time period 1816–2000. Out of this time frame I only use leaders that ruled after 1950 and before 1990, as other data to be utilized were not available before or after that point (see below). This allows for the measurement of the length of leadership terms throughout the world.9"
"23","In order to understand the domestic political repercussions of overcooperating with a rival, we need some way of delineating rivals. I measure the presence of rivalry using Thompson's (2001) measure of strategic rivalry. This is a perception‐based measure that was created using historical research into whether or not two states viewed each other as a competitors and enemies. The perception of threat is an important component of the measure in this study. If a leader, the opposition, or those with the power to deselect a leader from power do not perceive another state as an enemy, and do not care about the potential issue at stake, there is little reason to suggest that a leader will be punished for overcooperation. While other measures of rivalry are available (see Bennett 1997; Goertz and Diehl 2000), they lack this perceptual element. It would be optimal to have public opinion data, as well as content analyses of elite speeches and positions with which to analyze citizen and elite perceptions. Since these measures are unavailable, the perception of rivalry within the leadership is used as the best approximation. I do utilize the Goertz and Diehl (1995) enduring rivalry data to check the robustness of the findings, selecting only those cases that are included by both rivalry classifications. These results, as well as a list of states involved in rivalry, are included in Appendix B.         "
"24","To code the foreign policy competitiveness of each leader in relation to a rival in a given year, I construct a measure of conflict and cooperation toward a rival from events data. There are various sources of event data in existence; these include the Conflict and Peace Database (COPDAB), the World Event Interaction Survey (WEIS), Global Event Data System (GEDS), the various Kansas Events Data System datasets, and the Protocol for the Assessment of Nonviolent Direct Action (PANDA). Each of these sources suffers from either temporal or geographic limitations. For example, COPDAB is available for the entire world, but only for the years between 1948 and 1978. Likewise, the WEIS and PANDA systems code events worldwide, but only for 1966–1990 and 1984–2000, respectively. Both KEDS and GEDS cover only select dyads, and even then only for a few decades. Optimally, we would want one continuous series of event scores for each directed dyad (actions of state A toward state B in year x)."
"25","Fortunately, Reuveny and Kang (1996) suggest a method of using information from both COPDAB and WEIS by splicing together the two series, using regression techniques. The splicing technique yields a complete series of event data from 1948 to 1990.10 The measure is then aggregated to the year‐level.11 Before splicing the COPDAB and WEIS, discrete event codes were scaled according to the methods designed by Azar and Sloan (1975) and Goldstein (1992), respectively.12 The final measure of unreciprocated cooperation for country A in a given year is computed by subtracting rival B's conflict/cooperation score from country A's score.13 If state A is involved in more than one rivalry, the measure for unreciprocated cooperation is the average unreciprocated cooperation across all rivalries. Therefore, a leader being “soft” on one rivalry may counterbalance that by being tough toward another rival.14"
"26","The use of event data to code the relative bellicosity of a leader explicitly equates foreign policy actions with the leadership (as coded in the leadership data). It is true that the leader may not have full control over the foreign policy in a state, yet for the argument to hold, it is only necessary that the chief executive is held responsible for the foreign policy actions. I also conduct analyses using just the WEIS data for comparison with the spliced series. This allows for me to check whether the results are driven by the splicing technique and also allows for separate measures of cooperation and conflict.15 Additionally, I code nonrival unreciprocated conflict/cooperation from the WEIS scores by collapsing the behavior sent and received by each state to all other nonrival states. A leader word score high on this index if he sent considerably more cooperation (or less conflict) than he/she received from other states.16"
"27","It is important to note that many other factors will also prove to be important predictors of leadership tenure, apart from unreciprocated cooperation with a rival. In previous studies of leadership survival, regime type, the state of the economy, and other demographic variables have been shown to be statistically relevant (see Bienen and Van der Walle 1991; Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson 1995). I separate regime type into three categories using the Cross‐National Times‐Series data (Banks 2002). First, nonelected systems are coded where the executive is not chosen by either a direct or indirect election. Second, a presidential system is coded where the executive is elected, but is independent from parliament. The third category comprises systems whereby the executive is elected but is either completely or partially dependent on parliament for the continuation of tenure.         "
"28","Because the type of executive selection mechanism does not exhaust all the possible cross‐national or cross‐temporal variations in regime type, I also control for the democracy score of a country using the Polity III data. The specific democracy measure is calculated by subtracting the raw autocracy score from the raw democracy score. Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson (1995) find that both the size of the winning coalition (W) and the selectorate (S) are also important predictors of leadership tenure. As such, I also include these variables in the analysis measured with the Polity III data following the formulas of Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson (1995). To account for the state of the domestic economy, the growth rate is included, as measured by the Penn World Tables (Summers and Heston 1991).         "
"29","Cultural and demographic characteristics are included by measuring the colonial history, age, and ethnic fractionalization of a state. The more fractionalized a state, the more likely is leadership turnover, as the difficulties of ruling should be greater. The experience of previously being a British colony is meant to measure the possible cultural and path‐dependent values that may stabilize leadership tenures in these countries (see Colaresi and Thompson 2003; Przeworski et al. 2000). A newer state may not have evolved mechanisms to replace a leader. Thus states born after 1950 may have significantly lower risks of leadership turnover than older states.17 Ethnofractionalization is measured using the World Handbook on Political and Social Indicators II (Taylor and Hudson 1972). Colonial history is measured as a dichotomous variable, equal to one if the state was previously a British colony according to the ICOW colonial database, and zero otherwise (see Hensel 2000).         "
"30","I use a semiparametric Cox hazard model to analyze the relationship between these variables and leadership tenure. In the present context, the Cox model is superior to binary logit or simple regression for several reasons. First, the risk of losing office is likely to change over time. For example, incumbent advantage may mean that the risk of losing power decreases the longer a leader is in power. Alternatively, the accumulation of a policy record may give the opposition room to criticize the leader and increase the risk of losing power. The semiparametric Cox hazard model used in this study explicitly models the relationship between time in office and turnover propensity. Moreover, no specific assumption of this baseline hazard function is necessary in the Cox model, as it is factored out and the partial likelihood used to derive the estimates (see Allison 1984).18"
"31","The baseline hazard is stratified by the three regime type categories listed above (nondemocratic, presidential, and parliamentary) since it is likely that there are distinct regime dynamics in each context (Colaresi 2003).19 I find below, and other studies present evidence (Bienen and Van der Walle 1991), that the risk of a leader losing power is not equal across regime types in a given year and does not vary by a common factor over time. Therefore, stratification, rather than merely a categorical control is needed.20"
"32","First, we can analyze the differences in unreciprocated cooperation between rivals and nonrivals. This tests the expectation that a leader may anticipate a penalty from overcooperation with a rival. Figure 3 presents kernel density estimates for both the rivalry and nonrival subpopulations. The area under each curve, between two points, represents the frequency of observing the level of unreciprocated cooperation in that interval. Rivalries have a lower mean and median unreciprocated cooperation score, and the difference is significant at the .01 level with both a difference in means test (with unequal variance) and a nonparametric medians test. Additionally, the nonrivalry cases have a higher variance with a higher frequency of observing extreme values. A Mann‐Whitney test rejects the null hypothesis that the two samples were drawn from the same population (p < .01). The differences in the distributions of unreciprocated cooperation between rivals and nonrivals are consistent with the argument that leaders may eschew overcooperating with a rival, anticipating an electoral penalty. Of course, these differences could be caused by other phenomena. For further evidence we need to analyze the direct connection between unreciprocated cooperation and leadership tenure.21"
"33","                 Distribution of Unreciprocated Cooperation between Rivals and Nonrivals                      "
"34"," Note: The graphs are nonparametric gaussian kernel density smoothes of dyadic unreciprocated cooperation (bandwidth = .5). Mann–Whitney tests, nonparametric median tests, and difference in means tests all show statistically significant differences between the two distributions.                     "
"35","The results (in Table 1) strongly support the relationship between unreciprocated rivalry cooperation/conflict and leadership survival. When analyzing the spliced event data, the more cooperative a leader's foreign policy toward a rival, relative to the rival's policies, the higher the risk of a leader losing power (Table 1, Model 1). The same results do not hold outside of rivalry (Table 1, Model 3). Unreciprocated cooperation toward nonrivals does not significantly influence leadership tenure. Also, even within states involved in rivalries there is a difference between the electoral punishment for overcooperation with the rival and overcooperation with other states (Table 1, Model 4). The risk of leadership removal is only accelerated by unreciprocated cooperation with a rival, not a nonrival. Specifically, it is expected that a one‐unit increase in unreciprocated cooperation/conflict (on the WEIS‐scale, ranging from −10 to 10) increases the risk of a leader losing power by 28%, holding all other variables constant (p < .05 for a two‐tailed test). This can be seen graphically in Figure 4, which graphs the affect of a two‐unit increase in unreciprocated cooperation over the baseline hazard (when all covariates are held at zero), stratified by regime type. The hazards are smoothed using nonparametric regression techniques.         "
"36","                 The Estimated Effect of Unreciprocated Cooperation on the Hazard, Stratified by Regime Type                      "
"37","If we turn our attention just to the WEIS data,22 we can separate out conflictual versus cooperative events. It may be that leaders are only punished for overcooperating with a rival (for example offering a peace treaty with no response), but not for undercompeting (for example by failing to answer a threat with another threat). Of course, the reverse may be true (or there may be no difference); in either case, it is important to test for the possibility that the above result is not driven by one side of the cooperation/conflict continuum. When we add unreciprocated cooperation and conflict into the model separately (see Table 2), the coefficient for cooperation is larger than that for conflict (the same is true when they both are included in the same model), and both are statistically significant at the .05 level. While model 1 predicts that unreciprocated cooperation increases the risk of a leader losing power by 55%, and model 2 predicts that undercompetition increases the risk of leadership turnover by 16%, the coefficients are not significantly different from each other. Thus, we cannot reject the hypothesis that overcooperation and undercompetition increase the risk of leadership turnover equally. Yet again, despite the use of various controls for domestic level variables and a different measure of conflict/cooperation, the potential asymmetry of the action‐reaction sequence in rivalries remains an important predictor of leadership survival.23"
"38","In addition to international unreciprocated cooperation/conflict, the size of the selectorate, the concentration of power in the leader, and recent independence were significant predictors of leadership turnover. Leaders that are selected by a larger group of people are less likely to lose power. Similarly, the greater the concentration of power within the leadership the more likely that a leader will be able to retain office. Increasing a leader's concentration of power from the mean (5) to the maximum (9) decreases the risk of leadership turnover by approximately 30% (p < .05 for a one‐tailed test). In the opposite direction, leaders in states that have been independent for longer (pre‐1950) have a higher risk of turnover. This may be due to the fact that older states are more likely to have created mechanisms for replacing leaders institutionally. It is surprising that economic growth was not estimated to influence leadership survival. One tentative hypothesis for future research is that economic stakes are less important in the domestic politics of rival states. More conventionally, better measures and a more disaggregated research design may be necessary to untangle the relationship."
"39","The previous tenure of a leader also plays a complex but important role in leadership turnover. All the previously presented results were stratified by regime type, allowing for each different regime type (Unelected, Presidential, Parliamentary) to have distinct leadership survival dynamics over time. These can best be seen graphically in Figure 4. The baseline hazard graph represents the hazard of leadership tenure in each year, for each regime type, when all of the other variables are set to zero. The hazard for presidents is consistently higher than both parliamentary elected leaders and unelected executives. A Wilcoxon test for the equality of the survivor functions (Allison 1984) is significant at the .05 level, suggesting the presence of distinct regime dynamics. An issue dealt with below is the eventual decreasing of the hazard rates over time for each of the regime types. This could reflect an incumbent advantage, whereby a leader is able to consolidate her/his rule, after some period of time. An additional possibility is that there is some unobserved concept, such as weak versus strong leaders, that has gone unmeasured. In this case, weak leaders may lose power rather quickly, and then after only a few years we are left with stronger leaders in the sample, each of which has a higher probability of remaining in office, and thus a lower risk of being replaced. Below, I attempt to model the possibility of unmeasured heterogeneity and test the robustness of the previous results.         "
"40","Having analyzed the relationship between leadership survival and the relative balance of conflict and cooperation with an international rival using both the spliced data as well as the pure WEIS series, several further tests can be conducted to increase our confidence in the results. First, as noted above, the declining baseline hazard over time may be a sign of unobserved heterogeneity. One way to test whether this unobserved heterogeneity is affecting our estimates is to model explicitly the difference between individual leaders using a positive multiplicative random effect (see Gutierrez 2002). This class of models, sometimes known as shared frailty models or conditional models allows each leader to have his or her own “frailty” or individual hazard. Another way to conceptualize the frailty is the within‐group correlation in a cluster of observations. If the observations within a cluster all represent one leader over time, the probability of losing power may be correlated since there could be some personal/individual specific leadership traits that constantly accelerate or decelerate leadership turnover. These individual frailties are assumed to have a mean of one, where on average the baseline hazard is correct, and a finite variance. When we specify the frailty as gamma distributed, we get the estimates reported in Table 1, model 2. The estimate for reciprocated cooperation/conflict remains significant and in the predicted direction. Interestingly, the frailty variance parameter is not significant, meaning that there does not seem to be a significant individual level effect as modeled.24"
"41","Because the frailty model depends on specific distributional and zero‐correlation assumptions, I also attempt to hold constant the possible cause of this heterogeneity. If we think that there is an unobserved weak leader effect, and that weak leaders are more likely to leave office early,25 we can possibly control for or reduce the influence of this unobserved heterogeneity by only looking at leaders that have survived a certain time in office. Assuming that these leaders must have some baseline political strength to have survived in office this long we can hold constant the previously unobserved effect and compare estimates. These results are presented in Table 3.26 Results are included for leaders who have served in office at least three years (model 1) and at least six years (model 2). In both cases the results are entirely stable. Unreciprocated cooperation continues to increase the risk of leadership turnover.27"
"42","Theories of international rivalry have to date only partially specified a mechanism that maintains conflict over time. Equally, previous explorations of the relationship between international events and domestic politics have rarely considered how the hawk‐dove domestic conflict will evolve within a rivalry relationship. Building on both literatures, it is likely that leaders will be punished politically for overcooperating/undercompeting within a rivalry. More hawkish elites may be able to pry dovish leaders out of power if they give more than they get in an international compromise with a rival. This leads to the prediction that the greater the distance between a foreign rival's policy and the policy of a leader, in the direction of overcooperation, the greater the probability of leadership turnover. This does not mean that all leaders offering peaceful settlements are deselected from power. Instead, it is the balance between cooperation offered to a rival and that received from the rival that influences the risk of leadership removal."
"43","The hypothesis that dovish leaders are more likely to lose power was tested in a statistical study of leadership tenure and unreciprocated cooperation. Controlling for various other factors, the event history analysis supported the above supposition. The findings proved robust to various respecifications, outlier tests, and alternative assumptions. Additionally, some preliminary evidence was found to support the notion that leaders may anticipate the penalty for overcooperating and attempt to minimize unreciprocated cooperation in a rivalry context. More research and specific case studies are needed to trace the process by which elites may strategically avoid being caught out on a limb in rivalry situations."
"44","These results are relevant to not only studies of international rivalry and intranational hawk‐dove dynamics, but also analyses of the interaction between domestic and international politics in general. For example, diversionary theory states that leaders may initiate an international conflict in order to distract attention from a poor economy or other domestic problems. The findings in this article suggest that diversion may be more likely, all else equal, within rivalry and domestic contexts characterized by threat and mistrust."
"45","The idea that domestic politics may trap leaders into perpetuating a rivalry should spur more research into the dynamics of international public opinion and leadership support. Time‐series analyses within specific countries may be able to track increases and decreases in leadership support by rivalry policies. In a more qualitative vein, case studies of specific rivalries can illuminate the domestic and international processes that drive a rivalry forward and pressure a leader into avoiding compromise. Some previous case study work on the pressure to avoid compromise in the Egypt‐Israeli, Somali‐Ethiopian, and Sino‐American rivalries supports the importance of looking at the interaction between domestic and international levels of analysis (Colaresi 2002). The study presented here suggests this is a fruitful avenue for future research.         "
"46","Perhaps most importantly, rivals do compromise and the ways in which this happens are important to map out theoretically. This research suggests that two leaders sitting on opposite ends of a rivalry are most likely to cooperate with each other when they are relatively secure that cooperation will be reciprocated. Does this explain the prevalence of secret negotiations within rivalries, as these serve to float compromise proposals outside of the public eye? Similarly, conditions that make the rivalry more costly to both parties at the same time, for example a shared threat from a new common rival, may increase each states confidence in receiving reciprocation (see Bennett 1996). Research into how international factors increase or decrease the domestic pressures facing elites may also help to highlight when rivalries are ripe for mediation.         "
