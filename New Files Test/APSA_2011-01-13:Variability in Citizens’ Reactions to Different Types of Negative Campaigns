"1","We know that negative information is likely to attract people's attention, even when individuals are distracted by the demands associated with daily life (Fiske 1980). This “negativity bias” in impression formation is well established (e.g., Fiske 1980; Taylor 1981). The reason that people attend readily to negative information is that the content of negative messages is filled with clues about events or situations that people should avoid (e.g., Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Lau 1982; McGraw and Steenbergen 1997).            "
"2","In addition to the negativity of messages, people pay more attention to messages that they perceive as relevant to their daily lives. In social psychology, for example, a variety of models of persuasion indicate that the relevance of the message is a prerequisite for persuasion (McGuire 1964, 1989; Petty and Cacioppo 1986). McGuire (1989), in his classic model of persuasion, argues that a message is persuasive only if people attend to and comprehend the message. And, when deciding which messages to pay attention to, people use the relevance of the message as a decision rule, concentrating on the messages that are relevant and ignoring those that are irrelevant.3"
"3","Although the social psychological literature is based on messages that are personally relevant to individuals, we believe that the same logic extends to “relevance for governing” in the political realm. We define “relevance” as discussions about issues, personal traits, or other topics that people consider pertinent for an electoral campaign.4 We reason that voters find some negative messages far more relevant (e.g., candidates’ voting records) than others (e.g., candidates’ drug use in college). A recent survey experiment examined subjects’ impressions of fictitious candidates and the relevance of several commercials (Fridkin and Kenney 2008). Findings from this study demonstrated that subjects readily rated certain commercials as more relevant to governing than others. And, the same data indicated that relevant negative messages (e.g., a message about the candidate's health care proposal) are more effective in shaping attitudes than irrelevant negative messages (e.g., a message about the candidate's divorce).5"
"4","Negative commercials, in addition to varying in content, also vary dramatically in tone. Some negative messages are delivered in an uncivil and strident manner, while other negative commercials embrace a more measured and courteous tone (Geer 2006). We expect that negative messages differing in their civility will vary in their impact on citizens’ evaluations of candidates. Our expectations rest on research demonstrating that people embrace norms that guide their interactions with other individuals. These norms about civil discourse extend to public discourse as well, with people expecting a certain level of civility from political actors, including candidates running for office (Guttman 1993; Mutz and Reeves 2005). In fact, several studies have yielded consistent findings demonstrating that not only do citizens make predictable distinctions between civil and uncivil messages, but also uncivil messages consistently produce more negative views of politicians and the political process (e.g., Brooks and Geer 2007; Fridkin and Kenney 2008; Mutz and Reeves 2005).            "
"5","Given the importance of civility as a norm in public discourse, how might people respond to political discourse violating these established norms? According to research focused on product advertising, an advertisement is a social object and is evaluated by common social norms (Dahl, Frankenberger, and Manchanda 2003). When the content or tone of an advertisement breaches norms for decency, good taste, and personal moral standards, the advertisement causes surprise, thereby attracting attention to the novel stimulus (Meyer et al. 1991).            "
"6","In the political realm, a campaign advertisement violating norms of civility is likely to be noticed. And, consistent with theoretical and empirical research on information‐processing models, advertisements that violate the norms of civility are viewed as shocking, thereby facilitating message comprehension and enhancing message retention (e.g., McGuire 1976).            "
"7","In exploring the impact of negative messages, it is essential to consider the civility of those messages in conjunction with their relevance.6 In particular, in predicting how negative messages will influence evaluations of the candidates, the relevance of the message is paramount. Prospective voters are only interested in hearing criticisms and critiques that provide information directly relevant to how a candidate will perform in office. In contrast, we expect that negative messages focusing on topics irrelevant to governing will not influence evaluations of a targeted candidate.            "
"8","Although all relevant messages should influence voters’ assessments of a targeted candidate, we expect that the civility of the message will alter its impact. An uncivil message—on a relevant topic—will heighten people's attention to the message and will more likely be remembered (Lau 1982; Mutz and Reeves 2005). Therefore, relevant and uncivil messages should produce the most powerful negative images of a targeted candidate. Relevant and civil messages should produce more moderate negative impressions. And, irrelevant messages—whether they are civil or uncivil—should not influence impressions of a targeted candidate.            "
"9","Just as negative messages vary in terms of their relevance and civility, we think that citizens’ tolerance of negative messages varies. In particular, we expect that certain people may be more tolerant of messages delivered in a strident fashion or focused on topics only tangentially related to governing. That is, for some people, “anything goes” when it comes to negative campaigning. These people believe that candidates should be free to attack their opponents in whatever way they choose. For other people, certain types of negative messages “cross the line” and insult their sensibilities regarding public decency and fairness."
"10","We contend that people's predispositions regarding the appropriate nature of political discourse will determine their receptivity to certain types of negative messages delivered during campaigns. For people who have a high tolerance for negative messages (i.e., people who think any type of attack advertising is appropriate), the relevance and civility of the message will be less influential. In contrast, citizens who have a low tolerance for certain types of negative political messages will be more affected by the (ir)relevance and (in)civility of negative messages.            "
"11","We draw an analogy for illustrative purposes between tolerance toward political messages and tolerance of physiological conditions. In the medical field, for example, we know that people who have a low tolerance for pain are more likely to feel pain when they are hurt physically. So, even if two people in a laboratory setting are exposed to the same amount of pain (e.g., a certain level of pressure on a subject's finger), the person with a lower tolerance for pain will report a higher level of discomfort (see, for example, Ellermeier and Westphal 1995). Similarly, we expect that people with a low tolerance for certain types of negative messages are more sensitive and will be more influenced by such messages. Therefore, the impact of these messages will be greater.            "
"12","We are not the first to hypothesize that people differ in their sensitivity to negative stimuli. For example, Ulbig and Funk (1999) theorize that people differ in their “conflict avoidance” tendencies and people who are more likely to dislike conflict are less likely to participate in politics. The authors find that conflict avoidance is significantly and inversely related to political participation.7"
"13","These findings suggest that individual differences exist in people's reactions to negative or threatening stimuli. We extend this logic to negative political messages: certain people will be more sensitive to irrelevant and uncivil messages and may react more strongly when exposed to these types of messages during campaigns. We think that these differences in sensitivity to negative information go beyond standard political variables, such as political sophistication, partisanship, or political interest.8 Instead, we contend that people have distinct attitudes concerning their sensitivity or receptivity to negative political rhetoric. Some citizens have an easier time tolerating negative political messages, while others dislike public criticism and grow weary of such messages as campaigns progress.            "
"14","In this article, we hope to advance our understanding of the impact of negative messages on people's impressions of campaigns by examining the intersection between the relevance and civility of negative messages and how people differ in their reactions to these types of messages. We rely on a representative survey sample of over 1,000 respondents along with data assessing the content of political communications during the 2006 senatorial campaigns. We turn now to a discussion of our data and measurements."
"15","This study uses data from the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) to investigate the impact of negative campaigning in U.S. Senate races. The CCES is a preelection/postelection Internet survey, conducted by Polimetrix, Inc., on behalf of a consortium of scholars at 37 colleges and universities. Each group of scholars in the consortium designed a “module” with unique survey questions asked of 1,000 respondents. In other words, each group of scholars controlled the content of questions for 1,000 citizens. In addition, these respondents completed a “common content” survey. The common content survey included 30,000 respondents."
"16","Polimetrix uses a sample matching methodology to produce a sample that is representative of the overall U.S. electorate (Rivers, n.d.). Comparisons of the CCES sample with census data suggest that the CCES sample is somewhat more educated and younger than the population at large. However, the CCES sample matches census data in terms of gender, race, and ethnicity composition (Hill et al. 2007). And, analysis conducted by Hill et al. (2007) suggests that the 2006 CCES produces an Internet sample that looks similar to existing RDD phone surveys.         "
"17","For our “module,” Polimetrix sampled about 75 respondents in 21 of the 28 U.S. Senate races featuring a majority party incumbent and a majority party challenger, for a total of 1,045 respondents.9 The races varied dramatically in terms of competition, in the amount of money spent, and in the amount of media attention given to the contests.         "
"18","In addition to the survey data, we also collected contextual data regarding the political advertisements aired during the Senate campaigns and the news coverage of these campaigns in state newspapers. Turning first to the political advertising data, we collected advertisements from the National Journal website. The National Journal website included downloadable links to almost all U.S. Senate advertisements publicly available (Grose and Globetti 2007).10 We searched the candidates’ own websites, as well as other websites, to increase the completeness of candidates’ advertisement samples. With this additional search, we were able to include advertisements from the following races: Utah, California, Texas, and Wyoming.         "
"19","We coded 302 advertisements for the 42 candidates.11 Some contests featured a great number of political advertisements aired repeatedly over the months preceding Election Day. In contrast, in some Senate campaigns, there were no advertisements on television at all. In coding the political advertisements, we assessed a variety of factors associated with the tone of the advertisement, including the civility of each commercial, the relevance of its content, and the substance of its message.12"
"20","Turning to the news coverage, we collected newspaper data from each state's largest circulating newspaper from October 1 to Election Day. We coded 2,077 news articles for the 21 Senate races. In coding the news content, we assessed a variety of factors associated with the tone of the coverage, including the number, content, and source of criticisms published about each candidate.13"
"21","There are no established measures for defining the relevance and civility of commercials. In addition, we know of no prior studies that have measured respondents’ tolerance for irrelevant and uncivil messages. Consequently, in this section we explain how we developed new measures for these key concepts. We spend a significant amount of time and effort determining the validity of these measures. We employ three tests to determine the validity of the measures assessing the relevance and civility of the commercials, and we conduct two validity tests for the survey questions measuring citizens’ tolerance of negative messages."
"22","To content analyze the political advertisements, coders distinguished between messages that were relevant and irrelevant for governing.14 For example, negative commercials classified as relevant by coders contained the following examples of content: “The Senator voted to give tax breaks for companies that move overseas…” or “The Senator voted 96% of the time with Bush.” In contrast, negative commercials classified as irrelevant contained content such as the following: “The candidates’ supporters are from Hollywood” or “My opponent parties with Playboy playmates.”            "
"23","Coders also assessed the civility of the message in each of the political advertisements.15 We adopted a generous interpretation for determining civility given the rough‐and‐tumble nature of campaign messages in U.S. Senate campaigns (Kahn and Kenney 1999). That is, there needed to be an explicit use of harsh, shrill, or pejorative adjectives describing candidates, their policies, or their personal traits for an advertisement to be considered uncivil. The following are sentences taken from advertisements categorized as civil by coders: “The candidate voted 18 times to raise taxes,” or “He talks conservative, but his record says otherwise.” In comparison, advertisements with the following messages were coded as uncivil in tone: “The Senator shows a disgusting display of arrogance,” or “After all these years, can't he offer more than smears and distortions?”            "
"24","These examples are from actual commercials aired during the 2006 senatorial campaigns and illustrate differences between irrelevant and relevant messages and differences between civil and uncivil messages. According to our coders, most of the negative commercials in our sample were viewed as focusing on a relevant topic.16 The coders scored 88% of the ads as relevant and only 12% as irrelevant.17 This is not surprising given that campaign managers and insiders have argued that attacks need to resonate with voters’ concerns and worries (Fenno 1996; Kahn and Kenney 1999). The negative messages, on the other hand, generated more variance in terms of civility. Fifty‐three percent of the negative advertisements were classified as civil, while 47% were considered uncivil.            "
"25","We perform three tests to assess the validity of the measures of relevance and civility. First, we look at whether the number of criticisms per advertisement increases as the relevance and civility of the advertisement decreases. We expect that the nastiest commercials (commercials that are less relevant and less civil) will also include the greatest number of criticisms.18 The content analysis confirms our expectations; the number of criticisms per advertisement is statistically significant and negatively correlated with the civility of the commercials (Kendall's tau b =−.27, p < .01) and relevance of the commercials (Kendall's tau b =−.26, p < .04).19"
"26","Second, we examine whether the relevance and civility of political commercials are related to the competitiveness of the campaigns. We expect that candidates running in competitive races would be more likely to produce negative messages embracing an uncivil tone and focusing on irrelevant messages, since prior research shows that negativity—in general—increases in hard‐fought races (e.g., Kahn and Kenney 2004; Lau and Pomper 2004). We find that competitive races (i.e., fewer than 20 points separating the candidates in preelection polls) generate messages with a less civil tone and with less relevant content when compared with lopsided races (i.e., more than 20 points separating the candidates in preelection polls). In particular, the average civility score is −.23 in competitive races and .05 in noncompetitive races (p < .10, one‐tailed test). The average relevance score is .79 in competitive races and 1.0 in noncompetitive races (p < .05, one‐tailed test).20"
"27","As a final validity check, we look at whether the relevance and civility of the negative commercials (as measured by the content analysis) predict people's assessment of the tone of the Senate campaigns in their state. If we have captured the tone and content of the advertisements properly, then these indicators should be strongly correlated with respondents’ perceptions of the tone of the campaigns. We asked people during the postelection survey to describe the tone of the U.S. Senate campaign as “very positive,”“somewhat positive,”“somewhat negative,” or “very negative.”21 To predict people's views of the tone of the campaign, we include the measures of civility and relevance of the candidates’ campaign commercials.22 We expect that as civility of the negative commercials increases, people will view the campaign discourse as more positive. In contrast, we expect that the relationship between the relevance of negative messages and the tone of the campaign to be negative. That is, as the relevance of negative messages increases, we expect people's view of the campaign to become more negative since we expect relevant negative messages will be more influential than irrelevant negative messages.            "
"28","To avoid specification error, we include several standard control variables that are correlated with people's views of the overall tenor of a senatorial campaign. We include a simple measure of the number of criticisms aired in the candidates’ political commercials.23 This control is important to be certain that the measures of the relevance and the civility of the ads are not simply picking up overall negativity. We also include a measure of the number of criticisms published about the candidates in the largest circulating newspaper in the state.24 We also control for the context of the campaign by including a measure of the closeness of the campaign based on preelection polls.25"
"29","The results of the MLM/MLE analysis are presented in Table 1.26 The dependent variable, tone of the campaign, ranges from 1 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). The results demonstrate that the tone of the candidates’ commercials significantly influences people's perceptions of the tone of the campaign. As the candidates’ negative commercials become increasingly civil, respondents view the campaign as more positive. And, as expected, the relevance of the negative advertisements is negatively related to people's assessment of the tone of the campaign. When candidates’ negative commercials focus on more relevant topics, people see the campaign as more negative.            "
"30","Turning to the control variables, the number of criticisms presented in the candidates’ commercials leads people to view the campaign as more negative. It is important that this variable, as well as the relevance and civility of the advertisements, reaches statistical significance, demonstrating that our measures of relevance and civility are not simply tapping the number of criticisms in the ads. Similarly, as the number of criticisms in the press increases, people are significantly more likely to view the campaign tone as negative."
"31","We contend that people differ in their tolerance toward negative campaigning, and we have developed four survey items to assess people's tolerance for negative campaigning. We presented respondents with four statements and asked them to indicate whether they strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree with each statement. The first two statements tap the person's tolerance for uncivil discourse, and the second two statements measure the person's tolerance for irrelevant commentary. We vary whether an “agree” response means the respondent likes or dislikes uncivil or irrelevant negative commercials.27 The four items are as follows:            "
"32","                              "
"33","Some negative advertisements are so nasty that I stop paying attention to what the candidates are saying."
"34","                              "
"35","Mean‐spirited commercials attacking the opponent are appropriate during election campaigns."
"36","                              "
"37","Negative advertisements attacking a candidate's personal life are inappropriate."
"38","                              "
"39","I find negative political commercials attacking the opponent's personal life as a young person to be interesting."
"40","Responses to the two civility questions suggest that most people in our sample do not like mean‐spirited campaigns. For example, 47% of respondents “strongly agree” and 35%“somewhat agree” that campaign advertisements are “…so nasty that I stop paying attention.” Similarly, 45% of respondents “strongly disagree” and 27%“somewhat disagree” that “mean‐spirited commercials…” are appropriate during a campaign. Turning to the relevance of certain types of attacks, more than half of the respondents (55%) “strongly agree” and 27%“somewhat agree” that attacking a candidate's personal life is inappropriate. Similarly, 61% of the people in the survey “strongly disagree” and 21%“somewhat disagree” that negative advertisements attacking a candidate's personal life as a young person are interesting. These responses resonate with the electorate's long‐standing antagonism toward negative campaign rhetoric (Kahn and Kenney 2004).            "
"41","We conduct two tests to examine the validity of the individual measures of tolerance toward incivility and irrelevance. In our first test, we assess whether theoretically relevant variables help predict people's level of tolerance toward negative messages. To predict people's level of tolerance toward negative messages, we look at two sets of variables: demographic variables (i.e., the gender of the respondent, the respondent's age, and the respondent's education level) and political variables (i.e., the respondent's political sophistication, the respondent's ideology, and the strength of the respondent's party affiliation).28 Research examining the connection between negative campaigning and turnout suggests that women and Independents may react most strongly to negative messages. In particular, some scholars find that women and Independents are more likely to become demobilized as negativity increases (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1997; Kahn and Kenney 1999; Kern and Just 1997). These individuals may be more affected by campaign negativity because they are less tolerant of uncivil and irrelevant messages.29"
"42","We estimate two OLS models, one predicting an individual's tolerance toward irrelevant messages and one predicting an individual's tolerance toward uncivil messages.30 The results presented in Table 2 indicate that certain people are significantly more tolerant of uncivil and irrelevant messages. We find that people who are more strongly attached to the political parties are more tolerant of uncivil and irrelevant messages, as are people who are more interested in political campaigns. Ideology is related to people's tolerance to negativity, with conservatives being more tolerant of uncivil and irrelevant messages, compared with more liberal respondents. We also find that men are more tolerant of uncivil and irrelevant negative messages when compared with women. In addition, older people are less tolerant of uncivil and irrelevant messages. And, politically sophisticated citizens, who are most skilled at sorting through relevant and irrelevant discourse, appear to be less tolerant of irrelevant messages.31"
"43","A second test to establish the validity of our tolerance measures is to examine whether people's level of political tolerance predicts how they view political commercials. In our survey, we asked respondents to rate the usefulness and civility of negative commercials they reported seeing during their state's Senate race. These questions are asked in the postelection wave, whereas the questions assessing the respondents’ levels of tolerance regarding relevance and civility were asked in the preelection wave of the survey. We find that as people's tolerance for irrelevant advertisements increased, they were more likely to view the advertisements they saw as relevant. The correlation between people's tolerance for irrelevant commercials and their relevance ratings for the incumbent and challenger commercials was .21 (p < .01) and .13 (p < .01), respectively.32 Similarly, as people's tolerance for uncivil advertisements increased, people were more likely to view the advertisements they saw as civil. The correlation between people's tolerance for uncivil commercials and their civility ratings for the incumbent and challenger commercials was .16 (p < .01) and .08 (p < .05), respectively.33"
"44","Based on the series of tests reported here, we believe that we have developed valid measures of the civility and the relevance of the candidates’ advertisements as well as valid measures of respondents’ tolerance toward uncivil and irrelevant advertisements. We have demonstrated that these measures are related to a set of theoretically important predictors. And, we have shown that these measures predict citizens’ views of the Senate campaigns as well as their views of the candidates’ commercials."
"45","We turn now to exploring the key question in this article: do negative advertisements lower evaluations of a targeted candidate? As we have argued throughout the article, we believe that certain types of negative messages are more powerful than others. Specifically, we expect that the relevance of the message combined with the message's civility will influence evaluations of the candidates. In addition, we expect that the influence of the negative messages on citizens’ assessments of candidates will depend on people's tolerance for negative campaigning."
"46","With the important independent variables in place, we focus on developing several key dependent variables that capture citizens’ evaluations of the candidates seeking U.S. Senate seats in 2006. We assess four traditional dimensions that capture individuals’ evaluations of the candidates: (1) citizens’ impressions of the candidates’ personality traits, (2) individuals’ affective assessments of the candidates, (3) voters’ views regarding the candidates’ abilities to deal with several issues, and (4) citizens’ overall favorability ratings of the candidates (Abramowitz 1988; Campbell et al. 1960; Kinder 1986; Wright and Berkman 1986). The questions used to tap the dependent variables are derived primarily from standard NES measures.34"
"47","The analyses take place in two steps. First, we examine how negative campaign messages shape people’s evaluations of the Senate candidates. With this initial analysis, we examine how the interplay between the tone (civility) and content (relevance) of the messages shapes citizens’ impressions of the candidates. Second, we examine whether citizens’ tolerance of negative campaigning affects how the tone and content of negative messages shape citizens’ views of candidates."
"48","As discussed earlier, we expect that only relevant negative commercials will depress people's impressions of the targeted candidate. Among these relevant negative commercials, we hypothesize that uncivil advertisements will be more powerful than civil advertisements. Based on these theoretical expectations, we categorize the commercials of each candidate as relevant and uncivil, relevant and civil, and irrelevant. In particular, if a candidate's commercials are rated as high on relevance and low on civility, the candidate is given a score of 3.35 If a candidate's commercials are rated as high on relevance and high on civility, the candidate is given a score of 2. Finally, if a candidate's commercials are rated as low on relevance, the candidate is given a score of 1.36"
"49","To properly estimate the effect of the relevance and civility of negative advertisements on people's views of the candidates, we need to control for several rival factors. To begin, we need to assess whether candidates who engage in negative campaigning are susceptible to a “backlash” effect; that is, candidates who attack their opponents may hurt their own evaluations.37 Relying on the theoretical framework introduced earlier, we expect to find a backlash effect when candidates attack their opponents with uncivil and irrelevant messages. We expect citizens to find these messages offensive because they are delivered in an uncivil manner and focus on topics not germane to governing. To measure the backlash effect, we employ a binary coding where the sponsoring candidates’ commercials receive a score of 1 if these commercials are rated as low on relevance and low on civility. All other combinations of commercials receive a score of 0.38"
"50","We include additional measures assessing the context of the campaign as well as measures tapping the political profiles of the respondents. We include a variable measuring the number of press criticisms published about the candidate to capture the general negativity of the campaign.39 In addition, we include a measure assessing the competitiveness of the campaign. Based on prior research examining campaign intensity, we expect incumbents to be evaluated more favorably in noncompetitive races and challengers to be rated more positively in competitive races (Kahn and Kenney 1999; Westlye 1991). Finally, we control for respondents’ ideological and political preferences since people are likely to rate a candidate more positively when they share the candidate's party and ideological positions.40"
"51","The MLM/MLE results predicting evaluations of the incumbents and challengers are presented in Table 3. The findings demonstrate that the relevance and civility of the political advertisements perform precisely as expected. Overall, in each of the eight equations, the measure tapping the relevance and civility of political advertising is statistically significant and is signed in the hypothesized direction. In each case, as relevance and incivility of the advertisements increase, people's evaluations of the targeted candidates decline. This finding is consistent regardless of whether respondents are evaluating the candidates in terms of (1) personality traits, (2) affective impressions, (3) issue competence, or (4) overall impressions.41 In fact, the relevance and civility of the advertisements are more powerful and more consistent in their impact than the amount of press criticisms or the closeness of the race, suggesting that the relevance and civility measure is capturing something beyond the general negativity of the campaign and the competitiveness of the contest.         "
"52","In addition, the influence of the relevance and civility measure is more powerful in the challenger models than in the incumbent models, according to the parameter estimates. This indicates that the content and tone of incumbents’ advertising is more effective at lowering evaluations of the challengers than vice versa. For example, in the model predicting respondents’ assessments of candidates’ personality traits, the parameter estimate for the relevance and civility variable is −.76 in the challenger model and −.42 in the incumbent model."
"53","To provide a clearer picture of how the relevance and civility of negative messages influence citizens’ assessments of candidates’ personal traits, we calculate the “first differences” for the maximum likelihood coefficients (King 1989, 107–8).42 We want to estimate the average probability (i.e., 0 to 1.0) that people will lower their evaluations of candidates’ personal traits as the negative messages change in terms of relevance and civility. We turn first to an examination of the size of the effects when challengers attack incumbents. In particular, if challengers move from producing irrelevant commercials to producing relevant and civil commercials, there is a .22 probability that citizens will decrease their trait assessments of incumbents’ personal traits. If challengers move from marketing relevant and civil commercials to relevant and uncivil commercials, then voters have a .15 probability of decreasing their assessments of the incumbents’ personal traits. In comparison, changes in the incumbents’ commercials have a larger impact on assessments of the challengers’ personalities. In particular, moving from irrelevant commercials to relevant and civil commercials produces a .25 probability that citizens will decrease evaluations of challengers’ traits, and changing from relevant and civil commercials to relevant and uncivil messages produces another .25 probability that citizens will decrease their impressions of the challengers’ personalities.43"
"54","Looking at the remaining variables in the models, the variable estimating “backlash” is statistically significant in three of the four incumbent equations. But, the backlash variable does not reach statistical significance in any of the challenger models. These findings suggest negative campaigning by incumbents is risky.44 While incumbents will be effective at depressing views of their challengers as their commercials become more relevant and more uncivil, incumbents who air irrelevant and uncivil advertisements run the risks of offending potential supporters and hurting their own evaluations.         "
"55","We also find that press criticisms significantly influence impressions of the incumbent in three of the four equations. In contrast, the parameter estimates for press criticisms never reach statistical significance in the four equations predicting evaluations of the challengers. Press criticisms are probably more powerful for incumbents because incumbents garner significantly more press coverage than challengers (Kahn and Kenney 1999; Westlye 1991).         "
"56","Finally, and as expected, ideological and party proximity have a substantial and consistent impact on impressions of incumbents and challengers. This is not surprising. What is impressive, however, is that the relevance and civility of advertising exert a strong impact on candidate evaluations, even controlling for party and ideological proximity."
"57","We turn now to our final analysis. Are the strong effects of relevance and civility modified or altered by citizens’ tolerance of negative attacks? As discussed earlier, we expect that people with a low tolerance for uncivil and irrelevant messages will be more influenced by these types of communications. The impact of these messages will be greater simply because these individuals are more sensitive to the content and tone of the negative advertisements."
"58","To test whether tolerance for uncivil and irrelevant messages influences the impact of negative messages, we combine the measures of tolerance for uncivil messages and tolerance for irrelevant messages into a single index, ranging from 4 to 16.45 We then divide our sample at the mean and reestimate the MLM/MLE equations presented in Table 3 for people low in tolerance of negative messages (Table 4) and for people high in tolerance of negative messages (Table 5).46"
"59","Turning first to Table 4, the top panel presents the results for evaluations of incumbents while the bottom panel presents the results for evaluations of challengers. We are most interested in the strength, statistical significance, and direction of the parameter estimates for the measure tapping the relevance and civility of the negative advertisements. The relevance and civility variable is statistically significant in three of the four equations for incumbents and in four of the four equations for challengers. In addition, the sign of the relevance and civility variable is in the hypothesized (negative) direction in each of the eight models in Table 4.         "
"60","As in Table 3, the size of the parameter estimates for relevance and civility is larger in the challenger models, compared with the incumbent models. These results indicate that for people sensitive to negative campaigning, the incumbents’ messages are more damaging than the challengers’ messages. Also, consistent with the findings in Table 3, the backlash effect is evident for incumbents and not for challengers. In addition, the criticisms published in the newspaper damage evaluations of incumbents in each of the four models, while failing to significantly affect impressions of challengers.         "
"61","Turning to Table 5, these analyses focus only on people who have a high score on the tolerance scale (i.e., above the mean). For these individuals, we expect that the relevance and civility of the negative advertisements will only minimally influence their evaluations of the candidates. People with a high tolerance for negativity are less sensitive to negative information, and we do not expect variations in the tone and content of negative messages to alter their impressions of the candidates. For evaluations of incumbents (the top panel in Table 5), the relevance and civility measure is statistically significant in only one of the models (i.e., overall evaluations). And, for evaluations of challengers, the relevance and civility do not reach statistical significance in any of the four equations.47"
"62","Finally, we expect that the magnitude of the relevance and civility coefficients will be larger for people with low tolerance (i.e., Table 4) than for people with high tolerance (i.e., Table 5). And, this is precisely the case. In eight of the eight models, the size of the relevance and civility coefficient is larger in the low‐tolerance sample than in the high‐tolerance sample. In fact, the differences are quite dramatic. In seven of the eight comparisons, the relevance and civility coefficients are over twice as large in the low‐tolerance sample, compared with the high‐tolerance sample.         "
"63","The results presented in Tables 4 and 5 provide strong support for our hypothesis. The analyses, conducted across four different dependent variables and two subpopulations, are consistent and impressive. People who do not like uncivil and irrelevant discourse in negative communication are more responsive to the variation in the content and tone of negative commercials. These messages directly influence their assessments of incumbents and challengers. This finding stands in stark contrast to those people who are unperturbed by messages presented in an uncivil manner and focused on irrelevant content. For people with higher tolerance for negativity, the variance in the relevance and civility of messages has little influence on their evaluations of candidates running for the U.S. Senate.48"
"64","Communication between citizens and candidates during political campaigns is an essential element of representative democracies. A fundamental aspect of these discussions is for candidates to “make a case” for their candidacies. This involves disseminating a variety of messages, including biographical statements about the candidates, messages intended to build trust with constituents, discussions about the candidates’ political philosophy, and statements describing the candidates’ policy plans for solving contemporary problems. In addition, candidates need to explain why they will be better representatives than their opponents. Candidates often deliver these messages by disseminating negative advertisements aimed at their rivals. This campaign strategy is extremely common in the last days of statewide and national elections."
"65","Although negative campaigning is common, demonstrating the impact of negative campaigning has proven to be elusive. In this article, we introduce and test a more sophisticated theory of negative campaigning, exploring the conditions contributing to the effectiveness of negative messages. In particular, we examine how the relevance and civility of negative messages influence citizens’ assessments of candidates. The data analyses focus on the 2006 U.S. Senate campaigns and demonstrate that negative messages centered on topics relevant to governing and disseminated in an uncivil manner (e.g., harsh or shrill language) strongly influence citizens’ evaluations of candidates. Irrelevant messages, regardless of whether they are presented in a strident or civil manner, have little impact on voters’ views of the candidates. However, negative advertising is not without risk. When incumbents stray away from relevant messages and produce and disseminate irrelevant and uncivil messages, citizens react by lowering their evaluations of these incumbents. Challengers, on the other hand, do not face as fierce a backlash from potential voters."
"66","We also demonstrate that not all citizens are equally influenced by negative campaigning. In particular, the impact of negative messages is especially strong for citizens who have limited tolerance for “attack politics.” In contrast, for people with a high tolerance for rough‐and‐tumble campaign rhetoric, negative messages are less influential."
"67","All told, the evidence suggests that the effect of negative information on targeted politicians is not minimal. Rather, the effects are multifaceted, and under some circumstances, substantial. These effects hold up in the face of stiff controls for partisan and ideological attachments. In addition, we have identified these effects in real campaigns."
"68","While the present article focuses on evaluations of candidates, we think that the relevance and civility of negative messages—and people's tolerance for these messages—may also contribute to the resolution of the ongoing debate regarding the (de)mobilizing effect of negative campaigning. Embracing the variance in the content and tone of messages may help explain whether negative messages enhance or depress turnout. We expect that not all negative messages will demobilize citizens. Instead, messages focusing on irrelevant material—and presented in an uncivil manner—may be the most likely type of message to “turn off” voters. In contrast, messages focusing on relevant topics and presented in a civil manner may actually engage citizens and increase participation. In addition, we expect that the impact of these different messages will depend on people's tolerance for negative campaigning. In particular, irrelevant and uncivil messages may be more effective at depressing turnout among people with little tolerance for negative rhetoric. We encourage researchers to consider the variability in the content and tone of negative messages when exploring how negative campaigning affects turnout."
"69","We believe that this article advances our understanding of negative campaigning by embracing the variability in the content and tone of negative messages as well as the variance in people's tolerance for negative messages. However, this article represents a first step. Future work should explore variance in additional dimensions of campaign rhetoric, such as variance in the medium (e.g., Internet vs. television advertising), variance in the timing of the negative messages (e.g., early vs. late in the campaign), variance in the presence of a counterattack (e.g., how often, how fierce), and variance in the repetition of the message (e.g., how many repeated attacks before effectiveness is detected). We believe that all of these avenues will shed more light on how negative messages shape citizens’ attitudes and, ultimately, their choices at the ballot box."
