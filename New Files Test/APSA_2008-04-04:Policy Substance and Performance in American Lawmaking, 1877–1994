"1"," David Mayhew's            Divided We Govern (1991) demonstrated the importance of empirically explaining what government does, instead of focusing primarily on the behavior of individual members of Congress. In his work, Mayhew approached the idea that divided government suppresses legislative output (he found it does not). His findings generated a small cottage industry of research that assesses the determinants of legislative output. Others have argued that it is not divided government, but rather political polarization that decreases legislative output. Work on polarization often measures the concept quantitatively by the difference between the median members of the majority and minority parties in Congress, usually in the House of Representatives (McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006). Still others believe that polarization is a critical factor in determining policy output, but argue that bicameral differences between the House and Senate are the critical variable of interest (Binder 2003). Collectively, this work has certainly increased our understanding of the determinants of lawmaking, and yet the role of policy issue content is nearly invisible.         "
"2","Policy issue content is equally absent in recent formal theoretic accounts of U.S. lawmaking. The two most prominent models of this type are the pivotal politics (Brady and Volden 1998; Krehbiel 1998) and party cartel models (Cox and McCubbins 2005) of lawmaking.6 The pivotal politics model of lawmaking predicts that policy change occurs when status quo policies are extreme relative to the preferences of members of Congress. More specifically, a gridlock interval can be constructed by examining key “pivots” in the separation of powers system. These pivots are defined by the filibuster in the Senate (the cloture pivot) and the presidential veto.7 Policy change occurs precisely when the status quo of an existing policy is extreme relative to the gridlock interval. Like the pivotal politics model, the party cartel model of lawmaking also constructs a gridlock interval but differs in that the gridlock interval is set by the preferences of the median members of the majority party and the floor median. This partisan‐based gridlock interval vis‐à‐vis the status quo determines whether policy change is observed. In both models, policy change is determined by the location of status quo policies relative to the preferences of critical members of Congress.         "
"3","Empirical evaluations of the party and cartel models make implicit assumptions to produce testable predictions for legislative accomplishment across time. Many of the nonformal theories of lawmaking discussed above also make these implicit assumptions. These assumptions have to do with the desire and opportunity to pass legislation.         "
"4","The first assumption is that all legislative regimes are equally interested in legislating. At least one scholar has argued that not all legislative regimes are alike. John Coleman argues that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to enact new legislation when they control government (Coleman 1999). This type of assumption is not fully explored in most preference‐based models of lawmaking. Instead, most scholars implicitly assume that lawmakers would like to enact/move policies closer to their ideal points.8 Although this assumption is linked to policy substance by the fact that if the desire to legislate varies then it is likely to occur on an issue‐by‐issue basis, it is not empirically explored in this article.         "
"5","The second assumption about the opportunity to pass legislation is particularly critical for models of lawmaking that construct gridlock intervals. Empirical assessments of such models require that gridlock intervals, which can be constructed from either electoral or roll‐call data, are highly correlated with the amount of moveable status quos. The usual assumption is that the distribution of moveable status‐quo points is uniform across the policy space. A uniform distribution is highly desirable because it ensures that change in predicted legislative accomplishment is not dependent on the location of the pivots being changed. The intuitive idea behind this assumption is that an equal change in the gridlock interval width should have the same effect on lawmaking, regardless of whether the change occurred in a moderate section of the issue space or in a more extreme portion. The problem with this assumption is that the distribution of moveable status quos is likely not uniform (or even normal), but is, in fact, probably quite lumpy across time and particularly across different policy issue areas."
"6","The remainder of this section explains why the distribution of moveable status quos is likely to be very lumpy across different issue areas. David Mayhew's (2005a, 2005b) most recent work flushes out much of the intuition behind this. He argues that events such as wars, economic crises, and assassinations are important factors that drive policy change. Why do such events matter for lawmaking? In his work, Mayhew draws on the research of others, primarily John Kingdon's work on “policy windows,” which suggests that crises alter the demand and supply of public policies (Kingdon 1984). In other words, crises often delegitimize existing government policies that are directly and, in some cases, indirectly linked to the event. Consequently, a crisis can immediately shift the distribution of moveable status quo policies for some types of policies. This type of shift can and usually does happen quickly (think of the post 9/11, 107th Congress).         "
"7","In his work, Mayhew (2005a) argues that there are long‐ and short‐term effects of crises or major events on policymaking. In his article on war, he constructs lists of legislation that would not have come into existence without specific wars in American history. Crises and war therefore have the ability to immediately change the status quo locations of policies linked to the event. Others, of course, have also theorized and empirically demonstrated the effect of war on politics. Notable work includes John Mueller's work, War, Presidents and Public Opinion(1973), that demonstrates the “rally around the flag” effect of major crises which might facilitate major policy change. In a nutshell, these authors argue either implicitly or explicitly that status quo policies that are affected by a crisis are not random. Instead, they are linked by policy substance to the event itself. For example, in the case of war, international affairs issues such as defense policy and war‐related domestic policies will have moveable status quos that were likely not moveable immediately prior to the event, unless a major change in the gridlock interval resulted because of electoral replacement.9 For example, the 9/11 crisis affected the perceived status quo location for a number of related policy issues. This event led to the enactment of a number of highly significant laws in the 107th Congress, including the Use‐of‐force resolution, USA Patriot Act, and $40 billion in emergency spending. An event, such as war, of course, will not change the perception and location of status quo policies across all policy types. Thus, policy substance enters the equation. Crises have the potential to change the distribution of moveable status quo points for certain types or groups of policy.10"
"8","It has been demonstrated that it is possible, if not likely, that crises and other significant events by themselves can shift the distribution(s) of moveable status quos for different policy issues. Some policies, of course, might be quite immune to change because they are not linked to the event. Empirically, a better grasp of how crises and other events impact lawmaking by policy issue area is needed. To accomplish this, an appropriate way to classify policies by issue area is needed."
"9","Classifying acts, even when it seems unguided or purely inductive, is simultaneously a statement of theory that maintains that this is how the world might be studied within the ambit of a particular perspective on social reality and a set of empirical claims that assert that this is how the world actually is organized. In developing the coding scheme described below, there were two motivations that guided the entire effort—the understanding that good categorization requires guiding principles and a high degree of recognition by those who share in the experience being catalogued (Katznelson and Lapinski 2006a, 2006b).11"
"10","The schema is designed to organize an approach to policy coding that will be of interest and use beyond the confines of congressional studies or American politics more generally, and colleagues who work in comparative politics, political theory, and international relations should be able to locate their questions and categories within this approach.12 Theoretically, the schema is guided by the work of historians and scholars of APD, with categories that have been created that are appropriate to a representative democracy, building a modern national state, and creating public policies across time. The approach here centers on what the national state is, what it does, and how it structures key sets of linkages that define the character of its regime. From this approach, another objective comes to mind that is concerned with the character of political science and the place of American political studies within it. In combining a focus on representation and public policy, thoughtful coding can advance understanding of American state formation, the status of liberalism, and the character of temporality in the American experience (Katznelson and Lapinski 2006a).         "
"11","In addition to drawing upon ideas from APD, much effort was expended to make it suitable to empirically evaluate important theoretical work within the Congress subfield. For example, the Congress literature suggests that members of Congress would potentially have different incentives when dealing with passing public goods (nondivisible goods such as national defense) versus particularistic (private) goods whose benefits accrue to a limited number of constituents. This schema was specifically designed to be able to test such fundamental Congress‐centered questions."
"12","The schema works in nested tiers. Consequently, each public law in this article is assigned a Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 coding. This is an important design element of policy issue coding in that these different levels of aggregation allow additional flexibility and enabled the building of elements of legislative studies and APD into the different levels of the content categories. Tier 1 and Tier 2 are analytically driven categories motivated by theoretical literatures. Tier 3 is an inductively generated coding. In practical terms, this means that the schema has multiple levels of aggregation. These different tiers are explained in the following paragraphs."
"13","The first tier of the schema designates four basic elements common to modern states and reserves ‘Domestic Affairs’ to a specific zone of policies distinct from those that define the characteristics of sovereignty or the organization and scope of the state as an institution, but which designate substantive policy outputs. The first tier also includes four additional categories that are specific to the United States and Congress. Table 1 provides a listing of all the categories across the three tiers.         "
"14","Within Tier 1, the fitting first category is Sovereignty, the defining characteristic of the modern state. Within studies of historical institutionalism, sovereignty usually refers to the state's claim to rule legitimately over particular people and places. It is therefore concerned with the state's very existence, including its boundaries as well as membership in the national regime. Thus, the first grouping of policies inside Tier 1 is those that bear directly on the state as a sovereign entity. No other classification scheme designates this field of policy for particular consideration.         "
"15","The second category, Organization and Scope, concerns the institutional elaboration of the national government and its instruments for governing, including its basic constitutional rules, norms, formal organization, and terms of political participation. This is also a category usually not separated from domestic affairs. In identifying policy that is specifically related to the institutions that constitute the policymaking apparatus, the possibility opens to systematically measure when and why institutions change inside Congress and across the executive branch. By bearing on the character and institutional composition and rules of government, the first two categories taken together make it possible to develop systematic measures that place congressional decision making at the center of the historical development of the national state without reducing “state making,” as some literatures do, to a single continuum that runs from weak to strong, where “strong” too simply connotes a capable executive (Katznelson and Lapinski 2006b).         "
"16","The two remaining main categories in the first tier of coding concern the traditional outputs of government. International Relations refers to the geopolitical and economic transactions between the United States and other sovereign states within the global system. Domestic Affairs is the category concerned with public policies that shape the ties between government and the economy and between government and the welfare of its citizens.13"
"17","The first four main categories of the first tier of coding, therefore, are tied to what modern sovereign states are and do across time. By keeping these large categories constant, it is possible to see what the relative emphasis of lawmaking has been in distinct periods and probe whether policy coalitions vary from one domain to the other."
"18","The first‐tier categories are theoretically important, particularly for APD, but are nonetheless bulky. At the second tier, each first tier is divided into three or four subcategories. That is, for each class of policies in the first tier, the layered elements that together compose its constellation are identified. Thus, sovereignty in a representative democracy always entails decisions about liberty, membership and the demographic composition of the nation, civil rights, and physical boundaries. Organization and scope in such a regime are composed of decisions about constitutional structure, governmental organization, and rules of political representation. International relations divides into the triad of defense, geopolitics, and international political economy, whereas domestic affairs divides into policy judgments about agriculture, planning and resources, political economy, and social policy. Tier 2 categories cannot cross their Tier 1 counterparts. In other words, a policy coded as Tier 2 Civil Rights is required to be assigned a Tier 1 coding of Sovereignty.         "
"19","These distinctions are still not fine grained enough to surmount the problems of aggregation observed in other coding schemes. Utilizing a detailed review of congressional committee responsibilities, budget categories, and the classifications of existing coding approaches, each second‐tier category is subdivided into two‐to‐thirteen Tier 3 substantive classifications intended to be mutually exclusive and comprehensive. Overall, there is a total of 70 inductively‐based Tier 3 categories. Over time, of course, the relative weight of these sites of policy alters significantly."
"20","In sum, the classification is designed to code congressional roll calls and public statutes by policy area guided by visible criteria for the assemblage of categories, combining a strong deductive, institutionally, and state‐oriented approach to the first two tiers with a more inductive approach to filling out the third. The approach provides part of the data needed to construct policy‐specific measures of legislative accomplishment. In the next section, attention is turned to how to measure the significance of individual legislative enactments and how to marry the policy issue substance coding with legislative significance estimates in order to construct appropriate dependent variables for analysis."
"21","In order to study the importance of policy issue substance on lawmaking, new data are needed. This section explains how a new measure of legislative accomplishment is constructed that combines previous work on estimating a statute‐level measure of legislative significance for every public law enacted between 1877 and 1994 (45th to 103rd Congresses; n = 37,767) with substantive policy issue coding. In other words, the new measure of legislative accomplishments is a macrolevel variable that is constructed by aggregating by Congress the individual accomplishments (passed public laws) for each congressional term. This creates data that measure the legislative accomplishment for 59 Congresses (118 years) by policy issue area. As the individual significance estimate for each public law serves as a critical building block for this macrolevel measure, a brief review of how these “scores” were estimated must be presented. A complete description of this method can be found in Clinton and Lapinski (2006).         "
"22","In order to estimate the significance of every public statute passed by Congress, a comprehensive dataset was built that consists of each of the 37,767 public statutes passed between 1877 and 1994 (the 45th to 103rd Congresses). This dataset includes information on every public statute during this period, including a large sample of elite evaluations (20) of the importance of public enactments at different points in time, as well as a number of other measures by which the importance of a bill can be ascertained.14 These data are used to estimate a significance “score” for every public enactment as well as a standard error. This is accomplished by using a statistical model—the item response model15—to integrate all rater information and account for rater differences as well as leveraging data collected on the statutes themselves. For example, instead of choosing between the determinations of Mayhew (1991) and Howell et al. (2000), who each rate subsets of important enactments for the post‐WWII period—this method combines the information of each. The method reconciles disagreements and combines raters who assess different periods of American history to yield time‐consistent significance estimates (Clinton and Lapinski 2006). The statute‐level estimates for every enactment also stand in contrast to existing measures that treat all legislation as equally significant and perfectly measured. This measures discriminates between rated legislation, and we use information regarding the amount of attention Congress devoted to each statute, the number of substitute bills, whether a conference committee was required, and the session in which the legislation was introduced to extend the ratings to statutes unmentioned by the raters we utilize.         "
"23","Some examples of the significance scores for individual public statutes drawn from the data provide perhaps a better understanding of the measure. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (HR 7152, PL 352) is the highest‐scoring civil rights enactment in the dataset. The highest‐scoring labor law is the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (HR 3020, PL 101). It is not surprising that the highest‐scoring monetary legislation is the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (HR 7837, PL 43). These are a few examples of individual laws that have high individual significance scores. As stated above, there is a significance score for each passed enactment. The individual‐level significance estimates make it possible to construct a measure of legislative accomplishment that can be used to study lawmaking longitudinally. The dependent variable(s) used here to study legislative accomplishment will now be explained in more detail."
"24","There are essentially two approaches that can be used to construct measures of legislative accomplishment from the significance data. First, it is possible to sum the significance scores for all legislation or subsets of legislation. For example, Congress passed 37,767 laws during the period from 1877 to 1994. It is possible to sum the significance score of each law by Congress and produce a Congress‐by‐Congress measure of overall legislative accomplishment. It is also possible to break down such a measure by policy issue area. For example, between 1877 and 1994 Congress enacted 5,491 statutes that have been classified as international affairs issues. These statutes could be summed Congress by Congress to construct an overall measure of legislative accomplishment for international affairs. An alternative approach to summing individual significance scores is to produce a count measure of legislative accomplishment. This measure is a simple count of laws passed by Congress, which can also be broken down into policy issue areas (e.g., only international affairs laws). This is the approach taken in this study.16"
"25","For the purposes of this study, data using two different thresholds of significance are analyzed. The highest threshold uses the top 500 enactments. A measure of the top 500 enactments is nearly equivalent to the list of landmark enactments produced by David Mayhew in Divided We Govern (1991), except that this measure covers an additional 35 Congresses (over 70 years). The second threshold uses the top 3,500 enactments.17 This threshold captures landmarks for very important legislation. Perhaps it would be useful to describe at least one of these series, preferably the top 500, because readers are more familiar with landmark legislation. The top 500 measure is simply made up of the 500 highest‐scoring public laws enacted between 1877 and 1994 according to significance scores. Each Congress is a count of how many of these 500 laws were enacted during that Congress. The range of this measure varies from 0 to 29 enactments. The highlights of the top 500 significant enactments passed include the 73rd (1933–34) Congress, President Roosevelt's first, which ushered in the New Deal with a series high of 29 major enactments. The next highest Congress is President Johnson's 89th (1965–66), which passed 19 major enactments. Four Congresses have the negative distinction of passing no enactments from the top 500 list: the 46th (1879–81), 54th 1895–97), 58th (1903–05), and 100th (1987–88).         "
"26","Before conducting the multivariate analysis that examines the determinants of lawmaking, the data are descriptively examined. Table 2 provides the counts of public enactments by Tier 1 issue categories for the top 500 and 3,500 enactments. If the correlations between Sovereignty, Organization and Scope, International Affairs, and Domestic Affairs are assessed for the top 3,500 enactments, correlations that range from −.13 to .67 are observed. Here Sovereignty is correlated at −.13 with Sovereignty, at .05 with International Affairs, and 0 with Domestic Affairs. The highest correlation of .67 is between International and Domestic Affairs. Organization and Scope is correlated with International and Domestic Affairs at the .40 and .45 levels. The correlations of the measures become even weaker when shifted to a threshold of the top 500. The notable change observed when shifting thresholds from the top 3,500 to the top 500 enactments is between International and Domestic Affairs. This correlation drops to .12, and no other individual policy‐specific correlation is higher than .23.            "
"27","Thus far, through simple correlations, it has been shown that when the count measure of legislative accomplishment is disaggregated, individual policy‐specific measures behave in very different ways. This suggests that these policy‐specific measures of legislative accomplishment are not the same."
"28","The empirical core of this study—the multivariate analysis—aims to determine whether pooling policies (using an overall aggregate measure of all legislation) is potentially inappropriate. In other words, when the determinants of lawmaking are analyzed, are important relationships masked or dampened when policy types are pooled instead of disaggregated?"
"29","Although the purpose of this section is to demonstrate quantitatively how substance matters for lawmaking, it is important to recognize that even with the immense data collection and measurement issues dealt with in constructing this unique measure of legislative accomplishment, only 59 (Congresses) observations can be in the dataset. Consequently, not every possible explanation and related covariate are included in the model because this would lead quickly to a saturated specification and no degree of freedom. Instead, a parsimonious specification that includes the most common and important covariates found in the literature has been forwarded. It can then be determined whether policy substance matters by comparing the results from the pooled and nonpooled dependent variables. Policy substance provides no empirical leverage for understanding lawmaking if the relationships are reasonably steady across policies (and levels of significance)."
"30","Because the dependent variable(s) analyzed are counts of significant enactments, the relationship is modeled using a negative binomial regression model. When appropriate, a simple poisson process is substituted for the negative binomial model. Seven types of covariates are included in the models. These include measures to capture polarization, divided government, the majority party advantage, start‐of‐term effects, war, secular trends via a time trend, and other time/regime effects. Others have hypothesized that all of these covariates are important to lawmaking. The covariates are briefly described below."
"31"," Polarization is measured as the distance between the Democratic and Republican party median of the roll‐call‐based DW‐NOMINATE scores (McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006). The measure of polarization used here is often viewed as a proxy for the gridlock interval proposed by the pivotal politics model of Krehbiel (1998) and Brady and Volden (1998). Including this variable is important because elite polarization in Congress might matter for some policy issues but not others. For example, polarization might not matter for issues that are primarily distributive in nature. Additionally, issues that are regionally based might not be influenced by interparty conflict.            "
"32"," Divided Government is an indicator for whether the same party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency. The idea is that split control of government reduces the likelihood of enacting legislation (Mayhew 1991).            "
"33"," Start‐of‐Term is an indicator variable for the first Congress of each presidential term. The variable takes a value of “1” for every other Congress. Mayhew (1991) includes this as a control, with “the idea that more laws are likely to pass during the first half of a four‐year presidential term than during the second half” (Mayhew 1991, 177). Krehbiel elaborates on Mayhew's idea about how this change is often related to changes in the width of the gridlock interval (Krehbiel 1998).            "
"34"," Majority party advantage is the difference in size between the majority and minority party in the House. This measure reflects the amount of resources that a party may have at its disposal. This variable might be interpreted as a proxy for public sentiment. In other words, the variable captures how strongly the country is behind the majority party.            "
"35"," Wars attempts to capture the impact of exogenous shocks to the legislative environment. Only “hot” wars are included in this variable (Mayhew 2005a). The variable is an indicator variable and includes several wars: Spanish‐American War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Gulf War. Vietnam is separated out from the rest of the series because of a number of coincident changes in the environment over the period. Consequently, there are two war‐related variables—one indicator variable that includes all wars except Vietnam and a separate indicator variable for Vietnam. War is expected to significantly increase the productivity of Foreign Affairs legislation, but the expectation of this variable for domestic politics is somewhat unclear. Domestic affairs related to the war effort might be expected to increase, but there might be no effect or a decrease in other types of laws due to a crowding out effect. There is very little theoretical or empirical work on the subject, so although war is likely to affect policy production, there is currently no good understanding of how it should do so.            "
"36"," Time is included to account for systematic changes in the environment that are not captured by the included covariates. Including this variable accounts for any trends in the country over the period. For example, a trend would control for the rise of the administrative state and/or the possibility that as Congress passes additional landmark laws, it creates the opportunity for seriously amending them later on. Interpreting precisely what the trend captures is clearly impossible, but it is nonetheless an important control because it captures the changing institutional and societal environment in which Congress operates across the time period.18"
"37"," Period indicators are also included in the specification. The three moments identified are 1917, 1946, and 1970. All three moments, which are captured by indicator variables, coincide with major institutional change within Congress. In 1917, Rule 22 was established in the Senate (a few Congresses after the 17th Amendment was ratified to establish the direct election of senators). This period is considered to be significant for theoretical work on lawmaking (e.g., Krehbiel's pivotal politics models is designed for the post‐1917 cloture rule world). The year 1946 is associated with the passage of the Legislative Reform Act of 1946 that changed the internal organization of congress by drastically reducing the number of committees and centralizing their policy jurisdictions. This change led to a stronger committee system that was better able to operate independently of the executive branch. A post‐1970 indicator was also included and serves as a proxy for an era of congressional reform beginning in 1970 (see Adler 2002).19"
"38"," Tables 3A and 3B report the coefficient results for models for the top 500 and 3,500 significant enactments and by Tier 1 policy issue areas. As stated earlier, because the variable of interest is the number of enacted public statutes, the relationship is modeled using a negative binomial model, except where there is no evidence of overdispersion where a poisson regression is substituted. A number of different findings concerning policy substance emerge to provide suspicion that pooling all policy types together is not always a good idea.            "
"39","An assessment of the measures based on the effects on the top 500 significant enactments permits the observation that political polarization depresses lawmaking activity at a significant level for all legislation, but this result is being driven by Domestic Affairs and Organization and Scope legislation. This is so because the sign of the polarization coefficient is in the incorrect direction for Sovereignty policy and not significant for Foreign Affairs. Qualitative case work and quantitative work on coalition composition for Sovereignty bills suggest that the politics of this type of policy often involve intraparty conflict. This conflict is oftentimes regionally based, usually pitting Southern versus Northern Democrats, and for the early part of the twentieth century involving splits within the Republican Party."
"40","Another finding is that the War variable is only significant for Foreign Affairs issues. Consequently, this is a clear instance in which pooling of all Tier 1 categories is highly consequential, because War would not significantly affect policy if the categories were not disaggregated. The strength of the majority party in the House is statistically significant for Organization and Scope as well as Domestic Affairs, but the sign is nonintuitively negative for Organization and Scope legislation."
"41","When the top 3,500 enactments are considered, similar differences can be observed by policy substance. The polarization variable is not significant for the top 3,500 measure (all legislation), but is significant and negative for Domestic Affairs. Polarization is also significant, but positive, for the Sovereignty measure (after controlling for a time trend as well as regime variables). War is significant for only Foreign Affairs legislation, and the Post‐1917 indicator variable is significant for Domestic Affairs (suggesting that World War I and/or the changes in the Senate, such as direct election and the formalization of cloture via Rule 22, mattered)."
"42","Focusing on the effects of three variables—polarization, start of term, and war—the models will now be substantively assessed. These three variables were chosen as examples to illustrate how policy substance matters for a number of determinants of lawmaking that are considered important by many scholars. Because the model(s) is nonlinear, the effect of a one standard deviation change in the polarization variable is computed, holding continuous variables at their mean and indicator variables at 0. The effect for two other indicator variables—start of term and war—is also calculated. Here all continuous measures are held at their mean and other indicator variables at 0. The results are found in Tables 4A and 4B. The second column in these tables predicts the number of statutes expected if all continuous variables were held at their mean and all indicator variables at 0. The third column of Tables 4A and 4B reports how increasing polarization by one standard deviation affects the number of statutes expected, how changing the start of term indicator to 1 affects the number of statutes expected, and how changing the war indicator to 1 affects the expected number of statutes.            "
"43"," Table 4A shows how the expected number of laws changes as key determinants are varied. For example, 6.67 top 500 laws would be expected with the mean amount of political polarization and all other continuous variables set at their mean and all indicators set to zero. If political polarization is increased by one standard deviation, lawmaking productivity drops by 1.42 laws (over 20%). There is a similar relationship, although the percentage drop is smaller, when all legislation from the top 3,500 count variable in Table 4A is considered.            "
"44","An analysis of lawmaking by policy substance for the top 500 and top 3,500 statutes results in a much different conclusion. First, polarization has little, if no effect on Foreign Affairs legislation. The most likely reason for this is that events make status quos extreme in foreign affairs legislation, and therefore polarization matters less here. A second strong finding is that when political polarization is increased by a standard deviation for Sovereignty policy, the expected number of laws goes up by .48, which is large given that under mean polarization levels only .85 such laws per Congress are expected. This change is more than a 50% increase. Consequently, these two findings show that polarization works in different ways across policy types. This suggests that pooling policy types provides an inaccurate portrait of exactly how polarization affects lawmaking."
"45","Among the indicator variables, the start‐of‐term variable has a very strong effect on lawmaking. The effect is somewhat consistent across all policy types and across both the top 500 and top 3,500 statutes. For all the top 500 statutes (all legislation), for a Congress with a mean level of polarization and majority party advantage, with no war, and all other indicator variables set to zero, 4.13 more laws were enacted during the first term. This is a dramatic 61.6% increase over a nonfirst‐term Congress. For the top 500 Domestic Affairs laws, there is a 2.07 increase—a 55% increase. There is a similar strong pull for the top 3,500 statutes, with an increase of 9.65 laws in the first term (a 23% increase). For start of term, findings show that effect varies a bit across policies. It is statistically significant for the top 500 statutes for All Legislation, International Relations, and Domestic Affairs laws, and for the top 3,500 statutes it is significant for All, Organization and Scope, and Domestic laws. Thus, even for an important determinant that has somewhat consistent effects, an interesting variation exists by policy issue areas, which deserves further exploration."
"46","Very little empirical work has studied the effect of war on lawmaking. David Mayhew's excellent review essay (2005a) nicely shows the costs of not considering war as an important factor/determinant in lawmaking. The empirical analysis here crudely measures war through an indicator variable, but nonetheless shows important variations in how war affects lawmaking. War has no effect on the pooled measures of the top 500 and top 3,500 statutes. War, it seems, does not affect lawmaking. However, when the policy is disaggregated, important patterns emerge. The coefficient for War is statistically significant for only Foreign Affairs legislation for both the top 500 and 3,500 statutes. In fact, the substantive effect is quite large. For the top 500 legislation, war increases the legislative productivity of foreign affairs policy by 1.19 laws, which represent a 95.2% increase. The increase of 4.76 laws or a 54% increase for the top 3,500 Foreign Affairs legislation is also quite dramatic. Equally interesting is the idea that War dampens legislative productivity (although the coefficient is not statistically significant) for Domestic Affairs and Organization and Scope for both the top 500 and 3,500 statutes.

"47","Clearly, it is the case that if one wishes to understand empirically how lawmaking operates, the idea that policy substance matters must be taken seriously. The analyses here have shown that pooling all legislation sometimes provides incorrect and inaccurate portraits of how key determinants of lawmaking work. It was not the point of this section to fully understand these puzzles, but rather to identify them by showing how disaggregating policy and constructing appropriate, policy‐specific measures of legislative accomplishment can oftentimes provide a better empirical understanding of lawmaking."
"48","This study has demonstrated that reviving policy issue substance is necessary for us to better understand legislative accomplishment. Specifically, the article provides empirical evidence that questions the benefits of pooling legislation when such aggregation often obscures empirical findings related to understanding the mechanisms of lawmaking. Theoretical reasons have been presented that explain why policy issue substance is important. In principle, most scholars of American politics would probably agree with the statement that policy substance matters. This essay has attempted to explain and explore how policy substance might matter in specific and empirically measurable ways. In other words, new data were introduced that will allow us to gain a much better empirical understanding of how lawmaking behaves by issue area."
"49","Gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern policy making by issue area will help scholars build strong microfoundations for theoretical work. This article presents findings that hopefully will help in this effort and suggests that mechanisms do vary by policy issue area. For example, it was observed that political polarization does not appear to impact legislative productive in International Affairs issues, to the same extent as it does policies dealing directly with Sovereignty. This leads to the question of how the mechanisms vary by issue area. The article has suggested that for International Affairs issues, major events likely trump partisan conflict in determining legislative output in this specific area. In the case of Sovereignty issues, the finding that polarization likely leads to slight increases in accomplishment in this area is more puzzling. In examining how the policy issue influences politics within the realm of Sovereignty‐related issues, it is necessary to focus on how the microlevel behavior of members of Congress, including their personal preferences, party orientation, and constituency situation, under specific historical circumstances, influence this type of lawmaking (Katznelson and Lapinski 2006a, 2006b). In the case of Sovereignty policies, case work on individual bills suggests that these issues deal more with intraparty cleavages than across party differences. Much more work, however, is necessary to test the robustness of these preliminary findings. What is clear is that the politics of these types of policies seems quite different from other issue areas.         "
"50","While it is obviously the case that there is much work to be done to fully understand lawmaking in the United States, it is important to note that this topic need not be dominated by Congress scholars. For example, APD scholars can also contribute to this enterprise. APD research insists on certain principles when explaining events: historical specificity and a thick specification of actors and preferences placed inside determinate situations. This approach can certainly help unpack the mechanisms of lawmaking and create real synergy between APD and Congress scholars.20 Studying the substance of lawmaking also will likely help advance APD's research program on liberalism, periodization, state building, and policy feedback, which has curiously omitted Congress from serious consideration.         "
"51","Understanding the mechanisms of lawmaking, and specifically, how lawmaking varies by specific issue areas, is necessary for the study of issue substance to thrive. A lack of attention to mechanism is what doomed earlier work on policy issue substance. This essay has hopefully provided a start in helping to answer the mechanism‐rich question posed by Theodore Lowi over 40 years ago: how are political relationships determined by the specific policy at stake? It is now time to fully return to this question and make real progress in answering it."
