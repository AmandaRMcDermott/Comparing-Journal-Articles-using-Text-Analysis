"1","Despite clear humanitarian dimensions, refugee crises are not merely humanitarian disasters but have real security implications for states. I argue that refugee migration increases both (1) the likelihood that receiving states will mobilize forces against the sender, and (2) the likelihood that sending states will initiate disputes against the host. Mass, disorderly migration poses significant burdens on receiving states and refugee‐generating conflicts frequently extend across territorial boundaries."
"2","Before proceeding, it is useful to note the scale and extent of global refugee migration. Figure 1 displays the global trend in the number of refugees, 1961–2002. The number of refugees worldwide rose steadily during the Cold War—reflecting the rise in the number of armed conflicts during that period (see Gleditsch et al. 2002)—and peaked at roughly 18 million in the early 1990s. The number of conflicts and the number of refugees have been declining since the end of the Cold War as the superpowers were no longer funding many insurgencies and were more willing to approve peacekeeping operations. At its peak, the number of refugees exceeded the population of the Netherlands, and if “refugees” were a single country, it would be the 59th most populous state in the world. Yet, refugees are not evenly distributed across states. Some countries such as Iran, Pakistan, and Jordan hosted over 1 million refugees each; refugee populations were also quite large in some of the least developed countries such as Tanzania, Zaire, and Malawi.

"5","The terms “internal,”“domestic,” and “civil” conflict imply that violent interactions between states and dissidents, and the negative consequences of war and human rights violations, are contained within the state. Rather than treating states as independent units, it may be more appropriate to view them as interconnected in dense networks of social interactions where processes within one state have significant repercussions for other states in the region and elsewhere (Balch‐Lindsay and Enterline 2000; Gleditsch 2002a; Simmons, Dobbin, and Garrett 2006). The human costs of civil war and state persecution may not be entirely borne by the country itself, but may create significant externalities, or spillover effects, for others.            "
"6","Refugees may contribute to several types of negative externalities.1 First, refugee migration can inflict an economic burden on host countries. Although some international aid may be available, refugee hosts—including some of the world's poorest nations—often bear much of the cost of maintaining refugees. Refugees require humanitarian assistance and public services supplied by their hosts and may compete with locals for jobs and scarce resources, bringing them into conflict with domestic actors (Martin 2005). Compared to voluntary labor migrants, refugees are also less likely to contribute to productive economic activity in their hosts (Cortes 2004). As opposed to economic migrants, refugees are not selected for their skills, may have suffered war trauma making employment difficult, and may have lost their assets prior to flight. In a related study, Murdoch and Sandler (2004) find that civil wars in one country have a significant negative impact on GDP growth in neighboring states; they propose population migration as a potential causal factor, but do not test this explicitly.            "
"7","Second, refugees may entail negative public health consequences for their host countries. Refugee camps are often crowded and unsanitary, creating conditions ripe for infectious disease; refugee inflows stretch domestic medical resources thin; they divert health resources away from normal care; and refugees may have specific health needs related to war trauma that overwhelm the host. A growing body of empirical research finds that civil wars significantly increase the rate of morbidity and mortality in the affected country itself as well as in neighboring states (Ghobarah, Huth, and Russett 2003). Studies have shown that refugee camps have contributed to the spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, cholera, and diarrhea, among other infectious diseases (Collier et al. 2003; Rowland and Nosten 2001; Toole and Waldman 1997).            "
"8","Third, refugees may upset the ethnic balance in their host countries through what may be thought of as a “demographic” externality. Refugees and immigrants may be seen as unwelcome foreigners and a cultural “threat” to the host community (Weiner 1978, 1992). Ethnic tensions may become especially pronounced when refugees possess ethnic ties with groups already present in the host society. In countries where ethnic cleavages are deeply entrenched, large, unexpected migrant inflows may tilt the delicate ethnic balance in the host society and spark intergroup conflict. As Brown writes, “The sudden influx of refugees can aggravate ethnic problems and further complicate the picture by changing the domestic balance of power” (1996, 576). Lake and Rothchild (1998, 25) point to similar dynamics in their discussion of the diffusion of ethnic conflict across states.            "
"9","Finally, refugee flows may directly affect the security and stability of the host country by contributing to organized armed conflict on the host's territory. Salehyan and Gleditsch (2006) find that refugee inflows from neighboring states significantly increase the risk of civil war. Along with the refugees themselves, foreign fighters, arms, and ideologies that contribute to violence may stream across the border. “Refugee warrior” communities (see Lischer 2005; Salehyan 2007; Zolberg, Suhrke, and Aguayo 1989) can expand rebel networks to encompass the host state when militants establish bases on external territory and when they form social ties with domestic opposition groups of a similar ethnicity or political orientation. Therefore, at the extreme, refugee inflows may lead to violent turmoil on the host country's territory. For instance, Jordan was involved in a bloody armed conflict in 1970 when it moved to expel Palestine Liberation Organization fighters operating within refugee camps on its soil.            "
"10","These spillovers can seriously jeopardize interstate relations. Receiving countries may confront the sender to compel them to end civil wars and human rights violations that produce refugee burdens. Such bargains share similarities with conflicts over externalities in the economic realm (see Coase 1960). As the “Coase Theorem” suggests, those that suffer a negative externality will be willing to pay some cost to prevent its production at the source. Thus, negative externalities become part of the bargain between states. Receiving countries can issue threats and warnings to the sending state, demanding a change in that state's domestic behavior. They may also close border crossings and move troops near the international boundary—military operations and force deployment near the border may be seen as provocative. In some cases, they may become willing to prevent negative externalities through military invasions of the source state.            "
"11","The use of force may not be a forgone conclusion. The bargaining‐and‐war perspective (see, e.g., Fearon 1995; Powell 1999; Slantchev 2003; Wagner 2000) emphasizes that war results when parties cannot agree on an acceptable settlement. This framework was developed in the context of dyadic disputes over the distribution of some good such as territory. Conflicts about refugee flows resulting from civil wars and human rights violations are different from bargains over divisible goods because the political processes generating forced migration are a function of internal unrest and introduce a third actor, the domestic opposition (see Schultz 2007 for a related discussion). Yet, as the bargaining framework suggests, agreements may be difficult to reach when states cannot credibly commit to a deal. The refugee‐receiving country may demand that the sending state cease attacks on rebels and dissidents—and perhaps accommodate the opposition—in order to stem the flow of refugees across the border. Credible promises to do so are difficult to secure because refraining from such repressive policies threatens the very survival of the regime and the benefits of rule. The sending state may view the risk of external attacks to be acceptable given the benefits it hopes to achieve by continuing crackdowns against domestic opponents; or, it may simply be unable to contain domestic violence and control rebel actors. In addition, Jenne (2007) and Thyne (2006) argue that external signals in support of rebel aims and threats of intervention often exacerbate domestic conflict by emboldening the opposition and leading them to make more extreme demands (see also Crawford and Kuperman 2006).            "
"12","Military invasions in Haiti and Kosovo were partly motivated by the desire to stem further refugee migration. In a televised address shortly before the U.S. operation in Haiti in 1994, President Clinton remarked: “Today, more than 14,000 refugees are living at our naval base in Guantanamo. The American people have already expended almost $200 million to support them… We will continue to face the threat of a mass exodus of refugees and its constant threat to stability in our region and control of our borders.”2 In these cases, the refugee‐sending country could not commit to ending repressive policies because doing so would threaten the regime. This discussion leads to a first hypothesis:            "
"13","                              "
"14","Refugee migration between a dyad will increase the probability that the receiving country will initiate a militarized interstate dispute (MID) against the sending country."
"15","All forms of international migration underscore the frequent incongruence between the boundaries of the state and its citizenry (Fox 2005; Guarnizo, Portes, and Haller 2003; Shain 1989; Shain and Barth 2003; Waldinger and Fitzgerald 2004). States are formally sovereign over a given territory and claim to govern the affairs of their citizens; yet, migration implies that not all citizens of the state are physically present within its territorial jurisdiction. The state's laws and regulatory capabilities do not reach citizens beyond its geographic domain. But when migrants leave the state, attachments to the homeland and activism in home‐country politics rarely end at the border, and may persist for generations (Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Lyon and Ucarer 2001; Shain and Barth 2003; Sheffer 2003; Tatla 1999). Therefore, interactions between the state and the “polity” often extend beyond formal/legal state boundaries and give rise to transnational social processes involving migrant diasporas.            "
"16","In the case of refugee migration, such flows threaten to extend violence and opposition activities across national boundaries. Migrants flee civil war and state persecution for safety in countries of asylum, and most of the world's refugees flee to areas in close proximity to their country of origin. However, particularly when borders are porous, they are not necessarily immune from continued attacks by the state. Governments may pursue their ethnic and political rivals across the border, and such attacks necessarily violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of others. States will object to military incursions on their soil, particularly if local populations also become caught up in cross‐border attacks. No state welcomes foreign incursions and military violations of its sovereignty, even though the physical ability to firmly control borders may be lacking (Andreas 2003; Herbst 1989; Jackson 1987).            "
"17","Refugees may not be passive actors, however. While the vast majority of refugees never directly participate in violence, rather than being unfortunate victims of war, some have mobilized into insurgent organizations and refugee camps often serve a double purpose as sanctuaries for militant groups (Lischer 2005; Salehyan 2007; Stedman and Tanner 2003; Zolberg, Suhrke, and Aguayo 1989). Recruitment into a rebel organization may provide refugees a better alternative to life in a camp and provide individuals a sense of purpose. These “refugee warrior” communities are facilitated by hosts that are too weak to prevent the militarization of camps or by hosts that actively encourage dissident activities as a way to undermine their international rivals. Thus, violence between the country of origin and refugee communities may not be one‐sided, but takes the form of transnational civil wars that span international boundaries. Sending states may launch attacks on their neighbor's territory in order to strike at external rebel bases and to clear refugee camps close to the border; these attacks may also jeopardize the safety of local populations in the neighbor.            "
"18","More directly, the sending state may accuse the host country of harboring dissidents and political opponents. Accepting refugees is more than a humanitarian act, but implicates the sender in committing human rights violations, jeopardizing bilateral relations (Rosenblum and Salehyan 2004). Refugee‐sending states may directly attack the host state in retaliation for protecting their political opponents and for encouraging refugee militarization. Thus, support for militant activities and the existence of external rebel bases among refugee communities are especially likely to escalate into international hostilities (Salehyan 2008).            "
"19","As before, bargaining and negotiations may be difficult in these circumstances. Cross‐border strikes against external rebel bases and “hot pursuit” raids may jeopardize bilateral relations, but the costs of confrontation with the host state may be outweighed by the tactical need to strike rebel sanctuaries. Moreover, disputes about alleged foreign support for rebel organizations are difficult to resolve through bargaining because it may be difficult for the host state to credibly commit to reversing its policies (see Bapat 2006; Schultz 2007). In many instances, host countries deny supporting rebels despite home country allegations, and it is difficult to prove that the state is not engaging in a pernicious policy; it is hard to prove a negative fact. Verifying compliance with demands to discontinue rebel support is difficult since rebel assistance may continue covertly. Moreover, states supporting rebel organizations may find that the benefits of promoting instability in neighbors outweigh the risk of retaliatory strikes. Finally, weak hosts may find it difficult to comply with demands to evict rebel organizations because it is too costly and dangerous to forcibly move against such groups.            "
"20","This discussion suggests that refugee origin states may launch militarized disputes against refugee hosts. Such dynamics have recently been apparent during the refugee crisis in Darfur. Refugees from the Sudanese region of Darfur have fled to eastern Chad and have been attacked by government forces alongside their paramilitary allies seeking to eliminate ethno‐political rivals.3 Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 was in large part motivated by the desire to clear refugee camps of Palestine Liberation Organization forces. This resulted in a military occupation of southern Lebanon for two decades. This leads to a second hypothesis:            "
"21","                              "
"22","Refugee migration between a dyad will increase the probability that the sending country will initiate a militarized interstate dispute (MID) against the receiving country."
"23","Before proceeding to the large‐N quantitative analysis, this section presents a pair of illustrative cases that will help to underscore the theorized causal connections between refugees and international conflict. Both refugee‐receiving states and refugee‐sending states may initiate militarized actions. The Indian invasion of Bangladesh (East Pakistan) in 1971 demonstrates how concerns over refugee burdens can elicit a forceful response. Clearly, India and Pakistan had an enduring international rivalry since independence/partition, but the revolt in East Pakistan and the subsequent refugee exodus provided the spark that led to the escalation of conflict. Rwanda's invasion of Zaire offers a case where a government invades a neighboring state in order to attack refugee encampments and flush out militants among them. Along with backing rebel forces against Mobutu Sese Seko in 1996, the Rwandan armed forces attacked refugee camps in Eastern Zaire."
"24","The modern‐day state of Bangladesh seceded from Pakistan in 1971 following years of perceived second‐class status. Provincial elections in 1970 brought the pro‐independence Awami Lague to power in East Pakistan, and Bengali nationalists began to more vocally advocate for secession by taking to the streets. In March of 1971, the government of Pakistan, seeking to restore law and order to the region, arrested leaders of the pro‐independence movement, including the popular leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Following the arrest, Bengali units in the Pakistani army revolted and, under the leadership of Ziaur Rahman, declared the independence of Bangladesh on March 26. This led to open clashes between the Pakistani Army and a new rebel force, known as the Mukti Bahini (Sisson and Rose 1990).            "
"25","The fighting in Bangladesh led to the largest ever outpouring of refugees. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 10 million Bangladeshis fled for India, at a rate of over 100,000 per day (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2000). These migrants fled to the conflict‐prone Indian regions of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura, where political control and relations with New Delhi were already strained. The refugee influx presented a severe financial and human toll on the Indian government and fell particularly hard on local populations in the border regions.            "
"26","India suffered several externalities as a direct result of the conflict in Bangladesh. The government estimated that the cost of caring for the refugees for a six‐month period was roughly $175 million. Although some international aid was offered, much of the cost fell on India itself; on October 22, the government imposed new taxes on rail and air travel, postage, and periodicals to cover the cost of the refugee flow.4 In addition, the refugee crisis led to a major outbreak of cholera in the camps, severely jeopardizing public health conditions (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2000, 64). One doctor in the region indicated that “… many of the refugee camps were flooded in ankle‐deep water and millions of people spent the night squatting in mud and slush. Sanitation is non‐existent and it is feared that the rain will soon spread cholera and other diseases throughout the region.”5 The refugee inflow also caused frictions with local populations as refugees sought work to supplement their rations (Sisson and Rose 1990, 180). According to one report, refugees “…living outside camps are being employed by landowners as farm laborers on wages much lower than those that must be paid to laborers from the locality… This is creating resentment among the local working force.”6"
"27","As Sisson and Rose (1990, 179–81) argue, the refugee influx severely disrupted local politics in affected regions. Relations between the Indian central government and West Bengal—where the Communist party was recently included in the regional governing coalition—had previously been tense, and the refugee crisis was a “major factor in India's decision to dismiss the West Bengali coalition government in mid 1971” (179). Regions in the north‐east were also seriously affected as ethnic minorities in Assam, Tripura, and elsewhere felt threatened by the influx of foreigners (Sisson and Rose 1990, 181; see also Weiner 1978). India called on the government of Pakistan to end the conflict and accept repatriation. In a letter to Pakistan issued on May 14, 1971, the Indian government declared, “This deliberate expulsion of such a large number of people from their homes has created a human problem of unparalleled magnitude which is capable of producing serious repercussions in the area, leading to a threat to peace in the region.”7 Yet Pakistan found it difficult to comply with Indian demands as recognizing the opposition and ending the imposed state of emergency would mean resigning itself to Bangladeshi independence. Relations between the two states became even more strained after Pakistan accused India of harboring Mukti Bahini militants and launched several counterinsurgency strikes in the border region.8"
"28","Fearing the prospect of a protracted rebellion and a long‐term refugee situation, on December 3, 1971, India sent an invasion force into Bangladesh in support of the independence movement. On December 16, Pakistan surrendered and Bangladesh won its independence. Anxious to ease the refugee burden, India then declared that all refugees must return to Bangladesh by the end of February 1972, and began to make the necessary preparations in conjunction with the UNHCR. Thus, although relations between India and Pakistan had long been tense, the influx of 10 million refugees from East Pakistan precipitated a major conflict between the two countries as India sought a solution to the refugee crisis. The refugee issue was certainly not the only reason for India's invasion, yet it was a major factor that contributed to the war and a trigger that prompted the Indian response."
"29","The Rwandan genocide in 1994 shocked the world for its level of brutality, but beyond the immediate human toll, it contributed to long‐term instability across the Great Lakes region of Africa. The Arusha accords signed between the Tutsi‐dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and the Hutu‐led government was viewed by some members of the Hutu elite as granting too much power to the RPF. Yet, before the accords could be implemented, Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was assassinated, providing the excuse Hutu extremists needed to begin a campaign of genocidal violence against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. To put an end to the genocide, the RPF reinvaded the country from their bases in Uganda and toppled the government in Kigali, which in turn prompted an enormous refugee exodus as millions of Hutus fled the country fearing RPF reprisals. This mass emigration was encouraged and orchestrated by the ex‐Rwandan Armed Forces (ex‐FAR) and the Interahamwe militias, who sought to establish a government‐in‐exile and regroup as a rebel force across the border (Lischer 2005).            "
"30","At the peak of the refugee crisis, Zaire and Tanzania hosted over 1 million Rwandan refugees each. As Lischer (2005) explains, while Tanzania took steps to prevent refugee militarization, Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko was neither willing nor able to prevent the ex‐FAR forces from taking control of the camps. This posed a humanitarian dilemma for aid agencies as the necessity of feeding and sheltering legitimate refugees was complicated by the fact that the camps were largely run by the perpetrators of the genocide (Gourevitch 1998; United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2000). Officials on the ground understood the gravity of the situation. Shahyar Khan, the UN Secretary General's representative to Rwanda, exclaimed, “we are sitting on a volcano… we must separate the wolves from the sheep.”9"
"31","From inside Zaire, the ex‐FAR/Interahamwe forces began to mobilize militarily, while gathering recruits and supplies among the refugees. News reports estimated that roughly 40,000 fighters were present in and around the Zairean town of Goma.10 Clashes between Hutus and local Zairean Tutsis ensued with the complicity and support of President Mobutu, whose forces were responsible for their own human rights violations against Tutsis. RPF leader Paul Kagame viewed the refugee situation in Eastern Zaire with alarm. As the international community was unwilling to demilitarize the camps, Rwanda decided to act on its own. As Kagame would relate in an interview, “We were ready to hit them… and handle three things: first to save the Banyamulenge (Zairean Tutsis) and not let them die… then to dismantle the camps, return the refugees to Rwanda, and destroy the ex‐FAR and militias; and third, to change the situation in Zaire” (quoted in Gourevitch 1998, 296).            "
"32","In October of 1996, Rwanda began its offensive against Mobutu. First, it armed Zairean Tutsis to fight back against Hutu refugee militants and Mobutu's forces. Second, it armed and supported Laurent Kabila and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo (ADFL) to lead the charge against Mobutu, and later, to govern the country. With support from Rwandan troops, rebels took over the town of Goma by November.11 The Zairean army quickly crumbled as the ADFL continued its offensive westward towards the capital; by May 1997, Kinshasa was taken by Kabila's forces. Meanwhile, Rwandan troops invaded eastern Zaire to clear the refugee camps; most of the refugees had been moved to the Mugunga camp, which Rwandan forces began to dismantle. The Rwandan army began to fire upon the refugees in order to force people back into Rwanda and worked to cut off humanitarian aid and disperse the ex‐FAR militants (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2000; chap. 10). With food aid cut off, the refugees had no choice but to return to Rwanda. By mid‐November, the largest camps had been cleared and over 700,000 refugees returned home.12 As UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata commented, “The link between refugee problems and peace and security is perhaps nowhere more evident than in the Great Lakes region in Africa” (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2000, 262).            "
"33","Thus, the refugee crisis was not simply a humanitarian issue, but spread conflict between the Rwandan government and armed dissidents into neighboring states. It led to both instability in Zaire (see Lischer 2005; Salehyan and Gleditsch 2006) and a military invasion by Rwanda to attack the refugee camps, combat ex‐FAR militants, and retaliate against Mobutu for his support. Yet, the 1996–97 Rwandan invasion of Zaire would not be the first such attack. Kabila would later turn on his former patron and begin to support Hutu refugee warriors, reorganized under the banner of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). Rwanda again sent in troops in 1998 to attack the FDLR and Hutu refugees; yet this second invasion was not successful in toppling the government in Kinshasa and prompted states across the region to intervene as well, sparking a war involving several African states (see Clark 2002).            "
"34","To ascertain whether or not these cases reflect broader empirical patterns, I conduct a time‐series cross‐section probit analysis of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) spanning the period, 1955–2000.13 International conflict data come from the dyadic version of the MID dataset produced by Maoz (2005). MIDs are events that involve at least two states in which there was a threat, display, or use of military force; this variable is coded one for cases where there was a MID and zero otherwise. Because many pairs of states are unlikely to be involved in military conflicts with one another (e.g., Peru and Tanzania), following convention, I restrict the analysis to politically relevant dyads where the states are either contiguous or involve at least one major power.14 Also, as I am mainly interested in conflict onset, subsequent MID‐years after the first year are excluded from the analysis; this practice also excludes third states (or more) that join a MID after it begins.15 All regressions reported below involve directed‐dyads, where the dyad A‐B is also included as B‐A; this allows us to ascertain which state in the dyad initiates the MID. The dependent variable is coded one if the first state listed (the initiator) starts a MID against the second state (the target). If there was a MID in the A‐B dyad, the B‐A dyad is treated as missing.16"
"35","The main independent variable is the number of refugees in a dyad. These data come from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees17 (UNHCR) and is supplemented with data from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants for figures on Palestinian refugees.18 The data are given as annual dyads reporting the stock of refugees from the country of origin in the country of asylum in a given year, provided that there were at least 100 refugees.19 Thus, there are separate variables for the number of refugees in the initiator and the number of refugees from the initiator to test the hypotheses that both sending and receiving countries launch MIDs.20 The mean of the refugee variable (for nonzero observations) was 94,000; Pakistan hosted the largest number of refugees, with over 3.2 million Afghan refugees hosted in 1989. To deal with skewness and diminishing marginal effects, I use the natural log of refugees (in ‘000s) after adding one to the base. Finally, since international conflict may produce refugees, I use lagged rather than contemporaneous values of the independent variables. This approach is not without costs, as estimates will not reflect MIDs that occur during the first year of a refugee crisis.21 Yet, reverse causation is likely to be a bigger source of bias and so this conservative approach is preferred.         "
"36","In estimating these regressions, it is important to control for civil war within a state in the dyad. Since civil wars produce refugees and may also contribute to international conflict for reasons unrelated to forced migration (see Gleditsch, Salehyan, and Schultz 2008), omitting this variable may lead to biased estimates. In the models, I include separate dummy variables indicating whether the target or initiator had an internal armed conflict; the list of civil wars comes from the Uppsala University/Peace Research Institute of Oslo Armed Conflicts Dataset (Gleditsch et al. 2002) and includes both minor and major internal conflict.22"
"37","Other control variables include the liberal peace “triad” (Russett and Oneal 2001). First, I include information on regime type from the Polity IV dataset (Marshall and Jaggers 2005) to account for the well‐known democratic peace effect. I create dummy variables indicating whether the target, initiator, or both states were democratic as indicated by a Polity score of 6 or higher on the −10 to +10 Polity scale. Several cases in the Polity data have missing values indicating regime instability. Many of these cases of missing data stem from civil wars and/or regime upheavals, and so dropping them would not be appropriate. Instead of dropping cases or interpolating values, observations including transitional or interregnal polities are coded as “undemocratic” and receive a value of zero on the democracy indicator. In addition, I include a dichotomous variable coded one for cases of regime instability. Variables for instability in the target, initiator, and both are included.         "
"38","Second, I include a variable for trade dependence to account for the pacifying effect of economic ties. This is created by determining, for each state, the sum of imports plus exports from the other and dividing it by that state's GDP. Trade data are from Gleditsch (2002b) and GDP data come from Goldstein, Rivers, and Tomz (2007). Third, I include a variable for joint membership in intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). This is a count of IGOs of which both states in the dyad were members (Pevehouse, Nordstrom, and Warnke 2006).         "
"39","Other control variables include a dummy variable for territorial contiguity, which is coded one if the states are connected by land or separated by no more than 400 miles of water (Stinnett et al. 2002). Another dichotomous variable for colonial contiguity, taken from the Correlates of War (COW) data, is included and coded one if the states were contiguous through colonies or dependencies. Because power preponderance may deter hostilities, I also include data on relative capabilities, based on the COW project's Composite Index of National Capabilities. This is the initiator's capabilities over the total capabilities in the dyad. Finally, because allied states may be less likely to fight one another, I include a control variable for the similarity of the two states' alliance portfolios using the weighted S‐score developed by Signorino and Ritter (1999).23"
"40","In estimating these models, I include a count of years since the last MID in the dyad (or independence) to account for possible duration dependence in the data, along with a cubic spline with three knots (see Beck, Katz, and Tucker 1998). Also, because the dyadic observations are not independent of one another, I employ robust standard errors clustered on the dyad. Finally, all of the independent variables are lagged one year to limit biases caused by potential reverse causation, although results do not change significantly with contemporaneous variables.         "
"41","In addition to the main hypotheses about the conflict‐producing effects of refugee inflows and outflows, it may also be the case that given the presence of refugees, certain dyads are more conflict‐prone than others. The reasons for flight, the absorption capacity of the state, the ethnic makeup of the refugees and host society, and the availability of international assistance, among other factors, may explain why some dyads with refugees experience conflict while others do not. Unfortunately, the available data do not allow us to test all possible hypotheses about such effects.24 However, when sending as well as receiving refugees, I expect stronger countries to be more likely to launch attacks. Weak states are often unable to intervene to end forced migration from stronger countries, and instead must quietly suffer refugee burdens. In addition, weak states may not be able to pursue their own refugees across national boundaries when doing so risks a confrontation with a much more powerful state. I test these corollary hypotheses by interacting refugees to and from the initiator with the dyadic capabilities variable. In doing so, the capability share variable was mean‐centered in order to make the constituent coefficients more easily interpretable; in these models, the coefficient on refugees is interpreted as the marginal effect of refugees given mean levels of relative capabilities (i.e., near parity).         "
"42"," Table 1 presents the results of the probit regressions. Model 1 reports the results for the basic regressions while model 2 includes the interaction effects, testing the secondary hypotheses regarding relative power. Each model lists columns for the coefficient, robust standard errors, and p‐values of two‐tailed significance tests. To save on space, I will not discuss the control variables in depth here; most of the results confirm the findings of previous studies although shared IGO membership has an unexpected positive sign. Civil wars in the initiator and in the target both raise the probability of a MID (see Gleditsch, Salehyan, and Schultz 2008), while joint democracy reduces it.         "
"43","Turning to the variables of interest, model 1 provides evidence in support of both hypotheses. Refugees increase the probability that the host country will initiate a MID against the sending country; in addition, they raise the probability that the sending country will initiate a MID against the host. The size of both coefficients are similar and a Wald test of equivalence of coefficients fails to reject the null (χ2<.000); thus, there is little evidence that refugees from a country have a greater or lesser effect than refugees to a country. Model 2 includes the interaction terms between the initiator's share of total capabilities (mean‐centered) and each of the refugee variables. The coefficients indicate that relative strength exacerbates the effect of refugees. Stronger countries are more likely to attack weaker states, both when they send and when they receive refugees. The coefficients on refugees are statistically significant at mean capabilities, and taken together, the constituent coefficients pass tests of joint significance at the .05 level.         "
"44","Because probit coefficients are difficult to interpret, I compute predicted probabilities of conflict by setting a hypothetical baseline and varying the number of refugees and other variables of interest while holding other values constant based on estimates from model 1.25 These results are reported in Table 2. The baseline case is a contiguous, nondemocratic dyad, with no civil wars; neither is transitional, and all other values are set at their means; moreover, there are no refugees in this hypothetical case. The predicted probability of such a dyad experiencing a MID is approximately 1.2%. I then increase the refugee stock in the initiator to 100,000 refugees (in logged terms), which is roughly the mean refugee stock for all nonzero observations. Such an increase raises the predicted probability of a MID initiation to 2.3%; while this may be a low absolute probability, it represents a 96.55% increase in probabilities over the baseline case. A similar increase in the refugee stock from a country raises the predicted probability of a dispute by over 90%. By comparison, a civil war in the initiator raises the probability of a conflict by almost 78%, while a civil war in the target raises the probability by 40.46%. The pacifying effect of joint democracy reduces the estimated probability of a MID by nearly 53%. Clearly, in many cases refugee flows, authoritarianism, and civil wars coincide with one another and so these effects compound one another. Thus, in statistical and substantive terms, the effects of the dyadic refugee variables are quite large, confirming the hypotheses.         "
"45","Using a contour plot, Figure 2 graphically displays the substantive effects of the interaction between refugees and capabilities, given refugees to and from the initiator. Curves closer together indicate a sharper increase in predicted probabilities while the curvature of the lines displays the interaction. These images display roughly similar plots, although with somewhat stronger effects for refugees from the target to the initiator.         "

"47","This article has argued that refugee migration may spark conflicts between sending and receiving states. While migration scholars have suggested possible links between refugee flows and international tensions, such dynamics have been largely ignored in the extensive literature on the causes of war and interstate disputes. Yet, as suggested by Gleditsch, Salehyan, and Schultz (2008), civil unrest can also lead to conflicts between states. This article looks at one such connection and finds that both refugee‐sending and refugee‐receiving states are more likely to initiate militarized disputes. More generally, the issues and actors in civil wars frequently span national boundaries and become part of a regional security nexus, blurring firm distinctions between domestic and international conflict.         "
"48","Research on linkages between civil and international wars also promises to significantly expand our understanding of conflict bargaining. Triangular negotiations involving the state, dissident groups, and foreign powers are evident in many conflicts and are a clear next step in work on bargaining and war. First, as a “nested” analysis suggests, conflicts at the domestic level may impede successful bargaining at the international level. Inability or unwillingness to accommodate domestic opposition groups often make it difficult for states to find solutions to their international disputes. Second, principal‐agent problems may be apparent when states delegate conflict to rebel organizations rather than fight directly. Third, credible, verifiable promises to end rebel patronage may be difficult when such support continues covertly. Finally, applying a “Coasian” bargaining framework to the spillover effects of civil war can yield insights into the conditions under which states will work to stem internal conflicts."
"49","This article also has important normative and policy implications. Protecting vulnerable populations from persecution and abuse should be of paramount importance and efforts to use refugees as political pawns should be resisted. It is important to note that while refugee flows may raise the probability of international conflict, not all refugee crises lead to an escalation of violence, and future research should take into account how policy responses can mitigate potential security risks. The international community has tended to respond to refugee disasters in largely humanitarian terms, yet greater attention to the security needs of states and the refugees themselves is needed (Lischer 2005). Rather than reacting to refugee crises, preventative measures to keep domestic political unrest from escalating to civil war, ethnic cleansing, and genocide should be emphasized and promoted. Strengthening regional conflict management institutions such as the African Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe can help.         "
"50","Many contemporary conflicts, particularly those in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Sudan, have generated substantial refugee flows. Syria and Jordan, for instance, have accepted hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees, placing strains on their economies, social services, and internal stability. Afghanistan and Sudan have witnessed the transnational spread of civil war and the escalation of interstate disputes with neighbors. Yet, powerful countries—most notably the United States—have been reluctant to resettle refugees from these conflicts, even though this could relieve the burden on regional hosts. This significantly contrasts with the approach taken after the Vietnam War, for example, when large numbers of refugees were resettled as a way to prevent regional destabilization. Similar resettlement efforts could significantly improve economic and security conditions in these volatile regions as well. Thus, appreciating the complex relationship between forced migration and conflict can not only improve academic research, but also yield improved policy outcomes."
