"1","I consider a society consisting of a collection of groups that are differentiated solely on the basis of their respective sizes and the common preferences of their members. The set of groups is G, with  and , and with each group consisting of  individuals (“members of g”). The size of each group is relevant because I will assume that information is dispersed throughout the population, and therefore, that larger groups are privy to more information than smaller groups. It is important to note that throughout I will conceive of “a group” as a unitary actor whose informedness is proportionate to its size. The equilibria that this assumption generates are consistent with equilibria of a modified game in which information is completely decentralized and the individual group members are the actors. This game is briefly presented and discussed in Section 7.3 of the Online Appendix.11"
"2","Group preferences are represented by a vector of biases, , which are common knowledge as are the number of individuals in each group, . A group's bias will affect its payoff from both its own members' activities and the activities undertaken by the members of the groups it has chosen to associate with. Every group member undertakes an activity , and a member of g's payoff to a particular activity y is:            "
"3","In the following sections, I describe the three types of decisions that each group can make: an association decision, a message, and an activity. While I assume that each group holds  signals, and thus (implicitly), that individuals have communicated truthfully with members of their own group, groups may also choose to associate with “society at large” prior to realizing their own signals. A choice to associate with the larger society implies that the group agrees to both participate in a process of public communication with all other groups that have similarly chosen to associate with society at large, and to receive payoffs that are dependent on the actions of the groups in the association. In essence, the groups that choose to associate are choosing to form an organization with each other.            "
"4","As noted above, each group faces a trade‐off when choosing whether or not to associate. On the one hand, members of the group could choose to disassociate from the whole, and to receive a payoff that is dependent on only the activities of the group members and the information that that subset of individuals could provide. On the other, if the group chooses to associate with society at large then members can, potentially, reap the informational benefits that the larger pool of signals may afford. However, association comes at the cost of pooling sovereignty by incurring a payoff that is dependent on the actions of all members of the association. Thus, each member of an association incurs a negative externality associated with the actions of others who have similarly chosen to associate, but who hold different preferences."
"5","Leaving aside the role of communication for the moment, social outcomes are captured via a decision that every group g makes over its choice of an activity,  with . If a group chooses association, its members receive a payoff that is dependent on the activities of all members of the association. In this payoff, the activity of group h in association R is weighted by the exogenous term  by each member of the association. For any ,  captures the relative influence of h's decision within the association. These α terms could, for example, be proportional to the population of each group within the association, proportional to the wealth of the groups or something else entirely. For clarity, in what follows, I assume that  for all associations R. However, this assumption does not affect any results; it may be of interest to consider situations in which  is greater or lesser than 1, which would correspond, respectively, to associations possessing economies or diseconomies of scale. A natural “power sharing” interpretation of  is as a vector of probabilities representing the likelihood group h in association R will set policy for the association.            "
"6","It follows that the payoff to group g from association with others in R is               "
"7","If group g chooses exit, then its payoff is solely dependent on its own choice of activity,  so that               "
"8","To summarize, groups make three types of choices. First, each group makes an association decision  denoting association or exit, respectively. Second, if choosing association, each group picks a message to be sent to the other groups in the association, , communicating the sum of positive signals claimed to have been received by the group.12 After these messages are communicated to the association, each group chooses an activity, .            "
"9","This section presents an informal description of the equilibria of the game, with all formal definitions relegated to the Appendix. I am interested in characterizing the types of associations that can form, and group behavior within those associations, when communication and association decisions are strategic. Groups' actions are decomposed into two parts: a decision to associate, and if associating, a message to communicate to the association. For the sake of parsimony, and to clarify the arguments I wish to make, I focus on communication strategies within the messaging subgame for the association that are either separating or pooling.13 Thus, each group either reveals all of its information to the association or reveals no information. This focus simplifies the analysis by enabling us to consider only three actions taken by groups in equilibrium, with these actions implicitly capturing the group's association decision, messaging strategy and policy choice. Groups can either exit, or associate and communicate truthfully, or associate and babble. Equilibria can therefore be characterized by considering divisions of G into three possibly empty and mutually disjoint sets: E, D, and X, where .            "
"10","Groups in E choose to associate and to truthfully reveal their information to the other groups that have chosen association; these groups have chosen to engage. Groups in D choose to associate but reveal no meaningful information to the other groups in the association; these groups disengage. Groups in X choose to exit society, receiving no information from outgroups and taking actions informed solely by the information provided by their own members. The set of groups E and D comprise the association as these groups have chosen to participate in a public messaging game and to receive payoffs that depend on the actions of others. I denote an association by .            "
"11","Before defining the notion of societal stability used for the remainder of the article, I informally define a set of messaging equilibria for each possible association  that satisfies the equilibrium refinements discussed above.               "
"12","Definition 1.For any association R, a division of R into two disjoint subsets,  with , is a messaging equilibrium for R if the following three conditions are met:                  "
"13","               "
"14","Using the above definition of a messaging equilibrium for R, we are now in a position to define the notion of societal stability I am interested in.               "
"15","Definition 2.A collection of decisions by each group to either engage (E), disengage (D) or exit (X) is stable if the following three conditions are met:                  "
"16","               "
"17","               "
"18","The final stability condition deserves particular attention. This condition states that no group can strictly benefit by changing its association decision. For groups in association R, the condition is straightforward because it implies that they prefer remaining in R, given the current messaging equilibrium , to exit. For groups in X, the association decision poses a potential ambiguity, because if  chooses to enter association R the messaging strategies of the other groups in R may change. Thus, a group g that has chosen exit must compare the expected utility of exit to the expected utility of being in association given a new messaging equilibrium that its entry will generate.            "
"19","As the set of messaging equilibria may not be single‐valued, this calculation involves g choosing a particular messaging equilibrium to evaluate potential benefits of entry with respect to. In this case, I assume that g makes its calculation using a messaging equilibrium associated with association  that maximizes the expected utility of association for g. While this assumption seems strong, I discuss in the section titled “Equilibrium Selection and Social Welfare,” that if a messaging equilibrium for association R maximizes the expected utility of some group in the association, then it maximizes the expected utility of every group in the association; in other words, groups in an association have the same preferences over messaging equilibria. This stems from the fact that the only gain to association is a reduction in the residual variance of each group's estimate of θ due to information transmission. Due to the “shared policymaking” nature of group utility functions, each group in the association benefits equally from this reduction in variance. Thus, g evaluates its entry into an association by considering an equilibrium that is best for all members of the association, including itself.14"
"20","This section considers the conditions necessary for truthful communication (incentive compatibility) by group g to association R, and the conditions that characterize groups' association decisions. Together, the conditions can be used to fully characterize instances of societal stability. While these conditions are somewhat cumbersome to read, the intuition behind them is straightforward. First, the incentive compatibility condition necessary to ensure that a group g can truthfully communicate to an association R is below.15                              "
"21","Condition 1.Let R be an association, with  being the groups that truthfully reveal their signals and  being those that babble. The truthful messaging condition for group  is then:                     "
"22","A direct implication of this condition, observed on the right‐hand side of the equation, is that the closer group g's bias, , is to the biases of the other groups in the association, the easier it is for g to be incentivized to communicate truthfully to those groups. However, the effect of the size and the messaging strategies of the other groups in the association on g's own incentives is less clear‐cut.            "
"23","Consider, for example, the incentive a group g in association R faces when deciding whether to credibly communicate with the other groups in R. Some of these other groups are themselves communicating truthfully while others are not. First, suppose that many groups are communicating truthfully, so that a great deal of information is being conveyed within the association. A consequence is that the private information held by g is less important to the others in the association; if g lies, then the choices of others will only change by a small amount. In this setting, g is more incentivized to lie, because the small changes of others are likely to make g better off (an example is if g has ideal point 1, and by lying, can induce group h to shift its choice from 0 to ). Conversely, if very little information is being conveyed by the association then a lie by g will have a larger impact on the choices of others. This, perhaps unintuitively, makes g more likely to be truthful. Consider, for example, that g has ideal point 1 and, by lying in an attempt to shift h farther to the right, induces h to shift from from 0 to 3. This lie makes g worse off. The above intuition has been termed a “congestion effect” of more information; more information makes the effect of a lie smaller, and can reduce incentives for truthful messaging.16"
"24","Condition 1 only characterizes one aspect of a group's strategy: whether it is able to credibly communicate with association R. Stability also requires voluntary association; each group in association R would prefer remaining in R to exit, and each group choosing exit prefers exit to association. The voluntary association condition for groups in the association, also derived in Section 7.1 of the Online Appendix, captures the intuition that with more information, the precision of the decisions made by the groups in an association increases. This condition is below. The voluntary association condition for groups that have chosen exit is relegated to the print Appendix as it is more notationally intensive. The print Appendix also contains a more detailed discussion of this condition.               "
"25","Condition 2.The voluntary association condition for group  requires that:                     "
"26","In the above equation,  is the expected variance of a posterior belief about θ after receiving m signals. Thus, in deciding whether to associate, groups make a classic mean‐variance trade‐off: the different biases of the association members shift the expected value of the shared policy farther from a group's ideal point, but the added information improves the precision of decisions made by each association member. Because of this, groups that choose to “disengage” by withholding their information from the association are not free‐riding. These groups are able to pool their private information with whatever public information others have chosen to share, and consequently, their decisions are more precise than the decisions of the groups that have chosen “engage.”            "
"27","The quality of these babblers' decisions may be so high that it can be in the interest of a group to join an association in which it is the sole engager (the sole provider of information), and in which all other members of the association babble. Indeed, all three examples that follow in sections titled “Association Dynamics” and “Using Influence as an Inducement” generate an equilibrium of this type for some parameter values. However, an immediate implication of the voluntary association condition is that there can never be a stable configuration of groups in which all members of an association babble. If this occurs, then the association member with the most information can always benefit from exit; if it exits, this group can both make a more informed decision than the other groups and better target policy to its own bias. This is formalized in Corollary 1 in Section 7.1 of the Online Appendix.            "
"28","As alluded to in the section titled “Messaging Equilibria and Societal Stability,” there can be many messaging equilibria for a given association. Galeotti et al., considering a fixed association, demonstrate that when multiple equilibria exist in their framework, they can be Pareto‐ranked and characterized by a straightforward rule. The spirit of their result translates in part to the setting considered here. For a fixed association R, the set of messaging equilibria can similarly be Pareto‐ranked, although the rule that characterizes the ranking in Galeotti et al. no longer holds here because of the varying weights attached to the policy decisions of the groups. This rule is characterized formally in Proposition 1 in Section 7.2 of the Online Appendix, with some implications of the rule following in Corollary 2.            "
"29","Moving beyond the messaging stage and to a focus of this article—the association stage—while there is always at least one stable association, there will often exist more.17 When comparing two different messaging equilibria for two different, nonempty, stable associations, these equilibria can generally not be Pareto ranked. This stems from the nature of the association decision, and the fact that any group choosing exit obtains the minimum level of utility it could be expected to receive. Thus, if two stable associations are not nested, then they cannot be Pareto‐ranked.            "
"30","It should be noted that while stable equilibria corresponding to different associations can often not be Pareto ranked, it is always the case that members of an association receive a higher level of expected utility by associating than by exit. If institutional factors such as policy weights α can be utilized to increase the membership of a stable association, then this new equilibrium will dominate the former equilibrium with respect to something similar to Rawlsian (max‐min) social welfare, in that the new association raises the expected utility of one or more groups above minimum “exit” levels. The set of stable associations can be partially ranked on this basis."
"31","Finally, it is clear that increasing the welfare of more groups above minimum levels is only one type of welfare criterion; there is no guarantee that a stable association satisfying this criterion will maximize utilitarian welfare (the sum of individual payoffs). It may, for example, be the case that if group g joins an association then the payoffs of its own members increase slightly while the payoffs of all other association members decrease significantly, though not enough to induce their exit. This scenario opens the possibility of a natural extension of the model in which associations could, for example, bar certain groups from membership. This type of extension, and the consideration of utilitarian welfare, would be straightforward to calculate using the truthful messaging condition I provide, and modifying the association condition. I refrain from a more thorough treatment of these questions in part because they would necessitate a number of modeling choices that are beyond the scope of this article, including the decision rule used by an association to govern membership; whether payment transfers are allowable across groups; and relatedly, whether groups are able to make binding contracts. I note, however, that if there is a unique nonempty and stable association, then this association (and a corresponding Pareto‐optimal messaging equilibrium for its members) maximizes utilitarian welfare among the set of equilibria to this model. In all of the three‐group examples that follow, a unique such association exists.            "
"32","The following two examples provide the simplest illustration of the effect of a group's bias on the dynamics of a preexisting association (or non‐association). More specifically, they illustrate a simple comparative static: pinning down the size, policymaking discretion and locations of two groups, we can study how the presence of a third group alters association and communication strategies as we vary the bias of that third group. In the first example, the entry of a third group may break a preexisting association between groups 1 and 2. In the second, the third group's entry enables association between these groups where previously association was impossible. In both, the shaded regions of the corresponding figures depict the groups that have chosen association. The messaging strategies of the associating groups are labeled.            "
"33","Example 1.A “moderately extreme” third group may hinder beneficial association.               "
"34","Suppose that groups 1 and 2 are identical with respect to size and that policymaking discretion (α) is directly proportional to the size of each group in an association. The example uses parameter values  and . Groups 1 and 2 each have two members while Group 3 has one member. At these parameter values 1 and 2 have biases that are sufficiently close to each other to enable truthful messaging within an association consisting of just themselves, .         "
"35","Starting at , Figure 1 shows a Pareto‐optimal and stable equilibrium for each value of .18                        "
"36","Example 2.A third group may induce beneficial association.               "
"37","In the previous example, groups 1 and 2 were kept from communicating and associating with each other by the presence of an extreme third group that wants to join. In the following example, the third group is able to induce association between 1 and 2 where previously those groups could not associate. As before, suppose that groups 1 and 2 are identical with respect to size (they each have two members), that group 3 has one member, and that the α terms are proportional to association members' sizes. However, now let  and ; these biases are too far apart for truthful messaging to be sustained between groups 1 and 2 within association . Again, for each , Figure 2 shows a Pareto‐optimal and stable equilibrium.19                        "
"38","These examples demonstrate that the relative locations of the groups in an association play a central role in the types of associations possible, and more interestingly, in the information that can be credibly communicated within those associations. Notably, the most central group is always incentivized to communicate truthfully in these examples. As communication is public within the association, a dishonest message by a group would bias the choices of the remaining members to either the left or the right. When these members are on either side of the group, the group faces a mixed incentive to lie, and can more credibly communicate truthfully.20"
"39","If a group g joins an association, its policy choice factors into the payoffs of every association member, and is weighted by the term . The following example demonstrates that these α terms can be used to incentivize certain groups to both associate and to truthfully communicate. To illustrate, let there be three groups with group 1 having two members, group 2 having four members, and group 3 having a single member. Let the biases of these groups be ,  and . In this case, group 2 is both considerably larger (and hence, more informed) than groups 1 and 3, and the smallest group, group 3, is a preference outlier in the sense of being farther from centrist group 2 than group 1 is. In this example, any association containing any pair of groups cannot sustain truthful communication; each group is simply too far from any other group and/or too well‐informed. At the same time, groups 1 and 3 would benefit from association with the better‐informed group 2 to the extent that yielding all policymaking authority to 2 would be preferable to exit for those groups.         "
"40","While group 2's truthful communication and voluntary association conditions trivially hold when 2 is given all policymaking authority ( and ), the equality is knife‐edged; giving a minuscule degree of decision‐making authority to groups 1 and 3, for example, by setting , breaks 2's incentive to associate with 1 and 3. Moreover, there may be normative reasons to grant a positive degree of policymaking discretion to every group, in keeping with Iris Young's argument that “…a democratic decision is normatively legitimate only if all those affected by it are included in the process of discussion and decision‐making.”21 The question then is whether there exists a strictly positive vector of policymaking weights, α, for which all groups have a strictly positive incentive to associate, and consequently, for which some information can be shared across groups.         "
"41","To answer this question, first note that there is no strictly positive α that can ever induce either groups 1 or 3 to truthfully communicate to an association consisting of  (the verification of this statement, and all further calculations for this example, are in Section 7.4 of the Online Appendix). It follows that the only possible equilibrium association consisting of all three groups has a messaging equilibrium in which group 2 communicates truthfully and groups 1 and 3 babble. The policymaking weights α for which such an association is stable can be shown to be the subset of the two‐dimensional unit simplex with . This is pictured by the shaded region in Figure 3.         "
"42","Figure 3 shows how varying the distribution of α across the three groups affects group 2's association and messaging conditions. The figure depicts the Pareto‐optimal, stable equilibria for all possible realizations of α. The vertices of the simplex represent the values of α where one player is granted all policymaking authority, with the top of the simplex representing the point at which 2 has all authority. The points at which authority is evenly distributed across groups and at which authority is distributed proportionally according to group size are labeled.         "
"43","The shaded region II represents the values of α for which 2 truthfully messages to 1 and 3, and for which the association decision is positive for all groups. In region I, group 2 cannot be compelled to truthfully communicate to 1 and 3 because α3 is too low relative to α1 for group 3 to effectively counterbalance group 1's bias; 2 wants to lie to 1. In region III, group 2 can truthfully communicate with 1 and 3, but prefers exit to association. In this region, α3 is too large relative to α1 for association to be beneficial to 2, because a large α3 requires 2 to endure 3's greater bias. In region IV, group 2 can no longer credibly communicate with 1 and 3 because α1 is too low relative to α3 for group 1 to counterbalance group 3's bias; now 2 wants to lie to 3.         "
"44","The point to be taken from this example is that truthful messaging by 2 and voluntary association by all groups can only be meaningfully sustained when both groups 1 and 3 have strictly positive policymaking authority. Interestingly, the absolute level of authority held by groups 1 and 3 doesn't affect 2's decision to either associate or to communicate truthfully; only the relative balance of power between groups 1 and 3 matters. Group 2 can be incentivized to communicate truthfully, to be the sole provider of information, and to strictly prefer association to exit even when it is granted zero policymaking authority. This is because when group 2 provides information to groups 1 and 3, those groups make better decisions, and it is only by yielding power to those groups that 2 can benefit from those decisions. Finally, even though group 3 is a preference outlier and possesses little information of its own, its nontrivial presence is necessary in the association to induce 2 to communicate truthfully, and hence, to make everyone strictly better off.22"
"45","In this article, I have considered the possibility of alliance formation between two or more groups. If groups choose to join an alliance (or “associate”) they can reveal valuable information to each other, but must also pool their sovereignty. In equilibrium, certain associations are possible while others are not, and within an equilibrium association, some groups will publicly reveal their information while others will obfuscate. However, in any equilibrium association, some information transmission will occur, and for every member of the association, the benefits of this information outweigh the costs stemming from power sharing."
"46","A number of insights emerge from the model, with a general feature being that beneficial information can often be shared in settings where one group emerges as a natural “bridge” between other groups.23 The possibility of such a bridging group depends critically on the balance of power between the groups that ideologically flank it. While this power must be evenly distributed enough to ensure that the bridging group is incentivized to remain truthful, it must also favor moderate groups over extremists so that members wish to voluntarily remain in the association. This insight highlights both a benefit and a liability to the presence of extremists within an association. On the one hand, if association members' preferences are skewed right, the presence of a far‐left group can mitigate a centrist's incentive to lie, thus improving communication within the association. This effect can strictly improve the well‐being of everyone. On the other hand, power sharing with such an extreme group may prove too ideologically costly and may induce some members to leave.         "
"47","Modern examples of related organizational issues can be seen in rules intended to facilitate information sharing between members of alliances such as NATO. In the example of NATO, these features include the communication protocol used by member states to share intelligence, the pledge of mutual defense in the event of an external attack, and decentralized decision making by member states. NATO imposes a communication protocol similar to the within‐association protocol I consider here; on matters of intelligence concerning the alliance, information sharing within the alliance is facilitated between members through the use of various protected communication networks. Communication to nonmembers is disallowed. The pooled sovereignty of nations within the alliance to counter external threats, coupled with decentralized decision making by countries themselves, also reflects several key aspects of decision making in this model."
"48","To see how these features contribute to the potential value of an alliance, reconsider the example presented in the section entitled “Using Influence as an Inducement,” where the distribution of power between groups is manipulated to induce beneficial association. In this example, pairwise communication between any two groups breaks down; simultaneous communication between all groups is necessary in order for productive communication—and hence, association—to occur.24 Thus, the public nature of communication is essential to the value of the alliance because diversity within the alliance keeps certain informed members “honest.” Moreover, this balancing effect only holds if power is decentralized among members. This is because it is how listening groups utilize the information that they are given that enables credible communication by an informed group.         "
"49","While this framework is intended to be abstract, and is not intended to capture details of any specific organization, the insights it yields—for example, who can productively pool sovereignty, who can credibly share information, and why—can be used to better understand the circumstances under which communication and association can occur, and ultimately, why organizations form, persist, and disappear. For example, it has been noted that most intelligence sharing among countries is highly asymmetrical, with certain parties providing much more information than others.25 This model provides a rationale for why it might be beneficial for a country to be part of an alliance in which it is the sole information provider: Giving information to others improves the quality of their decisions above and beyond one's own, and this benefit can only be realized if power is (at least partially) ceded to those that have received the provider's information. Thus, the model could be used to consider the conditions under which countries asymmetrically share information, and how the changing membership of an intelligence community, or the changing nature of threat, might affect this.         "
"50","I conclude with the acknowledgement that the organizations modeled in this article are stylized. Membership is fluid in that there are no barriers to entry or exit; I consider the possibility of just a single association; and I do not explicitly analyze returns to scale that likely accrue to members of certain associations.26 These factors are clearly important determinants of organizational performance. At the same time, the framework presented here is straightforward and flexible and, I hope, will lend itself to a number of productive extensions. Developing these ideas, along with richer notions of a group's association and communication possibilities, are left for future research.         "
"51","As noted in the text, the voluntary association condition characterizes the requirement that each group in association R would prefer remaining in R to exit and vice versa. Let  be the expected variance of a posterior belief about θ after receiving m signals. The assumption of a quadratic utility function, combined with sequential rationality, enables us to express the equilibrium expected utility to player g from action profile  as the following:               "
"52","The voluntary association condition requires that for each , the expected utility from remaining in R exceeds the expected utility g would receive from forgoing the association in favor of implementing its own policy. The condition also requires that each  faces no possible benefit from joining the association. This requires that, for each group that has chosen exit from some association R, there is no messaging equilibrium for association  that yields h strictly higher expected utility than would be received by remaining out of the association. For the statement below, let . We can now express both parts of the voluntary association condition as follows.            "
