"1","The standard model of the density of political parties is perhaps best reflected in Gary Cox's 1997 book Making Votes Count, which builds on Duverger's (1954) insight that simple‐majority, single‐member, single‐ballot rules play a key role in “pushing” electoral systems toward two major parties (Cox 1997, 98). Duverger's focus on electoral rules was extended by Rae (1967) to consider a variety of electoral institutions in multiparty systems, including electoral formula (majority, plurality, or forms of proportional representation), district magnitude (the number of legislators elected from a district), and ballot structure (rules allowing/prohibiting voters to split their votes). Empirical research then confirmed that district magnitude (M), especially, severely constrains the number of political parties that might be viable within an electoral system (Lijphart 1990).            "
"2"," Duverger (1954) offered two explanations of this effect. The first is an entirely mechanical effect whereby smaller parties are penalized in terms of seats relative to the votes they receive (Blais and Carty 1991, 80; Taagepera 2001; Taagepera and Allik 2005). Thus, as Taagepera and Shugart note, “With M = 1, only one party can win; and this has a strong tendency to impel the political forces to conglomerate into two large parties in order to have some chance of winning. As M increases, more parties can possibly win seats in the given district; hence more parties can afford to run” (1993, 455). But smaller parties seem to be penalized even more severely than can be accounted for by the mechanical effect alone (Blais and Carty 1991). Attention, accordingly, shifted to Duverger's second explanation: the psychological effect, upon which Cox (1997) builds his analysis of party systems. That is, he argues that strategic voting on the part of individual citizens largely accounts for the strong relationship between district magnitude and number of effective parties. Simply put, “Instrumentally rational voters eschew wasting their votes on hopeless candidacies, preferring instead to transfer their support to some candidate with a serious chance of winning” (Cox 1997, 30).            "
"3","While most of Cox's (1997) attention is focused on strategic voting on the part of citizens in the context of a given set of electoral rules, his model—building on Powell (1982), Neto and Cox (1997), Taagepera and Grofman (1985), and Ordeshook and Shvetsova (1994)—also accounts for the role of electoral cleavages that allow more or fewer parties to emerge than would be expected given district magnitude alone.2 This was in part a response to empirical anomalies since some party systems support more political parties—Canada, the United Kingdom, or India, for example—than can be accounted for by electoral rules alone. But whatever its origins, this attention to social cleavages marks the emergence of the now standard model combining insights from the two traditions of explaining the party system density.3"
"4","This combination is not produced via simple addition, however. Rather, the standard model includes social cleavages in the model in interaction with district magnitude (Cox 1997; Neto and Cox 1997; Ordeshook and Shvetsova 1994). Cox's (1997, 206) expectation—one at least as old as Key'sSouthern Politics (1949)—is that “political entrepreneurs” have strong incentives “to base separate parties on these cleavages.” By accounting for this interaction, the standard model suggests that issues and/or social cleavages become more important as district magnitude increases.            "
"5","Given the impressive body of work it both builds upon and which builds upon it, what is wrong with the standard model? It provides a less than fully satisfying account of party system density in several respects, two of which we address here.4 The first is the very strong set of assumptions made about the capacities of individual voters (or elites) to engage in strategic voting (or entering campaigns, endorsing, or donating). Cox (1997, 79) appropriately noted that the model would fail if voters are not short‐term instrumentally rational, if there is a lack of information about voter preferences and vote intentions, if voters believe that a given candidate is certain to win, or if there are voters who care intensely about their first choice, but are indifferent toward other candidates. Problematically, then, a significant body of work has found little support for either strategic entrance into candidacy on the part of elites (Born 1986) or sophisticated voting by elites (Krehbiel and Rivers 1990) or citizens (Converse 1964; Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Macdonald, Rabinowitz, and Listhaug 1998). Luskin summarized several decades of research on public opinion when he noted: “At long last, and despite some flickering dissent…, there now seems to be a near‐consensus that by anything approaching elite standards most citizens think and know jaw‐droppingly little about politics” (2002, 282).5 In short, a model founded on the capacities of citizens to vote strategically represents a rather strong claim that demands strong proof.            "
"6","It is hardly surprising, then, that Making Votes Count provides a thorough review of the evidence supporting strategic or sophisticated voting. Aggregate‐level analyses do offer some support for Duverger's (1954) psychological effect, with Blais and Carty (1991) claiming that its impact on representation is the same as that of the mechanical effect across a wide range of countries. Still, Cox rather severely limits the scope of his primary causal account of the M + 1 rule,6 noting that “strategic voting ought to fade out when the district magnitude gets much above five” (Cox 1997, 100; also see Huber, Kernell, and Leoni 2005). Elsewhere, Cox observed that “whatever it is that explains why so few lists appear in large magnitude districts operating under PR, it is not systematic downward pressure derived from the fear of wasting votes” (1997, 141). Indeed, with application to only cases in which M is five or lower, Cox (1997, 203–24) suggests that his causal account of the M+1 rule applies to only 27 of the 54 cases he analyzes in his cross‐national test of the standard model (Cox, 1997, 203–24). Indeed, going beyond the two‐party result associated with Duverger's law, strategic voting would be expected to occur in only seven more cases: Mauritius and Ecuador, with a district magnitude of 3, El Salvador and Japan, with a district magnitude of 4, and Malta, Ireland, and the Dominican Republic, with an M value of 5.            "
"7","A second problem concerns the functional form of the core district magnitude variable used in cross‐national tests of the standard model. It is included in the model in either a decimal or natural logged form suggesting a curvilinear relationship. Yet, this specification is treated as a measurement convenience that is undefended theoretically (see Beck and Jackman 1998). Indeed, there is no theory of logged units mentioned anywhere in this literature. The closest one finds to a theoretical argument is Ordeshook and Shvetsova's summary of Sartori's (1986, 67, n. 15) observation that “although we might predict that single member districts imply two‐party systems, and that, say, 15‐member districts might imply four or five parties, it is unreasonable to suppose that 120‐ or 150‐member districts (Israel and the Netherlands) will generate 30 or 40 parties, ceteris paribus” (1994, 106–7). We have no trouble with this observation per se. Any number of models of decision making might suggest that the relationship between M and number of parties is characterized by a nonlinear response. But none of the several versions of the standard model actually specify why such a pattern might occur, thereby leaving these cases, too, beyond its scope. Or worse, these exceptions are buried deep in the logged values, where their exceptional character is effectively hidden.            "
"8","Even more importantly, the measurement convenience of logged values leads researchers to miss an important opportunity to probe the limits of the strategic voting hypothesis. Consider Cox's earlier noted claim that “strategic voting ought to fade out when the district magnitude gets much above five” (1997, 100). If this is true, then we can identify valuable test implications associated with the nature of that curvilinearity. That is, the effects of strategic voting should be more binding at lower values of district magnitude and become progressively less telling as district magnitude increases. If this is so, the relationship between district magnitude and number of parties should be convex, sloping upward as the capacities of citizens to engage in strategic voting are exhausted and the number of parties is free to accelerate to its theoretical limit given M.            "
"9","If we find no difference in the severity of the rate at which district magnitude determines number of parties, then this would indicate either that strategic voting is similarly binding across the full range of district magnitudes, which is implausible to supporters of the standard model, or that strategic voting poses no real threat to smaller parties. More likely, we will—as suggested by Cox—find that strategic voting is important in some number of cases at lower levels of district magnitude, but indeed fades in importance as district magnitude increases. Identifying when and how fast such fading occurs will reveal the range of cases to which the strategic voting explanation applies, as well as those for which we must seek other explanations if we are to build a more comprehensive and thereby more satisfying account of the densities of systems of political parties. To do so, however, requires that we unpack the logged value of M."
"10","Such diagnostic unpacking would also be useful to assess what happens when strategic voting fades to unimportance. Does the number of political parties continue to rise to its theoretical limits governed only by the M + 1 rule? This is unlikely to be true given the curvilinear relationship between district magnitude and number of parties implied by the logged functional form and Ordeshook and Shvetsova's earlier noted observation that “it is unreasonable to suppose that 120‐ or 150‐member districts (Israel and the Netherlands) will generate 30 or 40 parties, ceteris paribus” (1994, 107). To understand these extreme cases with large district magnitudes up to single national districts and, thus, district magnitudes of 120 (Israel) and 150 (the Netherlands), we will need to, as Cox suggested, “look elsewhere: to economies of scale in advertising, raising funds, securing portfolios, supplying policy benefits, and so on” (1997, 141). In short, the explanation of these cases is unlikely to be found in either strategic voting or district magnitude alone, but something else as yet not included in the standard model.            "
"11","Further, there remains a real question about when we must consider such alternative accounts. With specifications using a logged functional form, conventional tests of the standard model simply do not have the sensitivity needed to assess when such other variables might be important. It remains an open question, then, whether such issues become important only in the very extreme cases of single national districts or, more problematically in terms of theory, at much lower levels of district magnitude.            "
"12","In sum, the standard model is simply not very precise in its theoretical predictions about the nature of the curvilinearity in the relationship between district magnitude and number of parties. Further, the reliance of prior tests of the model on logged measures ensures that the nature of that curvilinearity remained obscured. We need both a more precise set of theoretical expectations and new empirical tools to assess them."
"13","We extract such new theoretical expectations from organizational ecology, a body of theory that examines the evolution of many kinds of populations of organizations via processes of selection (Hannan and Freeman 1977). As noted by Baum and Oliver, it highlights “how competition for scarce common resources and mutualism based on complementary functional differences” (1996, 1378–79) affects founding and failure rates. The paradigm has been used to understand the dynamics of populations of, among many others, newspapers (Boone, Carroll, and van Witteloostuijn 2002), labor unions (Hannan and Freeman 1988), audit firms (Bröcheler, Maijoor, and van Witteloostuijn 2004), lobby organizations (Lowery and Gray 1995), and national laws (van Witteloostuijn and de Jong 2010). Given these findings across a range of very different types of populations, we believe it reasonable to start by assuming that party system density may be subsumable under a general theory of populations of organizations of all kinds.            "
"14","More to the point, research on these varied organizational populations has found sigmoid functions to be the hallmark of the growth of populations of all sorts.7 Although organizational ecology hosts many different theories, it is fair to say that the theory of density dependence is at the heart of this perspective (Hannan and Carroll 1992). This theory predicts a sigmoid‐shaped evolution of organizational density or the organizational count in the population.8 Although several different theoretical processes have been used to account for this sigmoid function (Singh and Lumsden 1990), two selection forces are typically noted. The first force is constitutive legitimation, which is usually conceptualized as the “taken‐for‐grantedness” of the organizational form constituting the population. At low levels of density, an extra organization will contribute to further establishing the legitimacy of the organizational form. This implies positive density dependence with higher density increasing entry and depressing exit. The second force is resource competition. At higher levels of density, simply too many organizations compete for the same set or sets of scarce resources. Density dependence will then become negative, inhibiting organizational births and/or increasing the organizational death rate. Combining these two forces generates the sigmoid function of density, which specifies the carrying capacity of the population or the maximum number of organizations that can be sustained at a given resource level. Thus, in empirical studies relying on a population ecology approach, carrying capacity is determined by looking at the supply of resources that constrain any further growth of populations, whether the forces of energy, stability, and area in studies of island bio‐geography or the demand for the products or services of organizations in organizational ecology.            "
"15","How might this approach interpret the density of party systems? From an organizational ecology perspective, the major determinant of the carrying capacity of political systems for political parties, in the sense of dominating the central part of the relationship between district magnitude and number of parties, remains the mechanical effect of Duverger's Law (1954) as generalized by Lijphart (1990) to systems where M is greater than 1. But this simple mechanical effect is not sufficient to alone account for a flattening of the distribution of parties both at very low levels of M and when M becomes very large. It is here that the organizational ecology concepts of positive (legitimation) and negative (competition) density dependence become potentially important.            "
"16","Starting with the low‐M condition, constitutive legitimation of the organizational form per se seems unlikely to make a difference for our case since political parties are the taken‐for‐granted tools of political representation. So we argue that positive density dependence is now reflected in the fading out of strategic voting if M increases. Strategic voting suppresses density at lower levels of M. As citizens’capacities to engage in strategic voting become limited as making prospective estimates of the likelihood of a party winning becomes more difficult, however, number of parties in relation to M increases in an unfettered fashion with the M + 1 rule. Thus, the effect of strategic voting, if perhaps not its underlying logic, can be readily folded into an organizational ecology interpretation of positive density dependence.            "
"17","Still, we think that there is an even more plausible account for the observed effect of strategic voting that is both less dependent on strong assumptions about voters’ capacities and far more consistent with the spirit of the organizational ecology concept of “legitimation.” That is, once a sufficient number of parties can compete given a moderate level of M, it becomes increasingly unlikely that a single party will be able to form a government. In such cases, it may not be limitations on the capacities of citizens to engage in strategic voting based on prospective assessments of the likely winners of an election that legitimizes sincere voting for a preferred party that matter. Rather, there may simply be a lack of incentive to vote for a front‐runner given that a coalition government—in which the sincerely preferred party could well be a participant even if it does not gain the most votes—is the most plausible outcome. When coalitions become likely, many more parties than merely the one receiving the largest number of votes might plausibly have a legitimate chance of participating in a government. In organizational ecology terms, smaller parties would be delegitimized, if at a decreasing rate, until M is large enough that sufficient numbers of parties survive so as to make a coalition government likely. While we cannot test directly this modified interpretation of strategic voting with the data used here, it strikes us as far less demanding than that usual interpretation. It only requires voters to acknowledge retrospectively the frequency of coalitions and then to project such outcomes into the future.            "
"18","More uniquely in comparison to the standard interpretation, the organizational ecology approach suggests that at very high levels of M, as parties exhaust some as yet unidentified environmental resources needed to survive, the party population should experience negative density dependence. That is, the carrying capacity of the system for additional parties will be reached so that no more parties can be supported irrespective of further increases in values of M. Negative density dependence thus implies that crowding within the political system increases competition at an accelerating rate with incremental party entry. At some limit, entrance of any new party must come at the expense (death) of an old party. What remains for our model of party system density to be encompassed within the larger research program on organizational ecology is some specification of the environmental resources that impose density dependence at higher levels of M, the “something else” (Cox 1997, 141), an issue we return to later. But the need to specify what that something else is is all too neatly avoided by recourse to the LogM version of the standard model. Further, the use of LogM obscures precisely when along the distribution of M that something else comes into play.            "
"19","To test the two models, we employ the simple version of the standard model presented by Ordeshook and Shvetsova (1997, 11)—including M, ethnic heterogeneity, and their interaction—because it is a bit simpler than Cox's, yet produces similar results (Cox 1997, 221). However, we employ Cox's data—54 national cases (circa 1985)—because they provide us many more observations. We examined two dependent variables: the effective number of parties receiving votes (ENPV) and the effective number of parties receiving legislative seats (ENPS), which are inverse Herfindahl indices.9 They produced very similar results. Thus, we present only the latter. But the full results for both dependent variables are available on the AJPS website as supplemental information. The key independent variable is district magnitude (M), the number of legislators elected from the median legislator's district.10 A second independent variable is the effective number of ethnic groups (ENETH), which also interacts with M.11"
"20","The key issue we have raised about the standard model concerns the nature of the curvilinear relationship between district magnitude and number of parties. To examine this relationship fully, we examine the data inductively to diagnose the functional form of the relationship between M and number of parties receiving seats. That is, we conduct our re‐interrogation of Ordeshook and Shvetsova's (1997, 11) model and Cox's data (1997, 221) in three steps. First, we estimate the model using data from all 54 cases using linear, logged, and polynomial specifications of the critical district magnitude (M) variable. The purpose of this first test is simply to show that a polynomial specification produces quite similar results to those reported for the logged measure of M and that both are superior to a simple linear specification. Second, we then use the polynomial version of the model—and later a general additive (GAM) model—to examine subsets of the data in terms of the value of M. This will enable us to highlight inflection points in the relationship that indicate when first the constraints of strategic voting on the number of effective parties begins to fade away and then when district magnitude itself fades away as a determinant of party density in favor of the other, unspecified kinds of variables noted by Cox (1997, 141). In the third set of analyses, we consider what our findings can say about the extreme cases of single national districts found in Israel and the Netherlands. More specifically, we ask whether they are really so extreme given the negative density dependence expectation of organizational ecology that, after some point, number of parties should stabilize irrespective of further changes in M.         "
"21","Critically, we exclude several cases in the second set of analyses. First, we exclude Israel and the Netherlands not just because they look so extreme, but also so that they can provide in our third set of analyses an external assessment of the generalizability of our findings produced by analyzing the nature of party density using cases with more typical values of M. So, these two cases will return in our third set of analyses. Our decision to exclude three other cases—Ecuador, Brazil, and Belgium—will almost certainly be more controversial. But all three have extremely high numbers of parties receiving votes: respectively, 3.93, 3.56, and 2.66 standard deviations above the mean when the next most extreme standard deviation value, for Switzerland, is only 1.42. Just as importantly, Brazil and Ecuador, with district magnitudes 30 and 3, respectively, fall at or near the ends of the distribution of M, which ranges from 1 for countries with single‐member districts to 30, once we exclude Israel and the Netherlands."
"22","As a result, they exercise disproportionate influence on our estimates for several subsets of the data. Indeed, their inclusion generates some nonsensical results when we focus on subsets of data. For example, estimation of our core model for cases of district magnitude of 5 or smaller (model 1 in Table 2) while including Ecuador transforms what is otherwise a strong convex relationship into a sharply concave one. More modestly, Brazil's inclusion at the end of the distribution somewhat weakens a strong concave relationship. Including Belgium, because it has a moderate M value of 8, and thereby falls in the middle of distribution of M, has much less impact on the relationships, although it depresses coefficients of determination somewhat.         "
"23","Further, these cases are odd in ways that fall outside the explanatory foci of either the standard model or our own account. Belgium, with the regional split between Wallonia and Flanders, essentially has duplicated its party system with comparable parties in each part of its federal system. Brazil, and especially Ecuador, were, at least in the 1980s, typical of what Sanchez has called “party non‐systems” in having a party universe characterized by a “fundamental absence of inter‐temporal continuity in the identity of the main parties” (2009, 487). Mustillo notes, for example, that about 25 new parties were formed in Ecuador “each year in 1996, 1998, and 2002” (2009, 322). In such systems, it is not surprising that an extraordinarily large number of parties are evident. And it is also clear the parties mean something quite different from what parties mean in the literature considered here. Thus, we have opted to exclude them from the analysis.         "
"24","Critically, for our purpose, their exclusion neither advantages nor disadvantages the polynomial specification we rely on in contrast to the logged form of the model more commonly used. When the logged form of the standard model is applied to the 27 cases with district magnitude below 6, those cases for which Cox (1997) suggests that strategic voting is likely to be important, by regressing the effective number of parties receiving votes (ENPV) on logged district magnitude (M), the effective number of ethnic groups (ENETH), and their interaction, the estimate for logged M is negative, none of the estimates produces a t‐value greater than 0.55, and the coefficient of determination is only 0.089. In short, these extreme cases are as equally problematic for the standard logged model as for the polynomial results we present here. We will discuss in notes at appropriate points in the analysis, however, how the inclusion of the three extreme cases would influence our results and our interpretation of them.         "
"25","Our first analysis serves the housekeeping function of establishing the empirical equivalence of the logged and polynomial versions of the standard model using all 54 cases. Three pairs of estimates are presented using, respectively, a linear, logged, or second‐order polynomial specification of district magnitude (M). The first of each pair is a simple additive specification of M and the effective number of ethnic groups (ENETH), while the second of each pair includes their interaction."
"26","Two conclusions can be drawn from the results reported in Table 1. First, the least surprising is that, in terms of both explained variance and the size of the estimates, both the logged and polynomial specifications outperform the linear specifications. Clearly, the relationship between district magnitude and number of parties is strongly curvilinear across its full range, and this must be addressed in one manner or another. Second, the specifications including interactions perform much better in terms of explained variance.            "
"27","Still, it can be difficult to interpret the estimates of both the logged and polynomial models. This is especially true for the latter given its—not unexpected because of the several interactions—high collinearity, as evidenced by the exceptionally high R2 values generated from regressing each independent variable on the others: M (0.988), M‐SQ (0.993), M * ENETH (0.979), and M‐SQ * ENETH (0.993). Only ENETH (0.507) produced a modest R2 value. But while collinearity can create problems for standard errors, it does not bias slope estimates. And the plots of predicted values from both the logged and polynomial interactive models indicate that effective number of parties receiving seats rises with both M and ENETH. Indeed, the plots of the predicted values of the second‐order polynomial trends generated from both the interactive logged (column 4) and polynomial (column 6) models for the effective number of parties receiving seats are so similar that they are indistinguishable.            "
"28","So, which specification of the full interaction model is to be preferred: the logged or the polynomial? The explained variances of the competing pairs of models are quite similar, and they generate similar predicted values. The simple correlation of the predicted values from the interactive logged (model 4) and polynomial models (model 6) of ENPV is 0.878. Thus, the logged and polynomial interactive models are empirically equivalent in their predictions. Still, the latter has the advantage that we can use it to unfold the variation lost when district magnitude (M) is logged and then use that variation to examine additional test implications of the strategic voting hypothesis as well as other hypotheses about the density of party systems."
"29","We now turn our attention to the 49 cases excluding the extremes of nations with single national districts and the three countries with extremely large numbers of parties (Belgium, Ecuador, and Brazil). These cases were initially used to estimate models of ENPS using the interactive polynomial specification seen in column 6 in Table 1 for all 54 cases. The relationships between the predicted values from these two regressions and M are reported in Figure 1, again using a simple second‐order polynomial model. In effect, the response function highlights the portion of explained variance from the basic model associated with M while the residuals associated with the cases around the line are the unique effects of the effective number of ethnic groups (ENETH).12 M dominates the results and has a strong concave relationship with the dependent variable. Substantively, this means that electoral rules have a more telling impact on party density than ethnic cleavages (but see Clark and Golder 2006). More immediately, given our interest in examining the role of district magnitude and strategic voting that might be associated with it, we still need to account for the unique, albeit small, effects of ENETH as reflected by the distribution of the cases around the line in Figure 1. Accordingly, while the results reported in Table 2 were estimated with the actual values of ENETH, all of the predicted values generated from the fully specified interactive polynomial model in the later figures for subsets of our 49 remaining cases were generated using the estimates from Table 2after setting ENETH at its mean of 1.55 for all cases.            "
"30","                 Predicted Second‐Order Polynomial Values of ENPS for 49 Cases                         "
"31","The estimates reported in Table 2 were generated using the full model, but for successively greater numbers of cases including a higher value of M: the 26 countries with M values from 1 to 5 that are expected to be the most likely places to find evidence of strategic voting, the 41 countries with M values from 1 to 12, the 45 nations with M values up to 20, and the 49 countries with district magnitudes up to 30.13 It is clear, however, that a simple interpretation of the results is difficult. The signs of the estimates, for example, flip from model to model, something that, while perhaps disconcerting, is central to our analysis. Even so, interpreting the effects of M or ENETH on party density within any single set of estimates is difficult given the sheer number of interactions resulting from the use of a polynomial specification. It is not at all obvious how sometimes positively and negatively signed estimates combine to define together how a single underlying variable is related to numbers of parties. Further, the models are, with even fewer observations than in Table 1, even more extremely collinear.            "
"32","Yet, even with all of these surface limitations, the results in Table 2 can tell us quite a bit. One clue that this is so lies in the coefficients of determination of the models, which are as large as or larger than those reported in Table 1. Something is clearly going on even with all the nonsignificant estimates, but we must extract the message. Because collinearity does not bias estimates, we do so graphically, seeing if the predicted values from the models reproduce theoretically interpretable patterns. Figure 2 reports the predicted values of ENPS using the four estimates reported in Table 2, but, as noted earlier, after setting the effective number of ethnic groups at its mean to highlight the key relationships between M and ENPS.14"
"33","                 Predicted Relationship between Number of Parties Receiving Seats (ENPS) and District Magnitude (M) for M 1‐5, 1‐12, 1‐20, and 1‐30                         "
"34","The short lines on the left‐hand side of Figure 2 report the relationship between district magnitude and the effective number of parties receiving seats (ENPS) generated from the 26 cases with M values from 1 to 5.15 This is the range of M in which strategic voting is most likely to be telling. Yet, both functions slope upward at an increasing rate or are convex. We argued earlier that such a convex pattern would indicate that strategic voting becomes less constraining as district magnitude increases. Thus, these convex relationships suggest that the impact of strategic voting, while still at least to some extent constraining newer parties from taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by greater district magnitude, begins to fade surprisingly quickly as M increases, even within the M frontier of 5 suggested by Cox(1997 , 100).16"
"35","This interpretation is confirmed by the plots on the left‐hand side of Figure 2 generated by adding the 15 cases with M values from 6 to 12 in model 2 in Table 2.17 This plot of predicted values is clearly convex, again suggesting that the import of strategic voting diminishes rather quickly. This is especially so after M values of 5, as suggested by Cox, when both lines begin to rise sharply as more parties begin receiving votes and seats as district magnitude rises.18 Thus, these first two sets of results do not suggest that strategic voting—as either interpreted conventionally in terms of the prospective calculating capacities of voters or more plausibly via their retrospective attention to the likelihood of a coalition government—is unimportant, but only that its impact on party system density is limited in scope. Its constraint on party numbers diminishes even at very low values of M, and then essentially disappears after district magnitude values of 5. This both confirms Cox's (1997, 100) intuition, but also points to the restrictive scope of strategic voting (in either the conventional form or as interpreted here as attention to the likelihood of a coalition) as an account of party system density. For fully half of the cases in the data set (those where M is greater than 5), strategic voting or legitimation plays no role. And if elite behavior, à la Duverger (1954), accounts for the two‐party result of cases of M = 1, then it matters in only six of our cases.            "
"36","The third response function on the left‐hand side of Figure 2 is based on model 3 in Table 2 for cases with M values of up to 20. This adds only four more cases (Bolivia, Liechtenstein, Portugal, and Finland), and the highest M value of these is Bolivia's 17.5. But these cases have a significant impact on the relationship between M and ENPS. It becomes linear with the number of parties receiving seats rising at a sustained rate with M. This is the world—the range of M—in which the mechanical effect of the generalized Duverger's rule (Lijphart 1990; Taagepera and Shugart 1989) most clearly applies.            "
"37","The story, however, does not end there, which suggests that the generalized Duverger's rule and strategic voting provide an incomplete explanation. As seen in the longest plots of predicted values in Figure 2, generated from model 4 in Table 2, the relationship between M and number of effective parties switches to concave for higher values of M or when the four cases with M values from 20 to 30 (Luxemburg, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Italy) are included. Indeed, examination of several second‐order polynomial models not included here suggests that the relationship becomes flat for the last eight cases included in the estimated models in Table 2, those with district magnitude values of 15 or higher.19 This is a world in which neither strategic voting (again, as either interpreted conventionally in terms of the prospective calculating capacities of voters or more plausibly via their retrospective attention to the likelihood of a coalition) nor M seems to matter. More to the point, this world is largely invisible when the logged measure artificially flattens these cases into the upper end of the third, linear set of response functions. As Cox (1997, 141) noted, “something else” must be going on when M rises to higher values of 15 or so. That “something else” should be part of a general model of party system density. This is especially so since Cox's statement, as well as similar comments by Ordeshook and Shvetsova (1994, 106–7), seem to address only the really extreme cases of single national districts. Our results suggest that the “something else” may begin to constrain density at much lower levels of M.            "
"38","We can get a good hint about this “something else” now by looking at the overall shape of distributions reported in Figure 2. We first do so somewhat informally by combining the predicted values of ENPS from the sets of response functions in Figures 2 for values of M running from 1 to 5, 1 to 12, 1 to 20, and 1 to 30. We start with the predictions for M 1–5, but substitute these with those from the M 1–12 estimates starting when the M 1–5 trend‐line crosses that for M 1–12. Similarly, we substitute the predictions of the remaining higher trend‐lines starting at the point at which the prediction of a lower one crosses that of a higher. Thus, we always select the lower predicted values because these were generated from data series in which the cases were closer to the midpoint of the values of M. The response functions associated with the combined predictions of ENPS (as generated after smoothing them slightly with a fourth‐order polynomial model) are reported by the dashed line in Figure 3. They outline a sigmoid distribution that is initially flat, then convex, rising through a period of linear growth, then concave as the growth of party density slows, and finally flat as there is no further increase in parties as M increases.            "
"39","                 Predicted Values of Patched‐Together Polynomial and GAM Models of Effective Number of Parties Receiving Seats (ENPS) by District Magnitude M 1‐30                         "
"40","We also examined the shape of these response functions more formally using a generalized additive (GAM) model (Beck and Jackman 1998; Hastie and Tibshirani 1990). GAMs function well for exploratory analysis and can be used to check a linear model for bias. They are a flexible extension of generalized linear models where cubic smoothing splines are used to estimate flexible functions and reveal curvilinear relationships. The amount of smoothing is controlled through choice of equivalent degrees of freedom. Here we bring ENETH and its interaction with M back into the model along with a more complex estimation of the impact of M on ENPS. We explored a range of equivalent degrees of freedom and found that four degrees of freedom gave us the best balance between parsimony and the best results based on measures of model fit. The results were (with standard errors under the estimates) as follows.                "
"41","While remarkably similar to the earlier reported smoothed plot of predicted values from our more informal patched‐together second‐order polynomial models, there are several points worth noting. First, both the GAM and patched‐together polynomial plots of the predicted values of ENPS are in broad agreement about their linear relationship with M for values of M greater than 5 and less than 15. Second, however, the GAM diverges somewhat from the patched‐together polynomial function in Figure 4 in hinting at a sharp decline in ENPS for values of M greater than 20. This divergence is not surprising given the use of less sensitive second‐order polynomial models and, more importantly, the existence of only one case with an M value greater than 25 (Austria, M = 30). However, this is not a unique problem theoretically since no one's model of party system density would suggest that density should decline with M along any of its range. Still, the Cox (1997) data provide us with only four observations of M between 20 and 30. Given limited empirical leverage, it could well be that the declining predicted values of these cases represent the impact of local forces not addressed in the models, and that the true relationship between M and ENPS is, while concave as expected, flat after values of M of 15 or so. While we will have another occasion to consider this issue in our third set of analyses, these results, taken together, most plausibly suggest that there is a sigmoid relationship consistent with organizational ecology expectations.            "
"42","                 Relationship between Effective Number of Parties Receiving Seats (ENPS) and District Magnitude (M) for M > 15                         "
"43","Another way in which we can test the organizational ecology interpretation of our findings is by using the predicted results from the GAM model and the polynomial models in Table 2 and then combined in Figure 3 to consider how other cases not used to generate the predictions themselves fit the expected distribution of ENPS in relation to M. We have two such cases: Israel and the Netherlands, both single national districts with district magnitudes of 120 and 150, respectively. Adding such cases might also give us some additional empirical leverage in determining whether ENPS actually declines after M reaches 15 or so or whether the response function flattens, as would be suggested by organizational ecology theory. The negative density dependence emerging at values of M greater than 15 reported in Figures 2 and 3 suggests that the number of effective parties receiving seats certainly should not increase even if M were to increase to even much greater values than the maximum value of 30 used in our earlier tests. Even with very extreme values of 150 and 120, the effective number of political parties in Israel and the Netherlands should be about the same as those found in countries with M values greater than 15: Portugal, Finland, Bolivia, Luxemburg, the Czech Republic, Italy, and Austria.            "
"44","And as seen in Figure 4, they are. District magnitude explains essentially none of the variance in ENPS for cases of M greater than 15. The ENPS values of Israel and the Netherlands nestle quite comfortably at about the mean values of the variable for the other seven cases with much lower levels of district magnitude. All are at the carrying capacity of their political systems for political parties, implying crowding within the electoral space that effectively blocks further increases in party density. While this observation is not new, the standard model's emphasis on strategic voting and the generalized Duverger M + 1 rule whisk away the cases of Israel and the Netherlands under the rug of LogM. From an organizational ecology perspective, in contrast, they highlight a vital test implication of a more general model of party system density.            "
"45","By unpacking the LogM term of the standard model, we have found not one system of party density, but four relatively distinct worlds. There is Duverger's (1954) world of single‐member districts where a district magnitude of 1 produces, unless cleavages otherwise provide niches for specialist parties, only two political parties. Then there is Cox's (1997) twilight world of low district magnitude in which party numbers are weakly suppressed below what M alone might allow because of the continued influence of strategic voting of either the strong form suggested by Cox (1997) or the less demanding version offered here emphasizing the likelihood of a coalition, the impact of which nevertheless ebbs rather quickly. The third world—from M 5 to M 15 or so—is the exclusive province of Lijphart's (1990) generalized M + 1 rule in which only district magnitude matters. And finally, there is the as yet unexplored world of cases with M greater than 15 in which M plays little role in determining party density. But while these worlds are very different, we have seen that they might be effectively subsumed under a more general organizational ecology model of party system density in which different kinds of constraints operate under different environmental conditions.         "
"46","While not addressing all of the problems of the standard model, our organizational ecology model has value.22 First, it effectively accounts for—indeed, theoretically incorporates—the existing work on party density. Strategic voting (of some form) and the M + 1 rule still matter. Second, our interpretation accounts—if only empirically at this point—for anomalies that the standard model either effectively ignores by recourse to the logged measurement of district magnitude and/or by too readily dismissing some extreme cases as exceptional when, on the face of it, they behave quite similarly to several other cases the model purports to account for. Especially important in this regard are the cases of single national districts and the high levels of density dependence observed in Figure 4 at even more moderate levels of district magnitude. Finally, the broader, organizational ecology model used here suggests that we should bring party system density into the larger research program on organizational populations of all kinds.         "
"47","The most important step in adapting the organizational ecology model to the case of party system density entails theoretically explaining the negative density dependence of party systems in cases of M greater than 15. In doing so, organizational ecology would highlight vital environmental resources that set the carrying capacities of polities for political parties. Our intuition is that the critical resources are the issues parties use to meaningfully differentiate themselves. Parties attract voters with issues (Schlesinger 1984, 383). Downs even asserted that “parties formulate policies in order to win elections rather than win elections to formulate policies” (1957, 28). But if, in contrast to the strategic voting interpretation of voters as clairvoyant calculators of electoral odds, they are poorly informed and generally inattentive to politics (Converse 1964; Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Luskin 2002; Macdonald, Rabinowitz, and Listhaug 1998), then it will be increasingly difficult for parties to attract their attention as numbers of parties increase (Huber, Kernell, and Leoni 2005). This will especially be true for new parties, which explains why office seekers rely on established parties (Aldrich 1995, 49–56).         "
"48","While the density of the issue set facing a nation may ebb and flow, there are real limits to the issue agenda practically available to politicians to differentiate themselves. While party entrepreneurs will look for new issues with which to attract voter attention and mobilize their support (Rabinowitz and Macdonald 1989), a growing body of work suggests that agenda space is itself limited (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Jones and Baumgartner 2005) and that it is very difficult for newcomers to displace older parties even when new issues arise (Rohrschneider 1993). Given the inattention of voters and the limited supply of issues available to parties to distinguish themselves, the density of the political party system itself will act as an increasingly powerful drag on further party formation even as the potential number of survivable parties increases. This provides us, fortunately, with important test implications for further research. That is, for those cases beyond the M = 15 limit, we should see that existing parties die at higher rates as the size of the available issue agenda contracts. Further, we should see new parties form more readily when the issue agenda expands and prospective parties take advantage of their thereby enhanced capacity to differentiate themselves before voters.
