"1","The theory of negativity and turnout presented here relies on Geer's definition of a negative ad; this definition focuses on explicit criticisms of opponents:2"
"2","                              "
"3","It is simple and straightforward: negativity is any criticism leveled by one candidate against another during a campaign. Under this definition there is no gray area. An appeal in a campaign either raises doubts about the opposition (i.e., negative) or states why the candidate is worthy of your vote (i.e., positive). There is no middle category. Note that this definition does not speak to whether the criticism is about policy or about traits. Any type of criticism counts as negativity. (2006, 23)"
"4","This is a tonal definition that makes a clear distinction between negative and positive ads.3 Relying on Geer's definition, I will be able to discern whether a negative tone—regardless of the ad's substantive content—can have an effect on an individual's likelihood of turning out to vote.            "
"5","The first step to understanding why negativity may have the capacity to affect voter turnout is considering how negativity interacts with an individual's decision process during a campaign. Considering the individual's decision process is critical for two reasons. First, recent findings about the nuances of an individual's decision process suggest that this process will have important consequences for an individual's ultimate voting behavior (Lau and Redlawsk 2006). Second, understanding why and under what conditions negativity may affect an individual's decision process in such a way as to discourage the individual from voting will be helpful when searching for empirical evidence of this demobilizing power. While many scholars have applied a process‐based approach to analyses of individual political decision making, many such approaches have focused on attitudes and choice, rather than action (Lau and Redlawsk 2006; Taber and Lodge 2006). Relying on the psychology of decision making, this section explores the decision process in full, continuing past choice to action.            "
"6","An individual's decision process has two parts: selection and action (Svenson 1992). In the first phase, an individual considers his alternatives, determines which alternative is best, and makes his selection. In the second part of the decision process, an individual works to translate his selection into a tangible action (Dholakia and Bagozzi 2002; Svenson 1996). Thus, in a given campaign process an individual will first select which candidate he prefers. Then, he will begin the second phase of decision making: acting on his selection with a vote. Here the first part of the decision process will be referred to as the selection phase and the second part of the decision process as the post‐selection phase. This research focuses on the post‐selection phase, as negativity is most likely to be demobilizing in this second phase. Nonetheless, it is important to first briefly discuss the selection phase as a means of contrasting the role of negativity in the two parts of a decision process.            "
"7","Selection Phase The two parts of the decision process have different end‐goals. During the first part—selection—an individual seeks to discover the best alternative. Not only that, but as Svenson writes, “the goal of [the first part of the decision process] is not only to select the best alternative, but an alternative that is sufficiently differentiated from its closest competitor” (1992, 150). Thus, in order to complete selection, an individual must reach a place where he believes one alternative is sufficiently better than the other. Moreover, reaching selection also often leads the individual to develop a dislike for the unselected alternative—further ensuring that the ultimate selection stands out as the better of the two choices (Simon et al. 2001; Svenson 1992).               "
"8","During the first phase of decision making, negativity can be useful for reaching a selection. Negativity “may be especially useful to voters in developing their images (i.e., mental pictures) of candidates, and in differentiating or discriminating between those candidate images”(Garramone et al. 1990, 301). Further, negativity is more diagnostic than positivity and can work to ease the differentiation process (Riskey and Birnbaum 1974; Skowronski and Carlston 1989; Yzerbyt and Leyens 1991). Finally, it is usually negativity—rather than positivity—that leads an individual to believe that he has enough information to make a selection (Skowronski and Carlson 1989).4"
"9","Post‐selection Phase Negativity will not always be helpful. In particular, the role of negativity changes after a selection is made. Once a selection is made, the individual moves to the second part of the decision process: the post‐selection phase. Much of the existing research on voting decision processes stops at the end of the selection, assuming that a choice signifies the end of the decision process. While some scholars do consider how individuals evaluate their selections, existing research on political decision making has yet to understand the centrality of the post‐selection phase to individual behavior. The approach used here, however, brings this post‐selection phase to the forefront by focusing on the crucial role negativity plays after a person has already made a selection.               "
"10","The post‐selection phase focuses on action. While the purpose of the first phase was to consider the available alternatives and differentiate to select the most attractive one, the purpose of the post‐selection phase is to enact the selection (Gollwitzer 1996). It is during this second phase of a decision process, then, that individuals begin to consider how they might actually implement their selections (Bagozzi and Dholakia 1999; Sheeran 2002). As a result, it is during this second phase that the costs and benefits of action come into sharp focus (Busemeyer and Towensend 1993). As Busemeyer and Towensend write, “as the possibility of action increases, the attention to its consequences increases” (1993, 442). As a result, the outcome of a decision process may be such that a person will prefer one alternative to another, will make a selection, but will never actually implement his selection with an action. Indeed, evidence shows that this is the case in numerous decision contexts (Orbell and Sheeran 2000).               "
"11","During this post‐selection phase, exposure to new negativity about his selected candidate can lead an individual to believe that his selected candidate is no different and no better than the candidate he already knows he dislikes. Since an individual selected one alternative over another because he considered it superior to the unselected alternative, negativity can place that perception of superiority in doubt (Svenson 1992). Once an individual no longer believes that the candidate he selected is any different or better than the candidate he dislikes, he has no reason to turn out and vote (Downs 1957). In other words, an individual still prefers one candidate over the other—but not enough to actually turn out and vote. Thus, negativity will be demobilizing under two conditions: (1) if an individual is exposed to negativity after he has already made a selection and (2) if the negativity is about his selected alternative."
"12","The structure of the voting decision is particularly conducive for this process. In a voting decision, an individual can make a selection at any point in the campaign, but he may not be able to act on this selection by casting a vote until weeks later. This institutionalized temporal gap between selection and action creates an extended post‐selection phase that allows the voter to receive new information after the voter has selected a candidate, but before the voter has had the chance to act on that selection with an irreversible action. Even states that allow no‐excuse early voting may create this temporal gap between selection and action, as even early voting is only allowed at a predetermined date prior to the election.5"
"13","Psychologically, this is a simple process—one that does not require a lot of cognitive effort on the part of the individual. Attention to new information even after selection is quite natural, especially when an individual has yet to implement the selection with an irreversible action (Frey and Rosch 1984). Furthermore, it is likely that after selection, much of the individual's focus will be on ads about the selected candidate, as evidence shows that individuals generally look for incoming information about their selections, rather than the alternatives they did not select (Johnson and Russo 1984; also Campbell and Keller 2003). Finally, candidates frequently rely on negative ads, suggesting that an individual does not have to work particularly hard to observe this form of campaigning. In short, the voting decision has a built‐in opportunity for a person to receive negativity after he or she has made a selection and a person will be exposed to new negative ads during a campaign without exerting much effort.               "
"14","In its initial state, the theory presented here relies on a precise measure of an individual's selection time. This is something scholars can control and obtain in an experimental setting. While measuring this precise selection point is important, it is nonetheless helpful to translate the main theoretical prediction to the broader dynamics of a campaign, where measures of selection time may be less precise. Doing so will increase the generalizability and usability of this approach to identifying the relationship between negativity and turnout. A way to translate the psychological process described above to observe broad patterns in a campaign setting is by considering when during the duration of a campaign the majority of individuals make their candidate selections. Holbrook (1996) finds that over the years 1952 to 1992, by early October most voters have already selected which candidate they prefer. While Holbrook's data come from surveys of individuals who turned out to vote, more recent data confirm that even those who did not end up turning out to vote also made their selections at a similar time. Data from the 2000 National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES) reinforce this point. During a round of interviews conducted in late September 2000, around 67% of respondents indicated that they had selected a candidate. During a different interview wave, conducted in early October 2000, the percentage of respondents who made selections grew to nearly 75%.6 Also strengthening this argument are Hillygus and Jackman (2003), who rely on a panel dataset from Knowledge Networks. Their results show that in the 2000 election, there was little change in candidate preference after the first presidential debate—which took place on October 3 of that campaign.7"
"15","If negativity is indeed most demobilizing after an individual has made a selection, and any given individual has a higher likelihood of having made a selection by the beginning of October, translating the psychology of decision making to the campaign setting leads to the following prediction:"
"16","                              "
"17","Negativity will be most demobilizing under two conditions: (1) if it is about the individual's selected candidate and (2) it is aired in October of an election year."
"18","Undoubtedly, considering the precise point of selection is the most direct way to analyze the demobilizing role of negativity in later points of an individual's decision process; however, focusing on the timing of the ads also has some benefits. First, a prediction based on the timing of ads makes this approach applicable to a wide variety of observational data—even data that are not precise in measuring a respondent's selection state.8 Second, considering the role of negativity in this way will allow for a more direct comparison between the approach used in this research and those of past studies.            "
"19","Two tests explore the way timing affects the relationship between negativity and turnout. The first test focuses on the 2004 election and merges the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES) with advertising data for the same campaign from the Wisconsin Advertising Project. These data can produce estimates of the amount of negativity in each individual's media market, making it well suited for estimating an individual's potential for exposure to negativity. The second test combines the American National Election Study (ANES) with John Geer's ad data to consider negativity over elections 1976 to 2000. Relying on a different data combination, this second test acts both as a complement to and a check on the analysis of the 2004 election and offers a direct comparison to existing research on negativity and turnout. Together these two tests consider the relationship between negativity, timing, and turnout under different electoral conditions, yet lead to the same conclusion: negativity is most likely to demobilize after selection. As the two tests presented in detail here are observational, the empirical section concludes with a discussion of the role experimental work can play in the analysis of timing and negativity."
"20","Data about individual characteristics in the 2004 presidential election come from the NAES.9 Data about advertisements aired during the 2004 campaign come from the Wisconsin Advertising Project (Goldstein and Rivlin 2007).10 This dataset was built using advertising tracking data provided by the Campaign Media Advertising Group (CMAG) and coded for content at the University of Wisconsin. In total, CMAG tracked the top media markets in America in 2004. The data provide information about the content of the advertisement, the date the advertisement was aired, the media market in which the advertisement was aired, as well as the number of times each advertisement aired. In short, the Wisconsin data are the most thorough compendium of advertisements aired in 2004. The NAES data and the Wisconsin data were merged by the respondent's media market, meaning the combined dataset can offer an estimate of the amount of negativity aired in each respondent's media market.            "
"21","Negativity The Wisconsin Advertising Project codes all ads for content. Following Franz et al. (2007), ads are considered negative if they are characterized by the Wisconsin researchers as containing a negative appeal. This approach to negativity also follows from both the theoretical argument and Geer's (2006) definition: even if an advertisement contains some promotion of the sponsoring candidate, so long as the advertisement also contains a direct criticism of the opposing candidate it is still offering negativity.                  "
"22","The test of the timing prediction specified above relies on two categories of variables. These two categories of variables are described below and are further summarized in Table 1.                  "
"23","                        Category 1: Overall Negativity:                         The first category of measures does not account for timing. This set of measures takes two forms. The first—“overall negativity”—is simply the total percentage of negative ads aired over the course of the campaign. This variable does not consider the timing of airing, nor the candidate targeted in each ad. In this way, it serves as an initial contrast to the conditional approach.                  "
"24","The second form of the overall measure—“overall targeted negativity”—does take the target of the ads into account, producing two variables: (1) percentage of negativity over the course of the campaign about the respondent's preferred candidate and (2) the percentage of negativity over the course of the entire campaign about the other candidate.                  "
"25","                        Category 2: Late Negativity:                          The second category of measures is “late targeted negativity.” This is the amount of negativity shown after October 1, 2004, about both the respondent's preferred candidate and the other candidate, where the respondent's preferred candidate is determined through a candidate preference measure in the NAES. The late targeted negativity measure is composed of two separate variables: (1) the percentage of all ads shown after October 1 that contained negativity about the respondent's preferred candidate and (2) the percentage of all ads shown after October 1 that contained negativity about the other candidate. These variables combine both the timing and target conditions of the main prediction. In fact, following the main prediction, only negativity about the respondent's preferred candidate should have a significant demobilizing effect on voter turnout. When relying on these late negativity variables, controls are included to account for early negativity.11"
"26","Taken together, both categories serve to offer a complete test of the main prediction of this research. The variables in the first category are designed to ensure that a significant relationship between negativity and turnout is observed only when the key specified conditions for demobilization are met, while the second category actually tests the key prediction."
"27","Controls In addition to the measures of negativity, controls include the traditional determinants of turnout, using Rosentone and Hansen (1993) as a foundation. These variables include a set of demographic characteristics (age, race, education, income, gender, employment status, church attendance, and years at current residence) and political characteristics (strength of partisanship and efficacy). The Rosentone and Hansen (1993) model is modified to include measures of interest, attentiveness, and other political involvement. A detailed listing of all control variables is included in Appendix A.                  "
"28","In addition to these traditional control variables, several sets of controls are specific to the task at hand: (1) state competitiveness, (2) exposure to advertising, and (3) volume of advertising."
"29","The measure of state competitiveness comes from Shaw (2006). Shaw considers campaign strategy and predicts state competitiveness using interviews with operatives from both the Kerry and Bush campaigns. Relying on these interviews, he classifies each state as a battleground, a “possible leaner,” solidly Republican, or solidly Democrat. Shaw's classification produces the following controls: states that both campaigns classified as battleground are coded as 1; states that one of the campaigns classified as battleground are coded as 0.75; states that both campaigns classified as “possible leaners” are coded as 0.5; states that one of the campaigns classified as “possible leaners” are coded as 0.25; states that both campaigns agreed are solidly one party or the other are coded as 0. As Shaw (2006, Table 4.5) shows, states classified as 1 are receiving the most attention from the candidates and states classified as 0 are receiving the least.                  "
"30","Controlling for exposure is a more complicated task. Relying on previous approaches to negativity, exposure is estimated using an individual's media use habits, the percentage of negativity, and the volume of negativity. Volume in this case is the total number of ads shown in a particular media market, under the assumption that the more total ads, the more likely is an individual to have been exposed to advertising. This approach follows from Finkel and Geer (1998), who include the proportion of negativity and control for television habits, as well as Brader and Corrigan (2006), who estimate volume as the total number of ads in each media market. Although this is a useful approach, it is not the only approach to measuring exposure. Therefore, in order to ensure that this result is robust to changes in measurement of exposure, a separate model conceives of exposure in a different manner. Specifically, this additional model uses the measure of exposure discussed in Franz et al. (2007), a measure which relies on a combination of ad volume and estimates of individual viewing habits for specific TV programs. I discuss this additional conception of exposure in greater detail when I discuss the overall robustness of my results.                  "
"31","The key dependent variable is reported turnout. Although this variable is susceptible to various errors—in particular overreports—as Hillygus notes, “although it is important to recognize such overreporting, research has largely concluded that it is of little consequence” (2005, 56). Moreover, the key factors that lead individuals to misrepresent their voting behavior have little relationship to the hypothesis tested here (see Vavreck 2007 for a discussion of factors that affect overreporting). As a result, it is quite unlikely that the relationships observed in this study are a function of errors in the turnout variable. Indeed, it is more likely that the observed effects may even grow stronger if all voters reported their behavior truthfully. For a discussion of the usefulness of self‐reported turnout measures, see Hillygus (2005).12"
"32","The key prediction of this research is analyzed through a three‐part test that follows from the models laid out in Table 1. Each part of the test relies on a model estimated using logistic regression with clustered standard errors. The clustered standard errors serve to deal with any differences in state campaign experiences left unaccounted for by control variables.               "
"33","Estimating Model 1 shows that overall negativity has a null effect on turnout in the 2004 presidential election (Table 2, Model 1). While the coefficient on the overall negativity variable is negative, it does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. These results are in line with Finkel and Geer (1998), as well as Lau and Pomper (2004), and show that increases in the negativity in a respondent's media market over the entire duration of the campaign did not have any effect on his likelihood of turning out to vote in 2004. The rest of the control variables perform in a manner similar to other studies of voter turnout. The similarity of the rest of the model to previous results suggests that the null effect of negativity is not simply an issue of model specification or a function of the particular data used in this analysis.            "
"34","Model 2 offers a refinement of Model 1 by considering the target of negativity, though it still does not account for the timing of the negativity (Table 2, Model 2). Even when considered by target, negativity does not have a significant effect on voter turnout. Reinforcing this first set of results are the substantive effects of these estimates, shown in Table 3. Here, changes in turnout as a function of increases in overall negativity are statistically indistinguishable from 0. In short, these results show that negativity without timing does not have an effect on turnout—even when this negativity is distinguished by target. These results set the stage for a comparison to Model 3, which considers both timing and target.            "
"35","The results of estimating Model 3 show that only late negativity about a person's preferred candidate has a statistically significant, negative effect on turnout. Negativity about the other candidate, however, has a null effect on a person's likelihood of turnout. As predicted, it is not negativity in general that has an effect on turnout—but negativity under two specific conditions: (1) negativity after a selection and (2) negativity about an individual's selected candidate. All results are shown in Table 2.            "
"36","Table 3 reinforces the results above, showing the change in likelihood of turnout due to an increase in negativity. When negativity increases from 0% of all late ads to 40% of all late ads in a media market, for example, likelihood of turnout decreases by 0.087. An increase to 60% negativity in a media market will decrease the likelihood of turnout by 0.145. In contrast to the changes in likelihood that result from increases in overall negativity, these changes in likelihood of turnout are statistically significant.13"
"37","The robustness of these results is considered in several ways. The first reconsideration takes on exposure. As discussed earlier, there are numerous ways to measure exposure. While the model above relies on an approach which separates the proportion of negativity and the volume of negativity, another approach is to combine the two in a measure of exposure. This conception of exposure follows from Franz et al. (2007). In order to consider an individual's likelihood of seeing ads, Franz et al. measure the number of ads shown during particular programs and then consider whether an individual reported watching the program. The result is a measure where the number of ads shown during a specific program is multiplied by an individual's self‐reported viewing of said program. The number of days a week a respondent viewed Jeopardy, for example, is multiplied by the number of ads shown during Jeopardy. The various program estimates are then added together to form one exposure measure. This conception relies on fine‐grained measures of television viewing habits. While the 2004 NAES does not provide such measures, the 2000 ANES (the dataset which Franz et al. 2007 use in their analyses) provides a rich set of viewer‐pattern measures, including the frequency with which the respondent watches programs such as Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, morning news, daytime programs, evening news, late‐night programs, and network news. As a result, the 2000 ANES data are used to reestimate the key models relying on the same exposure measure as Franz et al. (2007). Specifically, I calculate the number of negative ads shown either over the entire course of the campaign or late in the campaign during specific programs and multiply these numbers by the individual's reported television habits. The results, which are shown in Appendix B, are consistent with the main hypothesis. The coefficient on late negativity about the selected candidate is negative, and this is the only coefficient on a negativity variable to reach statistical significance (p ≤ 0.05); in contrast, overall negativity does not have a significant effect on voter turnout. In sum, it is late negativity about the selected candidate that is significant and demobilizing.14"
"38","Another consideration is the specification of the models. More precisely, since different approaches to estimating campaign effects and turnout patterns rely on different sets of controls, the goal is to ensure that the results are robust to changes in control variables. To address questions of specification, the key models are reestimated with different specifications found in existing literature. These new specifications stem from models that estimate the effect of negativity on turnout (Finkel and Geer 1998; Kahn and Kenney 1999), analyze the effect of advertising in general (Franz et al. 2007), or focus on participation (Rosentone and Hansen 1993). Further, in addition to altering the variable specifications, a robustness check also includes using alternative estimation techniques. Extrapolating from Ansolabehere, Iyengar, and Simon (1999), for example, I estimate a two‐stage model that first predicts the likelihood of a media market receiving advertising and then estimates the effect of that advertising. Finally, a model relying on random effects accounts for the possibility of different campaigning techniques within different media markets. The tests are detailed in Appendix 1W.15 All six additional tests point to the same conclusion as Table 2: negativity about the selected candidate matters late in the campaign.16"
"39","The next step in testing the conditional relationship between negativity and turnout is to consider the post‐selection effect of negativity using a different combination of observational data. In this section, Finkel and Geer's (1998) study will serve as a foundation for an analysis of seven presidential elections from 1976 to 2000. In their original analysis, Finkel and Geer set out to reconsider previous empirical results on the demobilizing effect of negativity (e.g., Ansolabehere et al. 1994; Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995), arguing that “there is little theoretical reason to expect a powerful, systematic relationship between advertising tone and voter turnout” (1998, 575). Focusing on elections 1960 to 1992, the authors find that negative advertisements have no demobilizing effect on voter turnout. Following Finkel and Geer, this next test relies on a combination of the ANES and John Geer's ad data to reconsider Finkel and Geer's findings by accounting for the timing and target of negative ads.            "
"40","While this new dataset brings its own set of advantages and disadvantages (both of which are discussed in more detail below), it acts as an important check for two reasons. First, the broader time period of elections 1976 to 2000 works to ensure that the results observed above are not unique to the 2004 election. Second, the negativity estimates in this second analysis are based on Geer's coding of campaign ads, which will ensure that the results obtained in the first section of this article are not a function of the Wisconsin Advertising Project's specific coding mechanism."
"41","Data and Methods The ad data used in this analysis come from John Geer's database of presidential campaign advertisements.17 These advertisements are coded for various characteristics, including negativity. This is the same data that Finkel and Geer (1998) use in their analysis. While Finkel and Geer look at elections 1960 to 1992, this analysis focuses on years 1976 to 2000 as Geer's dataset has dates18 for advertisements aired during these years. Data about individual behavior during these elections come from the ANES. Geer's data and the ANES are merged by year of election.               "
"42","It is important to note that this combination of data does not allow for estimates of the number of ads aired in each media market—estimates that can be obtained using the earlier combination of NAES and Wisconsin ad data. As a results, estimates of exposure will be less precise than in the first analysis, leading to potentially statistically weaker results. While this is limiting, this second analysis is nonetheless helpful in three ways. First, as mentioned above, it works as a complement to and a check on my first analysis. Second, it serves to compare the approach used here directly to previous research on negativity and turnout. Finally, due to the lack of media market–level estimation, this second analysis serves as an extraordinarily conservative test of my hypothesis."
"43","Ads are considered negative following the same approach as applied to the Wisconsin data—if they include any negativity. Further, this second analysis relies on the same key variables as the 2004 analysis—only now re‐created with Geer's data. These variables are detailed in Table 1. Again these variables focus on overall negativity, negativity by target, and, finally, negativity that considers both timing and target. Once again, late negativity is coded as negativity aired after the majority of the electorate have made selections—after October 1 of the particular election year.               "
"44","The rest of the controls in this model are similar to those used to analyze the 2004 campaign, allowing for differences in questions between the NAES and the ANES. In particular, the ANES did not include questions about late‐night comedy and Internet usage over the years used in this analysis. In addition, as there are a number of different years included in this analysis, there are more election‐contextual variables to control for various differences in the political (and survey) environment."
"45","Following the 2004 analysis, this second test again relies on three models: Model 1 looks at overall negativity, Model 2 divides negativity by target without considering timing, and Model 3 accounts for both timing and target.19 If these results follow from predictions—and if these results are similar to those observed earlier—negativity will only have a significant effect on turnout when the two focal conditions for demobilization are met.               "
"46","Results The results of this second test follow the same pattern as those obtained with the 2004 data. First, the control variables behave in a similar manner to the control variables in both Finkel and Geer (1998) and Rosentone and Hansen (1993). Turning to the focal variables of this analysis, negativity over the duration of the campaign does not have a statistically significant effect on voter turnout (Table 4, Model 1). Moreover, even when the target of the negativity is considered (Table 4, Model 2), negativity still does not lead to a significant effect on turnout. Finally, as predicted, negativity still only has a significant negative effect on turnout when timing and target are jointly considered (Table 4, Model 3).               "
"47","Much like the coefficient estimates, the substantive results reinforce the conclusion that it is late negativity that targets the individual's preferred candidate that leads to significant changes in the likelihood of turnout (Table 3). Increases in negativity about the preferred candidate decrease turnout likelihood by as much as 6 percentage points; even more importantly, the decrease in turnout is statistically significant. In contrast, the substantive effects of negativity about the other candidate, as well as overall negativity, are statistically indistinguishable from 0. Looking at Table 3, however, it is clear that the results of this analysis are marginally weaker in the differentiation of negativity by target than the results of first analysis and lead to smaller substantive effects. This is likely due to the structure of the data, which relies on lower geographic precision than the 2004 analysis. Nevertheless, these results still showcase the same important pattern: negativity is only demobilizing under certain specific conditions.20"
"48","The observational data presented above show that negativity plays a key role at a late point in a campaign. This finding speaks to the broader theoretical argument: negativity is most likely to be demobilizing after a selection is made. Although observational data are a key part of the negativity and turnout debate (Goldstein and Freedman 2002), an additional way to consider the relationship between negativity, selection, and turnout is through an experimental approach. Existing experimental research in psychology already suggests that negativity can dissuade individuals from acting on their selections. In these experimental and field studies—ranging in focus from health behavior to purchasing intentions—scholars of marketing and psychology asked participants to make choices or commit to taking certain actions (Dholakia and Bagozzi 2003; Orbell and Sheeran 2000; Simon et al. 2001). The results of these studies are consistent: encountering direct negativity—or other day‐to‐day events which created obstacles—decreased the chance for action. In fact, as Bagozzi and Dholakia note, “in many cases, especially when there is a time gap between intention formation and action initiation, impediments to the enaction of the action … may occur” (1999, 29). Following this approach, a study which varies the timing of exposure while keeping content of ads constant could shed light on the relationship between timing, negativity, and turnout. Elsewhere, I conducted just such a study relying on a national sample of adults. This study showed that individuals assigned to receive negative campaign statements post‐selection were less likely to report that they would turn out and vote than those who received the same negativity pre‐selection. More detail on this study is available in Krupnikov (2009). Further, a check on this initial experiment shows that only post‐selection negativity leads to this type of demobilization. In a second national study, individuals were offered positive statements after selection; these positive statements had little effect on reported likelihood of turnout (Krupnikov 2009).            "
"49","Relying on a theory that incorporates the psychology of decision making with patterns in campaign dynamics, this research shows that negativity cannot be expected to have the same effect over the duration of a campaign—negativity is most likely to be demobilizing at a certain time. As the analysis of the 2004 election shows, negativity is most likely to demobilize when it is transmitted late in the campaign (after most people have likely made selections) and when it is about the candidate the individual prefers. Acting as a check on the 2004 results, the analysis of elections 1976 through 2000 shows a similar pattern: negativity can be demobilizing, but only under certain conditions. The fact that relying on two very different sources of data leads to the same pattern further reinforces the highly conditional effect of negativity.21"
"50","This research examined the role of negativity, showing that exposure to negativity after selection can derail action by convincing individuals that their selection is no better than the alternative they already know they do not like. In clarifying the conditions under which negativity can demobilize voters, this research works to resolve the existing empirical conflict in the negativity and turnout literature. The reanalysis of Finkel and Geer (1998) stands as an example of this resolution. While using an overall measure of negativity replicates Finkel and Geer's initial null findings, incorporating timing into the model suggests that negativity does have a demobilizing effect. In short, accounting for the conditions under which negativity can demobilize clarifies previous results.22"
"51","While this finding helps shed important light on a decade‐long disagreement in political science, it has broader implications than negativity and turnout. As research on general campaign effects has shown, some individuals make candidate selections early on in the campaign process (Holbrook 1996). As a result, scholars have suggested that while a campaign may not have wide influence over the entire voter population, candidates' efforts may work best to influence “the undecideds”—or voters who, according to polls, still have not chosen their preferred candidate. This focus on the undecideds is not simply a theoretical argument; during a campaign the mainstream media devotes a great deal of attention to this group of voters (Rohter and Zeleny 2008). While there is no doubt that the undecideds are an important part of an electoral outcome, the theoretical framework presented here suggests that the decideds—the voters who may initially seem immovable—may be just as malleable as the undecideds. Simply making a selection does not mean that an individual will act on this selection; indeed, the malleability of the decideds comes from the demobilizing power of information after election.         "
"52","More broadly, however, the theoretical framework and the findings presented here have important implications for analyses of the relationship between political communication and political behavior. In particular, the effect new political information has on individual behavior may be considered in two ways: (1) the effect of information on choice and (2) its effect on action. While negativity provides a crucial example, the psychological work cited in this research extends to other forms of political information. Countless political actors, candidates for office, government agencies, interest groups, media outlets, and even friends and neighbors in individuals' networks consistently seek to change individual behavior by providing new information. Sometimes the goal is to encourage limited, one‐time actions (a small donation, a form letter to a senator); other times the goal is to create broad political action (becoming an active political volunteer). When will new information create the desired effect? While some information may lead individuals to form opinions or preferences, it may serve no purpose in ensuring that these individuals act on these preferences. In contrast, while some information may do little to strengthen preferences, it may dramatically increase the likelihood of action if presented after a preference is formed. In this way, this study of the way negativity leads individuals away from voting sets the foundation for a broader analysis of the role political communication plays in translating individual political preferences into political action."
