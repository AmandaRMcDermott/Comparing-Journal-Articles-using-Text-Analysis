"1","It is generally assumed that parties' policy shifts are minor and infrequent. Several explanations have been proposed for why this is the case. First, movement may be discouraged because of radical uncertainty about the electorate's reaction (Budge 1994). Risk‐averse voters may punish parties that greatly shift their policies. It is also argued that movement can be limited because of a broader ideological constraint (Enelow and Hinich 1984). Adherence to a certain broader ideology attracts a group of supporters that may be alienated by such moves (Adams et al. 2004). Policy shifts may also threaten the willingness of party activists and interest organizations to provide campaign resources (Miller and Schofield 2003); they may encourage new parties to develop (Palfrey 1984), alter voters' decision rules, and increase voter uncertainty—all of which may prove harmful to the party (Alvarez and Nagler 2002; Stokes 2001).         "
"2","Some studies argue explicitly that there is little ideological movement because parties cannot adequately predict how movements will shape their electoral fortunes. Polls may be useful in identifying certain issues as important to electors, but they do not provide information as to whether these issues will necessarily affect votes (Budge 1994). This suggests that the link between changing policy position and the number of votes gained, even if the policy shift corresponds to a change in voter preferences, is not necessarily straightforward. In any event, the arguments presented in these studies would lead one to believe that policy shifts are inhibited by the potential threat of an electoral loss.         "
"3","At the same time, there is also some evidence that parties do change their policy positions and that they do respond to some movements in public opinion on the general left‐right ideological scale (Adams et al. 2004). It has also been argued that voters' preferences fluctuate considerably at least on economic policies (Durr 1995; Stevenson 2001), which further suggests that parties have strong incentives not to stay put. In a similar vein, Kollman et al. (1992) and Laver (2005) argue that party competition should be understood as a dynamic process where parties constantly adjust their policy positions. That is, parties are in constant search of more electorally beneficial spatial positions, and their moves in the policy space are guided by previous or anticipated election results. These studies thus paint a picture of an unstable and dynamic electoral arena—a picture according to which parties' policy shifts attempt to follow voters' preference shifts and the success rate of this attempt is reflected in votes.1"
"4","The two sets of studies provide very different predictions as to whether policy shifts are potentially electorally beneficial.2 Yet, we still lack empirical evidence about whether and when shifting policy positions leads to vote gains. A recent article by Adams et al. (2006) tackles the effect of policy shifts on vote totals with a specific focus on differences between niche and mainstream parties. This study, as most empirical studies on policy shifts to date, however, concentrates on the “super issue” of left‐right ideology. Yet change on different types of issues may trigger very different reactions from voters. Looking beyond the super issue into specific policy domains may provide a fuller picture of the electoral consequences of policy shifts.         "
"5","The theoretical argument in this article is based on the recognition that issues can be divided into two groups: issues that are more principled in nature versus those that are more pragmatic, and that voter utility is different for each type of issue. The existing literature on party competition has widely recognized the presence of an economic versus a social issue dimension within the cross‐national cross‐party context (Andrews and Money 2003; Laver 2001; Laver and Hunt 1992; van der Brug 1999; see also Kitschelt 1994; Kitschelt et al. 1999). The former is generally associated with economic policy choices or issues interpreted in material terms, while the latter refers to value‐based social and cultural issues. Public opinion research has suggested that these different domains activate different cognitions for voters (Domke, Shah, and Wackman 1998; Gangl 2003; Shah, Domke, and Wackman 1996). That is, considerations that underlie issues that are commonly interpreted in material or pragmatic terms include economics, expedience, practicality, or personal self‐interest. Considerations that underlie issues that are commonly interpreted in principled or ethical terms are very different and include human rights, religious morals, or personal principles (Domke, Shah, and Wackman 1998; Gangl 2003; Shen 2004).         "
"6","That voters may use domain‐specific considerations in their decision making is also apparent in the comparison of the economic versus social‐psychological approach to studying voting behavior. The former, mostly outcome‐oriented, pragmatic explanations of voting decisions, considers almost exclusively the economic policy domain (Fiorina 1981; see also Lewis‐Beck and Stegmaier 2000). The latter, explaining voters' understanding of issues largely by their core beliefs and values, typically considers very different types of issues—those that concern social and cultural affairs such as welfare, minority rights, race, social justice, health, education, environment, etc. (Feldman 1988; McClosky and Zaller 1984; Raskin 1987; Sniderman 1993; see also Domke, Shah, and Wackman 1998; Shah, Domke, and Wackman 1996).3 Furthermore, the studies of economic voting have explicitly recognized that there are other issue domains where voters do not follow pragmatism—domains that are usually concerned with values and ideology (Fiorina 1981). Similarly, students of political values have recognized that voters may adhere to different decision rules across domains and that some of those rules are less likely to be based on deeply ingrained values than others (van Deth and Scarbrough 1995).4"
"7","Given that people focus on these contrasting considerations in the case of pragmatic versus principled issues, it is also likely that their expectations and reactions to change differ across domains. Principled statements require stability in order to be taken seriously. Trading principles is therefore likely to be perceived as lacking credibility, and rational voters should not vote for such a party. Pragmatism, on the other hand, presumes responsiveness to changing circumstances. A lack of change on pragmatic issues is likely to be seen as a sign of stagnation and unresponsiveness. Again, a rational voter should reject an unresponsive party. A direct implication of these arguments is that policy shifts should be electorally beneficial in the case of pragmatic issues and harmful in the case of principled ones.5"
"8","Consider first the value‐based, principled policy domain. Adhering to certain values serves the purpose of defining a party's identity and helping to build a reputation of commitment, consistency, and probity (Dougan and Munger 1989; Lott 1987). Ideological movement devalues these reputations. Voter concern with ideology, principles, and commitment makes it more important to know where a party stands rather than how well it can respond to certain problems. The expression of values in political discourse is not about achieving pragmatic solutions; rather, it is a commitment device (Dougan and Munger 1989; Kau and Rubin 1981; Lott 1987). Shifting value statements cause cognitive dissonance for voters (see Domke, Shah, and Wackman 1998; Monroe 1995; Swann 1984) and undermine the credibility and commitment of the shifting party. Just as parties are seen as less credible and committed when they attempt to take over an issue that some other party “owns” (Budge and Farlie 1983; Petrocik 1996), they lack credibility and appear uncommitted when they shift their original stances on a principled issue. Policy shifts in the case of principled issues may, thus, not only alienate existing supporters who may feel betrayed by such shifts, but are also likely to repel potential new voters because of the undermined credibility of the party.            "
"9","How principled politics on social issues matters can be illustrated most vividly by the latest presidential election campaign in the United States. Much of the electoral competition between the Democratic Party nominee Senator Kerry and President Bush revolved around the issue of consistency in policy statements. Mr. Kerry faced relentless and well‐targeted efforts to portray him as inconsistent and opportunistic. These claims were first based on his changing position on the war in Iraq, but they were later followed by allegations of “flip‐flopping” on almost all the key social issues that defined the campaign period: gay marriage, abortion, gun control, etc. Mr. Kerry's credibility was undermined by claims that he goes as the wind blows (Cruz 2004). The slightly ridiculous term of “flip‐flopper” suggested that Mr. Kerry has shifted policy positions frequently throughout his career and is therefore weak, indecisive, and more ambitious than principled (Cave 2004). While Kerry's supporters tried to portray him as a pragmatist whose views reflected the complexity of evolving issues, pragmatism was not what voters were looking for on the principled social issues. Indeed, “flip‐flopping” rather than pragmatism seemed to have an impact on voters: Senator Kerry suffered in the polls, and it may have partly been due to changing his mind too frequently—not only during the election campaign, but throughout the past three decades (Ashbee 2005; Cave 2004; Cruz 2004).            "
"10","The example of the 2004 U.S. presidential election, although anecdotal, serves the purpose of illustrating that voters may prefer principles over pragmatism in the case of some value‐based and social issues. Given these principled preferences of voters on social issues, ideological shifts are likely to undermine the credibility of the party and lead to voter withdrawal."
"11","Compared to issues of principle, voter considerations on pragmatic issues are strikingly different. Not values, but economy and practicality in terms of “getting things done” define this domain. The emphasis is on outcomes and not necessarily on the means by which these outcomes are achieved. This pragmatism also has implications on how change is perceived. Indeed, given that economic conditions themselves are subject to change, viable economic policies are not likely to be constant across time. Thus, the economic policies that a party previously adhered to may no longer be viable as circumstances change. Not adjusting one's policies accordingly may be a sign of consistency and commitment, but in the pragmatic policy domain, commitment is not an appropriate strategy as it may become a serious obstacle to achieving the desired results. In this domain, rigid commitment becomes a sign of unresponsiveness. Policy shifts, on the other hand, send a signal of an urgent attempt to adjust to changing circumstances in order to secure the outcome desired by voters."
"12","That voters see policy shifts on pragmatic issues positively is all the more likely given that voter preferences for certain types of economic policies tend to fluctuate according to the actual economic performance (Durr 1993; Stevenson 2001). Studies of economic voting argue that voters acquire certain beliefs about what types of policies are related to what sorts of outcomes (Pattie and Johnston 2001) and can vote prospectively based on the promise of viable economic policies (McKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1992; see also Andersen, Tilley, and Heath 2005; Przeworski, Stokes, and Manin 1999). At different times, these viable economic policies can be quite ideologically different. Durr (1993) demonstrates in the case of the United States that when the economy expands, aggregate policy preferences move left, yet when the economy contracts, these preferences move right, further suggesting that on pragmatic issues, voters favor policy adjustments over ideological commitment. Stevenson (2001) confirms this result cross‐nationally.            "
"13","There is also some suggestive evidence that favoring adjustments is likely to lead to an active response, i.e., to rewarding parties' policy shifts on the economic dimension. Stokes (1999) has argued in the case of Latin American democracies that changing one's economic policy once in office is electorally beneficial if the change constitutes the best response to the actual economic circumstances. Responding in an operative manner to the economic conditions minimizes any negative effects from retrospective voting and actually corresponds to the preferences of performance‐oriented voters (Stokes 1999).            "
"14","In sum, on pragmatic or economic issues, voters may perceive ideological dogmatism about policy alternatives as a sign of unresponsiveness, and they may reject stability and tenacity. On the other hand, the extent to which policy shifts on pragmatic issues reflect an attempt to tackle the constantly changing real‐life economic conditions, movements in this domain should be rewarded at the polling booths."
"15","The two main axes of political competition in advanced democracies—economic and social—acquire inherently different roles in the voting decisions of the public. In the case of the latter, voters expect consistency. Change on principled issues is unexpected and threatens the credibility of the party. This, in turn, is likely to alienate ideological loyalists as well as repel new voters. Policy shifts on principled issues should thus be associated with aggregate vote loss for the shifting party. On the contrary, on pragmatic issues, change is a sign of responsiveness and does not constitute a threat to the party's credibility. Responsiveness to changing circumstances, in turn, should be attractive to both old supporters and new voters and amount to an aggregate increase in the vote totals of the shifting party.6"
"16","In order for the theoretical argument to be valid, the following implications should hold. First, policy shifts on the economic domain should be related to vote gains compared to the previous election. Second, policy shifts on the social domain should be related to vote losses compared to the previous election. Further, given that policy shifts may have such opposite effects on vote totals in the case of different issue domains, there is no clear prediction about the electoral effect of policy shifts aggregated into the left‐right super issue. In order to test these observable implications, I look at the policy shifts of the political contestants in Western Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States from 1960 to 1998. The unit of analysis is a political party at a given election and the data are organized as party panels."
"17","The dependent variable, Vote change, is operationalized as the change in the percentage of votes received by a given party in two consecutive national legislative7 elections. Negative values on this variable indicate the vote share lost while positive values indicate the vote share gained.         "
"18","Measuring the independent variable requires information on the across‐time movements in the ideological positions of political parties. The most comprehensive cross‐national dataset that provides such information is the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP). This project has analyzed and coded information on the post‐war election programs for all significant parties in more than 20 democracies. The compiled dataset records a party's support for and prioritization of a set of issue positions.1 The CMP codings run from −100 to +100. A party's policy shift is measured by the absolute difference between its position on a given issue at election t and election t‐1. The theoretical range of the policy shift measure is from 0 to 100.            "
"19","The theory requires identifying a pragmatic economic issue domain and a principled social one. There are several potential ways to divide party positions on different issues into the two domains. In the case of the general left‐right ideology, Gabel and Huber (2000) have made the case for approaching the data with as few ex ante assumptions as possible about the specific issues that constitute the super issue and how it varies across time and space. Here, using principled component analysis provides the best estimates for the party positions. While this may be reasonable to code left‐right ideology, this strategy has been more difficult to sustain in the case of specific issue domains. Laver and Hunt (1992, 55) point out serious problems that can emerge as a result of settling the dimensionality of a policy space by rigid application of data presentation techniques, such as principal component analysis. They argue that picking dimensions is a substantive task. Indeed, most of the researchers have followed this logic when constructing domain‐specific measures of party positions (Andrews and Money 2003; Meguid 2005).10"
"20","I have followed previous research in order to measure party positions in both the economic and social domains. The exact CMP variables used and the rationale for including these variables as well as the aggregation method are explained in the appendix. After obtaining scores for all parties for both domains, I calculated the absolute change in the party's scores from one election to the next in order to capture the extent of a policy shift.            "
"21","The extent of shift, however, is not in itself a useful indicator for testing the hypotheses because the theory does not relate the magnitude of a shift to the magnitude in the change of support for the party. Rather, I am interested in whether a noticeable policy shift has an effect on vote totals. Thus, parties showing little or no change in their policy positions were coded as nonshifters, while the rest were coded as shifters. Deciding on the cutoff point between shifters and nonshifters is, of course, a nontrivial matter. Absolutely no change was observed only in the case of six parties on the economic dimension out of the total of 931 cases included in the dataset. On the social dimension, even the most stable party had shifted by .01 on the 0 to 100 scale. Given the wide range of the scale, however, a .01 point change or even a 1‐ to 5‐point change is most probably not a noticeable policy shift. I performed the analyses presented below using 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as different possible cutoff points. The results of the analyses improved when the cutoff point was changed from 1 to 2; the estimates were most efficient for cutoff points between 2 and 4. The estimated effects became inefficient when using the cutoff‐point 5.11 I have presented the results using the cutoff point of 4 for both Economic shift and Social shift. The percent of parties classified as “shifters” for every different cutoff point is presented in Table 1.            "
"22","In addition to information on specific issue domains, the CMP dataset also provides a composite measure for the left‐right position of a party (see also Laver and Budge 1992). The variable is composed of a number of economic and social issue positions (see Appendix III in Budge et al. 2001). The changes in the party position on this general dimension are coded into variable Left‐right shift. A similar cutoff point as described above is also used for this variable. The results presented below are not sensitive to the cutoff point chosen.            "
"23","In order to reliably estimate whether shifters on either dimension gain more votes than nonshifters, it is also necessary to control for several other variables potentially influencing the extent of vote shifts between elections. First, it has long been observed that government parties tend to lose votes, i.e., bear the “cost of ruling” (Rose and Mackie 1983). Thus, if an existing party belonged to a governing coalition before a given election was held, then their vote loss may be greater regardless of any policy shifts. Coalition membership is measured by a dummy variable scored 1 if a party was in a majority or was a member of a coalition and 0 otherwise (Müller and Strøm 2000). Further, poor economic performance may trigger overall vote shifts (Anderson 1995). This effect is captured by a change in the Unemployment rate (Year Book of Labour Statistics, International Labour Office). The number of candidates may also condition the extent of change in the share of votes: large‐scale changes in vote totals are more likely when the number of parties is higher. This variable is measured by the Effective number of parties (ENP; Laaksoo and Taagepera 1979) coded from Golder (2005).12 Further, existing parties may also lose support simply because their voters withdraw (Tavits 2007). Turnout change is measured by a difference in voter turnout between previous and current election. The value of the variable is 0 when turnout between the two elections is exactly the same; it is negative when turnout has decreased and positive when it has increased (http://www.idea.int; author's calculations). Descriptive statistics for all variables are presented in Table 1.            "
"24","The effect of policy shifts on the change in electoral returns is estimated using pooled cross‐sectional time‐series analysis. Specifically, I employed an ordinary least‐squares regression with lagged dependent variable and panel‐corrected standard errors (Beck and Katz 1995), and fixed‐country effects. The country dummies help to control for the country‐level heteroskedasticity, which is not addressed by the party panel‐level correction of standard errors. Also, these variables reflect country effects that are not captured by the institutional variables included in the model, e.g., the shifts in the policy moods across countries, which may account for why certain parties lose or gain votes.13 For ease of presentation the country dummies are not shown. The sign and coefficients of these variables are not in and of themselves of interest here.14"
"25","The regression results reported in Table 2 (Models 1 and 2) confirm that policy shifts have a differential effect on vote share depending on the policy domain. Model 1 uses the general left‐right scale to capture policy shifts by parties. The variable remains statistically insignificant, indicating that whether or not a party shifts from its previous left‐right position has no significant effect on votes gained or lost by the party. Model 2, however, tells a different story. In the economic domain, parties that have shifted their policy positions are more likely to gain votes than parties that have stayed put; the effect of the variable Economic shift is positive and statistically highly significant. On the contrary, in the social domain, policy shifts are damaging: the effect of the variable Social shift is significant and negative, indicating that parties that have shifted their social policy positions are more likely to lose votes than parties that have stood by their previous ideological positions. Given these opposite effects, it is easy to see why shifts on the general left‐right ideological scale appear to have no effect on vote shares.         "
"26","Specifically, for parties shifting on the pragmatic or economic issues, the change in the vote share from one election to the next is about .58% higher than for those parties that stay put. Parties shifting on social issues tend to lose .64% more votes than those parties that do not shift. Given that in advanced democracies party support is generally very stable—the median absolute change in vote share for the parties and elections under consideration is only 1.8%—shifting or staying put is a consequential decision. Indeed, the combined effect of economic and social policy shifts is considerable: if the “right” strategies are followed in both issue domains, parties can win (or avoid losing) 1.2% of votes from one election to the next.15"
"27","In addition to the variables measuring ideological shifts, coalition membership and the effective number of parties have statistically significant effects on changes in the vote shares. Compared to opposition parties, coalition members lose about 1.9% more of their votes. The result indicates that there are significant costs of ruling. Also, when a party system is more fractionalized, the likelihood that any given party will lose votes is higher. This effect most likely reflects across‐time dynamics: when the number of parties increases, e.g., when a new party emerges, many existing parties may suffer. On the contrary, when the number of parties decreases, the parties that remain in the system will benefit."
"28","The results presented in Table 2 are robust to various alternative specifications such as dropping the lagged dependent variable or the country dummies from the model, adding a variable that measures mean district magnitude to capture the proportionality of the electoral systems, adding a dummy variable for majoritarian versus proportional electoral system, or using the different cutoff points for the policy shift variables explained above. Comparing Models 2 and 3 also shows that the hypothesized results hold when continuous rather than dichotomous measures of the policy shift variables are used (see below). The results stay substantively the same when some items used to construct the policy shift measures are dropped. Specifically, some questions may be raised about environmental protection as an issue of principled politics because one may consider environmental protection as a beneficial end rather than as a matter of value judgment. Gangl (2003), on the other hand, argues that in political discourse, the environment is often discussed in moral terms. Dropping this item does not change the results of the analyses. In sum, regardless of the configuration of the model and the measures used, policy shifts in the economic and social domains emerge as central factors shaping a party's electoral fate.         "
"29","Thus far policy shifts are treated as dichotomous variables. This provides the most direct test of the theoretical argument, which does not relate the magnitude of the shift to the magnitude of the vote loss or gain. It is, however, also interesting to explore whether the magnitude of the shift matters. In terms of social policy shifts, where any movement was argued to be harmful, one would expect that as the magnitude of the shift increases so does the loss of the vote share. In the case of economic policy shifts, the relationship is likely to be more complex. Recall that economic policy shifts are generally electorally beneficial. Yet it is unreasonable to expect sweeping policy shifts to meet electoral approval: otherwise parties would always have an incentive to move from one extreme of the spectrum to the other before each election. Rather, the magnitude of the shift on economic policies is likely to have a curvilinear effect on change in the vote shares: when policy shifts are moderate the effect is positive, but when they become sweeping, the effect becomes negative."
"30","The tests of these additional propositions are presented in the last column of Table 2 (Model 3). I have used both the first‐ and the second‐order polynomial for the variable measuring economic policy shifts in order to capture the curvilinear effect. The results confirm expectations. The magnitude of the economic policy shift has a curvilinear effect on the change in vote shares. More specifically, the effect is positive and significant for all values of the economic policy shift until about 20 units, after which the relationship becomes negative. The results also show that the greater the policy shifts on the social dimension, the more votes a party would lose.16"
"31","The negative effect of social policy shifts on the change in vote shares poses further questions. Do voters abandon shifting parties because they favor principled and persistent statements or simply because parties have miscalculated the preference shifts of voters and moved in the opposite direction? Or perhaps parties are responding to preference shifts, but not to those of voters but of party leaders or sponsors. That is, perhaps voters would still appreciate policy shifts also in the social domain but only if those shifts correspond to their own preference shifts. If this were true, the argument about the value of stable principles would be falsified. Thus, the additional hypothesis that needs to be tested is the following: party policy shifts on social issues that correspond with voter preference shifts are still associated with decreased vote totals."
"32","In order to test this hypothesis, additional information about shifts in voter preferences in the social domain is needed.17 The most comprehensive cross‐national source for such information is the European Communities Study that combines Eurobarometer surveys from 1970 to 1992 (Inglehart, Reif, and Melich 1994). However, even this comprehensive survey only included value‐based questions for a limited number of countries and for selected years only. Thus, the additional analyses include information on only 10 West European countries for elections held in the 1980s.18 Nonetheless, since the general relationships described above also hold in the case of this reduced dataset (see below), there is some confidence that the reduced dataset can serve as a valid basis for the additional tests.            "
"33","The following variables were coded for the additional tests. First, I constructed indicators to measure whether party social policy shifts corresponded to shifts in the policy mood of the public. In order to get an indicator for a public social preference shift, I used survey items that resemble as closely as possible the issue areas used to measure party social policy shifts (see appendix).19 The survey responses were compiled into an additive index, and a mean score of this index was recorded for each country‐year. The mean score of this index should capture the general policy “mood” in a given country at a given year: the lower the score the more socially liberal the mood, the higher the score the more socially conservative the mood.20 The change in the mean score from one election to the next is used to measure public social preference shift. Negative scores indicate shifts to the more socially liberal direction while positive scores indicate shifts to the more socially conservative direction. The corresponding party social policy shift is measured using the CMP items identified in the appendix. The aggregate score on the social issues for each party at a given election is compared to a similar score in the previous election. Again, lower (negative) scores indicate more socially liberal positions while higher (positive) scores indicate more socially conservative positions.21 Based on these two indicators, Social shift: same as voters is coded 1 if the party policy shift is significant (using the cutoff‐point 4) and in the same direction as the social preference shift by voters. Social shift: opposite to voters is coded 1 if the party policy shift is significant but in the opposite direction from the preference shift of voters.            "
"34"," Table 3 presents the results of the additional analysis. The data are set up as party panels. As above, I have used ordinary least‐squares regression analysis with panel‐corrected standard errors and the lagged dependent variable. All models also include country dummies and control for the same set of variables as described above. Model 4 replicates the analysis presented in Table 2, Model 2. The results confirm that the original argument about the negative relationship between social policy shifts and change in vote totals also holds in this reduced dataset. This result increases the credibility of the subsequent analysis.            "
"35","Model 5 considers whether parties lose votes even if their policy shifts correspond to the aggregate voter‐preference shifts. The evidence supports this hypothesis: the variable capturing social policy shifts that occur in the same direction as voter‐preference shifts (Social shift: same as voters) is negative and statistically significant. Thus, even those parties that make policy adjustments that correspond to the preference shifts of voters lose votes. Voters do not punish shifting parties for poor correspondence between their preference shifts and the party policy shifts; rather, they inherently prefer stability on principled issues as predicted by theory.            "
"36","This finding provides new insights to our current understanding of the voter‐party linkage, which is commonly assumed to be based solely on preference‐policy congruence both in the representation and spatial voting literatures. The findings here, however, show that even if the general policy mood shifts from one election to the next, crediting shifting parties may not be automatic. Rather, on social issues voters expect parties to adhere to their original ideological statements and their principles. When voters change their preferences, they can opt for another party that better represents their new preference order. When political representatives change their value statements, even if it is in response to changes in the public mood, they may be perceived as unreliable, unprincipled, and perhaps weak and indecisive."
"37","There is increasing interest in whether and how parties respond to changes in voter preferences, i.e., how parties decide on an optimal spatial position given the prevailing uncertainty about both voter preference shifts and the consequences of the party policy shifts from one election to the next. Increasingly complex modeling techniques are used to describe the potential decision rules that parties may use to adjust their positions (Kollman, Miller, and Page 1992; Laver 2005; see also Adams et al. 2004; Budge 1994). The common assumption in these studies is that parties are vote/seat maximizers—an incentive that becomes a driving force behind the need to adjust one's policy positions.         "
"38","The results of the current study make an important contribution to this evolving literature. The study tackles the yet unanswered question of whether policy shifts, assumed to have been undertaken to maximize one's vote share, actually serve their intended purpose. The results indicate that policy shifts have an impact on vote totals, but this impact differs according to whether a shift occurs on pragmatic or on principled issues. In the case of the former, shifting one's position is associated with increased vote totals, while shifting one's position on principled, value‐based issues is associated with decreased vote totals. Additional analysis showed that, paradoxically, parties are punished for policy shifts on principled issues despite high correspondence between those shifts and the shifts in preference of voters. This finding implies that shifting in itself, independent of the direction and the magnitude of the shift, may condition how electable voters perceive a party to be.         "
"39","Although the distinction between pragmatic and principled issues is inherently present in many different studies, the potentially profound electoral consequences of the nature of voter preferences in the case of either domain have not been sufficiently recognized. The current study puts this distinction at the center of its theoretical argument. By doing so, this study has been able to provide novel contributions to the study of party strategies, representation, and spatial voting. First, previous research has generated contradictory expectations about the incentives of parties to either adjust their policy positions from one election to the next or to stay put. Both courses of action may lead to higher levels of electoral success. Distinguishing between the pragmatic‐economic and principled‐social domains has helped us to better understand the contradictory incentives that parties face. The findings of this study alert us to the possibility that electoral politics combines performance pressure with loyalty to principles. In order to survive in the competitive game, parties need to find a balance between displaying responsiveness to changing circumstances and standing by one's values."
"40","The striking contrast in pragmatic versus principled issues and their consequences for electoral competition further uncover the complex nature of the voter‐party linkages, thus contributing to the literature on representation. The findings in this study imply, contrary to the conventional wisdom in the representation and spatial voting literatures, that the representational ideal may not always require congruence between voter preferences and policy. In some cases, the preferred form of representation is staying true to one's principles. On principled issues the accepted logic of spatial closeness may prove irrelevant as on these issues, voters may have considerations other than (or at least in addition to) policy proximity."
"41","Future research might examine further how pragmatism versus principles factors into representational linkages and why sometimes one is valued over the other. An individual‐level analysis of voting decisions in the two domains would be an especially desirable and fruitful avenue for future research.
