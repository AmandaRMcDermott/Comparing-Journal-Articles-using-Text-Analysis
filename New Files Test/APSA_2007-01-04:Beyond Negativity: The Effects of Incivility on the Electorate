"1","The assumption that incivility poses a dilemma for democracy is questionable, in large part, because there are few data that document whether incivility has pernicious effects on citizens. As Mutz and Reeves observe, “there has been little effort to confirm empirically the negative consequences of incivility” (2005, 1). There is a great deal of speculation on the matter, and certainly those who are attacked harshly do not like it. But that is not evidence of an adverse effect on the electorate."
"2","To compound problems, we have only a partial understanding of how incivility might influence the public. During any campaign, candidates choose to focus on their own accomplishments (i.e., delivering a positive message) or their opponents' failures (i.e., delivering a negative message), or some combination thereof. Most studies about the effects of campaign tone have focused on that balance between positive (i.e., self‐focused) and negative (i.e., opponent‐focused) campaigning (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Ansolabehere, Iyengar, and Simon 1999; Ansolabehere et al. 1994; Brooks 2006; Clinton and Lapinski 2004; Finkel and Geer 1998; Geer and Lau 2006; Goldstein and Freedman 2002; Kahn and Kenney 1999, 2004; Lau and Pomper 2001, 2004).         "
"3","But campaign messages clearly differ in ways that go well beyond a simple negative/positive distinction which, to date, has been the primary focus within academia.2 Two studies have gone further to develop the possibility that issue‐based attacks may have a different effect than more personal attacks (Finkel and Geer 1998; Lau and Pomper 2001, 2004), but neither separately analyzes the manner in which such messages are delivered. Only two studies have explored whether the manner in which negative messages are delivered—i.e., the civility of the attack—might affect voters (Kahn and Kenney 1999, 2004; Mutz and Reeves 2005).3 While each study made important contributions to the discussion of incivility, neither study establishes how uncivil negative messages contrast with both civil negative messages and positive messages, which is essential to understand if we are going to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of different types of political messages. And, most importantly, neither study separately analyzes the issue/trait distinction. That distinction may (or may not) be driving some of their findings about incivility.         "
"4","It is essential to delve deeper into this question. Just consider that the public generally does not mind when candidates attack on issues, but expresses dissatisfaction about personal attacks. But even then, the negative reaction is not uniform, which suggests that some citizens do not view personal attacks as negative or unfair (see Brooks 2000). Consider that only 19% of the public would classify a candidate discussing “an opponent's stands on issues like education or military spending” as being an example of negative campaigning, according to a 2000 Gallup Poll.4 Moreover, only 5% of the public would treat it as being an example of “unfair” campaigning. Contrast that with discussions of “the extramarital relationships of an opponent,” which was considered to be negative by 77% of the public and unfair by 68% of the public. These data suggest that the public distinguishes between issue‐based negativity and personal negativity. It also shows there is still a sizable chunk of people who are not bothered by strong personal attacks, at least when they are generically described without any implication of incivility. And if we were to add on a different manner of delivery (i.e., civility) for each type of message, we would almost certainly see further differences in public reaction. All of this suggests that when studying effects of campaign tone, we need to incorporate a more nuanced view of campaign negativity than is typically assumed by scholars (see also Sigelman and Kugler 2003).         "
"5","In order to understand better how campaign messages influence voters, all of these various features of candidate exchanges need to be examined simultaneously. By sorting attacks into separate dimensions concerning policy and personal traits while controlling for both the tone and civility of the attack, we can move towards a better understanding of how the public reacts to both the substance of the message and the manner in which it is delivered. Our study accomplishes just that and by so doing we can assess the merits of the conventional wisdom that incivility undermines our electoral process."
"6","An experiment offers a tractable way to examine empirically the effects of incivility on the public. Kinder and Iyengar (1987) nearly 20 years ago reminded us about the power of experiments (e.g., Campbell and Stanley 1963). The ability to isolate important causal forces is important and experiments offer the opportunity. Brader (2005) argues that the study of political communication is often best analyzed in experimental settings because our variables of interest usually cannot be effectively isolated long after exposure to the relevant stimuli (see also Glaser and Salovey 1998; Isbell and Ottati 2002). Moreover, with an experiment, we have direct control over exposure to the campaign appeal—a problem that has confronted much of the previous work in this field (see Prior 2005).         "
"7","By manipulating a few key words that capture our focal concepts, we are able to gather data that not only speak directly to the matter, but allow us to tell a compelling causal story. We can test with precision the effects of different aspects of the message. By holding the substance of the message constant for positive, civil negative, and uncivil negative messages while varying only the tone, we can present issue messages that are of similar length and depth. We can do the same for trait messages as well."
"8","The typical problem facing experiments involves, of course, external validity—that is, the generalizability of the findings. The laboratory is understandably viewed as an artificial setting, and using samples of convenience (i.e., undergraduates) only compounds the problem. We use Knowledge Networks for our experiment, however, which eases many of these concerns. Not only did the subjects in our study constitute a nationally representative sample, but respondents were at home in front of their television sets while participating in the experiment. Such a setting is not completely realistic, but it is an improvement over the sterile environment of a laboratory. In addition, Knowledge Networks makes it possible to employ larger samples that provide greater statistical precision. Each of our experimental conditions averaged 292 respondents.5"
"9","Our experiment examines three different dimensions that provide the opportunity to examine more fully the impact of negativity and incivility on the public. Each of those dimensions is discussed below."
"10","The first dimension concerns whether the statement was positive (i.e., sponsor focused, such as “Education is improving in our communities today because I have supported our local teachers and our schools”) or negative (i.e., opponent focused, such as “Education in our communities is suffering today because my opponent has failed to support …”). In other words, is the message focused on the positive attributes of the message sponsor or is it focused on the negative aspects of the opponent?6 This is a straightforward concept and is consistent with how negative and positive messages are treated in most of the literature around campaign tone (e.g., Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Ansolabehere, Iyengar, and Simon 1999; Ansolabehere et al. 1994; Brooks 2006; Geer 2006; Lau and Pomper 2001; West 2005).         "
"11","The second dimension we explore—issue‐ versus trait‐based messages—is also fairly straightforward. “Trait‐based” attacks focus on personal characteristics (“My opponent has not been a leader of our community. This lack of leadership will prevent him from being an effective representative”) while issue‐based attacks (“Education in our communities is suffering today because my opponent has failed to support our local teachers and our schools”) focus on policy matters. This is not a new dimension of analysis; some previous scholars (including Finkel and Geer 1998; Geer 2006; Lau and Pomper 2001, 2004) distinguish between ads that focus on personal traits or issues. However, prior work neglected to differentiate between personal messages (which may be civil or uncivil in content) and uncivil messages (which may be issue focused or trait focused). Treating issue/trait focus as a separate dimension from civil/uncivil is theoretically warranted and analytically important.         "
"12","The third dimension concerns civility. All positive statements are, by definition, “civil,” but among negative messages, there is variation. Attempts by other scholars to establish a precise definition have proved to be quite illusive. Boyd notes that “civility is notoriously difficult to define” (2004, 26). As Carter comments, observers “have trouble agreeing on exactly what civility is” (1998, 11). Sapiro sums up the issue well, noting that “any scholarly treatment of civility and politics must start with the recognition that civility, while widely discussed and argued, does not really have full conceptual standing as a ‘keyword’ in scholarship on democratic politics” (1999, 2).         "
"13","It is clear that incivility is a term people invoke frequently, but often with somewhat different connotations in mind. Although there is not a firm conceptual foundation, common threads do run through most scholarly efforts to understand this term. These strands provide the basis for our operationalization of the term. The concept of civility seems to invariably involve some notion of mutual respect, of being courteous and respectful to the individual (Carter 1998; Sapiro 1999). We can have strong disagreements on any subject, but that need not carry over to animosity and derision. For example, Carter (1998) believes that civility involves some level of respect for the actors involved. Funk raises the issue of incivility when she writes about “animosity” that violates “norms of courtesy and reciprocity in resolving social conflict” (2001, 198). Sapiro joins in, acknowledging that “respect,”“consideration,” and “courtesy” all lie “at the core of the calls for civility” (1999, 3).         "
"14","Taking all of those definitions into consideration in conjunction with concerns frequently expressed by the public about the tenor of campaigns, we operationalize incivility as claims that are inflammatory and superfluous. Some comments can, in fact, be quite critical of an opponent, and still not earn a classification as “uncivil.” Incivility requires going an extra step; that is, adding inflammatory comments that add little in the way of substance to the discussion. For example, a reporter makes the difference quite clear in a newspaper article about the 1994 Tennessee Senate race between Bill Frist and Jim Sasser: “It was fair for Frist to criticize Sasser last week for voting for an appropriations bill that contained $41 million in projects earmarked in a House‐Senate conference committee. It wasn't fair to label them ‘Sasser's Hidden Pet Projects.’”7 Ifa candidate claims that “my opponent has not told the truth to the American people about his voting record on school spending,” that is not uncivil. In fact, if that candidate has been deceptive, then the information is substantively important. But what if, instead, the candidate said, “My unethical and deceitful opponent has not told the truth to the American people about his position on school spending”? The two new words—unethical and deceitful—are an attempt to gratuitously accentuate the claim about dishonesty, while not adding any new substantive information to the message. The net result involves significantly more “punch.” It is this understanding of incivility that underlies our empirical analysis.         "
"15","This perspective builds upon Mutz and Reeves' work. For these scholars, “incivility” exists when candidates “used the same script but inserted gratuitous asides that suggested a lack of respect for and/or frustration with the opposition” (2005, 5). We borrow a page from them, inserting words into our experimental treatment that are designed to send these stronger, uncivil signals."
"16","One could say that a few uncivil words added to an otherwise civil message do not represent incivility in its strongest form.8 That is undeniably true. For example, Andrew Jackson was called a murderer, while his wife was labeled a prostitute in his run for the Oval Office (Geer 2006). Different results could potentially emerge if we focused on incivility in its most extreme and caustic form of the sort launched at Jackson. We argue, however, that it is most important to analyze the types of incivility we see regularly during contemporary election seasons. Incivility exists in politics today, but it is generally far more measured than the attacks launched against Andrew Jackson and looks much more like the type of rhetoric that is the focus of this study.9"
"17","In our operationalization of the concepts for the experiment, the civil version of a negative message would be a straightforward, opponent‐focused message (i.e., “Education in our communities is suffering today because my opponent has failed to support our local teachers and our schools”) while the uncivil version adds a pointed insult to the mix (i.e., “Education in our communities is suffering today because my unthinking opponent has recklessly failed to support our local teachers and our schools”). Specifically, we operationalize uncivil messages by adding two strong, pointed words (“dishonest,”“unprincipled,”“insensitive,”“heartless,”“cowardly,” etc.) to an otherwise civil negative message to tackle this key distinction.         "
"18","Because the concept of incivility only applies to negative messages (there are no uncivil positive messages, of course), the positive/negative and civil/uncivil dimensions combine into a single dimension (which we will generically refer to as “tone”) for analytical purposes. Specifically, the experiment took the form of a 3 (positive/civil negative/uncivil negative) × 2 (issue/trait) between‐subjects factorial design. See Table 1 for a breakdown of the conditions. We have labeled those conditions according to what conventional wisdom would suggest would be the optimal forms of campaigning, from the “Ideal Candidate” in the positive, issue‐based condition to “The Mudslinger” in the uncivil, trait‐based condition.         "
"19","The actual messages we present are realistic—the kind of statements candidates deliver during a typical campaign. We eliminated partisan cues that might have biased the results.10 Moreover, we eliminated any geographic cues such that our respondents who were spread out over all states in the United States could think that the messages might be attributable to candidates in their general area. We introduced our study to subjects with the following statement: “As you may know, we have elections coming up in November. There are many candidates running for political office. We would like you to read several statements made by one candidate who is running for Congress in this November's election.” The respondents were then shown three statements by a candidate on three separate Internet pages. They were then asked a series of questions. The general topics of the statements were designed to be consistent with existing content analyses of campaign messages (Geer 2006; Kahn and Kenney 1999; Vavreck 2001). Each respondent was exposed to three statements11 randomly drawn from a total of six for each condition, such that the issues presented and order of presentation was randomized for each participant to minimize potential bias from particular message content or issue focus (Appendix A provides examples of the statements).         "
"20","After viewing the messages, respondents were then asked three questions about the statements they just read in order to assess their perceptions of the messages. Respondents were asked about whether they “thought the candidate was campaigning in a fair manner,” whether the candidate had “raised important concerns,” and whether the message was “informative.” The goal with these items was to capture the reactions the public had to the varying tone and content of these statements. After a distraction (an unrelated set of survey questions), our participants answered questions about their engagement in politics (general levels of political interest, intent to vote in the 2004 elections, and political trust and efficacy). The objective was to go beyond just reactions to the questions and see if these statements altered more fundamental aspects of political life."
"21","Given that our manipulations are subtle, we wanted to assess whether our manipulations worked. If we have in fact captured positive, civil negative, and uncivil negative messages by candidates in our experiment, we should see some differences in respondents' perceptions of the “fairness” of the message.12 Uncivil messages should be seen as unfair by the public since that is a substantial part of the complaint against them. So, responses to this question provide us a chance to check our manipulation. Figure 1 suggests it works (see Appendix B for a summary of all ANOVA results, and see Appendix C to see exactly which conditions are significantly different from other conditions using the Bonferroni test of multiple comparisons, a method which conservatively adjusts for the potential increase in error encountered by testing the differences between many different groups at the same time). Respondents exposed to positive messages were far more likely to agree that “the candidate was campaigning in a fair manner” if the messages they were exposed to were positive (64% agree, with a mean of 2.65 on a 4‐point scale with a “4” being “strongly agree”) than if they were negative and civil (44% agree, for a mean of 2.33) or negative and uncivil (just 23% agree, for a mean of 1.89). Moreover, the most reviled of message types (or at least the “least fair” of message types) is a negative uncivil trait‐based message—a finding that further bolsters our faith in these manipulations.         "
"22","                 “I thought the candidate was campaigning in a fair manner”                      "
"23","The general view shared by most pundits and political observers, as we noted in the introduction, is that harsh campaigning undermines the political process. Our goal is to assess this conventional wisdom about the ill effects of negativity, in general, and incivility, in particular. Specifically, we will address three related, but distinct, questions. First, does civil negativity engender the ire of voters and undermine engagement in the political system? Second, does incivility have an even stronger harmful influence on the public? Third, do uncivil personal attacks have the most damaging effects of all on the public's perceptions and political engagement?"
"24","Does incivility in and of itself make politics seem superficial and unimportant to people? Political analyst Ron Faucheux expresses a reasonable concern when he argues that “spitefulness degrades the attacker and diminishes the process. It feeds media obsessions and trivializes debate” (1994, 5). While Faucheux's concern about media obsessions is outside of the purview of this article, the question of whether incivility trivializes debate is a testable question. Does incivility inherently trivialize the informational content of campaign messages? Does incivility distract from the substance of a message? Will voters think that uncivil messages—especially uncivil, trait‐based messages—are less informative than those that contain the same substantive information, without the inflammatory asides?            "
"25"," Table 2 offers mixed support for this concern. The main effects for the “tone” dimension and the “issue/trait” dimension, as well as the interaction effect between them, are all significant for “this candidate is raising important concerns.” The differences between the means on these various scales highlight the difference. For example, there is no significant or substantively important difference in agreement between those who viewed positive messages and those who viewed civil negative messages. People shown the uncivil negative messages, however, were significantly less likely to agree that the candidate was raising important concerns.            "
"26","While that difference between civil negative and uncivil negative is relatively modest (.27 on a 4‐point scale), the interaction between tone and the trait versus issue dimension obscures a more substantial difference. Overall, people are far more likely to judge issue‐based messages than trait‐based messages as raising important concerns. For issue‐based messages, there is no difference at all between perceptions of positive messages and civil negative messages, while uncivil negative is seen as slightly (and not significantly) less important. For trait‐based messages, however, the differences are quite marked. Civil negative messages are actually most likely to be seen as important, while uncivil negative messages are least likely, and positive messages fall in between. This suggests that people are more likely to see a civil negative trait‐based message as being more important than the same substantive message framed in a positive light.13 But as soon as a couple of uncivil words are added to the civil negative message, perceptions of its importance plummet.            "
"27","This jump for uncivil negative trait appeals is not only statistically significant as compared to all other types of messages, but it is substantively important. One might wonder if a difference of .78 really matters. The simple answer is yes. On a 4‐point scale, a difference of .78 represents a perceptual difference of about one quarter of the total possible range. But even a difference of .4 still is substantial. For our groups to be different by .4, that would mean that 40% of our sample was different by one unit, or 20% of our sample was different by two units. With only a 4‐point scale and a single manipulation, this is quite substantial movement."
"28","We now consider the public's judgments about whether these various messages differ in perceived informational value. People complain frequently that they don't learn enough from campaigns (especially from campaign ads) about the candidates and frequently lump those comments in with criticism about harsh campaigning. For similar reasons as those discussed above with reference to informational value, the general expectation is that negative messages—especially uncivil negative messages—will be seen as less informative than positive appeals, even when the informational content of the message is exactly the same. This relationship will be most marked for trait messages, since uncivil personal attacks will be perceived by the public to be the least informative.            "
"29","Our results again do not confirm all these expectations (see Appendix B and Table 2). For perception of informational value (specifically, agreement with the statement “I found the candidate's statements to be informative”), positive and civil negative messages are quite similar and do not differ significantly. Uncivil negative messages, however, are perceived to be significantly less informative than both positive and civil negative messages. Thus, incivility—but not just negativity alone—seems to be interfering to a modest degree with perceptions of informational value.            "
"30","As in the case of message importance, the issue versus trait dimension obscures this relationship. Issue and trait messages, taken as a whole, are only moderately different, with scores of 2.33 and 2.17, respectively. But in interaction with the negativity/incivility dimensions, issue‐based messages are almost indistinguishable from one another (with only a maximum .12 spread between issue‐based messages with the different types of tone). For trait‐based messages, however, the effects of different types of tone are far more substantial. Positive trait‐based messages have an average score of 2.34 on the informational value measure. Civil negative messages fare slightly, but not significantly, worse with an average score of 2.24. But, again, it is uncivil trait‐based messages that are rated the lowest, with a mean score of 1.91. In other words, the only category that stands out as being notably worse in the interaction between negativity, incivility, and the issue versus trait dimensions for perceptions of informational value is uncivil negative trait‐based messages. Incivility interferes with whether people think they learned something from the message, but only for trait‐based messages."
"31","These findings offer a consistent story. Negativity per se is not perceived by the public as being a problem, and even uncivil attacks on issues do not provoke concern on the part of the public. The problem lies with the personal attacks, especially of the uncivil variety. Even when the substantive content of a message is exactly the same, the public views personal, uncivil messages as being significantly less valuable than alternative forms of communication. These results, at this point, suggest we need to be more cautious in our worries about incivility. Uncivil attacks per se are not the problem; it is when it gets personal. But these data are just about perceptions of the messages. The next section looks at the potential effects that these different types of campaign messages have on political engagement.            "
"32","A more significant test of these concerns about negativity and incivility is whether they weaken citizens' involvement in the political process. Whether the public likes attacks or not matters, but if these attacks yield a more disengaged public, then serious concerns begin to arise and the critics of our current political dialogue need to be taken more seriously. We analyze this general issue by looking at an array of different questions, including intention to vote, interest in politics, political trust, and efficacy."
"33","Voter turnout has been the main dependent variable of interest in the study of the effects of campaign tone. That focus is understandable. Election Day provides the typical citizen a chance to influence the course of government. If attacks depress turnout, it is easy to see why there would be concern. The initial, and pioneering, research on the effects of negative advertising found that attacks demobilized the electorate (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Ansolabehere, Iyengar, and Simon 1999; Ansolabehere et al. 1994). Yet it now appears that negativity either does not affect turnout or that it increases turnout (Brooks 2006; Clinton and Lapinski 2004; Finkel and Geer 1998; Goldstein and Freedman 2002; Lau and Pomper 2001, 2004). However, it is still possible that incivility could have a strong depressive effect on turnout.            "
"34","To assess the effect on likelihood to vote we asked, “How likely is it that you will vote in the next presidential election?” which refers to the 2004 election that took place a few months after the administration of our experiment. While people notoriously overreport their likelihood to vote, the advantage of an experiment with randomized condition assignment is that the overreport bias should affect our treatment groups in a random fashion and therefore not bias our assessment of the effects of our independent variables of interest (see Clinton and Lapinski 2004, 79, for similar logic). If negativity, incivility, and/or a trait‐based focus in campaign messages have a demoralizing effect, then excitement about participating in the next election should be at least somewhat diminished soon after exposure to our stimulus.14"
"35","When the relationship between negativity, incivility, and trait/issue focus is examined, the main effect for tone falls just short of statistical significance (p = .09 in Appendix B). But even holding aside the normal .05 standard, positive tone and civil negative tone are quite similar, with means of 3.38 and 3.34, respectively, on a 4‐point scale (where “4”=“will definitely vote” in the next presidential election). People who viewed uncivil negative messages appear to be somewhat more likely to vote, although the difference is modest and not statistically significant. Moreover, a statistically significant difference exists for the interaction between “tone” and “trait.”Table 3 shows that the type of campaign message least likely to enhance voting intentions is the positive issue condition, a type of campaign message that one might consider to be rather straightforward and unexciting, while the three types of messages that generate the highest turnout intentions are the classic mudslinging, uncivil negative trait type of message, the “warm and fuzzy” civil positive trait type of message, and the “mean and focused” uncivil negative issue type of message. These are fairly modest differences, and the differences between the most‐different groups fall just short of statistical significance at .06 using the conservative Bonferroni test of multiple comparisons (as seen in Appendix C). Even so, the key finding is that uncivil messages (both trait and issue based) generate reasonably strong interest in voting. The larger lesson is that the doom and gloom scenarios of some observers about the effects of incivility seem premature at best, and perhaps even outright wrong.            "
"36","Another important measure of political engagement is citizens' interest in politics. Interest in politics affects behavior beyond just one election; it shapes one's general propensity to vote, one's likelihood to engage in other forms of political action, and the level of political information one might bring to politics. So while political interest is, indeed, related to voter turnout, it also goes further by allowing us to understand the effects of campaign incivility on the public's broader political engagement."
"37","There are reasons pundits suspect that campaign tone might affect how interested people are in politics. Negativity in general—and incivility in particular—might accentuate the least attractive aspects of politicians, and thereby turn people off to the whole process. Negativity reminds voters that the options are inherently flawed and that the political world is full of imperfect people making imperfect decisions. Moreover, conflict is an undesirable state of affairs for most people. “Tuning out” may be natural."
"38","In order to gauge whether our treatment had any effect on political interest, we asked respondents, “Generally speaking, how interested are you in politics and elections?” With reference to political interest, we see mixed results. The dimensions in question do not have a significant effect on political interest at conventional levels, with a p‐value for the corrected model of .07. It is sufficiently close, however, that it is worthwhile to examine the means. On that front, a potentially interesting relationship does arise. Uncivil negative messages seem to generate slightly more interest in politics than either civil negative or positive messages. In fact, Table 3 shows that the highest levels of political interest are generated by uncivil trait‐based negative messages. An analysis of just the negative message conditions shows that the difference between civil and uncivil negative messages is significantly different with respect to political interest (F = 3.24, p < .05). The interaction between civility and trait versus issue focus is also significant for negative messages (F = 5.14, p < .05). The difference does not appear to be large (Table 3 shows a difference of .21 between civil negative trait‐based messages and uncivil negative trait‐based messages on a 4‐point scale). But a difference of that magnitude means that about 20% of the respondents in the uncivil negative trait condition were at least one point more interested (or about 10% were two points different) than those in the civil negative trait condition. It is not a dramatic difference, but it surely calls into question claims that incivility is turning people off to politics.            "
"39","Thus, we find little validation for concerns that viewing negative, uncivil, and/or trait‐based messages will turn people off to politics overall. And, in fact, we find some evidence that suggests the most reviled of campaign messages—uncivil trait‐based messages—may slightly increase political interest as compared to some other types of messages. This finding lends support to Lau's (1982, 1985) hypothesis that negativity stands out and attracts notice, but with a few caveats. It may be that in the current campaign environment—one that is clearly awash with negative campaigning—the kinds of standard attacks about opponents don't pique voters' interest in the process. Even uncivil issue‐based messages might fade into a sea of negativity: while harsh, they are still focused on matters of policy relevance and fail to stand out as a result. But combine incivility with a focus on personal traits and that vitriolic combination becomes a colorful, exciting display that reminds voters that politics isn't boring and dull. Just as people are drawn to celebrity disagreements in tabloids or the viewing of car accidents on freeways, it may be that malicious, personal politics garners interest from people who would not otherwise notice the electoral process.            "
"40","While incivility might generate political interest and does not seem to depress turnout (and might even have a slight energizing effect), one could still worry that the longer‐term effects of negativity could still be detrimental. Uncivil attacks could make politicians as a class appear unseemly by casting aspersions on their character, qualifications, and/or policy preferences. And uncivil attacks could make people feel that they are vulnerable to untrustworthy tendencies among candidates. One could imagine a scenario in which people witness caustic exchanges between candidates that makes them interested in politics (that is, interested in how dysfunctional the political world is) and also makes them more likely to vote in the next election (because they want to keep the worst of the two bums out of office), but makes them feel cynical about politicians and the process of politics overall. Rahn and Hirshorn (1999) found some evidence to this effect in an experiment in which they showed negative and positive political ads to children: specifically, they found that campaign attacks soured the “public mood” of children while it did not affect their desire to vote.15 With reference to adults, Mutz and Reeves (2005) did not study intentions to vote, political interest, or efficacy, but they did study political trust and found that incivility (as compared to civil negativity) reduced citizens' trust. All of this suggests that incivility reduces trust and political efficacy.            "
"41","And yet there are also reasons to suspect that uncivil campaign attacks may not have detrimental effects on political trust or efficacy, particularly within the context of advertising messages. Mutz and Reeves (2005) focus on an interesting forum for political dialogue—Sunday morning political talk shows—but we need to go beyond that setting and consider other sources of information. Advertising‐type messages are one obvious choice, especially given their centrality in most visible campaigns today (see Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Geer 2006; Johnston, Hagen, and Jamieson 2004; West 2005). As compared to political talk shows, the public may start with lower expectations regarding the content of campaign ads. In a talk show, the candidates appear in a public setting and may be expected to be truthful, upstanding, and gracious. The public may just expect less from advertising‐type messages, which may lead them to treat this political communication format differently than others. If so, campaign messages in general—whether they be positive or negative, civil or uncivil—are just assumed to be misrepresentations by the public to at least some extent, which may lead the public to not see differences in trust or efficacy depending on message type.            "
"42","To assess the possible effect on trust we asked one question: “I think most officials can be trusted.” For efficacy, we asked two questions: “I don't think public officials care much what people like me think” and “People like me don't have a say about what the government does,” and combined the answers into a two‐item index. The trust and efficacy questions were measured on a 5‐point scale (“Agree strongly,”“Agree somewhat,”“ Neither agree nor disagree,”“Disagree somewhat,”“Disagree strongly”), such that the single‐item trust measure ranges from 1 to 5, with “5” representing “most trusting,” while the two‐item efficacy index ranges from 2 to 10, with “10” representing “most efficacious.”"
"43","Our data show no evidence of a relationship between incivility on either political trust or efficacy. With respect to political trust, the model F‐test is not significant and the associated means on Table 3 show little apparent relationship between campaign tone and political trust.            "
"44","With respect to political efficacy, the model approaches statistical significance (p = .06). The only statistically significant dimension is the issue/trait dimension, where trait‐based messages elicit moderately lower efficacy ratings (mean = 5.16) than issue‐based messages (mean = 5.36). Neither the main effect for “tone” nor the tone and trait interaction is a significant predictor of political efficacy."
"45","These results do not square with those of Mutz and Reeves (2005) with respect to the effects of incivility on political trust. It may be that both sets of findings are accurate for different communication formats: people may have lower expectations of paid media/campaign advertising‐type messages that are not affected by incivility, whereas they may hold higher expectations for politicians in free media (i.e., live debate) programs. Or perhaps the addition of nonverbal and tonal incivility present in the Mutz and Reeves study (including raised voices, frequent interruptions without apology, eye rolling, and head shaking while the opponent was talking) had stronger effect than our treatment. Political ads rarely show competing candidates interacting directly with one another; moreover, angry expressions and raised voices and the like would generally be edited out of the final cut of an advertisement. As such, visual and auditory incivility of the nature measured by Mutz and Reeves would not be a factor in paid political advertising—especially in print advertising, but even in most television advertising. This difference is important to sort out because a typical citizen is far more likely to have exposure to politicians through paid messages than through exposure to political talk shows.            "
"46","A final measure of political engagement is recall; that is, whether people will remember more from positive ads than from civil negative or uncivil negative ads. The idea that incivility distracts from the substance of debate is a common concern. One might think that incivility could detrimentally interfere with political learning by causing people to focus on the “punch” rather than the substance of the message. We demonstrated earlier that people claimed that uncivil messages—especially uncivil trait‐based messages—were less informative, even when they contained exactly the same substantive facts as positive messages. The question, then, is whether people actually do learn less from uncivil messages, even when the messages contain exactly the same substantive information as their less strident counterparts.16"
"47","While our results should be treated with some caution,17 we do not see any evidence to suggest that positive, civil negative, and uncivil negative messages are recalled at different levels.18 People exposed to uncivil negative messages were significantly more likely to try to recall something about the ad (77% of people exposed to uncivil negative messages attempted to recall the message content, versus just 66% in the civil negative condition and 65% in the positive message condition). But regardless of the greater number of recall attempts, they were no more likely to be correct in their recollections than people in the other conditions (see Geer and Geer 2003 for a related finding regarding radio ads). We see in Table 3 that issue messages are slightly more likely to be recalled correctly than trait messages, a finding which modestly supports the concerns of those who desire more of an issue‐focus in our campaigns. But within each of those types of ads (issue versus trait), we only see the most minor of differences for campaign tone, none of which are statistically significant or substantively important given the wide 7‐point scale on which it is based. Thus, all else being equal, incivility may generate more cognitive stimulation about a campaign (as reflected by more recall attempts), but it does not appear to affect political learning about the campaign.            "
"48","This article advances our understanding of the impact of campaign messages on the polity in several important ways. Through an examination of the effects of three different message characteristics on a probability sample of American citizens, we were able to analyze systematically both perceptions about message type and their effects on political engagement. Focusing on the weaknesses of the opponent is not, in and of itself, a problem, even in how it is perceived by the public. Negativity, on its own, thus does not seem to be the real issue of concern. Rather, it is incivility generally—and trait‐based incivility specifically—that is most likely to engender the ire of the public and to be least valued as part of campaign discourse."
"49","This all suggests that, at least on a perceptual level, some of the concerns about “negativity”—which academics have almost always defined as any time a candidate focuses on the opponent—might more accurately rest with “trait‐based incivility.” Upon close examination, however, we see no evidence that even the most despised of candidate messages—negative, uncivil, trait‐based messages—are harmful to the democratic engagement of the polity. We see no relationship between message type and political trust or political efficacy. We see no relationship between campaign tone and message recall. And, in fact, we see some suggestive evidence that those least‐liked, least‐valued kinds of messages may modestly stimulate two things that we tend to care a great deal about improving as a society: political interest and likelihood to vote."
"50","These findings about incivility take on even greater importance in today's politics. America is polarizing. Whether we talk about “red” or “blue” states or the partisan battles that seem to define the halls of Congress, polarization is part and parcel of contemporary American politics. Disagreements abound. Our data, however, suggest that the public will not melt in response to harsh exchanges—even those that are uncivil—and might even modestly profit from them in some cases. This should be good news to those who observe and study politics because it suggests that the American electorate is quite resilient to the nasty exchanges now prevalent in U.S. political discourse."
