"1","Democratic theorists acknowledge that it is important and difficult to demarcate the people, but they do not agree on how precisely to present the puzzle. A well‐known formulation is “the boundary problem” (Arrhenius 2005; Whelan 1983). It states that if the question of who to include in the demos is politically important, then, in a democracy, the people should decide that question at the polls. But if we need an election to delimit the demos, then it is also politically important to decide how to choose the electors. So we would then need to allow the people to decide that question too. But that decision would itself be politically important, et cetera, ad infinitum. So, this question generates an infinite regress caused by self‐reference that makes it impossible to define the people democratically. In the last few decades, similar formulations have been called “the problem of the unit” (Dahl 1989), “the paradox of founding” (Arendt 1990, 161; Connolly 1995, 138–39), “the democratic paradox” (Mouffe 2000), “the paradox of popular sovereignty”(Yack 2001), “the paradox of democratic legitimacy” (Benhabib 2006), “the paradox of politics” (Honig 2007), and “the problem of constituting the demos” (Goodin 2007). I use the term “the paradox of popular indeterminacy” (Ochoa Espejo 2011), because this particular formulation of the problem explains why the problem of self‐reference does not result solely from a requirement of consent, but also from the very justificatory ground of democracy: the principle of equality.1"
"2","The problem of indeterminacy has arisen in theoretical discussions at least since the time of Rousseau (1978, 69). Yet traditionally it has not been considered a serious threat to democracy. This may be because democratic theorists seek to avoid the problem by defining the demos using criteria that are independent of the democratic process, like culture or liberal principles. Such criteria do not seem to threaten democratic legitimacy because if the people have no right to decide how to apply them, the regress does not arise. Moreover, if every single individual found himself thrown into a given group, then exclusion from the process of deciding the state's boundaries would not be unfair: everyone would be treated in an equally arbitrary way. So the key to solving the indeterminacy problem is finding a decision‐independent criterion, one which is compatible with democratic principles of equal freedom but not set by a political decision in which the people is entitled to participate, so as to avoid the regress.         "
"3","In the first part of this section, I show that statist, culturalist, and nationalist theorists who believe that the demos must be internally bounded, and cosmopolitan theorists who hold that the demos is in principle unbounded, all propose inadequate decision‐independent criteria. I show, that is, how their official solutions to the boundary problem ultimately fail. In the second part of this section, I then consider the tacit solutions that statists, culturalists, nationalists, and cosmopolitans would offer to the boundary problem, given the failure of their official solutions. I argue that all these tacit solutions make the people a function of a well‐defined territory.         "
"4","Democratic theorists frequently assume that the boundaries of the demos correspond to the territorial boundaries of states (Dahl 1989; Song 2012). But when dealing with the question of why a given group should be part of one state rather than another, those who hold that a demos should be bounded traditionally use the limits of independent cultures as a criterion for demarking it (Walzer 1981). At first, this criterion seems decision‐independent, because everybody is born into a culture: cultural belonging seems arbitrary to all. Yet I will show that the cultural criterion in fact does require a political decision in which the people ought to be entitled to participate, and thus, it generates a new infinite regress.            "
"5","The term “independent culture” often comes up in debates about self‐determination (Margalit and Raz 1990; Philpott 1995) and liberal nationalism (Meisels 2003; Miller 1995; Tamir 1993). In these views, ideally, the boundaries of the people in a democratic state would coincide with the boundaries of the nation or cultural group (Miller 1995, 99–100). Cultural belonging or nationality does seem decision‐independent at first. For belonging to a nation is a circumstance of birth, not a political choice; a matter of “belonging, rather than achievement” (Margalit and Raz 1990, 444–48). Moreover, according to these theorists, self‐determination is justified on the basis of individual rights and therefore is compatible with equality. Critics of this criterion for determining the people's boundaries normally object that culture is ascriptive. That is, they argue that culture is neither chosen nor earned, and thus it should be morally irrelevant (Buchanan 2003, 250). Yet, given the possibility of popular indeterminacy, the crucial problem with this criterion comes from the opposite direction. Given that we seek a decision‐independent criterion to exclude without causing inequalities, that is, a criterion that people should not choose, the problem here is that nationality is not ascriptive enough.            "
"6","Culture and nationality are not sufficiently ascriptive because belonging to a cultural group is not a characteristic that is obvious to all. Hence, there is bound to be political disagreement over who belongs, and whenever there is deep disagreement over a crucial political question, democratic decision making ought to be the norm. But if we need a democratic ruling on this matter, then culture is not decision‐independent. Proponents of demarcating peoples on the basis of culture have yet to solve this problem."
"7","A second group of scholars, those with cosmopolitan sympathies, addresses the indeterminacy problem by making the people's boundaries irrelevant in principle. A demarcation criterion used by this group is the principle of affected interests (Dahl 1990; Goodin 2007; Whelan 1983, 16–24).2 This principle proposes that “everyone who is affected by the decisions of a government should have the right to participate in that government” (Dahl 1990, 49). The principle is attractive because it avoids the difficulties of the cultural and nationalist views: it is morally relevant, compatible with equality, and not related to personal identity. But is it decision‐independent? At first, it may not seem so. Determining who is affected is an important political decision that should itself be subjected to a democratic decision, generating logical regress once again. But as Goodin has argued, this problem can be avoided by adopting a modified version of the principle. Rather than stipulating that every person who is actually affected by a decision should have a say, the principle can be modified to be “the principle of all possibly affected interests” (2007, 55). On this version, every democratic decision could possibly affect everyone in the world, and applying the principle would mean “giving virtually everyone everywhere a vote on virtually everything decided anywhere” (64). In Goodin's view, then, democrats should err on the side of caution and extend the demos to include everyone in the world, thus making the demos unbounded and compatible with liberal democratic principles. Hence, as a criterion for demarking the people, the principle of affected interests leads to an unbounded demos. A commitment to such a demos is shared by other cosmopolitan thinkers, who often reach the same conclusion from different premises (Agne 2010; Held 1995; Pogge 1992). This has become known as the Unbounded Demos Thesis (Abizadeh 2008, 44–48).            "
"8","However, cosmopolitan thinkers cannot fully resolve the problem of popular indeterminacy: there are at least two reasons why the problem remains. First, the principle of all possibly affected interests is not in fact a decision‐independent criterion: it conflates the problem of the unit (defining the population from which the citizenry is drawn) with the problem of the demos (establishing a criterion of exclusion from the citizenry). Even if the unit were humanity at large, and everybody potentially belonged to a worldwide people, we would still have to make a political decision to determine the precise contours of the citizenry. To make this decision, everybody should be allowed to participate, but this poses the question of how to define “everybody.” If, however, we gave up on a criterion of exclusion and were to include in the demos every single living person (including children and the mentally impaired), the indeterminacy would then extend to the question of who counts as a person. In the end, exclusion would be the result of a fundamental political decision in which the demos should be entitled to participate, thus reproducing the infinite regress. Hence, the criterion is not decision‐independent.            "
"9","Some might object that even if sometimes we have philosophical debates on the meaning of personhood in bioethics, there is in fact not a relevant political debate on whether a person counts as a person (Agne 2010). This view is controversial, but even if we conceded that point, there is a second reason why a cosmopolitan solution to the boundary problem is not decision‐independent: a worldwide demos still requires a democratic decision to come into being because a cosmopolitan project is not universally accepted. According to Näsström, extending the demos or making each local demos unbounded would have to be the decision of those who believe that democracy should be universal, and this decision would be paternalistic towards those who prefer to retain existent boundaries of states (2011, 129). The supposedly independent criteria are, in fact, not independent of a political decision that ought to, but cannot, be democratic.            "
"10","Notice that the decision to establish a universal democratic people is quite different from the decision to seek (or even to establish) democracy for all persons in the world, which may be a requirement in a worldwide regime for the protection of human rights (Christiano 2011). Arguably, establishing human rights is a closed decision that can be decided correctly and universally applied without moral paternalism (Talbott 2005, 107–10). Human rights may include political rights, which means that asserting that everyone in the world has a right to participate in democratic governance may be a decision that everybody should accept (Christiano 2011; Gould 2004; Talbott 2005). However, this tells us nothing about the particular borders that the demos (or demoi) should take, because the decision to establish the boundaries of democratic polities (including the decision to establish a world demos) is morally open (Pogge 1992, 64). We know that it is open because there are many possible institutional arrangements that would be compatible with the universal extension of democracy and human rights (there could be many countries under international institutions, a world‐state with divided sovereignty, nested or overlapping jurisdictions, etc.). Some theorists hold that there is a distinct best solution to the question of how to determine global institutional design, but even they agree that there could be alternative arrangements, and they also hold that there is wide scope for democratic participation in this decision (Caney 2006, 752; Pogge 1992, 6). So, the decision to create the institutions of a worldwide demos cannot be made on behalf of others without paternalism.            "
"11","Note, moreover, that paternalism is not problematic because we need each individual's consent to establish democracy; rather, it is a concern because some cannot make a crucial political decision of institutional design on behalf of others without undermining the principle of equality. Many liberals take an “instrumental view” of democratic participation in institutional design and hold that the sole consideration when deciding what kind of political structure there should be is “which best realizes the best view of justice?” (Caney 2006, 726). Thus, for them, democratic equality is a secondary concern. However, for most democrats, equality is a central value. It must also govern the process of institutional design in order to realize the principles that justify democracy (Abizadeh 2008, 41; Cohen 1989; Habermas 1996; Song 2012, 44). And given that the creation of demoi is a decision of institutional design, it should be made democratically. Yet this conclusion shows that an unbounded demos is not decision‐independent.            "
"12","In sum, “independent” criteria currently available in the literature are not, in fact, decision‐independent; they still suffer from the indeterminacy problem. So, in my view, the official solutions to the boundary problem offered by statists and nationalists/culturalists, on the one hand, and by cosmopolitans, on the other hand, ultimately fail."
"13","Given the seeming failure of their official solutions, it is worth asking whether these theories might not also have a tacit solution to the boundary problem. In this section, I argue that they do. The leading statist, culturalist, nationalist, and cosmopolitan solutions to the problem ultimately rely on the notion of a well‐defined territory to demarcate the people. They all tacitly make the people a function of a well‐defined territory."
"14","Many statist responses to the boundary problem explicitly rely on territory because they use the existing borders of territorial states to establish the initial boundaries of the people (or the unit) and then the demos (Christiano 2006; Dahl 1989; Song 2012). However, territorial exclusion is not unique to statist democratic theories. It is also present in those theories that rely on independent cultures and nations as their principle of exclusion, as well as in those theories that advocate an unbounded demos. In the case of the culturalists and nationalists, as we will see, their theories do not in fact ultimately define the people by a culture but rather in terms of a given state territory or national “homeland.” In the case of the cosmopolitans, their principles only become compatible with democratic governance in territorially demarcated communities. Let us examine these positions in turn.            "
"15","According to Margalit and Raz, the main exponents of the idea of self‐determination of independent cultures, not all cultural groups have a right to self‐determination. These writers offer the examples of the fiction‐reading public and a club of soccer fans as groups that have a common culture but do not enjoy political rights of self‐determination (1990, 443). On their theory, what grants the right to collective self‐determination is that encompassing groups play an important role in supporting the freedom and autonomy of individuals. However, their theory also holds that a group can have a right of self‐determination only when it forms “a substantial majority in a territory” (457). In fact, the right of self‐determination “is a right over a territory” (458). This means that, conceptually, the territory is prior to the group. Hence what makes self‐determination possible is not the existence of an encompassing group, but rather that the group is a majority in a given territory. In sum, the stable boundaries of the given territory are conceptually prior to the group and its right of self‐determination (see also Nine 2012, 46).            "
"16","This territory‐based theoretical structure is also present in nationalist theories, of which Miller's is perhaps the best example. Miller explicitly states that there is an intrinsic connection between nationality and a particular geographical place (1995, 24). Yet, the connection is deeper than he acknowledges. As with the culturalists, the criterion of exclusion from the demos is ultimately not the nation (22), but rather the national territorial state that confers rights of participation in the political community. For a person has a right to political participation only when she has citizenship. And on Miller's theory, when nations are territorially ill‐defined or interspersed, the question of state boundaries—and thus citizenship—is indeterminate (113–15). Hence what allows nationalists to demarcate the demos with any clarity is not nationality but rather the jurisdictional authority of a nation‐state in a given territory. Therefore, in these arguments too, culture is less important than territory.            "
"17","This unacknowledged dependence on territory is also present in cosmopolitan approaches. As we saw, cosmopolitan responses to the boundary problem deploy the Unbounded Demos Thesis (Abizadeh 2008). According to Abizadeh, we need not appeal to the affected‐interests principle to conclude that there is an unbounded demos. One can reach the same ambitious conclusion solely from a commitment to popular sovereignty. On his view, popular sovereignty requires that political power be justified “by and to those who are subject to it, in a manner that is consistent with their freedom and equality” (2008, 47). This means that states have no right to unilaterally control their own borders (37), given that border regimes coerce both citizens and aliens. Yet this argument presupposes that, even if states have an obligation to justify border governance to citizens and foreigners, the citizenry's scope remains defined by each state's borders. Hence, in Abizadeh's theory, democratic governance still depends on established territorial jurisdictions.            "
"18","One could object that while territorial jurisdictions are still in place, they are irrelevant when it comes to the problem of defining peoples. For, according to Abizadeh, decisions about border making and border control would be made by all those whom the boundary coerces. This means that we would not require a territorial boundary to define the relevant demos only for this particular decision because boundaries coerce both citizens and noncitizens alike: so the unbounded demos “extends as far as practices of mutual justification can go” (2008, 48). However, this view equivocates over the meaning of “practices of mutual justification” (2008, 48). It is true that practices of mutual justification can extend as far as there are human beings. Yet, the fact that these practices are universal cannot alone determine the shape of the demos. In the abstract, the possibility of mutual justification does not determine anything substantial about the political realm; it only provides a formal standard to determine whether a norm could be valid.3 Practices of mutual justification, like universal moral norms, exist potentially among all humans, but the laws required to establish a demos (which is a political institution) exist only in communities that have shared institutions of lawmaking (Habermas 1996, 108). Thus, even if a demos is potentially unbounded, any actual demos depends on established democratic institutions and thus on a difference between citizens and aliens. These considerations do not refute Abizadeh's argument as a normative ideal, but they do show that any actual democratic regime of border control must rely on particular territories.            "
"19","Territoriality is also required in other cosmopolitan views. Cosmopolitan thinkers generally gloss over the details of how to precisely establish the borders of territorial jurisdictions because for them territory is not a relevant moral distinction. For example, for those who argue for a prima facie right to free movement (Carens 1987; Hayter 2000), territory may not seem contentious: if all individuals have a right to come and go as they see fit, exclusion (territorial or otherwise) is not important. However, free movement alone does not settle the question of who gets to decide on the precise shape of demoi. In fact, it makes territoriality even more salient: for if one holds that individuals can become part of a new demos just by settling in a new jurisdiction, then territoriality determines political belonging.            "
"20","This issue also arises in other cosmopolitan views more sensitive to territorial jurisdictions. According to Pogge, for example, cosmopolitanism is compatible with democratic governance to the extent that sovereignty is vertically distributed: there exist relevant political units above and below the level of the state (Pogge 1992, 69). These units are to be established on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity and self‐determination. Yet these principles, in turn, depend on majoritarian decisions of “the inhabitants of any contiguous territory of reasonable shape” (69, 70). Hence Pogge's democratic construction of the demos also relies on the prior establishment of the boundaries of a contiguous territory. Goodin, by contrast, rejects subsidiarity and self‐determination as plausible criteria of exclusion. Instead, he proposes a schema of compensation to lessen the effect of the inevitable disenfranchisement that occurs in a divided world (Goodin 2007, 66–67). So, on his view, the realization of democratic principles remains worldwide in principle, but for all practical matters it also depends on the existence of distinct polities divided by territorial borders.            "
"21","If this is right, then while democrats may differ on their preference for bounded or unbounded demoi in principle, in practice, they all require territory to define the group that makes collective decisions. The people is ultimately viewed as a function of territory.            "
"22","To this point, I have tried to show that a well‐defined territory is a tacit background assumption in the leading solutions to the boundary problem. In this section, I argue the converse: that the leading statist, nationalist, culturalist, and cosmopolitan justifications of territorial rights all tacitly or explicitly rely on the notion of a well‐defined people to demarcate territory."
"23","Territory, as a criterion of exclusion, must be compatible with democratic legitimacy. This means that territorial holdings must be rightful. But who has a right to territory? Political theorists have traditionally assumed that the holders of territorial rights are peoples, who have a right of self‐determination that they may exercise over a given territory. This view has been explicitly put forward by Miller (2012), who holds that peoples (defined as national or cultural groups) define jurisdictions and have a right to control borders and resources. In other versions of this view, the right to territory is also collective, even when it is justified on the basis of the rights of the group's individual members (Margalit and Raz 1990; Meisels 2003; Nine 2008; Philpott 1995). This relation between individuals and territory is established through the state. States have jurisdictional authority over a territory, and in a legitimate democratic state, the people are the ultimate source of authority. Hence, “in democratic liberal theory, it is the people, ultimately, for whom and by whom jurisdictional authority is to be exercised” (Buchanan 2003, 244). By appealing to the people, then, modern theories of territorial rights can justify territorial claims on the basis of liberal‐democratic principles. But these accounts have other unintended consequences: besides establishing a right over a given territory, this view implicitly makes territory a function of peoplehood.         "
"24","Territory is a function of the people because it is defined in terms of the people's rights. This is explicit in nationalist accounts of territorial rights like Miller's (2012) or Meisels's, who argues that “a joint territory, a homeland, is inherent to nationalism” (2003, 27); but it also obtains in theories of secession and self‐determination grounded on individual rights (Moore 1998; Philpott 1995). The assumption also appears in contemporary Lockean theories of territory such as Nine's (2008), which uses an individualist theory to argue for a collective territorial jurisdiction. In other accounts, territory is a function of the people by way of the state. In order to exercise self‐government, peoples need states; individuals hold certain rights and duties that can only be realized under government, and the establishment of a liberal government that secures peace and protects moral rights is necessarily territorial (Wellman 2005, 251). According to Stilz (2009, 205–6), for example, a people as a whole has a right to territory because the state that has jurisdictional authority over a territory represents the people. The assumption that a people has a right to territory is present even in value‐individualist theories of secession based on consent (Beran 1988). In all these cases, a people is the holder of territorial rights.         "
"25","Now, by making the people hold territorial rights, these theories also make territory a function of the people. For one must define a people first in order to define the territory in question. This is obvious in the case of nationalistic views that define territory as a national homeland. But it is also true of nonnationalistic liberal democratic views because in a democracy, the people is ultimately the authority that establishes a state's territorial jurisdiction (Buchanan 2003).         "
"26","Jurisdiction, or more precisely jurisdictional authority by the state or other political entity, turns a bounded place into a territory. This authority is “the right to make and adjudicate legal rules within a domain” (Buchanan 2003, 233). Yet this domain does not include the authority to establish the jurisdiction's boundaries; that is the province of a metajurisdictional authority. A metajurisdictional authority has the right to create and alter all jurisdictions, including geographical jurisdictions. So the existence of a territory depends on whomever has the right to determine whether a state and its borders are legitimate and thus on whether a state has a right to rule over a given territory. In contemporary accounts of territorial rights, the only persons invested with this right are the individuals who dwell on some land. Such theories hold that metajurisdictional authority belongs to a people, the collective subject of rights and the prepolitical ground of the constitution. This, say these theories, follows from the principles of popular sovereignty and self‐determination. As the constitutive power in a state, the people has a right to create and dissolve the states’ institutions, including those that determine territorial jurisdiction. Hence, in this view, only peoples have metajurisdictional authority.         "
"27","This view of metajurisdictional authority is implicit in culturalist and nationalist views, but it is also prevalent in statist views which consider the demos—as a group of citizens—the territorial state's legitimate ground (Stilz 2009). This view is also a corollary of consent theories of territory, which hold that the people, conceived as an association of free and equal individuals, is the maker of state institutions and hence the maker of the territory where the state has jurisdiction (Beran 1987; Wellman 2005). So, given that the best available theories of territorial rights hold that the people is the metajurisdictional authority that establishes geographical jurisdiction, and given that jurisdictional authority defines the geographical boundaries of the state, these theories hold that peoples have the authority to determine territorial boundaries. In sum, territory is a function of the people.         "
"28","A cosmopolitan thinker could object that this account only considers theories of territorial rights for independent bounded peoples with exclusive jurisdiction. Would the problem arise, the objection runs, in a cosmopolitan theory of territory that provided full freedom of movement? It is true that just as we can imagine an unbounded demos, so we can also envision a world divided by a system of jurisdictions arranged for administrative efficiency, not according to rights to self‐determination. In this case, territory would not be defined by the people. Yet, the arrangement would again encounter the problem of closed and open moral decisions. Given that determining where the boundary falls is an important decision that ought to be democratic, we would require some sort of world demos to determine the new jurisdictions, and the lack of such a demos is precisely what is at stake in this debate.4"
"29","Hence, if my arguments in this section are right, all of these leading justifications of territorial rights ultimately rely on the notion of a well‐defined people."
"30","I have tried to show that the leading theories of the people's boundaries tacitly assume that the people is to be demarcated in terms of well‐defined territory and that their counterpart theories of territorial rights tacitly assume that territories are to be demarcated in terms of well‐defined peoples. In short, the leading statist, nationalist, culturalist, and cosmopolitan theories of people, territory, and democratic legitimacy seem caught in a circularity paradox: the paradox of people and territory."
"31","The paradox is a problem because territory is commonly used as a decision‐independent criterion to individuate and define the people that rules itself. But if the territory depends on the people's existence, then territorial rights and the state's legitimacy depend again on the group's self‐definition. This problem surfaces in the practical politics of border drawing, as in the cases of secession and decolonization. That was precisely why the English constitutional scholar Ivor Jennings criticized the carve‐up of Europe based on Woodrow Wilson's doctrine of self‐determination: “On the surface it seemed reasonable: Let the people decide. It was in fact ridiculous because the people cannot decide until somebody decides who are the people” (1956, 56).         "
"32","This paradox, like all paradoxes, is worrisome, but it can work as a wake‐up call for democratic theory. Paradoxes are stepping stones rather than dead ends, and so this last section lays out four paths political theorists could take to deal with the problem. It sketches the main difficulties and advantages of each of these approaches, but it lays special emphasis on the fourth, which I find particularly promising."
"33","I produce these approaches by drawing analogies with existing solutions to other paradoxes in political theory. Those other problems are as hard to handle as the circularity of people and territory because they also show that deeply held assumptions and normative commitments in democratic theory conflict. In that respect, the problem of people and territory resembles Wolff's (1970) Conflict between Autonomy and Authority or Habermas's (2001) Paradox of Constitutional Democracy. Those paradoxes have the same structure as the one we are discussing: they seem to show that some normative assumptions used to legitimize rule either contradict each other or are incompatible with reality. In contemporary political theory, intractable problems of this type are commonly dealt with in one of four different ways. Thus, it is likely that political theorists would try to deal similarly with the vicious circle of people and territory by either asserting, circumventing, solving, or dissolving it. I now turn to describing these four approaches to political paradoxes.         "
"34","Those who assert intractable problems accept that normative principles conflict, and thus they either assert the conflict and relinquish one of the conflicting principles, or, alternatively, accept the costs of not making such a difficult choice. So, for example, Wolff (1970) adopts an assert‐and‐relinquish strategy in his famous treatment of anarchism. He concludes that autonomous individuals cannot subject their will to somebody else and thus that autonomy is incompatible with authority. His final conclusion is that we should assert the contradiction, stand by our commitment to autonomy, relinquish authority, and bite the bullet of anarchism. An example of the second strategy comes from several scholars who refer to “the paradox of founding.” In their view, the historical origins of the state are always incompatible with a rational democratic founding, and thus they assert the paradox and the “constitutive imperfectness of reason” (Thomassen 2008, 119). Those who hold this view often claim that paradox is an inevitable reality of political thinking (Honig 2007); they refuse to relinquish any of the conflicting principles and hold that paradoxes can have positive consequences: in practice, they say, the conflicting principles of a paradox function as a productive site of contestation that revitalizes politics (Frank 2010; Näsström 2007; Ochoa Espejo 2012).            "
"35","How would the assertion approach work in the case of the paradox of people and territory? I see two strategies parallel to those described above. First, we could assert the paradox and relinquish one of the principles, by asserting that the relation of people and territory is indeed circular and that this circularity is proof of the impossibility of grounding territorial rights or legitimizing the state democratically. Thus, we would conclude that territorial rights are not compatible with liberal democracy, and hence we must choose between those two ideals. Given this choice, one could adopt territorial rights and accept that in a given territory, democracy will always lack a legitimate democratic founding. This is the view of nationalists who associate the origins of the state with the origins of the nation and its territorial rights. This tack, then, will have a coherent argument for establishing territorial rights, but it would have to give up its liberal democratic credentials. Alternatively, we could choose liberal democracy—give up territorial rights and try to figure out a way to make liberal democracy work without a well‐defined people and without territorial jurisdictions. This remains a possibility, but it would require a worked‐out theory that does not exist yet."
"36","Second, we could refuse to choose and instead adopt a tragic orientation to deal with the problem. Those adopting this orientation would accept that democracy and territorial rights are incompatible, thus accepting that the democratic state is unavoidably illegitimate. The advantage of this problem‐asserting approach is its straightforwardness, but one could argue that unless we conciliate between the conflicting premises, we have not dealt with the theoretical difficulty and the practical problems that it entails."
"37","When confronted with an intractable problem in democratic theory, those who adopt this approach accept the problem's reality, but they save the premises from the unpalatable conclusion by building a containment dam around the difficulty. Famously, Whelan (1983) deals with the boundary problem by using this strategy. Whelan acknowledges that a people cannot decide the question of membership democratically, but he does not think that this is a fundamental problem for democratic theory. The problem, he claims, just establishes the limits of democratic decision making. This means that the problems of membership cannot be dealt with democratically, but all other such problems are susceptible to democratic decisions.            "
"38","Without acknowledging it, this is also how most theorists deal with the circularity between people and territory. If pressed, they may recognize the vicious circularity, but they often contain the problem by isolating this difficulty in the moment of the state's foundation and then concentrating on states that are already constituted and whose territory is well defined (e.g., Christiano 2006). In this view, we can still legitimize the state democratically, provided that we begin from assumed existing peoples and given territories.            "
"39","This approach allows us to keep democracy, people, and territory intact. However, the solution only works when people and territories are in fact stable. The solution fails in cases of territorial conflict or problems concerning population displacement. The strategy does not work when the problem overflows the dam, as it were. Clearly, that has been the case in the last decades, when immigration has challenged the existing boundaries of nations and states. Moreover, the strategy would certainly be insufficient in the case of contested territorial claims or of territorial problems related to massive immigration that could emerge from a global environmental crisis."
"40","This approach accepts that the theoretical problem is difficult, but it still tackles the difficulty head‐on. In this view, paradoxes—even logical paradoxes—can be solved. For example, Habermas recently proposed a new solution to the vicious circle of liberal rights and democratic institutions in constitutional democracies (Habermas 2001). He claims to solve the chicken‐and‐egg problem of citizens who create democratic institutions and democratic institutions that create citizens by proposing the “co‐original constitution” of both terms in question (Habermas 2001; Olson 2007). On this view, there is a positive feedback loop between liberal rights and popular sovereignty: the loop then dissolves the vicious circle over time.            "
"41","Analogously, we could imagine a solution to the paradox of people and territory that viewed both terms as co‐original. On this approach, peoples and territories are created in unison as lived practices. They emerge in a given place as a political process unfolds, and over time they attain a legal sanction. This implies that territory is not given to us as a morally neutral fact of history. Instead, territories are made by those who participate in political projects. The people, in turn, are constituted by the interactions that occur in a particular place. These mutually reinforcing processes make territory part of the discourse of legitimacy. If people and territory are co‐original, there is no question of priority and thus, no circularity."
"42","An argument of this type seems promising; however, it may suffer the same ailments as Habermas's proposal for constituting the appropriate demos within a constitutional democracy. In both cases, there is no guarantee that the actual political processes that ground the state are normative. How do we know that the people and territory that mutually create each other will constitute the right boundary over time? For the processes to satisfy democratic principles, the rules that govern the process would have to be agreed upon by all parties (citizens and foreigners) from the outset. But if we lack a people from the get‐go, we cannot count on this initial consensus. (For similar critiques, see Goodin 2007, 45–46, and Näsström 2011, 131.)            "
"43","This is the traditional way of dealing with paradoxes in philosophy. Those who adopt this approach proceed by analyzing the problem: if the premises are true, the reasoning sound, and the conclusion leads to a contradiction, then we are in the presence of a true paradox. To escape the paradox, one can then weaken the assumptions that lead to the contradiction up to the point where they no longer conflict. Thus, can we undo the paradox and dissolve the difficulty? For example, when confronting Wolff's conflict between authority and autonomy, we could define autonomy such that it is compatible with obeying somebody else's commands (Raz 1986).5 So defined, authority no longer conflicts with autonomy. Hence the paradox is dissolved.            "
"44","Similarly, in the case of the vicious circle between people and territory, we can begin by analyzing the problem. The analysis reveals that the origin of the vicious circularity is the underlying problem of popular indeterminacy (unless the people creates the people, we jeopardize equality). We can then redefine the terms so that they no longer conflict. There are at least two ways to do this.               "
"45","This solution is attractive in that it logically dissolves the problem, but its revised idea of equality is likely to encounter the same practical difficulties as the principle of affected interests. How do we determine individual stakes in the political process? Who decides? This would lead back to popular indeterminacy and eventually to territory as a proxy for the demographic boundary. Moreover, one could object that democratic theorists should not compromise when it comes to basic principles such as equality.               "
"46","Can we rethink the concept of territory such that it better describes the world and also works within democratic theory? I believe this is the most promising tack to take in dealing with the paradox. However, it leads to terra incognita. For while democratic theory has views about territorial rights, it has practically nothing to say about territory itself. In fact, according to Elden, “political theory lacks a sense of territory, and territory lacks a political theory”(2010, 799). For Kolers (2009, 2), territory is political philosophy's elephant in the room. The vicious circle of people and territory opens up a whole new area of research for democratic theory.            "
"47","How should democratic theory think of territory? Why does a specific place or land matter for democracy? Why should democracy be local? Are universal liberal rights compatible with territorial jurisdictions? Should there be borders? Where should they lie? Current statist or liberal cosmopolitan views offer few answers to these questions. By way of conclusion, then, I lay out a future research agenda for a democratic theory of territory. The following items would help us avoid the vicious circle and stay attuned to democratic commitments:               "
"48","Complying with these criteria may seem demanding, but it is not impossible. In recent years, some have begun to think along these lines by examining the legal and technological contexts that define territory over time, including the evolution of legal thinking and techniques of mapping and measuring (Elden 2010), as well as by focusing on a culture's relation to its environment in terms of specific “ethnogeographies” (Kolers 2009, 67).            "
"49","Following these criteria, we could develop a democratic theory of peoplehood which takes into consideration equality and affected interests. Yet, rather than asking whose interests, we can shift our gaze to what type of interests with which we are dealing. This shift in focus is promising because interests do not depend solely on individual identity, but rather they arise from the type of roles and institutions that take place in particular circumstances. Thus, we may be able to define a set of environmental and political relations existing in specific geographical areas and use those to independently demark democratic institutions, thus facilitating governance of demoi, which may be in principle unbounded.            "
"50","I have argued in this article for two claims. First, the leading statist, nationalist, culturalist, and cosmopolitan theories of how to demarcate peoples ultimately rely on the notion of a well‐defined territory. Second, their counterpart theories of how to demarcate territories ultimately rely on the notion of a well‐defined people. The two claims imply that these theories fall afoul of a vicious circle, the paradox of people and territory."
"51","The circularity is a real paradox, and like all paradoxes, it may initially seem daunting. Yet it is not a dead end, but rather an opportunity to advance. By shifting the focus away from the abstract nature of identity and communities and by turning towards concrete institutions in a concrete environment, political theorists can advance debates on immigration, cosmopolitan governance, and environmental degradation. Rather than concentrating on abstract questions about belonging, this new focus would allow democratic theory to focus on concrete questions about political relations and practices in specific places. A focus on which interests are affected, rather than whose interests they are, could help us dissolve the boundary problem. But it could also help steer democratic theory away from intractable debates about identity and towards new questions about democratic practices, environmental relations, and stewardship.         "
"52","The four ways of dealing with the problem of people and territory that I have presented here are rough sketches rather than finished solutions. Moreover, the suggested avenues are not exhaustive. They are just four among a myriad of possibilities. It may be important to explore some of those possibilities as we encounter more practical problems relating to immigration and disputed territorial claims. These problems are bound to increase, as the world's population increases, land becomes scarce, and transnational environmental problems, such as food shortages and climate emergencies, produce more waves of immigration. As problems related to the democratic management of land and resources become more salient, new scrutiny of long‐held conventions regarding people and territory will be particularly urgent."
