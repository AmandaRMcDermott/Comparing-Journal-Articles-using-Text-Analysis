"1","John Stuart Mill's work, particularly On Liberty, is often read as embracing and perpetuating what Charles Taylor (1979) has called the atomism and primacy of rights theses.7 Mill is, in other words, read as offering a quintessential defense of rights grounded in a particular set of ontological commitments that, at their core, presume that individuals are, naturally, rightfully, and/or simply best off when they are unencumbered by the interferences of others. Such readings are supported by considerable evidence. A critic of the despotism of custom, of the increasingly invasive reach of social norms, Mill demands that with regard to action that “merely concerns himself” an individual's “independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign” (1991b, 14). These are the well‐known (and somewhat infamous) words of Mill's Harm Principle. They are taken to mean that when an individual is engaged in self‐regarding activities that have no effect on others, she has a right to do as she desires and these desires should take precedence over the concerns of society. In cases of other‐regarding behavior, evidence of harm serves as a necessary, though not necessarily sufficient, condition for legitimately intervening with her freedom.8 Why should the individual be free from the interference of the state or society to follow her own path of life? Because, according to Mill, individual and social progress depends upon this freedom. Progress requires that individuals have the freedom to follow their own life plans, unhindered by the capricious “likings or dislikings” of society. Human capacities only flourish, Mill suggests, when “left alone,” and thus individuals “arrived at the maturity of [their] faculties,” should have the right “to use and interpret experience in [their] own way (1991b, 64). To hinder individual freedom would be to jeopardize both individual and social well‐being.         "
"2","Millian subjects thus deploy rights to protect their freedom and their privacy. And their claims should be respected: “To have rights is to have something which society ought to defend me in the possession of” (1991d, 189). But not because rights adhere to individuals by virtue of their humanity, not because they are the natural birthright of human beings. Rather, rights should be protected and respected because they serve the interests of society, advancing the “permanent interests of man as a progressive being” (1991b, 15). A rights claim is valid, in other words, if it contributes to individual and social well‐being, and, of course, if, in exercising that right, I avoid doing harm to others. In such cases, my right should trump all other considerations absolutely. A rights claim, Mill explains, “assumes that character of absoluteness” and comes to seem incommensurable “with all other considerations.” The “ought and should” implicit in the rights claim “grow into must” (1991d, 190).         "
"3","Given Mill's description of individual freedom and rights, it is not surprising that Wolff describes Millian society as “a system of independent centers of consciousness, each pursuing its own gratification and confronting the others as beings standing over‐against the self ” (1968, 142). Nor is it surprising that Berlin interprets Mill as attempting to protect “a minimum area of personal freedom which must on no account be violated” through the construction of an inviolable barrier, a clear demarcation “between the area of private life and that of public authority” (1969, 124). And while some may celebrate Mill for giving pride of place to individual rights and allowing them to take precedence over obligations to society, others condemn him. Indeed, what pleases Berlin troubles Glendon, a scholar who very explicitly locates the antidemocratic tendencies of rights in Millian ontology.         "
"4","In her 1990 book, Rights Talk, Glendon offers a scathing criticism of Anglo‐American rights discourse, a discourse whose roots she locates in the work of John Stuart Mill.9 According to Glendon, Millian rights enter the American political discourse most explicitly through Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis's famous treatise “The Right of Privacy.” So captivated were they by Mill's depiction and celebration of privacy—the only sphere in which genius and individuality could flourish—that they promoted it as one of the fundamental, if not the most important, rights of political society. In doing so, Glendon argues, they brought the Millian conception of rights as trumps, with its peculiar ontological underpinnings, into the American public discourse. In defending the individual's right of privacy as necessary to human flourishing, Warren and Brandeis perpetuated a Millian conception of individuals as atomistic and unencumbered, as “lone rights‐bearers.” They tacitly accepted and thus promoted a conception of individuals as, to borrow DiStefano's language, “clearly demarcated” and “field‐independent,” as “capable of maintaining a discrete identity vis‐à‐vis fellow human beings” (1991, 171).10"
"5","Unfortunately, Glendon argues, this Americanized version of Millian rights is both philosophically and politically problematic. It inaugurates a “hyperindividualism” and an absolutism that is politically destructive. As she explains, in embracing and defending Mill's “lone rights‐bearer,” American society comes to devalue an ethic of responsibility and ignore the needs of the community, fundamentally rejecting the participatory ethos necessary to sustain democratic community.11 We end up, that is, undermining the very foundations of a democratic society, “ignoring or downgrading healthy forms of interdependence” and overlooking important sources of communal viability (1990, 75). This democratically debilitating political ethos is inextricably linked to a fundamentally flawed ontology. The Millian paradigm, in other words, obscures the facts of our intersubjectivity and fails to appreciate the extent to which we come to be selves in relation to rather than in isolation from others. Thus with their defense of Millian rights, Warren and Brandeis not only encoded a conception of the rights‐bearing subject as separated from and in antagonistic relations with others, but helped create a political ethos that releases individuals from obligations of democratic participation and devalues the common good.         "
"6","But does Mill's work really fail to appreciate the intersubjective dimensions of the human condition? Does his defense of individual rights rest on such ontological premises? And, if so, does this have the kind of problematic consequences for democratic politics suggested by Glendon? To answer these questions, I take a closer look not only at On Liberty, but at A System of Logic (The Logic) as well. As I suggest below, despite the celebration of a sphere of unfettered freedom bounded and protected by inviolable rights that seems to emerge from traditional readings of On Liberty, Mill never conceived of the individual as completely extractable or isolatable from society. To attribute such a conception of the subject to Mill is to miss his deep commitment to the doctrine of necessity and his deep suspicion of the doctrine of free will. It is to miss his recognition that individuals are never purely willing or self‐interested, but are, rather, constituted through social networks and thus vulnerable to both the positive and negative influences of society.         "
"7","On the communitarian reading, it would appear that Mill denies the important role that social forces play in the development of individuals and presumes instead that individuals have access to ideas and volitions that are independent of society. To put it in Taylor's language, Mill appears to repudiate the notion that distinctive human capacities develop within the context of social relations and, instead, presents such relations as a threat to this development. But Mill's understanding of subjectivity, developed in The Logic and sprinkled throughout his political writings, suggests otherwise. In The Logic, particularly the chapter “Of Liberty and Necessity,” we see Mill's frustration with the metaphysical distinctions he has inherited and find him struggling to articulate a theory of human subjectivity that avoids the extremes of both the doctrines of free will and necessity popular during his day. It is here that we get a glimpse of his deep investment in the kind of intersubjective dimensions of human character that the atomism thesis is presumed to occlude.         "
"8","For Mill, who we are, what we do, how we think—our volitions and our actions—are not the result of nor do they flourish by being left alone, isolated in our sphere of freedom, protected from social forces by a set of inviolable borders. In fact, it is almost impossible, Mill suggests, to conceive of individuals as isolatable from social forces or to imagine character as emanating from some pure form of unshaped consciousness or will. As he explains in The Subjection of Women, it would be impossible to “isolate a human being from the circumstances of his condition, so as to ascertain experimentally what he would have been by nature” (1991c, 544). All that we can do is “consider what he is, and what his circumstances have been, and whether the one would have been capable of producing the other” (1991c, 544). This is because Mill is a proponent of what was known at the time as the doctrine of necessity. Or, to be more precise, Mill was a proponent of a modified doctrine of necessity that he preferred to call the doctrine of causation.         "
"9","The doctrine of necessity posits that human actions have identifiable causes. It seeks to show that “our volitions and actions are invariable consequents of our antecedent states of mind” (1963b, 837). Human behavior, according to this doctrine, can be attributed to causal factors in much the same way that movement in the physical world can be attributed to physical causes. Our education, our upbringing, our work experiences, all these influence our character and inform our temperament and our actions. For example, what we take to be natural about men or women—feminine nature or manliness—these are the product of everything from educational opportunities to what we learn about ourselves and how to treat others from watching our parents interact. If these circumstances are changed, our characters will change and this, in turn, will change the decisions we make and the actions we take."
"10","Of course, the attribution of human behavior to causal laws, not surprisingly, alarmed many. Proponents of the doctrine of free will argued that human volitions were uncaused, not the effects of causes that “they uniformly and implicitly obey” (1963b, 836). To conceive of human actions as the necessary outcome of causes, they argued, was both nonsensical and demeaning, “inconsistent with every one's instinctive consciousness, as well as humiliating to the pride and even degrading to the moral nature of man” (836). If all of human behavior were attributable to a specific cause, how could we explain our feelings of free will, and what kind of responsibility or accountability would be left for the individual? We would all be social dupes."
"11"," Mill, however, believed otherwise. His particular understanding of the doctrine of necessity explicitly rejects the idea that individuals are socially determined. Indeed, he argues that causation is actually consistent rather than inconsistent with much of our experience. Empirically, our experiences are more likely to confirm than to dumbfound causal explanations of our actions. Philosophically, causation has never been completely at odds with doctrines of free will. One need just to consider religious doctrines to realize that freedom of the will has always been consistent with antecedent causes such as God's will (1963b, 837). To be free, in other words, need not foreclose the possibility that our actions have antecedent causes, empirically or philosophically. In fact, to believe otherwise, Mill believes, is to make a potentially grave error, to embrace a “false philosophy.” For Mill, the doctrine of free will divorced from any theory of causation is not only incorrect but dangerous: “The notion that truths external to the mind may be known by intuition or consciousness, independently of observation and experience, is, I am persuaded, in these times, the great intellectual support of false doctrines and bad institutions” (1952, 191).         "
"12","In rejecting the doctrine of free will, however, Mill is careful to distinguish himself from those who adopt a more strict interpretation of the doctrine of necessity and assume an absolute determinism to human behavior. Proponents of the strict interpretation, he argues, make as grave an error as proponents of the doctrine of free will when they posit an irresistibility or absolute determinism to human actions. Simply “Because something will certainly happen if nothing is done to prevent it,” does not mean that “it will certainly happen whatever may be done to prevent it” (1963a, 469). It does not mean that there is some “mysterious compulsion” that determines the shape of our all actions (467). Perhaps it would be best then, he suggests, to replace the term “necessity” with the term “causation” for “The application of so improper a term as Necessity to the doctrine of cause and effect in the matter of human character seems to me one of the most signal instances in philosophy of abuse of terms … The subject will never be generally understood, until that objectionable term is dropped” (1963b, 841).         "
"13"," Mill's modified doctrine of necessity or causation draws attention not to what must happen, but only what will happen, given certain circumstances. Certain things will occur if unimpeded. For example, while it may be true that we will die if we go without food or air, it need not be inevitable that the lack of food or air will lead to our death. Causation does not, according to Mill, entail a must, for there are many other factors that may come into play to alter the outcome of particular causes: “human actions are … never … ruled by any one motive with such absolute sway, that there is no room for the influence of another” (1963c, 839). Moreover, it is not possible to know all the circumstances that influence action and volition. So numerous and varied are the circumstances that shape an individual's character that it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine precisely which influences cause which effects. These facts render the doctrine of necessity far less absolute and determinist, far more unpredictable and contingent, than some would think.12"
"14"," Mill's rejection of the strict interpretation of the doctrine of necessity is premised on more than simply an awareness of the potentially infinite circumstances that may shape a person's character. He also recognizes something that is beyond the reach of circumstances and is, in fact, to be considered a circumstance itself. One of those innumerable circumstances that shapes individual character and generates diversity of character and unpredictability of action is our feeling of moral power, the “power to alter [our] character” (1963b, 840). While refusing to call this free will, Mill does describe it as a “feeling of our being able to modify our own character if we wish” (841), and he remains committed to seeing this power as consistent with the modified doctrine of necessity he embraces. It is a perversion of the doctrine of necessity to believe that one's “character is formed for him, not by him” for “We are exactly as capable of making our own character, if we will, as others are of making it for us” (840).         "
"15","As Mill explains elsewhere, this power to modify our character derives, in part, from the fact that individuals are born with certain capacities including “faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feelings, mental activity, and even moral preference” (1991b, 65) and at least two sentiments, sympathy and self‐defense, which “either are or resemble instincts” (1991d, 186). When we recognize the many ways in which circumstances can interact to encourage or curtail these capacities and instincts, it becomes clear that human beings are born with “a whole world of possibilities” (1963c, 392–93). In fact, it is only in social context and through social relations, through the “artificial discipline” of education, legislation, and social arrangements, that these potentials and capacities come to have meaning.         "
"16","For Mill, unraveling the mystery of human subjectivity requires rejecting facile depictions of individuals as either purely free willing and self‐interested or as unwitting social dupes. Recognizing an element of truth to both the doctrine of necessity and the doctrine of freewill, Mill suggests that the two doctrines be joined together in order to more accurately and adequately capture the human experience."
"17","What bearing does Mill's modified doctrine of necessity have on the kind of political ethos that emerges from his work or, more specifically, on his understanding of rights? What would it mean for this Millian subject to make a rights claim? Mill, I suggest, was far too cognizant of the irreducibly social dimensions of subjectivity to imagine that individuals could deploy rights to isolate themselves from all other social influences or to believe that individuals would, or even could, develop best when left completely alone. Instead, what emerges from his writing is not only a recognition that social forces can shape human behavior and identity, but also a desire, even an anxious compulsion, to identify those social forces that shape our character for better or worse. His point is less to construct impermeable barriers between individuals and society than it is to distinguish the kinds of social arrangements that may retard individual development from those that might cultivate character more favorably. And it is through rights that these arrangements are not only identified, but even rectified."
"18","It is not society per se that is the problem for Mill, nor are inviolable barriers the solution. Rather, it is specific social forces, “wretched arrangements,” that are the problem, and careful cultivation the solution. It is his recognition that egos are not inviolable and his recognition that character is the product of social forces and cultivation, that leads to his strident defense of the individual against society as well as to his support for other forms of social intervention. I suggest, then, that Mill's defense of individual liberty and rights offered in On Liberty and The Subjection of Women be read less as justifications for strict boundaries grounded in an embrace of a “field‐independent” subject and more as descriptions of the kind of wretched arrangements that might lead to individual and social decay.         "
"19","Traditionally, we read Mill as defending individual rights from the despotism of custom. However, it is important to remember that despotic and tyrannical practices are rejected because they cultivate character poorly. “[W]retched education and wretched social relations,” Mill argues, can lead to the production of bad characters, and these are what the individual must be saved from. For example, On Liberty and The Subjection of Women, it is the overbearing force of public opinion that is quelling dissent and disagreement, constraining freedom of expression and “experiments in living.” These circumstances are turning individuals into sheep. It is a belief in women's inequality, manifest in particular political practices and social arrangements, that is producing emotionally and mentally stunted women concerned primarily with frivolity. And it is this same system of gender subordination that makes men selfish and self‐serving (1991c, 558). In fact, according to Mill, selfishness is by no means an inevitable part of human character, but is the result of poor upbringing and bad social arrangements. Certain social arrangements and the imposition of social norms, in other words, can actually destroy affective ties and inhibit the intellectual and moral development of individuals.         "
"20"," Mill's response to these practices and institutions is, of course, to make an argument for individual freedom and rights. If poor character is the “result of forced repression in some directions, unnatural stimulation in others,” good character, Mill suggests, develops when individuals are free to pursue their own paths in life (1991c, 493). For example, he defends women's rights by arguing that if women were allowed the same freedoms as men to think and act, to choose their own life plans, then they would not only improve their faculties of judgment and perception, but contribute to the progress of society. And he defends free speech on the grounds that it will improve the faculties of judgment and perception.         "
"21","But attention to Mill's defense of individual freedom fails to appreciate the extent to which Mill also calls for intervention into the lives of individuals on precisely the same grounds that he defends their freedom. If we appreciate that extent to which Mill embraced a modified doctrine of necessity, the extent to which he believed individual character to be the product of artificial cultivation, then we can understand better why he would support some invasive public policies and not others. For example, in response to the outbreak of venereal disease in Britain, Mill suggested that military men be watched and examined in order to reduce the likelihood of their transmitting disease to their wives. He also suggested that a law be made to penalize men who were found guilty of such transmission, subjecting them to monetary penalties and allowing their wives the right to divorce them. Such policies, he believed, would have the potential to discourage men from soliciting prostitutes and thereby reduce the threat of venereal disease."
"22","One could say that he supports these policies because they address a clear harm—the transmission of venereal disease. However, the possibility of harm is not enough to explain why Mill supports intervention into men's lives and yet demands that women be free from state interference. In fact, Mill offers his policy suggestions as alternatives to the very intrusive Contagious Diseases Acts (CD Acts) supported by Parliament. The CD Acts presumed women to be the source of infection and, therefore, the proper targets of arrest, detainment, and forced medical examination. They thus supported the use of police power to round up women suspected of being prostitutes and to detain them until they received a clean bill of health. Parliament approved the regulation of women, rather than the sailors and soldiers who visited prostitutes, because they presumed men to have a natural and uncontrollable sexual propensity. Such presuppositions failed, from Mill's perspective, to appreciate the processes of causation, overestimating the “naturalness” of both female degradation and masculine sexual urges. Illicit male sexuality, he argued, was actually promoted, if not produced, by the Acts themselves. By providing men with a safe outlet for their sexual urges, the CD Acts fostered men's sexual transgressions, leaving “the impression on the minds of soldiers and sailors … that it is not discouraged, that it is considered by Parliament a necessity which may be regulated, but which must be accepted, and that Parliament does not entertain any serious disapprobation of immoral conduct of that kind” (1963d, 360). In making “illicit indulgence” safe, Parliament cultivated the very unruly male sexuality it presumed to be so natural. And this, from Mill's perspective, was a wretched arrangement that needed to be rectified, not through increasing men's freedom, but through curtailing it.         "
"23","What is important on this reading is not protecting individuals against any and all forms of majoritarian tyranny, but cultivating character in specific ways which may or may not require state intervention. In fact, one could even read Mill's defense of women's privacy rights as an effort, not to set up a sphere of unfettered freedom, but to cultivate women's character as well. Improvements in women's morality and health, Mill argued, would be more likely to result from their having the freedom to make health care decisions for themselves than from their being forced to undergo medical examination and treatment. Arrest, detainment, and forced medical treatment would only degrade women's character, while “the mere existence of hospitals” and care provided by “benevolent and excellent people” would help turn women from a life of prostitution to one of moral propriety (1963d, 365). Mill defense of women's liberty, of their right to privacy and freedom from state intervention, while seemingly able to provide a space for women's flourishing, upon closer examination appears to be intended to improve their character by urging their relocation in different webs of social relations, not abstracting them from these relations altogether.13"
"24","There are, of course, dangers to making an argument for rights based on the recognition of intersubjectivity, perils that result from linking rights to the cultivation of character. These include a tendency to transform rights into a moral discourse that seeks to distinguish those fit for rights‐bearing subjectivity from those unfit for it, and to punish or constrain those deemed unfit. This is certainly a concern raised by the postmodern readings of Mill's work (e.g., Walkowitz 1991; Zerilli 1994). But while I discuss and respond to this concern in greater detail below, my point here is simply to challenge the reading of Mill as a celebrant of a rights‐as‐trumps model that requires a commitment to atomistic individualism.         "
"25","The fact that rights are, for Mill, never meant to abstract individuals from society, but instead to acknowledge and appreciate their embeddedness in social relations is further supported by Mill's description of rights in Utilitarianism. Though usually read as a description of the absolutism and divisiveness of rights, Mill's argument is actually quite critical of the rights‐as‐trump conception. As Mill explains, a right, or rather “the idea of a right,” represents a particular set of feelings, beliefs, and demands that we commonly associate with justice. The idea of a right brings together both our ideas of justice—what we understand intellectually or what Mill associates with our rational instincts—and our sentiments of justice—what we feel or what Mill associates with the animal instincts. A right, in other words, captures our understanding of the rules that determine injury or violation as well as our desire for retaliation and revenge. When we call something a right, when we speak of violations of rights, we mean that there has been some violation of a rule of conduct, some injury, and we demand punishment out of a desire for revenge (1991d, 188–89).         "
"26","This desire for retaliation, Mill acknowledges, is an intense feeling shared by all sentient beings rooted in a common need for security. And it is what gives a rights claim the sense of absoluteness. That, however, does not make a rights claim a moral claim (1991d, 189–90). Absoluteness, he explains, is associated with an animal feeling manifest in a desire for retaliation rather than being based in anything purely rational or intellectual (188). A rights claim becomes a moral claim only when this desire is combined with what he calls “superior intelligence” or “enlarged sympathy.” The sentiment of justice that stems from a desire for revenge only becomes moral when it is subordinated to “the social sympathies” (187). Rights claims must consider the interests of society as a whole and recognize the individual as a part of that society in order to be moral, otherwise they are simply the expression of sentiments untempered by social feelings. Justice and morality, often manifest in rights claims, do not derive from purely individualistic desires for revenge. Such desires must be subordinated to social feeling. It is enlarged sympathy that moves us from an individualistic thirst for retaliation back into the community where thought, discussion, and debate are central, without giving up on the positive aspects of Mill's rights discourse—their ability to identify wretched arrangements and imagine alternatives for the cultivation of character.         "
"27","Mill's recognition that character is formed, in good ways and bad, through interactions with others, while obscured by interpretations that overemphasize Mill as a champion of atomistic individualism and rights as trumps, has itself become something of a concern. As I suggested above, it is precisely Mill's concern with what he calls “careful cultivation,” and what contemporary scholars call discipline or regulation, that leads to a different criticism of the political implications of Millian ontology, to a concern with the moralizing tendencies of rights discourse. While communitarians suggest that Mill may fail to adequately capture the intersubjective dimensions of personhood, postmodernists draw attention to the ways in which Mill's rights‐bearing subject is constituted through the disciplining and exclusion of others. For these scholars, the atomistic individual is less the starting point for Mill's philosophical writings than its goal, or rather the effect of a series of practices and discursive formations. And this discursive production of the subject comes with significant costs. In this section, I argue that the reading of Millian rights as regulatory, and therefore quite costly for democracy, tells only part of the story. In fact, the disciplinarity of rights, as Mill's argument reveals, is both constraining and enabling, often for the very same individuals."
"28","Zerilli and Passavant have offered detailed and compelling analyses of the regulatory dimensions of Millian rights discourse. Challenging the traditional liberal definition of freedom as the opposite of government intervention, they bring to light Mill's contribution to what Rose (1999) calls the practice of governing through freedom. That is, they make visible the extent to which the Millian rights‐bearing subject is produced through practices of gender, race, and class exclusion and differentiation that are meant to constitute “free” individuals. They illuminate the extent to which Mill, rather than presuming an atomistic subject in need of being freed from the illegitimate interferences of the state or society, actually goes to great lengths to bring the putatively sovereign subject into existence. Zerilli, for example, details the ways in which that the creation of such subjects requires disciplining those who cannot discipline themselves—the unruly poor, particularly women: “Mill's dread of the masses,” she argues, leads him “to advocate a series of disciplinary mechanisms that increase the power of the state, place the working‐class family under middle‐class surveillance, underwrite the factory system as an instrument of moral reform …” (1994, 98). Passavant, attentive to the intersections of class and race in Millian rights discourse, reminds us that Mill often argued that only those deemed “civilized” merited liberty and rights. Barbarians—non‐Westerners and the English working class who “resembled barbarians through their lack of speech‐related capital”—were to be excluded from rights‐bearing subjectivity (2002, 109).         "
"29","These readings rightly draw attention to the costs associated with Mill's production of subjectivity, to the perils that attend Millian rights discourse, and raise concerns about the ways in which the exclusions necessitated by Mill's argument diminish opportunities for political participation. Rights, Passavant argues, function as a “mechanism of social discipline” that reinforces national power by excluding all those who are deemed a threat (2002, 167). And Zerilli argues that Millian rights arguments reveal a desire for unity and order that “depreciate[s] politics as diversity, conflict, and dissonance” (1994, 152). These thinkers find Mill troubling, less because his perspective threatens the moral fabric of society, and more because it is premised upon and perpetuates class, gender, and/or race biases that threaten the egalitarian and participatory ethos necessary for a healthy democracy."
"30","As their work suggests, Mill's efforts to shore up the rights‐bearing subject in the face of the despotism of custom derives not from a belief in the inviolability of egos, but from his anxiety regarding the contingent and mutable character of human nature. It is this contingency of character, the possibility that who we are and how we behave can change easily and in ways beyond an individual's or a society's control, that makes Mill terribly anxious. It is the fact that development is never certain or guaranteed, that social forces do not always nurture the “nobler virtues” and that these forces are often too complex to understand completely that leads Mill to retreat to the seeming safety of the supposedly sovereign subject.14"
"31","While my own reading of Mill has much in common, and is greatly indebted to the arguments of Zerilli and Passavant, I want to offer a slightly different reading. Mill, I suggest, espouses practices of cultivation that engender a politics of engagement and contestation. Careful cultivation produces subjects who are capable of critical judgment and ethical confrontation, who are able to “challenge … existing modes of life and creat[e] … new modes of existence” (Rose 1999, 283). The very careful cultivation through which we come to be individuals and members of strong communities may be enabling to even those it is meant to exclude.         "
"32","To be fair, Passavant does want to illustrate the ways in which rights discourse enables rather than only constrains the production of subjectivity and the transformation of society. He does argue that “the practice of rights not only challenges certain modes of collective life but also helps to reconstitute positive forms of social identity” (2002, 168). However, his reading of Mill emphasizes the regulatory dimensions and costs far more than the benefits. I want to emphasize the fact that Mill actually appreciates the fact that both the “wretched arrangements” he fears and the tactics of careful cultivation he endorses are never totalizing, seamless, or wholly disabling. For example, despite a recognition that social norms and laws are producing unthinking individuals, emotionally unstable women, and selfish, sexually disruptive men, Mill refuses to grant these arrangements a totalizing power. Society still has its eccentrics and geniuses, its dissenters; it still has women who are fighting for the right to vote and receive an education, and men who refuse to treat women as their inferiors or use them for sexual pleasure (cf. Mill 1991b, 1991c). If wretched social arrangements—bad laws, poor education, misguided health policy—may retard development, but not control it completely, so the tactics of discipline remain beyond the complete control of those who espouse them.         "
"33","Consider Mill's defense of freedom of thought and expression in On Liberty. Read in the context of Mill's concerns about the cultivation of character, we come to see that engagement in dialogue and discussion is one of the most important practices of cultivation. Through the freedom of thought and expression, individual capacities for perception and judgment develop as do affective ties between individuals and a sense of care for the community.15 Human beings, Mill reminds us, are fallible, prone to make serious errors in judgment that are then codified in legislation and action. These errors are only corrected through debate, deliberation, and contestation of ideas and opinions. But freedom of thought and expression are valuable not simply because they may allow us to replace falsehood with truth or to develop new ideas and displace pernicious ones, but also, and perhaps more importantly, because it is through contestation and engagement with differences of perspective that one comes to be fully human. “Judgment,”Mill argues, “is given to men that they may use it” (1991b, 23). Like any other muscle, it must be exercised in order for it to remain strong, and it can be exercised through lively discussion that forces us to examine our deeply held beliefs. Thus it is through acting on our opinions and challenging presumed social truths that we exercise and improve the very faculties that make us human.         "
"34","And for Mill, it is best to do this in ways that are contestatory. As Waldron (1987) argues, Mill greatly appreciates the value of “moral distress” or “ethical confrontation.” Differences of opinion and variation among lifestyles often come into conflict, and this “open clash between earnestly‐held ideals and opinions about the nature and basis of the good life” is essential to individual and social progress (Waldron 1987, 414). In Mill's words, debate and discussion require the “reconciling and combining opposites” which is “a rough process of a struggle between combatants fighting under hostile banners” (1991b, 54). And though having one's fundamental beliefs and practices questioned may be painful, individuals develop an open‐mindedness, a tolerance of difference, and the ability to listen as well as persuade in the process (Waldron 1987, 416). For Mill, then, antagonism between individuals and groups holding different opinions is not rooted in an innate competitiveness or desire for isolation and absolute separation. Rather, politics as a process of refutation and contestation is a result of the deficiencies of the human mind and the usefulness of such challenges. In politics, Mill explains, opposition is healthy: “it is almost commonplace, that a party of order or stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary elements of a healthy state of political life …” (1991b, 53).         "
"35","In fact, Mill explicitly denounces the idea of a “frictionless” society. “Without the right to protest, and the capacity for it, there is … no justice, there are no ends worth pursuing” (1991d, 152). The right to protest prevents error and even truth from “hardening into prejudice” and helps to prevent the development of passive individuals who lack the courage to think and act in new and different ways. Passivity or “peace in the intellectual world” is not, according to Mill, desirable if it means conformity of opinion and action. “[T]he price paid for this sort of intellectual pacification, is the sacrifice of the entire moral courage of the human mind” (1991b, 38). Without lively debates over social norms and customs, society will not generate “the open, fearless characters, and logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the world” (38). But this character is not reserved for the geniuses or the elite. As if anticipating charges of elitism, Mill argues that freedom of thought is as important to the individual of average intellect as it is to the great thinkers. In fact, it is “even more indispensable, to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature which they are capable of ” (39). A few great minds may be able to survive in a society in which there is a despotism and uniformity of opinion, but “an intellectually active people” will never be produced under conditions of “mental slavery” (39).         "
"36","This is not to deny that Mill is concerned about the tenor of public debate. He does argue for temperance and respectful disagreement. “The free expression of all opinions,”Mill suggests, “should be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and do not pass the bounds of fair discussion” (1991b, 59). “Vituperative language” and other unsavory tactics that might stifle certain opinions must also be rejected. However, Mill denounces a disorderly politics not because he desires harmony or unemotional debates, but rather because he is concerned that tactics of bullying and denouncing opponents get used to silence certain ideas, particularly those that challenge and refute social norms and customs. The argument for temperance is not an argument for temperance as a good in and of itself, but rather as a tool meant to safeguard the space for different voices and perspectives, to allow outrage and divergent opinions a place in politics, and to make space for that one voice, that one person with a contrary opinion at risk of being muted.         "
"37","Mill's defense of individual liberty, then, is not an attack on social relations in total, but rather an attack on those relations that shut down ethical confrontation. Uncontested acceptance of public opinion and the lack of opportunities for political participation undermine the general well‐being of individuals and society. As Mill suggests, a society that willingly accepts the opinions of a few without contestation or critical engagement becomes a society of “sheep” who simply follow rules and a society without strong affective ties. In fact, communal ties result from social norms and institutions that encourage participation in social and political life. In Considerations on Representative Government, for example, Mill argues that individuals who are denied the right to vote in elections or a voice in the governance of a society become indifferent to the social well‐being and learn not to care about what happens to others. Under a despotic government, the mental faculties of human beings are deprived of exercise and thereby “stunted,” and social connections are disbanded. “Whenever the sphere of action of human beings is artificially circumscribed,”Mill argues, “their sentiments are narrowed and dwarfed in the same proportion … . Let a person have nothing to do for his country, and he will not care for it” (1991a, 240).         "
"38","Millian rights‐claiming, I am suggesting, is part of an active, participatory ethos that not only helps to constitute community, but it also allows for the contestation of the arrangements and identity categories constitutive of that very community. This becomes evident when we return to Mill's opposition to the Contagious Diseases Acts. Here Mill uses rights language to expose and dispute the dominant conceptions of male sexuality and the sexual double standard implicit in the Acts. By calling attention to the inequality perpetrated by the legislation, Mill not only challenges Parliament to rethink its public health policy, but also challenges his society to rethink their conceptions of male and female sexuality."
"39","Remember that the Contagious Diseases Acts responded to the spread of venereal disease in Britain by calling for constraints on the freedom of women. Mill was troubled by the belief that male sexual desire could not be contained and thus needed a safe outlet such as a pool of uninfected prostitutes. Supporters justified the regulation of prostitutes with the argument that men had naturally uncontrollable sexual urges and therefore needed safe outlets for their sexual desires while women did not. Women, according to this interpretation, were not only able but expected to control their sexual impulses, while men were presumed to be beyond control. In demanding the repeal of the Acts and the protection of women's right to privacy, Mill drew attention to and challenged these underlying premises."
"40","Indeed, he found the Acts to be not only gross violations of women's liberty but also “monstrous” public policy. From his perspective, Parliament was pandering to men: “The idea of keeping a large army in idleness and vice and then keeping a large army of prostitutes to pander to their vices … [is] too monstrous to admit of a moment's consideration …” Such a system, he argued, was “a monstrous artificial cure for a monstrous artificial evil which had far better be swept away at its root in accordance with democratic principles of government” (1963e, 1688). In keeping with his commitment to the doctrine of necessity, his recognition of the intersubjective and causal dimensions of subjectivity, Mill suggested that public education about the threat of disease transmission or laws criminalizing disease transmission to wives be enacted. Such policies would encourage men to change their behavior, cultivating their ability to control their sexual desires. Persuasion, advice, and information could and would, in his opinion, lead to important behavior changes. For Mill, there was nothing naturally uncontrollable about male sexuality. Rather, like women's supposedly natural inferiority or female prostitutes' supposedly natural pathology, men's supposed sexual propensity was actually a product of the very social arrangements presumed to reflect it.         "
"41","In challenging dominant conceptions of male sexuality, Mill also challenges the dominant Victorian conceptions of female sexuality. The double standard allowed and accepted male sexual license while it expected purity and virtue from women. Evidence of female sexual license (i.e., prostitution) was thus taken as evidence of the loss of femininity or womanhood defined in terms of purity and virtue. This interpretation of the female body led to a rather odd and somewhat contradictory position on prostitution. On the one hand, supporters argued that the women who were engaged in prostitution had lost all traces of their femininity or womanhood and were therefore already so degraded that surveillance and examination could not degrade them further. On the other hand, supporters also justified the regulation with the argument that such legislation would eventually lead to the reclamation of these women, thereby assuming there was some femininity left to be salvaged. These arguments were further complicated by supporters' refusal to allow the examination of men. Whereas examination of prostitutes was not seen as degrading, examination of men was. These arguments were not entirely convincing to Mill. While he agreed with supporters that female sexuality could be controlled, that it was not naturally unruly, he also believed that men could control their sexuality. And though he agreed that men could be degraded by the examination, he believed that they would be much less degraded than most women: “Men are not lowered in their own eyes as much by exposure of their persons” (1963d, 356)."
"42","To be sure, Mill's defense of women's rights, like his defense of rights in general, is full of tensions and paradoxes. While he defends women's rights and contests dominant conceptions of female inferiority by describing “character” or identity as something that is artificially and socially constituted, Mill also uses essentialized notions of gender identity to achieve the same purposes. This shift between a recognition of the mutability of identity and the naturalization of character leads Mill not only to argue for women's freedom from state interference, but also to support a host of state and socially based disciplinary practices that are quite worrisome.16 But it is, as I have argued, his understanding of the very porousness of the subject, not a belief in impermeable boundaries and inviolable egos, that leads Mill to champion individual freedom at the same time that he champions both participation in politics and the intervention of the state.         "
"43","These tensions in Mill's work are erased when he is read as a theorist of liberal individualism and a proponent of the atomism thesis. Though Mill clearly evinces an anxiety about the detrimental effects that social relations may have on human character, as the atomism thesis suggests, his understanding of what enables human development and how rights can function are, nonetheless, far more complicated than such a thesis proposes. Human beings do not, he teaches, develop their human capacities in isolation, but rather through engagement with other individuals. And rights claims are an essential element of that participation. Not only do rights claims reflect the socially situated qualities of individuals, as they reflect the partiality and plurality of perspectives, but also it is through the practice of rights claiming, through rights‐based political activity that individual identity is contested and reconstituted and communities are formed. With John Stuart Mill, then, we learn that instability and mutability at the level of identity, while anxiety producing, can also be a source of democratic political promise."
