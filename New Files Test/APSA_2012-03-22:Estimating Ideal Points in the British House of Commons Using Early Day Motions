"1","The idea that political actors can be ordered along a continuum of policy preferences goes back over 100 years. Political competition in Britain has long been described in terms of left and right. This spatial metaphor extends to differences of opinion within the major political parties. The Labour Party has been divided between the center, left, and far left. Likewise, Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher could be categorized into “wets” in the center and “drys” on the right, with varying degrees of dampness in between (Norton 1990). Political observers and commentators typically have strong beliefs about the appropriate ordering of politicians, but quantifying this intuition presents nontrivial statistical problems.         "
"2","Ideal point models provide a method to estimate the preferences of individual legislators. These models assume that political preferences can be summarized by points in one or more dimensions representing each actor’s most preferred policy outcomes. Statistical models for ideal points that use roll‐call data assume that legislators will support a proposal that moves policy closer to their ideal point than the status quo that the proposal seeks to overturn, allowing for some stochastic error. Each vote, therefore, divides legislators into two groups at a cutpoint located somewhere on the policy dimension. Legislators on one side are expected to support the proposal, and those on the other are expected to oppose it. These cutpoints, in turn, enable the estimation of legislator ideal points."
"3","Since political preferences cannot be observed directly, ideal point estimates provide useful descriptive information about legislators. In the United States, where these techniques have been used most extensively, ideal points have been used to measure polarization in Congress, estimate the dimensionality of policy space, and identify the median voter in legislative or judicial bodies (Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004a; Martin, Quinn, and Epstein 2005; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006; Poole and Rosenthal 1997). Ideal point estimates have even entered the discourse of political competition, with candidates accusing each other of being the “most liberal” or “most conservative” (in the American sense) member of the House or Senate based on simple ideal‐point‐like measures (Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004b).         "
"4","Ideal point models can be extended to characterize the evolution of political preferences. Such methods may consider the aggregate distribution of preferences, examining changes in the dimensions structuring political competition and the ideological cohesiveness of political parties (Poole and Rosenthal 1997). At the individual level, models can be used to estimate the degree to which legislator preferences shift (Martin and Quinn 2002). These estimates, in turn, can determine whether changing preference distributions at the party level are a function of evolving preferences on the part of existing party members or of replacement by new cohorts with distinct preferences. Estimating the evolution of preferences over time requires additional assumptions to link across sessions, but to the extent that those assumptions are plausible, the questions that can be addressed increase significantly.         "
"5","While ideal point estimates have many uses for descriptive purposes, they also enable the comparison of theoretical models of legislative behavior that would otherwise be difficult to evaluate empirically. Starting with the basic spatial voting models of Black (1958) and Downs (1957), a large theoretical literature has developed assuming that political preferences can be represented by ideal points. Politicians attempt to move policy toward their most preferred outcomes given the constraints imposed by the institutions within which they act. These theories have implications for the kinds of proposals that come to the floor, the roles of committees in the legislative process, the responsiveness of policy to election results, and a variety of other outcomes. Adjudicating between competing theories would be much simpler if the locations of preferences and policy outcomes could be observed.         "
"6","Since policy space cannot be observed, estimates must be recovered from observed behavior such as votes on bills or signatures on petitions. The appropriate way to evaluate these theories requires that implications from the theoretical model be incorporated into the statistical model used to estimate preferences (Clinton and Meirowitz 2003). Since most ideal point models build on simple spatial voting ideas, it is typically straightforward to elaborate them with more complicated theoretical models of legislative behavior.         "
"7","While the use of ideal point estimation is most developed in the context of American politics, those methods have been used in other settings with varying degrees of success. Ideal point estimates have been produced for the UN General Assembly (Voeten 2000), European Parliament (Hix, Noury, and Roland 2006), and national legislatures in Europe (Poole 2005; Rosenthal and Voeten 2004) and Latin America (Londregan 2000; Morgenstern 2004). In general, the usefulness of the resulting estimates depends strongly on the degree to which party affiliation structures voting behavior. In legislatures with highly cohesive parties, Poole (2005) and Rosenthal and Voeten (2004) suggest nonparametric methods such as optimal classification for ideal point estimation. These authors argue that the high degree of party discipline makes the assumption of independence between votes (conditional on preferences) implausible. While nonparametric models eliminate the need for distributional assumptions, they simultaneously weaken the link to theoretical models of legislative behavior. In cases such as the British House of Commons, even these nonparametric models do not produce plausible preference estimates (Spirling and McLean 2007).         "
"8","Recovering ideal points from divisions in the House of Commons has proved to be difficult. Both parametric random‐utility models and optimal classification approaches produce estimates that are implausible on their face.2 These models make assumptions about the behavior of legislators that are simply untenable in the House of Commons. The two most problematic features of divisions are the high levels of party cohesion and a tradition of oppositional voting (Spirling and McLean 2007).         "
"9","Parties in the House of Commons are remarkably cohesive in parliamentary divisions. In the 1997–2001 Parliament, more than 98% of Labour Party MPs voted together on 90% of divisions (including free votes). Cohesion is a function of several factors. Party discipline is strong: the vast majority of divisions are subject to party whips, and party leaders possess an array of tools to induce compliance, including the promise of advancement for those loyal to the party and the threat that the whip will be withdrawn from those who rebel. Cohesion is reinforced by the government’s control of the agenda, which enables it to keep proposals that would divide the governing party from coming to the floor. High party cohesion implies that little information can be retrieved from division data about preferences within parties. There are few questions that differentiate among members of a party, and those questions are likely to be highly unrepresentative."
"10","Oppositional voting presents a more serious problem for conventional ideal point estimates. Both parametric and nonparametric approaches assume that, with some stochastic noise, legislators who vote together have similar preferences. In a system where the duty of the opposition is to oppose, this assumption is violated. When the opposition sincerely prefers the status quo to a government proposal, this presents no fundamental problem for preference estimation. Problems arise when the opposition votes against a proposal that it would otherwise endorse (that is, a proposal that moves policy outcomes closer to the ideal points of opposition members) in order to embarrass the government. This can produce a situation in which opposition party members join with government party rebels in voting against the government."
"11","In the presence of this nonmonotonicity in voting, ideal point models produce government support scores rather than preference estimates (Spirling and McLean 2007). Typically, government members and core supporters anchor one extreme, followed by government rebels, genuine independents, opposition rebels, and finally the leaders of the opposition. In this situation, the tendency for the ends of the political spectrum to unite against the middle makes it appear that extremists from both parties have similar preferences. The resulting estimates “cannot be interpreted as ideological continua” (Spirling and McLean 2007, 86).         "
"12","Given the difficulties of estimating legislator preferences from division data, there are two approaches available to scholars interested in legislative behavior in the House of Commons. One option is to abandon the spatial voting framework entirely, focusing instead on nonspatial models that identify clusters of MPs who have similar voting histories (Spirling and Quinn 2010). The other option, pursued in this project, is to use alternative sources of data to estimate the spatial preferences of legislators.         "
"13","Early Day Motions are formal, nonbinding expressions of opinion by members of the House of Commons; they are essentially petitions signed by MPs. Any member can sponsor an EDM on any topic, from criticizing the government to congratulating local sports teams. Once introduced, other MPs can indicate their support for the policy proposed in the motion by “signing” the EDM; their names are then associated with the motion and can be seen by other legislators and the public. By convention, cabinet members, opposition leaders, and party whips rarely introduce EDMs or sign those introduced by others. Unlike bills, which survive for the duration of a Parliament, EDMs are closed to new signatures at the end of each session."
"14","The current use of Early Day Motions arose from a nineteenth‐century practice in which members of Parliament would introduce motions for consideration “at an early day”: an unspecified date in the future (House of Commons Information Office 2000). As governments consolidated their control of the legislative agenda during the late 1800s (Cox 1987), such motions were rarely debated. By the 1940s, the clerks of the House had developed a system to number the motions and record the names of supporters. Since then, the number of EDMs has grown dramatically over time, from fewer than 100 per session in the 1940s to over 1,000 per session since the mid‐1980s.         "
"15","Early Day Motions can be classified into several categories based on the nature of the proposition being advanced. Many EDMs are policy related, in that they support or oppose some action that the sitting government could take. For example, Gordon Prentice introduced an EDM early in the 1998–99 session calling on the government to implement “legally enforceable environmental rights including a right of access to common land, open country, mountain and moorland” (EDM 98/15). The “Freedom to Roam” was a totemic issue for certain parts of the Labour Party, and the EDM attracted more than 200 Labour signatures. At the same time, several Liberal Democrat MPs also signed the motion. Motions such as this one can be quite informative about the preferences of legislators.3 In legislatures where leaders exercise weaker control of the agenda, similar proposals would be subject to votes on the floor.         "
"16","On the other hand, many EDMs are proposed for primarily parochial reasons. Early Day Motions provide MPs with a way to gain attention in their constituencies by recognizing the activities of local individuals or organizations. Typical of this category were motions congratulating the Swansea City Football Club for an upset victory (EDM 98/186), recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Cheltenham Festival of Literature (EDM 98/919), or applauding the Essex County Council Library Service for its summer reading programs (EDM 98/952). While these EDMs may provide information about local concerns, they provide minimal information to locate members along the major ideological dimensions structuring political competition."
"17","A third group of motions aims to score party political points without necessarily advocating particular policies. Examples include EDMs suggesting that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had misled Parliament (EDM 98/1007) or mocking members of the opposition for their apparent lack of knowledge about the member states of the European Union (EDM 98/935). While signatures on these motions may be more a function of partisanship than of preferences per se, to the extent that these two characteristics vary together such motions provide some information about member preferences."
"18","Finally, a small subset of Early Day Motions is used by opposition party leaders to prompt debate on secondary legislation (regulations promulgated by the government). These EDMs, known as prayers, can be identified by their language and the pattern of signatures, which are typically limited to members of the opposition front bench. Since backbenchers rarely sign prayers, these motions do not help to identify member preferences."
"19","Early Day Motions have been widely used in studies of the political preferences of members of the House of Commons. Their popularity stems from the challenges presented by division data along with the relative dearth of alternatives that Franklin and Tappin (1977) describe as “unobtrusive measures of backbench opinion”: data sources that are easy to collect and do not require the participation of members themselves. Several approaches to the use of EDMs appear in the literature. Some studies use small subsets of EDMs focused on common themes as indicators of member preferences on issues such as European integration or women’s issues (Berrington and Hague 1998; Childs and Withey 2004). Other studies survey a larger set of motions in an attempt to identify blocks of MPs with common interests (Berrington 1973; Finer, Berrington, and Bartholomew 1961; Franklin and Tappin 1977). Bailey and Nason (2008) use Early Day Motions to explore changes in cohesion within each major party over shorter periods of time. Finally, a few studies attempt to construct scales of MP preferences on one or more dimensions using EDM data (Leece and Berrington 1977; Nason 2001). This article extends the final approach by developing a more appropriate statistical model of EDM signing behavior and using it to estimate the ideal points of British parliamentarians.         "
"20","Using Early Day Motions provides several advantages relative to divisions as a basis for estimating member preferences in the House of Commons. First and foremost, parties exert far less influence over signatures on EDMs than they do over divisions in the House. While the party whip organizations monitor signatures on motions, they typically do not attempt to influence their members.4 Without the influence of the whips, there is greater scope for differentiation in revealed preferences among party members. Second, since EDMs are nonbinding, there is little incentive for opposition party members to join government rebels in an “ends against the middle” attempt to embarrass or defeat the government. This type of voting is one of the principal reasons that existing methods using division data fail to recover plausible preference estimates (Spirling and McLean 2007). Instead, two motions would typically be introduced: one consistent with the policy preferences of the rebels and another consistent with the preferences of the opposition.5"
"21","Other characteristics of Early Day Motions, while not as important as the relative weakness of party influence, are still useful for preference estimation. Since any MP can sponsor an EDM, agenda control is weak to nonexistent and a wide range of policy proposals will be observed. Agenda control is potentially problematic when estimating ideal points, since it may restrict the distribution of proposals in ways that produce misleading estimates (Clinton and Meirowitz 2001). Finally, there are simply many more Early Day Motions—on the order of 10 times as many—than divisions in a given Parliament.         "
"22","While Early Day Motions have several advantages over divisions, using EDMs to estimate legislator preferences is not unproblematic. Since party leaders typically do not sign EDMs, they cannot be used to estimate frontbench preferences. While this is unfortunate, it does not present any fundamental challenge to the validity of the estimates for backbench MPs presented here. More serious challenges arise from the differences between EDMs and roll‐call votes. First, unlike roll‐call votes, EDMs do not provide legislators with any way to record opposition to the policy change proposed in the motion. Failing to sign a particular EDM could indicate either abstention or opposition. Second, unlike roll‐call votes, EDMs do not have formal implications for the policy enacted by the government. As a result, they can be viewed as a form of cheap talk or expressive gesture rather than as an expression of political preferences (McLean 1995, 126). While these problems have been addressed at length by previous authors (Berrington 1973; Finer, Berrington, and Bartholomew 1961; Franklin and Tappin 1977), they are reviewed here given their importance to the statistical model developed in the next section.         "
"23","There is little doubt that members vary in their propensity to sign Early Day Motions. Most EDMs are signed by a small number of parliamentarians, making it inappropriate to assume that all nonsignatures indicate opposition to the policy advocated in the motion. On the other hand, a few MPs are quite promiscuous in their signing behavior, lending credence to the claim that some members “will sign anything they are asked to sign” (Franklin and Tappin 1977, 54). Differences in the rate at which members sign are a function of several factors: the amount of time spent at Westminster, the density of connections to other MPs, and the personal importance that each parliamentarian assigns to EDMs. Both the distribution of signatures and the qualitative evidence on signing behavior suggest that differences in the propensity to sign must be modeled explicitly.         "
"24","Determining whether signatures on EDMs reflect underlying preferences presents a more difficult problem. A strongly consequentialist view of legislative behavior would suggest skepticism since EDMs do not directly affect policy outcomes. At the same time, there are several reasons to believe that EDM signatures (after taking differences in signing propensity into account) do reflect the revealed preferences of members. Signing or failing to sign an EDM does impose some costs. The press reports on EDMs dealing with salient political issues, and advocacy groups often organize letter‐writing campaigns urging members to sign. Moreover, Early Day Motions are one of the few ways by which MPs can differentiate themselves from their party leadership, giving them an incentive to consider carefully their decisions to sign. In the end, this issue is best addressed by evaluating the validity of the resulting estimates, in terms of the degree to which the estimates both correspond to qualitative beliefs about member preferences and predict other forms of legislative behavior. The results in the following sections suggest that the ideal point estimates perform well on both of these aspects of validity."
"25","This section develops a statistical model for Early Day Motion signatures based on the behavioral assumptions discussed above. While a formal behavioral model is not necessary to generate preference estimates, such a model does link the results more closely to theoretical models of legislative behavior. The EDM model assumes that the decision to sign an EDM is driven by three factors: the policy utility derived from the proposed EDM relative to the status quo, the cost to the MP of signing any EDM, and a stochastic component representing idiosyncratic characteristics influencing the decision to sign. This model takes a standard ideal point model based on spatial voting and elaborates it by including a cost term unique to each legislator."
"26","Operationalizing the model requires assumptions about the form of legislator utility functions and the distribution of the stochastic utility term. I follow Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004a) and Martin and Quinn (2002) in assuming quadratic policy‐utility functions and normal errors. In particular, let i= 1, … , I index legislators and j= 1, … , J index Early Day Motions. Each legislator is assumed to have an ideal point θi along the single policy dimension.6 Each Early Day Motion has a policy position implied by the motion mj and an associated status quo sj that the motion seeks to overturn. The utility of supporting motion j for legislator i is thus               "
"27","As discussed above, this simple two‐parameter model is inappropriate for Early Day Motions because it ignores the fact that while a legislator can express support by signing the EDM, there is no way to express opposition to the proposal. Applying the standard model to EDM data produces implausible preference estimates; instead, the results are strongly correlated to the number of EDMs signed. Most members of Parliament sign few Early Day Motions, but some are quite prolific. The variability in the rate at which members sign Early Day Motions is too great to be explained plausibly by the content of the motions themselves; therefore, I assume that there is a legislator‐specific cost ci associated with signing any EDM. This changes the expression for the latent utility to               "
"28","Restricting the posterior distribution in substantively interesting ways is key to obtaining useful estimates of legislator ideal points from this model. For the prior distributions on the legislator parameters θi and ci, I assume standard normal distributions (with one exception), such that θi∼N(0, 1) and ci∼N(0, 1). This implies that prior beliefs about the ideal points and signing costs for each legislator are the same. This is a conservative assumption, as it does not take advantage of our knowledge of MP policy preferences. The one exception is that the prior for the ideal point of one member of Parliament known to be extreme is restricted to one side of zero; in the case of a Labour member, the restricted prior is . This orients the policy space by placing Labour on the left.            "
"29","More informative prior distributions are used for the motion parameters mj. The nature of Early Day Motions reduces the incentive to make proposals that can gain the support of a majority of legislators. As a result, it is plausible to assume that MPs sponsor Early Day Motions that support policy outcomes close to their most‐preferred outcomes. Since the sponsor of each EDM is known, I assume a hierarchical normal prior on each motion parameter centered around the ideal point  of the member making the proposal mj:               "
"30","Finally, the model is closed out by assuming prior distributions on the status quo points sj. These are assumed to have normal priors centered at zero with variance , such that . A smaller prior variance gives more weight to centrist status quo positions. In this study, I assume that the prior variance  is 1.            "
"31","These prior distributions are informative in the sense that they place higher prior probability on some regions of the parameter space. With the exception of the truncated prior on the ideal point of one MP, however, the priors do not distinguish between members or between EDMs. The need to use informative priors comes from the fundamental lack of identification in the sampling density. While different choices for the prior variances may change the cardinal measures of legislator preferences, they typically have little influence on the more relevant ordinal measures (Jackman 2009).            "
"32","Given the assumptions of the EDM model, the posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood multiplied by the prior distributions for each block of parameters. The posterior distribution f(θ, c, m, s|Y) provides the joint probability distribution for all of the parameters of interest conditional on the observed data. This distribution does not have a standard functional form, so estimates of posterior quantities must be obtained through simulation (Gelman et al. 2004).            "
"33","To sample from the posterior distribution, I construct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that converges over time to the desired distribution. The algorithm used to estimate the model samples alternately from the conditional distributions of the legislator and bill parameters, using the slice sampling approach suggested by Neal (2003). Details of the algorithm and diagnostics for the resulting samples from the posterior are presented in the Supporting Information.            "
"34","Since the primary goal is to demonstrate that the model presented in the previous section can recover plausible estimates of the preferences of members of Parliament, the choice of data for analysis is driven by practical considerations. Nason (2001) makes available EDM signature matrices for the first three sessions of the 1997 Parliament. Since the computational difficulty of estimating the EDM model is not trivial, I use data from the 1998–99 session as it has the fewest motions (and as a consequence the fewest parameters) of the available data. This session, which lasted from 24 November 1998 to 11 November 1999, had only 149 sitting days, a small number for a session not ending in a general election. This dataset provides evidence of member preferences in the early years of the Blair government. Major issues considered in the 1998–99 session included constitutional changes (creation of the Greater London Authority and reforms to the House of Lords) and welfare and pension reform.         "
"35","Before estimating the model, some motions and legislators must be removed from the data. Prayers for the reconsideration of secondary legislation are excluded; since signatures on these motions are typically limited to party leaders (who rarely sign other motions), it is inappropriate to include these EDMs in the data. In addition, motions withdrawn by their sponsors are deleted because members may not have had equal opportunities to sign before the motion was withdrawn. Finally, motions signed only by their sponsor are eliminated, since the data provide essentially no information to nail down the locations of such proposals. This procedure eliminates some motions on politically trivial topics, but similar motions signed by multiple MPs remain in the dataset. After deleting these motions, any MP who did not sign any of the remaining EDMs is likewise removed from the dataset. All of these members would have the same posterior estimates for ideal points and signing costs, since the data provide no information with which to differentiate them.8"
"36","The final dataset includes 547 out of the 659 members who sat in the 1998–99 session of the House of Commons. As explained above, notable members not appearing in the dataset include Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chancellor Gordon Brown, and Conservative Party leader William Hague. The final dataset contains 991 motions, which received an average of 50 signatures. Among the MPs in the data, 109 members signed fewer than 10 motions. At the other extreme, Labour MP John McDonnell signed 668 EDMs, the most of any member. Liberal Democrat MPs are the most active sponsors and signers of EDMs, followed by Labour and Conservative members. Liberal Democrat members sponsored and signed EDMs at more than six times the rates of their Conservative colleagues. These behavioral differences, in turn, affect the precision with which preferences can be estimated."
"37","The model produces estimates from the joint posterior distribution of ideal points, signing costs, and motion characteristics.9 With two parameters for each MP and each EDM, there are over 3,000 parameters in the model fit to the 1998–99 data. The large number of parameters makes graphical summarization useful in characterizing the results of the model. This section presents a number of graphical summaries to highlight different aspects of the distribution of ideal points in the 1998–99 session.         "
"38","To build intuition about the results of the model, it is useful to consider estimates for a few prominent members of Parliament. Figure 1 shows the posterior distributions for the ideal points of six MPs: Ken Livingstone, Diane Abbott, Giles Radice (Labour); Martin Bell (Independent); and Virginia Bottomley and Christopher Chope (Conservative). The optimal classification estimates presented by Spirling and McLean (2007) identify Radice as the most extreme member of the Labour Party. The EDM estimates, in contrast, place Radice at the center of the political spectrum. One would expect this from a former chair of the Manifesto Group in the early 1980s, who later described the revision of Clause Four ending Labour’s commitment to public ownership as “a great moment in my political life” (Radice 2004, 333). His estimated ideal point is slightly to the left of Martin Bell, a former BBC war correspondent and the first MP elected to the House of Commons as an independent in over 40 years. The ideal point estimate for Radice is less precise than the estimate for Bell; Radice signed only six EDMs while Bell signed 58.         "
"39","                Posterior Distributions of Ideal Points for Selected MPs"
"40","Ideal point estimates generated from voting data locate Labour rebels close to independents such as Bell. In the Spirling and McLean (2007) estimates, which rank MPs in order from left to right, Abbott is the 415th most left‐wing MP, while Livingstone and Bell occupy positions 422 and 432, respectively. The EDM estimates are far more plausible, showing Livingstone at the far left and Abbott slightly, but distinctly, to his right. Ken Livingstone, affectionately known as “Red Ken,” was expelled from the Labour Party for running against Blair’s chosen candidate for mayor of London. Abbott, while less prominent at the time than Livingstone, was the first black woman to serve in Parliament and is well known as a member of the Labour left. By correctly placing these MPs to the left of the bulk of the Labour Party, the EDM model eliminates one of the key problems with preference estimates generated by other approaches.         "
"41","The increased face validity of the estimates generated by the EDM model extends to members of the opposition. The two Conservative MPs shown in Figure 1, Bottomley and Chope, come from opposite wings of the party. Bottomley is a life member of the Tory Reform Group; Chope, in contrast, is active in Conservative Way Forward.10 As expected given these affiliations, Bottomley is located closer to Labour members. Chope’s estimated ideal point is among the furthest right of all Conservative MPs. Taken together, these results suggest that the preferences of government and opposition members are being estimated on a common scale that accords with conventional understandings of the left‐right dimension in British politics.         "
"42","Having examined the ideal points for a few notable MPs, Figure 2 summarizes the preferences for all legislators in the dataset.11 Posterior mean estimates for ideal points are plotted on the horizontal axis and signing costs are on the vertical axis. In this figure, members from the three major parties resolve into three distinct clusters. Labour members fall predominantly on the left of the plot, Conservatives on the right, and Liberal Democrats in the center. There is considerable overlap, however, between Liberal Democrat MPs and the more moderate members of the Labour party. The Liberal Democrats had abandoned their policy of “equidistance” a few years earlier, and Blair and Ashdown had collaborated on efforts to promote cooperation between the two parties (Russell and Fieldhouse 2005, 39–42), so this overlap is not surprising. Figure 2 also reveals considerable heterogeneity in the implied signing costs faced by MPs within each party. As expected, Liberal Democrats have the lowest average signing costs, although the differences across parties are smaller than would be expected from the observed difference in the average number of EDMs signed.         "
"43","                Estimated Ideal Points and Signing Costs (Posterior Means) for Major Party MPs"
"44","As Figure 1 illustrates, point estimates of ideal points provide only a partial picture of legislator preferences. They provide no information about the uncertainty inherent in the estimates. Interval estimates provide an alternative summary of MP preferences, at the cost of some interpretive complexity. Figure 3 presents two alternative interval estimates for MP ideal points. The left‐hand panels display 95% central credible intervals12 for the location of each member in the dataset, ordered by their posterior means. Each party’s MPs are shown in a different panel to reveal differences across the major parties. As the figure shows, there is considerable variation in the precision with which member ideal points are estimated. Focusing on the posterior intervals for the Labour Party reveals that the interval estimates for far‐left MPs such as Livingstone or Abbott are far narrower than those for Labour moderates.         "
"45","                Interval Estimates for Member Ideal Points and Ranks (95% Central Credible Intervals), by Major Party"
"46","This pattern of precise estimates for extremists and vague estimates for moderates is unusual in ideal point estimation. It is often difficult to estimate precisely the preferences of politicians at either end of a political dimension because few votes distinguish between them. In the case of Early Day Motions, however, the lack of agenda control makes it possible to differentiate between the conventional left and the far left in the Labour Party. In contrast, it is difficult to estimate the positions of those members who choose not to sign many EDMs, unless those that they do sign are highly informative. The same would be true of an MP who signed nearly every motion, if such an MP existed. This characteristic is illustrated by comparing the estimates for moderate Labour MPs with those of Liberal Democrats. While there is considerable overlap between the two, Liberal Democrat intervals are much narrower. In general, as the estimated signing costs increase, the precision with which member ideal points are estimated decreases, but the variation in the precision of estimates increases.13"
"47","Posterior ranks, in which members are placed in order from left to right based on their estimated ideal points, provide an alternative means to summarize the preferences of members of the House of Commons. These ranks are obtained by taking each set of ideal points generated by the MCMC sampler, ordering them from left to right, and assigning each the appropriate rank number. Measuring the rank order of MP preferences rather than their location can be useful for two reasons. First, the scale on which ideal points are measured has no inherent meaning, and it is not clear that the resulting estimates contain interval‐level information. Second, many theories of legislative behavior, from the median voter theorem forward, make predictions in terms of quantiles of the distribution of preferences. While the identity of the median voter in the House of Commons cannot be estimated using Early Day Motions since not all members appear in the dataset, posterior ranks do provide some insight into the distribution of preferences. The right‐hand panels of Figure 3 show 95% central credible intervals for the in‐sample ranks of each major party MP in the dataset. Aside from the intervals for members estimated to have extreme ideal points, the rank interval estimates are quite broad, particularly within the Labour Party. The combination of relatively noisy ideal point estimates and the high density of MPs with relatively similar preferences makes it difficult to recover the ordering of the bulk of Labour members.         "
"48","A problem with all ideal point methods is the difficulty in determining whether the resulting estimates are measuring underlying preferences or some other quantity. As with any method used to estimate latent characteristics, the model proposed in this article would produce results given any signature matrix. Moreover, purely statistical criteria cannot resolve this problem. Indeed, models applied to division data within the House of Commons tend to fit the data quite well; Spirling and McLean (2007) report correct classification proportions exceeding .99 for divisions in the 1997–2001 Parliament. Instead, the resulting estimates are so inconsistent with prior beliefs about the preferences of MPs that they are rejected as lacking face validity.         "
"49","In the absence of clear statistical criteria, one must rely on other factors to assess the utility of ideal point estimates. These criteria include the plausibility of the behavioral assumptions underpinning the statistical model, the consistency of the results with qualitative knowledge about legislator preferences, and the ability of the resulting estimates to predict other forms of legislative behavior. The first two criteria have been described above. Augmenting a standard ideal point model with an individual‐specific signing cost addresses one of the key differences between voting and EDM data. The resulting estimates place the parties in the expected order and recover more plausible orderings within parties, reversing the standard outcomes in which party rebels are estimated to have moderate preferences."
"50","The remainder of this section attempts to validate the ideal point estimates generated by the EDM model, using them to predict behavior on divisions in the House of Commons. Since standard models of voting in legislatures are based on the same spatial representation of preferences used in this article, the ideal point estimates should provide more information about the way MPs vote than their party affiliation alone. To summarize voting behavior, I construct a simple measure of support for Labour in parliamentary divisions. Using data from the 1997–2001 Parliament (Firth and Spirling 2005), I first identify the outcome supported by the majority of Labour MPs voting on each division. Defining this outcome as the Labour position, I calculate the proportion of votes in which each parliamentarian supported the Labour position.         "
"51","The ideal point estimates improve predictions of Labour support scores, although this relationship is mediated by party. Labour members have extremely high Labour support scores (greater than 90%), Conservatives have low scores, and Liberal Democrats fall in the middle. Differences within each party allow for a better evaluation of the ideal point estimates generated by the EDM model. A simple model of legislative behavior would predict that support for Labour majority positions should be highest near the center of the Labour Party. This implies that the relationship between Labour support and estimated ideal points should be positive on the Labour left and negative for parties to the right of Labour. As expected, the members of the Labour Party least likely to support the majority are those located at the extreme left, including Livingstone, Abbott, Tony Benn, and Jeremy Corbyn, among others. On the other hand, Liberal Democrats closest to the Conservatives are the least likely to support Labour. Tory support for Labour positions is weakest at the right of the party, although the relationship is not as strong as for Liberal Democrats."
"52","These qualitative results are confirmed by robust linear regressions within each party caucus of Labour support on estimated ideal points.14 Ideal points are defined as the posterior mean for each MP. The results in Table 1 show that the relationship is positive and significant for Labour MPs and negative and significant for Liberal Democrats. Among Conservative MPs, the relationship is negative as expected but not statistically significant. This is likely a function of the lower precision with which Conservative preferences are measured. Overall, however, the results suggest that the ideal point estimates are in fact measuring preferences rather than government support or some other latent characteristic of parliamentarians.         "
"53","These results suggest a significant amount of ideological heterogeneity within each of the major parliamentary parties. The variation in estimated ideal points within the Labour Party is particularly notable, given that these estimates come from the second year of Tony Blair’s time as prime minister, at the height of the influence of New Labour. While party unity in divisions was high at this point in time, the extreme variation in ideal point estimates foreshadows the stark divisions within the party that would emerge in later parliaments, most notably after the start of the war in Iraq. The estimates also reveal the ideological overlap between the Liberal Democrats and the moderate wing of the Labour Party during this period. The close relationship between Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown was well publicized, but these estimates reveal that there were considerable commonalities in the preferences of backbench MPs in the two parties as well. Finally, the ideal point estimates clearly identify the ideological distinctiveness of the Conservative MPs sitting in opposition after 18 years on the government benches. The remaining Conservative caucus is far more conservative than MPs from the other two major parties, with only a few members overlapping with the most right‐wing of Labour or Liberal Democrat MPs."
"54","Estimating the preferences of British MPs has presented a long‐standing challenge. The intractability of standard methods using roll‐call votes argues for the use of alternative sources of information about legislator preferences. The approach presented in this article builds on earlier efforts to use Early Day Motions by constructing a more realistic model of the process by which members sign EDMs. Following similar efforts in other contexts, the EDM model uses a Bayesian approach to produce estimates that would be difficult to obtain using classical methods. While estimates from the EDM model come at the expense of some computational complexity, they offer the prospect of “unobtrusive measures of backbench opinion” that are far more plausible than existing alternatives."
"55","The ideal point estimates generated from EDMs signed in the 1998–99 session indicate the utility of these estimates for understanding British politics. While the main purpose of this article is to develop and validate a method of preference estimation, these observations suggest questions that could be addressed using estimates generated by the model."
"56","The model developed in this article and the results that it produces can be extended in a number of ways. First, estimates generated using this approach offer the prospect of evaluating theories of legislative behavior in the context of the British Parliament. Attempts to measure the strength of party discipline on particular votes in the House of Commons have been hampered by the inability to separate out the effects of discipline from the effects of preferences. To address this problem, one should estimate vote choice and EDM signatures simultaneously, assuming a common preference structure but allowing for discipline on divisions. By taking advantage of the fact that EDM signatures are not whipped, it would be possible to estimate the amount of disciplinary pressure incurred by each legislator."
"57","Second, the model can be elaborated to generate estimates of preferences over time. The distribution of preferences within the House of Commons or within a party caucus can change in two ways: either through the replacement of legislators with new cohorts of MPs or through the evolution of the preferences of existing members. The major parties have seen significant turnover in the past 30 years; estimating preferences over time could reveal, for example, the degree to which Labour’s move to the center in the 1990s was a function of a new generation of Labour MPs. Estimating individual‐level preference change requires additional assumptions, but could resolve the question of whether the increased rebelliousness of Labour backbenchers in the closing years of the Blair government was a function of radicalization in preferences or simply a weakening of discipline within the party. If, for example, ideal points of members on the left of the Labour Party shifted further to the left, one would expect more rebellions given a fixed level of party discipline."
"58","More broadly, the model developed in this article could be applied to obtain ideal point estimates in other cases where petition‐like data are available, provided that both the proposed policy and the existing conditions play a role in the decision to sign. As such, it adds to the growing array of models and data sources that have been used to estimate preferences. While all of these approaches have merit, there are several advantages to the use of petition‐based data. In legislatures where party discipline is strong, petitions provide more information about the preferences of individual legislators. At the same time, the choice to sign or not sign a petition is a behavior more similar to voting than, for example, the decision to cite certain experts or to use particular words in debate. As such, petition data are more analogous to the decision‐making contexts in which ideal points have been a useful way to think about the preferences of politicians."
