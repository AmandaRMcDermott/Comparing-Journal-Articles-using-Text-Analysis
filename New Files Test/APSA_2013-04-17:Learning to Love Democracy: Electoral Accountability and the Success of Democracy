"1","Consider the following electoral accountability game between a voter and two candidates (i=1, 2). At the beginning of any period , one of the two candidates is the incumbent and either behaves in office or exploits office. The latter action implies policies that benefit the incumbent at the expense of the voter, and we assume that any incumbent prefers exploiting to behaving in office. More precisely, exploiting office is costless for an incumbent, whereas behaving is costly, c>0.         "
"2","Additionally, an incumbent prefers to remain in office in the next period rather than be replaced by the challenger. I normalize the candidates’ payoffs from being in office and out of office to w>0 and 0, respectively. The candidates and the voter discount future payoffs by a discount factor , respectively. I will notationally distinguish between  and  only when discussing player‐specific discount factors.         "
"3","As I indicated earlier, two assumptions in this model reflect the distinct challenges to electoral accountability in new democracies. First, each candidate can be one of two types, . Candidate i is bad, , if he would prefer exploiting office to behaving even if a permanent removal from office (reelection) were a sure consequence of the former (latter). Thus, for a bad candidate, , or equivalently if . On the other hand, candidate i is normal, , if the threat of a certain removal from office deters him from exploiting it, . Thus, we can alternatively think of c as the benefit from exploiting office and of the bad candidate as one for whom the benefit from exploiting office in the present term is more attractive than a reelection for another term.13 But note that the normal type of a candidate is no angel: if not threatened with a removal from office, he prefers to exploit it rather than behave. Importantly, a candidate's type is his private information: the voter does not know the candidates’ types, and each candidate knows his own type but not the type of the other candidate.         "
"4","The second key assumption in this model is costly monitoring. The voter does not observe the incumbent's action directly; instead, she either ignores or monitors the incumbent's performance, and the latter entails a cost m>0.14 Only if the voter monitors the incumbent's performance, she observes a policy outcome O, which is either a policy success or failure, . The policy outcome is an informative but imperfect signal of the incumbent's action: if the incumbent behaves, the voter observes a policy success with probability  and a policy failure with probability ; if the incumbent exploits office, the corresponding probability of a success is . I assume that , so that policies may fail even if the incumbent behaves but are less likely to do so than when the incumbent exploits office and vice versa. In order to keep the formal analysis as simple as possible, I let  and assume that the voter does not discriminate between the two candidates in her decision whether to monitor the incumbent's performance.         "
"5","At the end of any period, the voter either reelects or replaces the incumbent with the challenger. The voter prefers a policy success to a failure, with the corresponding payoffs s>0 and 0.15 Since , the voter would like to motivate the normal incumbent to behave in office by conditioning reelection on a policy success. However, if the voter ignored the incumbent's performance, she must decide whether to reelect the incumbent without any information about the policy outcome.         "
"6","Before examining equilibrium outcomes in this accountability game, consider a simpler setting with only the normal candidate type. Equilibrium outcomes in this simpler setting will serve as a benchmark against which outcomes in the more complex setting with both normal and bad candidates can be compared."
"7","When only normal candidates are present, the threat of a removal from office following a policy failure will motivate them to behave as long as both the voter and the candidates are sufficiently patient. More specifically, the following strategies constitute an equilibrium: in any period, incumbents behave in office while the voter monitors incumbent performance and conditions reelection on a policy success, as long as the voter monitored and conditioned reelection on a policy success in any previous period. Otherwise, incumbents exploit office while the voter ignores policy outcomes and uses a reelection rule that is unrelated to actual policy outcomes.16"
"8","To see that these strategies constitute an equilibrium, suppose that the voter monitored incumbent performance and conditioned reelection on a policy success in any previous period and consider incumbent i's expected discounted payoff  from behaving,               "
"9","Incumbent i prefers behaving to exploiting as long as behaving yields a greater expected discounted payoff than a one‐shot deviation to exploiting,               "
"10","Now consider the voter's incentive to monitor incumbent performance and condition reelection on a policy success. When she does so and incumbents behave in office, her expected discounted payoff is               "
"11","Note that the voter's threshold discount factor  is positive, increasing in m and , decreasing in s and , and smaller than 1 as long as . Thus, the voter is willing to monitor incumbent performance and condition reelection on a policy success when she values policy successes highly, when the cost of monitoring is low, and when the policy outcome is a more informative signal of the incumbent's action.17"
"12","To summarize, we see that in this benchmark setting, the threat of a removal from office after a policy failure motivates candidates to behave in office as long as the candidates and the voter are sufficiently patient,  and , and value the office and policy successes highly enough,  and . In order to restrict attention in the remainder of the article to interesting scenarios, I assume that these conditions on patience as well as the associated lower bounds on w and s hold. Accordingly, we may say that with only the normal candidate types, electoral accountability succeeds when , , , and .18"
"13","In a subgame perfect equilibrium with only normal types, incumbents behave in office while the voter monitors and conditions reelection on a policy success, as long as , , , , and the voter monitored and conditioned reelection on a policy success in any previous period.                  "
"14","Follows directly from the text.□"
"15","Consider now whether electoral accountability succeeds once we let each candidate be either a normal or bad type, which is privately observed by each candidate. The timing of moves is as follows. At time t=0, nature determines the type of each candidate and determines (with equal probability) which candidate will be the incumbent in period one. Independently, each candidate i will be normal with probability  and bad with probability . The following stage game ensues in each subsequent period . First, the incumbent either behaves in office or exploits office. Second, nature determines whether the policy outcome is a success or failure. Third, the voter either monitors or ignores the incumbent's performance and observes the policy outcome if and only if she monitored the incumbent's performance. Finally, the voter either reelects or replaces the incumbent.            "
"16","Denote by  the voter's belief that candidate i is normal at the beginning of period  given her belief about candidate i's type and the policy outcome in the previous period, . The voter updates her belief  about incumbent i's type using Bayes’ rule;  and  are the voter's initial, possibly distinct beliefs about each candidate's type.19 If the voter monitors the policy outcome, then after observing a policy success in period t−1, the voter's belief at the beginning of period t that the incumbent is normal will increase to               "
"17","When convenient, I will denote the two candidates’ reputations by  and . The indexes k and l refer to the ordered set of the voter's possible beliefs about candidates 1 and 2 instead of time periods. Thus, for candidate 1, , and the transition from  to  corresponds to a one‐step increase in candidate 1's reputation.20"
"18","Can the voter motivate normal incumbents to behave in office by conditioning reelection on a policy success? Consider a scenario in which after a succession of policy failures the voter concludes that both candidates are most likely of the bad type. That is,  is close to zero for i=1, 2. Because monitoring policy outcomes is costly, there will be a level of  at which the voter concludes that monitoring incumbent performance is not worth its cost, since both candidates are most likely bad and will exploit office regardless of the voter's actions. Anticipating this, even normal incumbents will exploit office. Therefore, after a succession of policy failures, electoral accountability may fail even if both candidates are normal and willing to behave in office if sufficiently motivated.            "
"19","I now examine when the above dynamic depicts a perfect Bayesian equilibrium of this accountability game. Since a bad incumbent always exploits office, we only need to consider strategies for the normal type of the incumbent and the voter. When candidate 1 is the incumbent in period t and the voter's beliefs about the candidates are  and , her payoff from monitoring incumbent 1's performance and conditioning reelection on a policy success is               "
"20","Intuitively, the voter's payoff from monitoring incumbent performance and conditioning reelection on a policy success in 4 is increasing in each candidate's reputation. As the candidates’ reputations decline, the voter's expected per‐period payoff approaches , which is less than , the expected per‐period payoff that the voter would obtain if she ignored incumbent performance. Suppose candidate 1 is the incumbent in the current period.21 Then for some , there will be a threshold belief  such that if the incumbent's reputation drops to , the voter prefers to ignore incumbent performance,               "
"21","In the supplementary appendix, I show that the incumbent's threshold reputation  is weakly decreasing in the challenger's current reputation . That is, the stronger candidate 2's reputation, the worse candidate 1 must perform before the voter gives up on monitoring incumbent performance. In new democracies, one candidate's success in office is a positive externality from which all candidates benefit.            "
"22","Furthermore, the threshold reputation  may not exist when  is above some threshold . In other words, the voter will not give up on monitoring incumbent performance when candidate 1 is in office, as long as her belief that candidate 2 is normal is high enough. The voter must believe sufficiently strongly that both candidates are crooks before she gives up on monitoring incumbent performance.            "
"23","Once a candidate with a reputation below the threshold  enters office, electoral accountability fails: the voter no longer monitors incumbent performance and therefore cannot condition reelection on actual policy outcomes. To keep the analysis simple, I assume that the incumbent is reelected with the probability 1/2 if this occurs.22 Importantly, once the threshold  has been crossed, the voter's skepticism about candidate behavior is self‐fulfilling: even a normal incumbent—who would be willing to behave in office if the voter conditioned reelection on a policy success—will choose to exploit office. Accordingly, we may call this equilibrium the trap of pessimistic expectations.            "
"24","In a perfect Bayesian equilibrium,                  "
"25","(i) If , , and as long as the voter monitored and conditioned reelection on a policy success in any previous period, normal incumbents behave in office, and the voter monitors incumbent performance and conditions reelection on a policy success. Otherwise, normal incumbents exploit office and the voter ignores incumbent performance and uses a reelection rule that is unrelated to policy outcomes.                  "

"28","See the supplementary appendix.□"
"29","The above analysis implies that a sequence of policy failures may result in a complete failure of electoral accountability. Once in the trap of pessimistic expectations, voters no longer believe that their democracy can deliver better governance than a dictatorship. In turn, they no longer have a stake in defending democracy against attempts to subvert it, thus giving candidates an incentive to acquire or maintain power by nondemocratic means.23 A failure of electoral accountability may therefore precipitate the breakdown of democracy. I now examine an extension of the above accountability game that models this intuition.            "
"30","Suppose that at the beginning of any period  and before any of the existing moves, candidates simultaneously decide whether to subvert or comply with democracy. If both candidates comply, the stage game continues as previously. But if an attempt to subvert democracy occurs, the voter either acquiesces or defends democracy, the latter being associated with a cost d>0. If the voter acquiesces, the game ends in a breakdown of democracy and the voter receives the discounted payoff . If only one candidate subverts democracy, the candidate who subverts becomes a dictator and obtains the per‐period payoff w in any subsequent period, while the other candidate obtains the payoff 0. If both candidates subvert, then each becomes a dictator with the probability 1/2. On the other hand, if the voter defends democracy, any attempt to subvert democracy fails, any candidate who attempts to subvert democracy leaves the game and receives a negative discounted payoff , a new candidate enters the game in his place, and the stage game continues as previously.            "
"31","This extension implies that once a democracy enters the trap of pessimistic expectations, both the incumbent and challenger subvert democracy, the voter acquiesces, and the game ends in a breakdown of democracy. After accounting for the cost of defending democracy, the threshold  in 5 becomes               "
"32","In a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, if , , , and as long as the voter monitored and conditioned reelection on a policy success in any previous period, both candidates comply with democracy, and the voter defends democracy. Otherwise, both candidates subvert democracy and the voter acquiesces.                  "
"33","See the supplementary appendix.□"
"34","Propositions 2 and 3 imply that as long as the incumbent's reputation is above the breakdown thresholds  and , the voter monitors incumbent performance and conditions reelection on a policy success, thus motivating normal incumbents to behave in office. In the long run, however, any democracy will fall into the trap of pessimistic expectations: with a positive probability, a sequence of policy failures occurs that is sufficiently long to bring even a normal incumbent's reputation under the breakdown threshold. This happens because we fixed the identity of the two candidates who compete for office at the beginning of the game. I now relax that assumption by letting candidates enter and exit politics.            "
"35","Suppose that at the beginning of any period  and before any other moves in the game, each of two candidates decides whether to run for office or exit politics. Any candidate who exits obtains a per‐period payoff x>0 from an alternative career. New candidates are drawn at random from a candidate pool with a positive share of normal types .24 The timing of the moves in the rest of any period remains unchanged.            "
"36","This natural extension has some surprising but intuitive implications. When sufficiently attractive nonpolitical careers are available, good reputations serve as barriers to the entry of bad candidates. More specifically, once incumbent 1's reputation grows past the consolidation threshold , a bad challenger 2 will exit, and no bad challenger will run for office again. This occurs because a bad incumbent, who gets reelected less often than a normal one, sees his chances of returning to office decline as his competitor develops a reputation for being the normal type. Once the incumbent's reputation crosses the consolidation threshold, equilibrium strategies in this game will be identical to those in the benchmark game without bad types, and, crucially, electoral accountability will succeed. Consistent with our earlier analysis, however, before the consolidation threshold is crossed, the voter may conclude after repeated policy failures that both candidates are bad, and this democracy may fall into the trap of pessimistic expectations and break down.            "
"37","To examine these intuitions, consider how the incumbent's reputation affects the challenger's incentives to stay in politics. The expected discounted payoff of a challenger of either type is decreasing in the incumbent's reputation. For instance, the payoff of a bad challenger 1 is               "
"38","and the payoff of a normal challenger 1 is analogous. Intuitively, both types of challenger expect to return to office sooner if the incumbent is a bad type because the latter exploits office and is therefore less likely to get reelected. Meanwhile, the expected discounted payoff of a bad incumbent 1 is               "
"39","the payoff of a normal challenger 1 is analogous. Because a bad incumbent is less likely to get reelected, he expects to spend less time in office than a normal incumbent. Jointly, the above expressions for the incumbent's and challenger's payoffs imply that a normal challenger expects a greater discounted payoff from running than a bad challenger as the incumbent's reputation approaches 1. When candidate 2 is the challenger, we have               "
"40","Inequality 7 indicates that once the incumbent's reputation  is sufficiently strong, there will be a range of discounted exit payoffs , for which a bad challenger prefers to exit but a normal challenger prefers to run. A bad challenger 2 will exit if . On the other hand, a normal challenger 2 will run even as the incumbent's reputation  approaches 1 as long as . Suppose therefore that  and denote the highest value of incumbent 1's reputation at which bad challenger 2 prefers running to exiting by ,               "
"41","This equilibrium dynamic implies that once incumbent 1's reputation grows past , electoral accountability succeeds: the voter correctly interprets any policy failure as the result of bad luck rather than a bad incumbent's policy choice. Consequently, this democracy can no longer enter the trap of pessimistic expectations and break down. Accordingly, we may call the sets of beliefs  and  the consolidation thresholds, the time  the consolidation time, and any state past period  a consolidated democracy. By contrast, the set of states in which candidate reputations are at or between the breakdown and consolidation thresholds may be called a transitional democracy.            "

"46","See the supplementary appendix.□"
"47","According to Propositions 2–4, the voter's beliefs about the type of candidates that she is facing—and ultimately about whether democracy can deliver accountability—evolve endogenously. In any period, the incumbent's type and equilibrium strategy determine the most likely policy outcome, which in turn shapes the voter's belief about the incumbent's type. Eventually, however, this process results in one of two outcomes: the breakdown or the consolidation of democracy. I now illustrate this dynamic with simulations of the equilibrium behavior predicted by this model."
"48","Suppose that s=1, m=0.1, w=1, c=0.1, d=0.5, x=0.35, , , and . In Figure 2, I plot the breakdown thresholds  and  and the consolidation thresholds  and . The thin dotted lines plot the (incomplete) set of candidate reputations, while circles and squares connected by thick solid and dashed lines plot the breakdown and consolidation thresholds when candidate 1 or 2 is the incumbent, respectively. As stated by Proposition 2, the breakdown threshold when candidate 1 is the incumbent  is weakly decreasing in the challenger's reputation  and may not bind if the challenger's reputation is sufficiently strong.            "
"49","We see that democracies in which initial beliefs about candidates are so pessimistic that they lie below both breakdown thresholds will start in the trap of pessimistic expectations and are doomed to break down. Meanwhile, those democracies in which initial beliefs are so optimistic that they lie above one of the consolidation thresholds will consolidate immediately."
"50","For most real‐world cases, however, an empirically plausible set of initial beliefs is neither so pessimistic as to result in an immediate breakdown of democracy nor so optimistic as to lead to an immediate consolidation of democracy—these are transitional democracies. For instance, if the voter's initial beliefs about the two candidates are , then it takes at least three consecutive policy successes for a democracy to consolidate. Meanwhile, it takes at least five consecutive policy failures for a democracy to fall into the trap of pessimistic expectations and then break down. Note that any candidate's three consecutive policy successes will be sufficient for consolidation, but it takes more than two failures by each candidate before a democracy breaks down. That is, a single successful candidate can bring about the consolidation of democracy, but with sufficiently optimistic initial beliefs, it will take several failures by each candidate before a democracy breaks down. The equilibrium behavior in this accountability game thus implies a particular distribution of time to democratic consolidation and breakdowns. I examine this and related empirical predictions in the next section.            "
"51","The model developed in the previous section has a number of implications for the empirical study of democratic survival, public support for democracy, and the “quality” of politicians in new democracies. First, the statistical distribution of the timing of democratic breakdowns and consolidation follows directly from the long‐run equilibrium behavior in this model. Theoretically informed knowledge of these distributions offers guidance in the choice of appropriate statistical techniques for the analysis of data on democratic survival. Second, the model's long‐run equilibrium behavior leads to an intuitive prediction about the relationship between economic downturns, the age of democracy, and the likelihood of democratic breakdowns: the adverse effect of economic downturns on democratic breakdowns should be conditional on the age of democracy. I find preliminary support for this proposition when I estimate a change‐point model of democratic survival in the supplementary appendix. Finally, the model offers theoretical microfoundations for the empirical association between public attitudes toward democracy, economic development, and the survival of democracy, and it predicts a previously underexplored empirical association between economic opportunities, the history of democracy, and the composition of the political class in new democracies."
"52","As the numerical illustration in the previous section suggests, the voter's and incumbents’ equilibrium strategies imply a particular long‐run distribution of democratic consolidation and breakdowns. The equilibrium path of this game can be statistically represented by a discrete time‐absorbing Markov chain where any belief vector that lies above the breakdown but below the consolidation thresholds constitutes a transient state, whereas transitions to belief vectors immediately below or above these thresholds constitute transitions to the absorbing states of breakdown and consolidation, respectively. While a democracy is transitional, only transitions to neighboring states occur with a positive probability. These probabilities depend on the type of incumbent in office and are thus either  and  or  and . Since the two absorbing states can be reached in one or more steps from any transient state, a democracy will eventually either consolidate or break down. After 100,000 simulations that draw a normal type with the probability , 32% of democracies eventually break down, 68% consolidate, and the median times to breakdown and consolidation are 9 and 13, respectively.26 Crucially, in about 10% of the simulations, a democracy descends into the trap of pessimistic expectations even though at least one of the candidates was a normal type.         "
"53","This long‐run equilibrium behavior has two key implications for the statistical analysis of data on democratic survival. First, breakdown and consolidation are competing risks. As time progresses, transitional democracies either consolidate or break down and the fraction of transitional democracies among surviving democracies decreases. Figure 3 illustrates this dynamic. Crucially, given the limitations of large‐N data, studies of democratic survival typically do not distinguish between consolidated and transitional democracies. In turn, surviving democracies are a mixture of transitional and consolidated democracies, where the latter survive arbitrarily long. Proper inference for such data must therefore account for the possibility that, as time progresses, a fraction of surviving democracies will no longer be at risk of a breakdown.27"
"54","The long‐run equilibrium behavior in the present model also suggests a particular shape of the hazard rate of democratic breakdowns. Recall that in the empirically plausible case when any democracy starts as a transitional democracy, it takes k>0 more policy failures than successes before a democracy falls into the trap of pessimistic expectations and breaks down. Thus, the hazard rate of democratic breakdowns will be zero during the first k−1 periods. Thereafter, the hazard rate will be a mixture of hazard rates corresponding to the two incumbents’ types. Because of the discrete nature of transition to the absorbing state of breakdown, the hazard rate may fluctuate sharply between neighboring time periods. However, it will be decreasing over a sufficiently large interval and converge to zero as all transitional democracies either consolidate or break down.28 Hence the equilibrium behavior in our model suggests that statistical models for the analysis of democratic survival should allow for a hazard rate that is sufficiently flexible to describe a quick increase followed by a gradual decrease in the hazard rate of democratic breakdowns.29 This dynamic is illustrated in Figure 4, which plots the hazard rate of democratic breakdowns after policy failures.         "
"55","The long‐run equilibrium behavior in the present model also predicts a previously unexamined relationship between economic downturns, the age of democracy, and the likelihood of democratic breakdowns. As Figure 4 illustrates, the probability that a surviving democracy breaks down after a policy failure converges to zero as a democracy grows older. If we adopt economic downturns as an indicator of policy failures, then the present model implies that the effect of an economic downturn on the probability of a democracy's breakdown will be conditional on its age: this effect should be positive and statistically significant early on in the life of a democracy but vanishing over time.30 That is, the likelihoods of a democratic breakdown during economic downturns and expansions should be statistically indistinguishable from each other after some point in time. In Figure 4, the solid line that plots the four‐period moving average of a surviving democracy's probability of breakdown can be viewed as a continuous‐time approximation of the hazard of democratic breakdowns following policy failures implied by our model. We see that as a democracy ages, this hazard becomes indistinguishable from zero under an arbitrarily strict significance level.         "
"56","As an initial step toward evaluating this proposition, I estimate an extension of the standard Cox survival model according to which the effect of economic growth on the hazard rate of democratic breakdowns may change at an unknown point in time. I employ data on democratic survival that cover the period 1841–2007 and are based on the regime‐type data compiled by Przeworski et al. (2000), Boix (2003), Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland (2010), and my own coding. Consistent with our theoretical analysis, the results of this estimation suggest that economic downturns indeed raise the risk of breakdowns for young democracies, but that this effect becomes statistically insignificant once a democracy survives for about two decades. One advantage of this approach is that it does not make any assumptions about when the hypothesized change in the effect of economic growth on breakdowns occurs or whether it occurs at all—both are estimated. The results of this estimation are presented in the supplementary appendix.         "
"57","The theoretical analysis in this article additionally suggests theoretical microfoundations for two empirical associations that have been extensively studied in the research on democratic transitions. First, a large literature studies the effect of public attitudes toward democracy on the survival of new democracies (see, e.g., Booth and Seligson 2009; Canache 2002; Norris 1999; Rose, Mishler, and Munro 2006). Consistent with this research, the mechanism that explains the failure of electoral accountability in the trap of pessimistic expectations implies that voters should be more dissatisfied with individual politicians or institutions during economic downturns (cf. Córdova and Seligson 2009.) Yet the present analysis also suggests that it is only in transitional democracies where such dissatisfaction should translate into disillusionment with democracy as a political system. By contrast, voters in consolidated democracies should correctly interpret poor government performance as the result of the uncertainty inherent in policymaking rather than the capture of electoral politics by a self‐serving political class.         "
"58","Second, our analysis implies that poor democracies will either take longer to consolidate or not consolidate at all. This prediction is consistent with a large body of empirical research that finds that high levels of economic development correlate with the survival of democracy (see, e.g., Boix and Stokes 2003; Lipset 1959; Przeworski et al. 2000). The present article suggests a theoretical microfoundation for this correlation: in poor democracies, where politics may be “the most profitable game in town,” electoral competition may be flooded by candidates whose primary interest lies not in a long‐lived political career but in the immediate, self‐serving gain from holding a political office. In these circumstances, elections may fail as an instrument of accountability because career‐oriented politicians will have a hard time developing reputations that would otherwise deter undesirable candidate types from competing for office.         "
"59","This logic anticipates a previously underexplored empirical association between economic development and the quality of politicians in new democracies: as nonpolitical career opportunities improve with economic development, the political class in new democracies should be increasingly populated by career politicians (political activists, party members) instead of opportunistic entrants (celebrities, businesspeople). The existing empirical literature on the selection of politicians has studied mostly established democracies (Besley 2005; Mattozzi and Merlo 2011) or focused on the role of formal institutions, especially electoral systems (Birch 2003; Cox 1997). As in Gehlbach, Sonin, and Zhuravskaya (2010), the arguments here suggest that political selection may be central to the success of democratic consolidation and clarify how outside career opportunities and informal factors—like the stock of existing political reputations—shape the qualities of candidates who enter and exit from politics in new democracies.         "
"60","Why would voters who only a few years earlier supported their country's struggle for democracy react with resignation when an incumbent seeks to subvert it? Consider Russia, where observers frequently attribute widespread indifference to Vladimir Putin's gradual return to authoritarianism to ordinary Russians’ disenchantment with democracy under Boris Yeltsin.31 Russia's GDP per capita declined by almost 40% between 1990 and 1999, from $2,602 to $1,614. Concurrently, ordinary Russians’ support for democracy waned.32 According to one survey, the proportion of Russians who would not mind if their parliament were closed down and parties abolished rose from 35 to 51% between 1990 and 2001.33 Thus, the hardship and insecurity of Russia's posttransition experience appear to have indeed contributed to ordinary Russians’ acquiescence to authoritarianism.         "
"61","This article clarifies why a new democracy's posttransition performance critically shapes mass attitudes toward not only individual politicians but also democracy as a political system. The burden on elections as an instrument of political accountability is much greater in new than established democracies. After a transition to democracy, the door to politics is wide open: politicians have yet to form reputations, a condition that facilitates the entry into politics of not only career politicians but also those who see this period as their “one‐time opportunity to get rich.” The success of electoral accountability therefore critically depends on voters’ evolving perceptions about whether electoral competition can in fact discourage undesirable types of politicians from staying in politics. By examining the interdependence between those perceptions, voters’ incentives to critically evaluate government performance and politicians’ incentives to perform well in office, this article generates several insights into the challenges to the consolidation of new democracies."
"62","First, a new democracy's performance immediately after its transition to democracy exerts disproportionate influence over its future political trajectory. Early policy successes create a cushion that helps a new democracy weather poor performance in the future, thus facilitating its consolidation. By contrast, after repeated policy failures, voters may conclude that “all politicians are crooks” and “democracy does not work.” Crucially, such pessimistic expectations are more than just everyday frustration with democratic politics. When espoused by a sizeable fraction of the electorate, these expectations are self‐perpetuating and represent an existential danger for a new democracy. They dampen the public's willingness to defend democracy against attempts to subvert it, thus eliminating a key check on politicians or groups with authoritarian ambitions."
"63","Second, and as implied by the above logic, the descent into the trap of pessimistic expectations may undermine democratic stability even if formal democratic institutions remain intact. Thus, when they occur, transgressions against key procedural or institutional tenets of democracy should be seen as the symptoms of an impending democratic breakdown, not its underlying causes. An incumbent who curbs rights and fixes elections amidst widespread ambivalence about democracy does so because he anticipates quiescent resignation instead of vocal opposition. The descent into the trap of pessimistic expectations thus represents a distinctive, intrinsic vulnerability of electoral accountability in new democracies.         "
"64","Third, this article suggests that the principal difference between new and established democracies is not in their formal institutions. Here, a key developmental deficiency of new democracies is the absence of an intangible, historically contingent asset—established political reputations. When lacking, reputations cannot serve as barriers to the entry of low‐quality candidates, allowing for the actual or perceived capture of democratic politics by self‐serving politicians."
"65","New democracies should therefore benefit from the strengthening of those institutional mechanisms that compensate for the absence of established reputations and facilitate their formation. For instance, elections that occur in multiple stages and levels—typically in federal systems—allow for the formation of reputations even amidst public skepticism about the character of politicians (Myerson 2006); the separation of powers and term limits may prevent a total or permanent capture of democratic institutions by a single politician or group; and assistance to new democracies that empowers the civil society and independent media may help voters to evaluate candidates’ performance with lesser effort and greater precision. Meanwhile, political parties, subnational elections, and primaries have the potential to limit the entry of low‐quality candidates into politics by acting as institutional gatekeepers. However, in the period after a transition to democracy, such institutions are frequently underdeveloped and may be captured by the very types of candidates whose entry they are supposed to restrain (Grzymała‐Busse 2007). More critically, even in a favorable institutional setting reputations take time to form. The arguments in this article thus clarify not only the potential but also the limits to the contribution of constitutional design to democratic consolidation.         "
