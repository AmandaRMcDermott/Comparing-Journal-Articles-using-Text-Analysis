"1","Democracies do not legally bind individual politicians or political parties to their policy promises (Manin, Przeworski, and Stokes 1999). Thus, parties aiming to win the power to control policy through elections face the problem of making credible their policy appeals to pivotal voters. Doing so is challenging for parties with strong ideological or organizational links to core voters or groups whose interests diverge from those of the pivotal voters. In the absence of exogenous enforcement, politicians who care about policy, for intrinsic or instrumental reasons, face a time‐inconsistency problem (Alesina 1988). To win elections, they want to commit to promises that, if elected, they have incentives to break. This may make them unelectable in the eyes of pivotal voters. In this article, I argue that the commitment problem affects party competition over redistribution in important ways. When and how do parties achieve endogenous commitment to policies preferred by pivotal voters? With what consequences for elections and redistribution? Do electoral systems influence parties' responses to the commitment problem? These questions are central to debates in the literature on inequality and redistribution in democracies as well as the theoretical and empirical literature on party competition. Despite significant advances, discussed below, existing research does not fully answer these questions. I begin to address this shortcoming by proposing a new model of endogenous commitment and by providing evidence on key observable implications of the model.         "
"2","The problem of credible commitment in policymaking occupies a central place in modern political economy research. For instance, institutional reforms that introduce veto players as constraints on absolute rulers have been linked to good economic performance (North and Weingast 1989; Stasavage 2002). Scholars also argue that elites facing redistributive demands under the threat of revolution are limited in their ability to make credible policy concession but that the introduction of democracy can serve as a commitment device (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). Accounting for the absence of external enforcement of campaign promises in democracies, the innovative theory of Iversen and Soskice (2006) demonstrates that lack of commitment in partisan conflict over redistribution can have profound consequences and explain why some democracies redistribute more than others. This is one of the enduring puzzles in the literature, as simple economic explanations fail to explain the large variation in redistributive policies across advanced industrialized democracies (e.g., Alesina and Glaeser 2004; Lupu and Pontusson 2011; Milanovic 2000; Persson and Tabellini 2003). The model of Iversen and Soskice (2006) compares the outcome of party competition over redistribution between majoritarian and proportional electoral systems when parties are unable to make binding promises. It considers a political economy with three groups (i.e., low‐income, middle‐income, and high‐income). Institutionally, proportional representation (PR) is characterized by coalition government between representative parties, and the majoritarian system is characterized by competition between two leadership parties. In this setting, the middle‐income group is pivotal. The resulting implications are clear‐cut. If the left party wins the election in majoritarian systems, it may renege on its promised moderate policy and instead impose a policy of high taxes and little benefits for everybody but the poor. Right parties may also renege, but this only means low taxes and no benefits. As a consequence, middle‐class voters in majoritarian systems tend to strategically support right parties, leading to relatively low levels of redistribution. This stands in contrast to PR, where coalition government between a left and centrist party provides a credible mechanism due to mutual veto power that protects the middle class from being soaked. Therefore, elections tend to produce center‐left coalitions, resulting in more redistribution. Thus, the model can explain the striking twin observation that governments are more left‐leaning and redistribution is more pronounced under proportional than under majoritarian electoral institutions (Iversen and Soskice 2006; also see Döring and Manow 2015; Funk and Gathmann 2013; Persson and Tabellini 2003).1"
"3","Given the high stakes of the redistribution game, it is puzzling, however, that parties competing under majoritarian rules systematically fail to solve the commitment problem in equilibrium. Left parties in particular, which otherwise have to endure significant policy losses, have clear incentives to devise a credible commitment mechanism. If successful, endogenous commitment may substantively change the redistributive game. To capture the centripetal incentives of electoral competition, Iversen and Soskice (2006) assume that parties in majoritarian systems are leadership parties. As their analysis reveals, however, this is not sufficient to achieve commitment. This article builds on Iversen and Soskice (2006) and extends further the idea that parties have incentives to achieve endogenous commitment. The main theoretical intuition is that under some conditions, parties will make costly investments to credibly appeal to pivotal middle‐class voters. More specifically, parties can achieve endogenous commitment if they not only choose the party leader but also select candidates for the legislature, as is the case in nearly all developed democracies (Ranney 1981). In line with a delegation view of parliamentary democracy, a party's elected candidates become parliamentarians who influence the selection of cabinet ministers with control over the legislative agenda and thus shape policy (Kam et al. 2010; Strøm 2000). By selecting a sufficient number of candidates from their moderate wing, parties can therefore credibly tie their hands, at least probabilistically, in post‐electoral policymaking. For the left, endogenous commitment can be good politics because centrist policy outcomes entail more redistribution to the poor than the policies pursued by a right government. Selecting moderates is costly, however, so whether candidate‐based commitment is worthwhile depends on the behavior of competitors and features of the political economy. I develop a stylized game‐theoretical model to clarify the logic of the argument and derive several novel observable implications, some of which are later confronted with data. The model considers a majoritarian electoral system with multiple districts and parties that decide which type of candidate to select in each district. The analysis shows that parties' strategic decision whether to commit to a centrist redistributive platform is endogenous to political competition and varies with income inequality and the cost of recruiting moderates.         "
"4","Endogenous commitment implies that left parties in majoritarian electoral systems need not suffer from an observable electoral bias. Rather, the existence of an electoral disadvantage is conditional on context. In that sense, a main result of Iversen and Soskice (2006, Proposition 1) is a special case. Comparing redistribution in the majoritarian setting with PR also unbundles the anti‐left bias of majoritarian systems discussed in the literature. It reveals that differences in redistribution and government partisanship can occur (a) because left parties are less likely to win election under majoritarian than PR electoral rules (as in Iversen and Soskice 2006) or (b) because left parties are credibly more centrist in majoritarian systems (endogenous commitment). Existing empirical studies do not distinguish these mechanisms (Döring and Manow 2015; Funk and Gathmann 2013; Iversen and Soskice 2006).         "
"5","Another novel implication is that rising top inequality may cause left parties to move to the right in majoritarian but not in PR systems. This does not follow from conventional pivotal voter or partisan theories of redistribution. This counterintuitive prediction for majoritarian systems is driven by the left's response to the commitment problem. In particular, as the rich become richer relative to everyone else, middle‐income voters will be more willing to support the left—but only if the left's commitment to protect their interests is sufficiently credible. As higher top incomes imply more gains from redistribution for the poor, the left has more incentive to make costly investments in moderate candidates. Because coalition government serves as a commitment device under PR, the electoral incentives are different.2 By the same logic, left parties should select different candidates under different electoral rules. The analysis also highlights that candidate selection in nonmarginal districts matters in majoritarian settings. Parties may make costly investments in candidates beyond marginal districts, in contrast to existing theories (Galasso and Nannicini 2011).         "
"6","In the empirical part of the article, I provide evidence on several implications of the model. A time‐series cross‐section analysis covering 16 affluent democracies between 1950 and 2010 finds that there is an institution‐varying impact of income inequality on the position of the mainstream left party. Consistent with the model, left parties in majoritarian systems move to the right in response to rising inequality, whereas left parties in PR do not. This result also contributes to the large empirical literature on the determinants of party positions, especially recent work on the consequences of income inequality (Barth, Finseraas, and Moene 2015; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006; Pontusson and Rueda 2010; Tavits and Potter 2015). The few existing studies do not consider the conditioning influence of electoral institutions and examine a smaller number of elections. I also discuss the findings of a complementary analysis focusing on institutional variation in Great Britain that provides some initial evidence on the candidate selection mechanism.         "
"7","The political economy literature spells out the importance of credibility in political competition, but it has paid relatively little attention to what makes policy promises by political parties credible. Most theoretical accounts either simply assume that parties' policy promises are binding or that policy promises are not binding and parties can take no action to endogenously increase their credibility (Persson and Tabellini 2000, chap. 3–5). One may argue that parties easily achieve commitment merely based on reelection incentives. Modeling party competition as an infinitely repeated game demonstrates that there can be an equilibrium with endogeneous commitment to the median voter's ideal point by policy‐motivated parties purely based on reputation. But the seminal analysis of Alesina (1988) also shows that the existence of this type of equilibrium depends on many factors, such as voters and politicians having long time horizons and using particular punishment strategies, that need not be present.3 The perfect commitment implied by the long‐run view is also difficult to reconcile with evidence on partisan effects (Lee, Moretti, and Butler 2004) and cross‐national variation in government partisanship (Iversen and Soskice 2006). Thus, scholars have started to analyze additional commitment mechanisms.         "
"8","Candidate selection is a commitment device available to parties even when time horizons are limited. This is illustrated clearly by the British Labour Party. The creation of “new” Labour was to a significant degree about solving the commitment problem that lies at the heart of the article, and candidate selection was an important part of the solution. After four successive electoral defeats to the Conservative Party between 1979 and 1992, commitment to middle‐class‐friendly tax policy was perceived as a real problem by the party. Surveys and focus groups indicated that pivotal groups of voters did not trust the moderation of the parties' redistributive program. In this context, reforming the candidate selection process to reduce the influence of labor unions was a deliberate strategy to back up the moderation of the redistributive platform with more moderate candidates and thus an important step on the way to “new” Labour and three successive electoral victories (Russell 2005).         "
"9","Why would parliamentary candidates serve as a credible commitment device? While party leaders in parliamentary democracies are sometimes depicted as being all‐powerful relative to the party's legislators, a delegation perspective on parliamentary government clarifies the relevance of candidates as prospective parliamentarians for commitment (Strøm 2000). Importantly, the focus on candidates in the chain of delegation from voters to policy makers is consistent with recent evidence of the strong influence of backbenchers' collective preferences on the selection of cabinet‐level positions in Westminster systems (Kam et al. 2010).4 Furthermore, a systematic analysis of leadership changes in 49 parliamentary democracies also shows that parties “regularly remove their own prime ministers between elections” (Samuels and Shugart 2010, 94). In short, the literature provides solid empirical foundations for the candidate‐based commitment mechanism. To be clear, this is not to say that leaders are not important. As government leaders, for instance, they usually have control over the legislative agenda (Döring 1995). But this has to be placed in the context of the larger chain of delegation within parties. The theoretical model elaborated below captures and elucidates the importance of candidate selection as an endogenous commitment device.5"
"10","In this section, I propose a stylized model to analyze when and with what consequences parties competing under majoritarian electoral rules make costly investments in moderate parliamentary candidates to achieve endogenous commitment. Building on Iversen and Soskice (2006), the model considers a political economy with three economic groups: low‐income (L), middle‐income (M), and high‐income (H), of equal size (unity) and indexed by J (also see Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Persson and Tabellini 2000). Each group cares about its disposable income, and political conflict is over the choice of a possibly group‐specific tax rate and transfer payment.6"
"11","J's indirect utility function is , where  is the exogenous gross income and  is the net government transfer received by J. Each group has a maximum taxable capacity  that is less than its exogenous income, capturing incentive effects of taxation. Hence, the net transfer to a group is constrained below: . Taxable capacity increases in exogenous income, , where the taxable capacity of the low‐income group is normalized to zero. The total revenue available for redistribution is . The budget is balanced, . The final assumption is that net transfers are nonregressive, . The policy setup is more general than the more common assumption of a linear income tax and a general lump sum payment. Given these assumptions, the most preferred transfer policies for group J, denoted by the vector , are as follows:               "
"12","Redistributive policy is determined in a multimember legislature by politicians elected under plurality rule (first‐past‐the‐post) in single‐member districts. Politicians are policy motivated. They care about the well‐being of a particular group. Corresponding to the three types of voters, there are three types of politicians (i.e., ). Two political parties compete by selecting a candidate for each district. Policy promises made before the election are not binding. But as we will see, the degree of credible commitment to the policy preferred by the pivotal middle‐income voter is endogenous to candidate selection. After the election, the agenda setter is selected from the majority party's legislators and makes a proposal that becomes policy only if it is supported by a majority of all legislators. This setting can be interpreted as a Westminster‐style parliamentary democracy, which is characterized by majoritarian electoral rules and a fusion of executive‐legislative relations.            "
"13","Suppose there are two dominant parties  that have a chance of winning the election, a center‐left party, , and a center‐right party, . This assumption captures Duverger's Law, according to which majoritarian electoral rules lead to the emergence of a two‐party system (Cox 1997; Duverger 1954).  consists of a majority faction of L politicians and a minority faction of M politicians.  consists of a majority faction of H politicians and a minority faction of M politicians. The key departure from Iversen and Soskice (2006) is that there are multiple districts and parties select candidates for each district. Specifically, consider three heterogeneous districts (e.g., see Persson and Tabellini 2000, chap. 8). In the marginal district, middle‐income voters M are pivotal. There also is a district where L and H voters, respectively, are in the majority. I will refer to the latter as safe districts for  and  because their candidate wins for sure.            "
"14","In terms of party organization, the model captures that candidate selection in established democracies, with the notable exception of open primaries in several U.S. states, usually takes place within political parties and parliamentary candidates need to be supported by a majority of members in national or local party bodies. While parties' internal rules on candidate selection vary, the party leadership typically does not have the formal power to unilaterally select candidates (Ranney 1981). Thus, the model assumes that the majority faction in the party selects the candidates: The L‐majority select candidates in party , and the H‐majority select candidates in party .7"
"15","The pool of candidates contains politicians with different exogenously given reputations, mirroring the two factions of each party: candidates who have a reputation of being a moderate type (M) and candidates who have a reputation of being a type representing the party's core constituency (L in party LM and H in party MH). The reputation of candidates is an informative but imperfect predictor of their true type. For a given reputation, in other words, there remains uncertainty about a candidate's true type. This informational structure captures that imperfect information about prospective policy makers' preferences is an important problem that parties face when selecting candidates (Samuels and Shugart 2010, 63; Strøm 2000). As a consequence, commitment based on candidate selection is probabilistic rather than deterministic.8 Formally, the informational value of a candidate's reputation is denoted by . Thus, π is the probability that a candidate with a reputation of being an M‐type actually is an M‐type. With the smaller complementary probability of , the candidate's true type deviates from her reputation but corresponds to her party's core constituency (L in LM, H in HM). Conversely, given the reputation of being an L‐type (H‐type), π is the probability that the reputation is correct, and  is the probability that the candidate actually is an M‐type.            "
"16","For simplicity, assume that in the electoral stage, the majority faction in each party chooses between full moderation (), which entails nominating a candidate with the reputation of being an M‐type in both the marginal and the party's safe district, and partial moderation (), which entails nominating a candidate with the reputation of being an M‐type in the marginal but not her safe district. Partial moderation is consistent with the majoritarian model of Iversen and Soskice (2006). As parties may use mixed strategies, let  denote the probability that party P chooses full moderation. Full moderation entails an exogenous commitment cost  for the majority faction. This is a reduced form to capture motivations other than policy outcomes. A natural interpretation is that each type of party member is also ideologically committed to a particular policy (Roemer 1999). Full moderation means diluting the party's traditional ideology. Thus, members do not like to select moderates unless they are moderates themselves.9"
"17","After parties' candidates have been chosen and revealed to the public, an election is held and voters decide which candidate to support in their district. The middle‐income group M in the marginal district decides which party wins a majority of seats. The simple post‐electoral bargaining protocol captures that the majority party controls the legislative agenda, and there are no exogenous restrictions on legislative voting. The agenda setter, which one can think of as the chief executive or responsible cabinet minister, is selected by majority voting among the elected members of the majority party.10 A range of factors go into this vote, but it is assumed that the probability that a moderate will emerge victorious is proportional to the share of moderates among the party's legislators (which is equivalent to assuming that the setter is randomly drawn from the pool of party legislators). The agenda setter makes a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it policy proposal. The policy passes if supported by a majority; otherwise there is no redistribution.11"
"18","To summarize, the sequence of events is as follows:               "
"19","The equilibrium concept is subgame‐perfect Nash equilibrium. As usual, equilibria where individuals use weakly dominated strategies are excluded."
"20","As illustrated by Figure 1, equilibrium outcomes of partisan competition over redistribution vary by top income inequality and parties' cost of commitment. A formal statement and proof are in online Appendix S1 (Proposition 1). First, suppose the difference in taxable income between middle‐income and high‐income citizens is relatively small or the cost of commitment is sufficiently high for both parties (region I in Figure 1). This means that either middle‐income voters prefer party  even when party  makes more efforts to moderate (because commitment is only probabilistic and the structure of inequality makes the perils of left government more pronounced) or 's cost of commitment is simply too high. As a consequence, neither party has an incentive to pursue a costly commitment strategy. Hence,  suffers from an observable electoral disadvantage, and the policy outcome entails little redistribution to the poor in expectation. Second, a different political equilibrium emerges if the income differences between the middle and the top are sufficiently large and there are asymmetric costs with sufficiently low cost only for  (region II in Figure 1). In this scenario,  makes a greater effort to commit by recruiting more moderates (including some safe districts) than  and, as a consequence, has better electoral prospects. Redistribution is higher than in the previous case without costly commitment. The center‐left party does not suffer from an electoral disadvantage, as it has credibly moved to the center while its competitor has not. Thus, there is a positional but not an electoral anti‐left bias of partisan competition. Third, consider the scenario where income differences between the middle‐ and high‐income groups are sufficiently large and costs are sufficiently low for both parties (region III in Figure 1). In this situation, the equilibrium is in mixed strategies where both parties choose a moderate candidate selection strategy with positive probability (but strictly less than one). Electoral outcomes are uncertain ex ante, and there is no generic electoral disadvantage for . Expected redistribution is higher than in the case without costly commitment but lower than in the case with asymmetric commitment only by the left.         "
"21","Equilibria in the Majoritiarian Model"
"22","Note: The figure shows how parties' electoral strategies vary by top income inequality, captured by the ratio of taxable incomes of the top income group relative to the middle‐income group and holding the denominator constant, and the commitment cost of recruiting moderate candidates. The probability that the center‐left LM (center‐right MH) party pursues a costly strategy of full moderation is denoted by  ().                     "
"23","The model has several novel implications. First, endogenous commitment implies that center‐left parties need not suffer from an observable electoral disadvantage in majoritarian electoral systems. Several prominent theories in the literature maintain that majoritarian institutions entail an electoral bias against the left. This means that even if there is a balanced distribution of voter preferences, the electoral system induces electoral outcomes that favor the right. As discussed before, the model of Iversen and Soskice (2006, Proposition 1) implies that, given the absence of commitment, strategic voting by the middle class favors the right: On average, center‐left parties lose elections to their center‐right rivals.12 Iversen and Soskice (2006, 170) point out that their analysis suggests that parties may have incentives to find a commitment device. My model captures and further explores that intuition. It shows that endogenous commitment using parliamentary candidates implies that center‐left parties can escape their electoral dilemma. Furthermore, the existence of an electoral disadvantage in equilibrium is conditional on context. When income inequality between the middle and the top is sufficiently high and parties' commitment costs are sufficiently low, center‐left parties will have incentives to pursue a strategy of endogenous commitment. As a consequence, they tend to be electorally competitive. When income inequality between the middle and the top is low or parties' cost are sufficiently high, costly commitment is not an equilibrium strategy and center‐left parties will systematically lose elections. This logic can account for why center‐left parties in majoritarian systems may exhibit relatively long spells of electoral success as well as long spells in opposition, which does not follow straightforwardly from the theories discussed above or Downsian models of party competition that assume commitment and imply (near) convergence.            "
"24","Second, an increase in the taxable income of the rich relative to the middle class increases the probability that the center‐left party in majoritarian systems moves toward the center.13 The moderation effect seems counterintuitive, as partisan and Downsian models assuming commitment suggest the opposite. The standard partisan approach (Hibbs 1977) suggests that left parties will respond to rising inequality by moving toward the left, reemphasizing egalitarian policies favored by their core constituencies. If middle‐class voters would benefit from higher taxes on the rich, then canonical models of party competition that assume commitment also suggest that all parties should respond to higher top inequality by moving to the left, without necessarily converging to the same position (Calvert 1985). Given the commitment problem, however, the rightward move follows rationally from the center‐left's incentives to achieve endogenous commitment. An increase in the distance of middle to top incomes increases the willingness of the middle‐income group to support the center‐left party. But this is conditional on the party's ability to appease middle‐class fears of being soaked at the expense of the poor. With higher inequality between the rich and the middle class, the redistributive gains of a commitment strategy increase for the left, and so it will be more willing to select candidates with a moderate reputation. Note that if top inequality increases because the high‐income group becomes richer relative to everybody else, as depicted in Figure 1, then the left's moderation can occur despite a rise in the tax base for redistribution (different from Barth, Finseraas, and Moene 2015).            "
"25","Third, what parties do in nonmarginal districts matters for the outcome in marginal or swing districts. Indeed, parties may have incentives to nominate moderates even in safe districts to achieve more commitment in marginal districts. This does not follow from standard political economy models of majoritarian systems in general (Persson and Tabellini 2000) or models of costly candidate selection by parties in particular, where parties tend to concentrate high‐cost candidates in marginal districts (Galasso and Nannicini 2011).            "
"26","The outcome of redistributive conflict under majoritarian institutions analyzed so far can also be compared to PR. A clear benchmark is provided by the PR model in Iversen and Soskice (2006), which is based on the same general assumptions about preferences and policy. Key features of PR in their model are that there are group‐based parties and, as no party can expect to win a majority, policy is determined through a process of coalition bargaining between parties. Crucially, coalition government implies that left parties in government are subjected to a veto by a coalition partner. This makes center‐left coalition governments attractive to middle‐income voters. Coalition government, put simply, results in endogenous commitment due to mutual vetoes (Stasavage 2002; Tsebelis 2002). Comparing redistributive politics across the majoritarian and the PR system, the analysis concurs with that of Iversen and Soskice (2006) in that government partisanship is a key mechanism through which electoral rules affect economic policy. There tends to be an anti‐left bias in majoritarian compared to proportional electoral rules that leads to lower redistribution (for a formal statement, see Proposition 2 in Appendix S2). Extending their framework to allow for endogenous commitment highlights that the anti‐left bias may take two distinct forms and is conditional on features of the political economy. The anti‐left bias has a positional as well as an electoral component. Observed differences in government partisanship and redistribution across electoral rules can arise because left parties competing under majoritarian rules are (a) less electorally successful compared to the left parties competing under PR (the mechanism emphasized by Iversen and Soskice 2006) or (b) are credibly more centrist (the endogenous commitment mechanism). Studies using center‐of‐gravity measures of government partisanship have documented a robust difference in partisanship across electoral rules (Döring and Manow 2015; Iversen and Soskice 2006; also see Funk and Gathmann 2013). Interpreting this observed difference as the effect of electoral bias most likely overstates the electoral component, as it does not account for endogenous commitment, which entails a positional bias but not necessarily an electoral bias.            "
"27","The comparison also implies that there should be observable differences in candidate selection across electoral rules. Holding other things equal, left parties have more incentives to nominate moderate candidates in majoritarian than in proportional electoral systems, where coalition government provides endogenous commitment. By the same logic, the effect of income inequality on the position of the center‐left party, discussed above for the majoritarian setting, should vary by electoral system. While an increase in inequality between top incomes and middle incomes increases the incentives for the left to moderate under majoritarianism, this is not the case under PR."
"28","An intertemporal issue ignored until now is that current redistribution influences the future distribution of pre‐fisc income and thereby also shapes future conflict over redistribution. To explore how such dynamic considerations shape endogenous commitment, I have analyzed a dynamic version of the static model, in the spirit of models like that of Besley and Coate (1998; see Appendix S2 in our supporting information). There are two electoral periods. After the first period, there is a shock to the distribution of incomes that depends on the size of the redistributive budget in the first period. The economic assumption is that higher income redistribution in the first period leads to lower income growth and a more compressed pre‐fisc income distribution in the second period. Reassuringly, the results from the static model still go through in this repeated elections framework. But accounting for dynamics generates additional insights.         "
"29","The commitment problem does not go away even if policy makers in the first period put a large weight on second‐period utility and anticipate how current redistributive policy affects future income distribution and voting behavior. Consider the scenario where the center‐left party LM wins the election in the first period and there is a majority of L‐types in the legislature. While policy makers are forward‐looking and understand the economic and political cost of redistribution, an L‐majority will generally choose more redistribution to the low‐income group than preferred by the pivotal middle‐income voter M (Proposition 3 in S2 in the supporting information). Intuitively, first‐period policy in the dynamic framework can be more moderate than in the static model if policy makers put a high weight on the second period. Politicians understand that high redistribution in the first period can undermine economic efficiency and political support among the middle class in the second period. In response, the L‐majority will choose to moderate current redistribution if it cares sufficiently about the future—though not enough to eliminate the commitment problem. The reason is that M voters cannot credibly threaten to punish all deviations from their most preferred policy.         "
"30","Dynamic considerations can actually increase the commitment problem faced by LM because forward‐looking middle‐income voters now have an additional motivation to fear a left government: not just the current loss imposed by redistribution to the poor, but also the reduction in future income as a consequence of high redistribution. As a consequence, they can be more reluctant to support the LM party in the dynamic compared to the static setting. Appendix S2 describes such an equilibrium (Proposition 4). The severity of the commitment problem is indicated by the relative income threshold below which middle‐class voters have a dominant strategy to vote for the center‐right party (MH). In this equilibrium of the dynamic game, the endogenous threshold is to the right of the threshold of the static game, , depicted in Figure 1.         "
"31","The empirical section confronts novel implications of the theoretical model with evidence. The main focus is on how within‐country changes in top income inequality affect party positions and whether this relationship depends on electoral rules. The basic statistical specification is as follows:            "
"32","The analysis covers 16 advanced industrial parliamentary democracies between 1946 and 2010 for which the inequality data are available: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In line with the theory as well as the study of Pontusson and Rueda (2010), the focus is on the position of the main left party.14"
"33","The dependent variable is measured using new estimates of the publicly stated economic left‐right position based on party manifestos from Elff (2013), where larger values indicate a more rightist (i.e., less supportive of redistribution and state intervention) position. The positions were estimated by Elff (2013) using data coded by the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP; see Budge et al. 2001) for a large set of countries since World War II. As has been extensively described elsewhere (Budge et al. 2001), CMP has manually coded each quasi‐sentence in a given electoral program into one of 56 policy categories. The left‐right summary indicator provided by CMP, which is based on the relative frequency of sentences in left versus right policy categories, has been widely used in the literature on party positions and partisan effects on policy. Its time coverage is unique, and it correlates fairly highly with alternative measures (e.g., expert judgments) available for a subset of country‐years. The measure developed by Elff (2013) deals with important limitations of the CMP index. His scaling procedure, which is related to the estimation of ideal points in legislatures, disentangles policy positions from the relative frequency or salience of an issue. It also relaxes the assumption that all coding categories are a priori determined to be either left or right. The variable does not attempt to measure whether a party's stated position is perceived to be credible by voters. However, it allows researchers to examine whether left parties make more or less leftist appeals in response to changing inequality.            "
"34","To measure income inequality, I draw on the World Top Incomes Database painstakingly put together by economists using income tax records over the last decade (Atkinson and Piketty 2007, 2010; for an overview and thorough discussion of methodological issues, see Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez 2011). The database covers a much larger period than usual survey‐based measures, and it contains a measure that is close to the theoretical model. The model emphasizes a particular facet of inequality, namely, how much better the rich are doing compared to the middle classes. What matters for the electoral incentives of left parties is shaped to an important degree by the dynamics at the top of the income distribution. For this purpose, the database is especially well suited. Survey‐based measures, by comparison, usually have problems capturing the top of the distribution due to top‐coding and relatively small sample sizes. The inverted Pareto coefficient characterizing top incomes is the main measure of income inequality. The Pareto law is usually considered to be a good approximation of the upper part (say top 10%) of the observed income distribution. Reflecting the theoretical logic, an increase in the coefficient indicates higher top shares and generally higher income inequality. For instance, if the coefficient is 2, the average income of individuals with income above a threshold, say $100,000, is twice the threshold value (Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez 2011). In the data set, it varies from 1.3 to 2.9.15 The data are fairly homogenous within countries, and researchers contributing to the database have made great efforts to harmonize them across countries as well. Including country fixed effects in the estimation absorbs possibly remaining country‐specific variation in the measure. The variable has been rescaled as deviations from the overall mean to allow for an easier interpretation of the interactive specification.            "
"35","Thanks to a cumulative research effort, classifying electoral rules has become a largely uncontroversial affair. Following Iversen and Soskice (2006), for each election the electoral system for the legislature (lower house under bicameralism) is coded as PR or majoritarian (missing years were updated; see online Appendix S3 for details). As is well documented in the literature, most of the variation in electoral rules is cross‐sectional.            "
"36","The literature discusses several other factors that may affect income inequality, electoral rules, and party positions. Country fixed effects account for potentially unobservable time‐invariant country heterogeneity. For example, historical legacies, varieties of capitalist institutions, or cultural differences may drive trends in economic inequality and party positions. The literature on the choice of electoral rules debates whether they are endogenous to redistributive politics (e.g., Boix 1999; Cusack, Iversen, and Soskice 2007). To account for unobserved time effects, the analysis includes a linear time trend; some specifications also include period effects (1950–72, 1973–89, 1990–2010) or country‐specific trends. The analysis also includes time‐varying control variables whose omission may bias the results. Income per capita captures differences in the capacity to redistribute and, according to some (Wagner's Law), preferences for public spending. Voter turnout is often linked to the mobilization capacity of left parties (Pontusson and Rueda 2010). Population size is included because size has been argued to impede the organization of working‐class interests (Alesina and Glaeser 2004). A prevalent view is that economic globalization, which covaries with income inequality, increases demand for public spending; at the same time, it is held to constrain policy choices and thus party positions (Ward, Ezrow, and Dorussen 2011). The measure used here is trade openness as a percentage of GDP. The percentage of population over 65 is a common proxy for the demand for social insurance. All time‐varying right‐hand‐side variables except electoral rules are measured as the average for the years from the last to the current election.            "
"37","Figure 2 provides a descriptive overview of the relationship between top income inequality and party positions by electoral system (Appendix S3 in the supporting information provides a plot for each country). Observations are deviations from their country‐specific means. The pattern is plain to see: In majoritarian electoral systems, there is a clear positive relationship between top inequality and the left‐right position of the main left party. In PR systems, there is no discernible relationship.            "
"38","The regression results from the basic specification are summarized in Table 1.16 They confirm the graphical analysis. While all models include country fixed effects, additional control variables are added sequentially. Throughout, the effects of the main variables of theoretical interest, income inequality and its interaction with PR, are fairly precisely estimated and have the predicted sign. The positive coefficient on the inequality variable indicates that an increase in top income inequality is associated with a rightward move of the main left party in majoritarian systems. The magnitude of the negative coefficient on the interaction term indicates that the impact of inequality is practically reversed in PR systems. These estimates are consistent with the theoretical expectations and are not easily accounted for by existing theories. Adding control variables and time effects does not change the results very much. The results are politically relevant. Model 4, which includes time‐varying controls as well as country‐specific time trends, suggests that a one standard deviation increase in top income inequality causes left parties in majoritarian settings to move to the right by about one standard deviation. The sum of the coefficients on inequality and the interaction term suggests that the marginal effect of inequality is negative (about −0.6) under PR, though not significant at conventional levels (). What is clear is that, on average, left parties competing under PR do not move to the right in response to rising top inequality, whereas left parties in majoritarian systems do.            "
"39","The results are robust to various alternative specifications (see Appendix S3 in the supporting information). This includes using alternative measures of all three main theoretical concepts: top income inequality, electoral systems, and party positions. The sensitivity analysis also adds additional control variables sometimes used in related studies of party positions (i.e., union density, European Union integration, incumbency, existence of a left competitor) and a lagged dependent variable. I also control for the centralization of candidate selection. Using data on the Gini coefficient of market inequality available from 1960 onward, I rule out that the effect of top inequality is driven by changes in other parts of the income distribution."
"40","One remaining concern is that top income inequality is endogenous to redistributive politics in a way that is not captured by the fixed effects, controls, and time trends. Given the observational nature of the data, it is impossible to completely rule out time‐varying country‐specific confounders. To address this possibility, an additional analysis exploits plausibly exogenous variation in top income inequality based on the evolution of top inequality in the United States. The idea is that the increase in top income inequality is driven in large part by a dramatic increase in executive pay, and this occurred first in the United States (Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez 2011). This rise was not driven by politics in the smaller economies outside the United States. Through explicit compensation benchmarking and partially integrated markets for top managers (DiPrete, Eirich, and Pittinsky 2010), the dramatic rise in executive compensation in the United States led to exogenous competitive wage pressures on executive pay in other developed countries. The instrumental variables approach confirms the results from the basic panel analysis that under majoritarian rules, increased top inequality leads left parties to move to the right (S3, Table 8).17"
"41","Altogether, the results provide robust evidence consistent with central implications of the theory and run counter to conventional views of partisan conflict over redistribution. The results also qualify the previous finding that higher inequality generally induces left parties to move to the right (Barth, Finseraas, and Moene 2015). Accounts emphasizing the ability of rich elites to influence voting and party behavior through the media and political donations (Hacker and Pierson 2010) also do not explain the institution‐varying effect of income inequality.18"
"42","Note that the empirical analysis does not aim to address whether or not candidate selection is the commitment mechanism driving these results or whether some other commitment mechanism is doing the work. The central finding is that left parties in majoritarian systems behave in a manner consistent with the endogenous investment in a commitment device but at odds with standard explanations. Building on the literature about the role of parties in the chain of delegation in representative democracies, the theoretical model highlights that candidate selection can offer such a device. More data are needed to distinguish between different commitment mechanisms."
"43","An additional empirical analysis, reported in detail in Appendix S4 in the supporting information, due to space constraints, provides some initial evidence that parties select parliamentary candidates consistent with the commitment mechanisms of the theoretical model. The analysis exploits within‐country variation in electoral rules created by political decentralization in Great Britain between 1997 and 1999 to test the implication that the main left party's incentives to select moderate candidates are larger under pure majoritarian rules (in place for the national parliament in Westminster) than the mixed‐member proportional electoral rules (in place for the new subnational Scottish Parliament). The research design allows us to compare candidate selection in the same constituency under alternative electoral institutions, and it uses smaller parties as a control group for the party (Labour) that, according to the theoretical model, should be most sensitive to alternative institutions. It thus accounts for unobserved district heterogeneity and changes in the median voter at large across elections. The main finding is that Labour significantly increased its share of left‐wing candidates compared to its smaller competitors when competition moved to PR."
"44","This article has provided a new theoretical perspective and brought new evidence to bear on how partisan conflict over redistribution plays out in contemporary democracies under alternative rules of the electoral game. Political parties competing for the power to set redistributive policy face the problem of making credible their policy promises to voters because electoral promises are not legally binding. Using a game‐theoretic model, I have developed the argument that in majoritarian electoral systems, parties' efforts to solve the commitment problem are a driving force in redistributive politics and that candidate selection is an important—though mostly neglected in the literature—commitment device. The main theoretical innovation is to consider how parties' ability to invest in endogenous commitment influences electoral strategies, election outcomes, and policy. This has led to several new testable implications, for example, concerning the institution‐varying responsiveness of parties to rising income inequality. The empirical analysis has found evidence consistent with key implications of the theoretical logic. Left parties in majoritarian electoral systems turn to the right, thereby moving closer to the center of the political space, as top inequality increases. Under PR, they more or less stay where they are."
"45","In future research, additional implications of the theory merit testing. One further empirical task, for example, is to try to unbundle the difference in government partisanship observed across electoral institutions into its positional and electoral components. Broadening the analysis of commitment beyond reputation also matters for the literature on the determinants of party policy positions and opens up questions about the underpinnings of credible positions."
