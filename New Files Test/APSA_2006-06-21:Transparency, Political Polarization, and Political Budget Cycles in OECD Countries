"1","Greater transparency is a way to create what Powell and Whitten (1993) called “clarity of responsibility.” It eases the task of attributing outcomes to the acts of particular politicians. Naturally, incumbents want credit for delivering things valued by voters. Equally, incumbents want to dodge blame for things disliked by voters. Transparency may increase the visibility of an action which has both liked and disliked consequences. Even so, transparency also makes observers more able to distinguish effort from opportunistic behavior or stochastic factors “primarily by providing actors with greater or lesser degrees of certainty about the present and future behavior of other actors” (Hall and Taylor 1996, 939).         "
"2","Fiscal transparency allows voters, interest groups, and competing political parties to observe—or infer with better precision—causes and consequences of a government's fiscal policy, either directly or through the media.3 The ability of observers, and ultimately voters, to separate politicians' opportunistic policy choices from ones with other motivations (whether social welfare or random) depends crucially on the nature of voters' decision‐making process and the information available to them. The early generation of political business cycle models featured economic agents with adaptive expectations. Later work established the possibility of such cycles in a rational expectations framework. More recently still, attempts to explain the appearance of political business cycles have been based on models of imperfect information in a rational expectations framework (Brender and Drazen 2005; Lohmann 1998; Persson and Tabellini 2000, 2003b; Rogoff 1990; and Shi and Svensson 2002a).         "
"3","Recent empirical work on electoral cycles employs data from many countries, including both developed and developing countries, over as many as 40 years. Clark and Hallerberg (2000), mentioned above, and Clark (2003) show that electoral fiscal cycles exist in OECD countries with fixed exchange rates. Both Persson and Tabellini and Shi and Svensson find electoral cycles in fiscal policy instruments, conditioning, respectively, on constitutional regime and degree of democracy. Shi and Svensson proxy the public's ability to monitor politicians by media access, measured by radio ownership multiplied by freedom of broadcasting, and find that cycles are more prominent where incumbents are more able to hide fiscal policy from the public. In contrast, Brender and Drazen (2005) argue that the apparent presence of electoral cycles stems from the inclusion of new democracies in the sample.         "
"4","But new democracies are overrepresented among countries with weak media, and indeed (in the case of Persson and Tabellini), presidential systems. Budget process transparency could foster either increased ability to discern manipulation (and connect it with elections) that Brender and Drazen say voters learn with experience or the increased information flow that Shi and Svensson say comes from freer and more accessible media.4 We do not model media effects on communication separately from the effects of transparency on information flow, so we disentangle these correlated effects below, empirically.5"
"5","Our full model is published elsewhere (Alt and Lassen 2006). For the sake of cumulation, we present just enough here to clarify the differences between our model and its predecessors (Persson and Tabellini and Shi and Svensson), and the consequences for analysis. In all cases, incumbents produce public goods primarily financed by tax revenue.6 Incumbents can incur deficits, which increase current public goods provision for a given tax revenue (and, hence, a given level of private consumption), but are costly in terms of foregone future consumption. Increasing incumbent ability increases public goods provision. Crucially, according to the “career‐concerns” specification used in these models, incumbent ability is unknown to both voters and politicians at the time public sector decisions are taken.         "
"6","In the models of both Persson and Tabellini and Shi and Svensson, politicians seek reelection to enjoy office rents, and voters are concerned only with the competence of politicians. Voters want politicians in office who, everything else equal, have more ability in providing public goods. However, voters cannot necessarily observe either incumbent ability or the current debt level. They thus face a signal extraction problem, since they cannot separate the effects of ability and deficits on the provision of public goods. Politicians realize this and therefore find it optimal to incur deficits to appear more competent in the eyes of voters, even though they do not know their own competence."
"7","The role of transparency in these models is intuitive. Our budget process transparency measure contains items reflecting the amount, relevance, accessibility, and comprehensibility of timely information that becomes available to voters. We model transparency as the probability that voters observe the true level of deficits before the election. If that probability is one (complete transparency), voters can in principle deduce incumbent ability from the public budget constraint, and decide on reelection voting with full information. The greater the level of transparency, the less incumbent politicians gain in terms of expected votes by electioneering. Since running deficits is costly, the more budget practices are transparent, the smaller is the equilibrium level of pre‐election deficits incurred by the incumbent.7Figure 1 stylizes the expected time path of the budget surplus in high‐ and low‐transparency regimes.         "
"8","                 A Hypothetical Example of Political Budget Cycles                      "
"9","We also generalize the model by explicitly considering a trade‐off voters face between policy positions and competence.8 Now, voters differ in their desired policies and politicians seek election to implement their preferred policies as well as to gain rents. We assume parties differ with respect to a dimension of economic conflict, often treated as reflecting public ownership, redistribution, or public spending (Huber and Inglehart 1995). In our model of two parties or blocs, one (“Left”) prefers a larger scale of public good production than the other.         "
"10","The inclusion of partisan differences in the model opens up another channel of influence on electoral cycles. Suppose “political polarization” is simply the distance or absolute difference between platforms of the parties. For convenience, we define that distance in a way that leaves the median voter's assessment of party platforms unchanged, to focus the model on a pure polarization effect. A party seeing its opponent implement the opponent's favored policy experiences a welfare loss. As polarization increases it becomes more desirable for each party to stay in office, since the utility loss felt by voters and politicians alike from seeing the opponent in office increases. The farther away the opponent's platform, the greater is the utility loss from losing office, and the greater the debt the incumbent is willing to risk in order to be reelected.9"
"11","Put another way, since the loss from seeing the opponent party's platform implemented increases with the distance between it and the incumbent's own platform where polarization is higher, being in office is more valuable to the incumbent. This means that, other things equal, the incumbent is willing to run a higher deficit, at higher costs, to convince the voters that she is competent. Therefore, in equilibrium politicians of both parties are willing to incur more debt to remain in office, other things equal. Thus, for both parties equilibrium debt accumulation increases as the degree of political polarization increases, and since the debt is incurred by assumption before elections, this leads to a bigger electoral cycle in deficits."
"12","This analysis assumes that governments have “left” and “right” centers of gravity. With two parties there is no ambiguity. Some believe that our model of competition between two parties or blocs is not a good description of a system where competition often takes place among different coalitions of parties, which could matter for the dynamics of the electoral cycles. Key elements of the model are whether an incumbent can increase reelection chances by appearing competent and get the credit for appearing competent. The first should be true in coalitions and the second possibly diluted but still true. Is the logic of disliking the other “side” appropriate? Ex ante the incumbent's choice is based on an expectation of its successor's platform. When there are more than two parties, polarization reflects the distance to an average of possible successors. Confidence about the likely alternative is increased by frequent pre‐election pacts (Golder 2004) but within a multiparty governing coalition, partners would not necessarily share the same expected distances. Also, this effect will diminish but not necessarily disappear for governments close to the “center.” Can parties bargain ex post to form a coalition? If yes, should polarization only include parties that could be in government? Probably—we deal with this problem in the empirical analysis below.10"
"13","While fiscal transparency has been a key issue in fiscal policy debates for more than a decade, a comprehensive measure does not exist and attempts at definition have only recently been proposed. Our empirical work is based on a new replicable index of the transparency of the fiscal policy process, developed in Alt and Lassen (2006). The index aggregates responses to a detailed survey focused on formal requirements and procedures related to fiscal policy. It thus improves significantly on earlier proxies of fiscal, or budget, transparency.11 A good comprehensive definition is in Kopits and Craig, who write that         "
"14","                        "
"15","Fiscal transparency is defined … as openness toward the public at large about government structure and functions, fiscal policy intentions, public sector accounts, and projections. It involves ready access to reliable, comprehensive, timely, understandable, and internationally comparable information on government activities … so that the electorate and financial markets can accurately assess the government's financial position and the true costs and benefits of government activities, including their present and future economic and social implications.12 (1998, 1)               "
"16","The literature also provides specific examples of transparent budget reporting procedures:"
"17","                        "
"18","“A transparent budget process is one that provides clear information on all aspects of government fiscal policy. Budgets that include numerous special accounts and that fail to consolidate all fiscal activity into a single ‘bottom line’ measure are not transparent. Budgets that are easily available to the public and to participants in the policymaking process, and that do present consolidated information, are transparent.” (Poterba and von Hagen 1999, 3–4)               "
"19"," Alt and Lassen (2006) construct a transparency index based on four distinct categories that all feature in the definitions and examples above. First, independent verification—for example, independently audited in‐year financial reports—increases both the accuracy and persuasiveness of information. Second, more transparent procedures should ease access and monitoring by processing more information, and, other things equal, do so in fewer documents or places. In that way, supplementary budgets make it more difficult to discern total amounts. Third, there should be a commitment to nonarbitrary language such that words and classifications have clear, shared, unequivocal meanings. The use of accrual accounting better ties expenditures and receipts together temporally. Finally, the presence of more justification of decisions solidifies the basis for decision making.         "
"20","The index comprises 11 items, 10 of which are taken from a 1999 OECD questionnaire sent to all Budget Directors of OECD member countries (OECD 1999). Nine of these 10 variables are a part of OECD's Best Practises for Budget Transparency (OECD 2001). The original survey contained 76 items, many of which had nothing to do with transparency. Some questions were repetitive, and on others there was no cross‐country variation. This left some 15 possible variables, of which 10 were ultimately included. All results are robust to the precise composition of the transparency index and the inclusion or exclusion of individual items. To the 10 were added a measure of whether financial statements are prepared using accrual accounting. The list of 11 items, with their question numbers in the original survey as appropriate, is in the appendix.         "
"21","We aggregate the 11 items additively into an index, whose values range from a minimum of zero (Japan) to a maximum of 11 (New Zealand). Individual country scores are in Alt and Lassen (2006), Figure 1. The virtue of the survey data used to construct the index is that it focuses directly on transparency and is comprehensive, covering the entire spectrum of issues related to transparency. A potential drawback of the data is that it focuses on formal rules and procedures that may differ from actual practice. However, for most of the survey questions an accompanying question asked whether actual practices differed, which they did not in any case. Overall, the index is well in accord with the qualitative literature on budget procedures, including von Hagen's (1992) subjective assessment of transparency in eight European countries.13 The transparency variable has mean 4.2 and standard deviation 2.5.         "
"22","Our main measure of party system polarization comes from an expert survey (Laver and Hunt 1992). Country specialists were asked to assign scores on a 20‐point scale representing the parties' priorities between raising taxes to increase public services and cutting public services to cut taxes.14 Our variable is the standard deviation of party‐by‐party mean raw scores on this rating for each country.15 The index ranges from 2.2 (New Zealand) to 6.6 (United States), with a mean of 4.7 and a standard deviation of 1.1. We note that there is no statistical association at all between polarization and transparency.         "
"23","To facilitate comparison with the literature referred to above, we use the data set from Persson and Tabellini (2003a, 2003b), to which we add further variables as noted. The key dependent variable is the central government fiscal surplus (and, also below, revenues and expenditures themselves) as a percentage of GDP, based on data from the International Financial Statistics database from the IMF. The average surplus for the period under consideration was −2.94 (that is, a deficit of just under 3% of GDP) with a standard deviation of 3.5.         "
"24","The main explanatory variables, which appear in all the estimates reported below, are again based on the Persson‐Tabellini data set, selected so as to facilitate comparison with the other studies. The key independent variables are binary election variables. We code PREELEX, the “(pre‐)election year,” as equal to one in the year of an election for the executive and zero otherwise, while POSTELEX, the “post‐election year,” is one in the year following an executive election and zero otherwise. Since the conjecture about the electoral cycle in fiscal balance is that deficits relatively expand before and contract after elections, the specification includes both pre‐ and post‐election effects. Our sample comprises 19 OECD countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.         "
"25","We start by replicating the Persson‐Tabellini specification. To aid those replicating our work, we include these background results in Appendix A1, column 1. To this we add the stock of outstanding government debt, lagged one year (column 2). The rationale for this is that higher debt raises the interest costs on new debt, other things equal, and thus increases spending and pressure on fiscal balance (see Blais, Blake, and Dion 1996; Lowry and Alt 2001 and sources cited therein). The specification allows pre‐ and post‐election effects on public finance outcomes to vary across constitutional regimes (majoritarian versus proportional and presidential versus parliamentary), controlling for other factors. It also includes a lagged dependent variable (which is also interacted with indicators for presidential and majoritarian regimes), indicators for the calendar year in which an election occurred and the subsequent year. The other control variables include real income (GDP) per capita, in natural logs, share of population aged 15 to 64, and share above age 64, trade openness (exports plus imports as a share of GDP), and the output gap, a measure of country‐idiosyncratic shocks constructed as the deviation from the real GDP country trend, computed using the Hodrick‐Prescott filter.16"
"26","How do electoral cycles in deficits differ between high‐ and low‐transparency and more and less polarized countries? For clarity, we take the two key variables one at a time. Since the transparency index covers only the 1990s, we consider the period 1989–98 for the countries for which the index is available. For some countries not all years have complete data, resulting in a sample varying from 127 to 139 observations. We distinguish two cases. In one specification we consider a binary transparency index, achieved by splitting the sample into roughly equal groups of higher and lower transparency countries. This has the virtue of making results more robust to inclusion or exclusion of particular items of the transparency index and might also reduce measurement error from a judgment survey. In the other, we interact the election‐year indicator variables with the continuous transparency index. For polarization, we employ both dichotomous17 and continuous measures in the same way.         "
"27","Summary statistics are as follows. Table 1 presents the decomposition of average surplus by transparency regime and polarization, in election as opposed to nonelection years. For example, the average fiscal balance in all nonelection years was a deficit of just under 2.9% of GDP. By contrast, in election years, low‐transparency countries on average had a deficit of 3.3% of GDP. The simple decomposition in Table 1(A) shows that deficits were slightly larger in election years than nonelection years, and that high‐transparency countries had slightly higher deficits. However, we also see that while the deficits across election and nonelection years are more or less the same for high‐transparency countries, they differ more markedly for low‐transparency countries, with deficits in election years being larger, if not significantly so, than in nonelection years.18 It is also immediate from Table 1(B) that higher polarization is associated with higher average deficits in election years, but lower deficits in nonelection years. To evaluate the size and significance of these differences in a multivariate setting, we turn to econometric analysis.         "
"28","The basic specification allows the effects of lagged endogenous variables (persistence), economic shocks (SHOCK), and electoral cycles (as election year and post‐election year effects) to differ between high and low regimes for transparency and polarization. Formally, to encompass these effects, we partition countries with variables H and L into two groups: Hi= 1 for high‐transparency (or polarization) countries and zero otherwise and vice versa for Li. Then we write the model as            "
"29","Ideally, the results do not depend qualitatively on whether the electoral cycle is interacted with transparency or polarization in continuous or collapsed form. To show this, we specify a second case with the continuous index. In the case of transparency, this is like the specification above apart from how the interaction and the election year variables are included:             "
"30","We still face a number of estimation issues. First, when the time dimension T is small, the standard fixed‐effects estimator is biased in the presence of a lagged endogenous variable, which should be included in this case as fiscal balance is persistent over time. Therefore, we estimate the Arellano and Bond (1991) dynamic panel data model using first‐differences that Judson and Owen (1999), based on Monte Carlo studies, recommend for macroeconomic models with small time samples.21 Note that since the estimation is in first differences, all fixed effects are differenced out and do not enter into the calculation of conditional effects. We estimate the robust GMM model in Stata 8 and present the results. We also estimate but do not present the corresponding fixed‐effects results and comment on differences between methods in the text.         "
"31","Second, following Persson and Tabellini (2003a), a few observations display very large output shocks (more than 5% of GDP). Such extraordinary circumstances could possibly affect the “normal‐period” estimates that we are seeking. Indeed, deleting these few extreme observations (typically no more than four in our sample) has some impact on results. Hence, for each pair of specifications we report results for two samples: an all‐inclusive sample and a sample omitting observations with output shocks in excess of 5% of GDP.         "
"32","Finally, we consider two different definitions of the electoral year. Suppose that incumbent governments manipulate public finances in order to increase the chances of reelection. Whether we can observe the evidence for such manipulation in public budget accounts is likely to depend on when the election was held. Persson and Tabellini define the election year as the calendar year in which the election was held and the subsequent calendar year as the post‐election year. We refer to this as calendar election year. In a second set of results we redefine the adjusted election year as follows. If the election took place within the first quarter of a given year, the election year is the calendar year before the election actually took place, and, thus, the post‐election year equals the actual calendar election year; other cases are not adjusted. For example, suppose an election took place in February 1995. In one set of our specifications (and all of Persson and Tabellini 2003b), the election year is 1995 and 1996 is the post‐election year. In our alternative, “adjusted” definition, in this case, 1994 is the “election year” and 1995 the “post‐election year.” This is still clumsy, so we attempt a partial replication below with quarterly data, but the finer data is not available for all countries or variables.         "
"33","Therefore, we present the results of eight specifications that vary the transparency or polarization indicator (binary‐continuous) by the sample (inclusive‐omit largest shocks), and by electoral‐year definition. We back these up with a full replication using fixed‐effects regression. We also replicate all results using the data obtained from Brender and Drazen (2005) as an alternative. As specification checks, we compute Hansen's J‐statistic for the test for overidentifying restrictions, an extension of the Sargan‐test statistic to include a robust error structure. We test for second‐order serial correlation in the error terms which, if present, would render the estimator inconsistent. We report only the serial correlation test in tables, as the former, possibly due to the large number of degrees of freedom, always indicates valid instruments (no overidentification). In fact, the empirical analysis, as can be seen from the tables, never rejects the hypothesis of no second order serial correlation in the errors.         "
"34","If we do not condition the election year effects on transparency regime (see Table [A]1, column 1), we find that the pre‐election variable has coefficient −0.20 and standard error 0.25, while the post‐election coefficient is 0.03 with standard error 0.24. The signs are consistent with theory, but the coefficients are not significant, echoing others' results. Table 2 reports a summary of results from the most basic specification above, allowing electoral effects to differ between transparency regimes when we use the binary transparency indicator.            "
"35","All regressions in Table 2 included the full set of controls. Full results for the first column of Table 2 appear in Table 1(A), column 2. Among what isn't shown in Table 2, lagged debt is always positive, so the existence of a larger stock of debt, other things equal, predicts deficit reduction.22 Lagged debt is observable (at least as a forecast) when budgets are being done. The lagged dependent variable and its interactions with constitutional regime type are usually significant with expected signs, as is the log of income (positive for fiscal balance). Trade and demographic effects vary. In contrast to Persson and Tabellini, we find that the effect of the output gap is generally insignificant, maybe reflecting the inclusion of lagged debt.            "
"36","Consider the first two columns of Table 2. The main result is that we find no indication of an electoral cycle in fiscal balance for the high‐transparency countries. We consistently identify an electoral cycle in the low‐transparency countries. Conditional on low transparency, the electoral indicators have the correct sign (negative for election year, positive for post‐election year).23 Election‐year effects are consistently significant, though post‐election effects are significant only when we omit observations with large output shocks (column 2). The intuition behind the results is straightforward. Studies that do not find significant electoral cycles in fiscal balance in industrial countries lump together the data for high‐ and low‐transparency countries. This averages the different effects, as was illustrated by the “benchmark” line in Figure 1. Once the transparency of the budgetary process is taken into account, we find electoral cycles in fiscal policy where we would expect: exactly where it is difficult for voters to see them, in countries whose budget‐process transparency is lower.            "
"37"," Table 2, columns 3 and 4, report results from a similar pair of regressions, but with adjusted dates for elections occurring in the first quarter of a year. Statistical significance is identical to the results based on calendar year (columns 1 and 2). However, the size of the estimated effects is quite different. The pre‐election decrease in the surplus is estimated to be between 35% and 50% larger when the election year is adjusted to the previous calendar year because the election occurs in the first quarter, and the post‐election effect appropriately declines, though not by quite as much. The larger coefficient on the pre‐electoral decrease in the deficit suggests that incumbents do indeed engage in electoral manipulation already in the year preceding the election, and our adjusted coding is more appropriate.            "
"38","The main quantity of interest is what happens across the electoral cycle. Looking back at Figure 1, the magnitude of the electoral cycle is equal to how much the deficit expands (or the surplus declines) in the year before the election plus how much the deficit contracts (surplus expands) in the post‐election year. The estimate of this quantity, which we will call “cycle,” for any context in Table 2, is minus the estimated pre‐election shift in balance plus the post‐election shift. For example, for the low‐transparency countries in column 1, this sum of the interaction coefficients is (−1) * (−.56) + (.51) or 1.07. For the high‐transparency countries the analogous sum is −.11: small and in the wrong direction. Estimated this way, the magnitude of the cycle for low‐transparency countries varies between 1.07 and 1.37 for the cases in Table 2.            "
"39","How important, substantively or economically, is the estimated cycle? Bear in mind that the average (across all countries and years) absolute (regardless of direction) annual change in the fiscal balance has a magnitude of 1.21 (as a percent of GDP). However, the cycle estimated above contains two annual changes, so the estimated annual equivalent of the low‐transparency cycle in the first column of Table 2 is 0.54% of GDP. Across the table, these estimates range from .54 to .69 or between 45% and 57% of the average absolute change in the fiscal balance (1.21). These are substantively (as well as statistically) significant effects.            "
"40","The indicator variables are not always individually significant. However, a correct significance test on “cycle,” the quantity of interest, requires taking into account the covariance between the parameter estimates for the election year and post‐election year dummies which in this case is generally nonnegligible.24 We carry out these tests by taking 10,000 draws from a bivariate normal distribution with means equal to the estimated coefficients for election year and post‐election year, and variance and covariance equal to the relevant elements in the variance‐covariance matrix of the estimates. We calculate from each draw a predicted cycle estimate as −1 * (election year estimate)+ (election year estimate). The average value of this quantity over the 10,000 draws is shown in the tables as cycle, with its standard error observed across 10,000 draws. The cycle is indeed usually statistically significant and is well more than twice its standard error, four times in the case with the biggest shocks deleted and an adjusted election year. Note that because cycle is a linear combination of two regression coefficients, the statistical significance of cycle is a better substitute for the usual F‐test on the joint significance of two coefficients, since it takes account of correct signs as well as magnitudes.            "
"41"," Table 3 reports a similar picture if we interact the continuous index, rather than the binary transparency measure, with the election year and post‐election year indicators. Recall that in the specification without transparency, the electoral‐year indicators and the estimated cycles are insignificant (Table 1[A]). However, once we include interactions with the continuous index, the election year and post‐election effects become stronger, and the estimated interactions have the correct sign and are significant, conditional on using adjusted election years.            "
"42","To clarify how transparency constrains incumbents from engaging in fiscal manipulation around elections, consider Figure 2. The two panels in the figure show, for the two definitions of election year, how the effect of elections on a political budget cycle in fiscal balance varies with the degree of transparency.25 The panel on the right, reflecting smaller standard errors in the case of adjusted election years, shows that having an extreme score of zero on the transparency index implies that elections cause a cycle in the deficit of almost 2% of GDP, one which is significantly different from zero. The size of the estimate of cycle decreases as transparency increases. The electoral cycle disappears—that is, either the estimate has the wrong direction, or the confidence interval includes zero, or both—a little above a level of transparency of about 5, which in turn is just a little above the average level of transparency.            "
"43","                 Transparency and Political Budget Cycles                         "
"44","In results not reported, we replaced the Persson‐Tabellini data with public finance data collected by Brender and Drazen (2005), with more observations for some, but not all, countries. In the binary transparency case, the estimated pre‐election effect is larger and more significant, but the post‐election effect is smaller and generally insignificant. However, the size and significance of the cycle are at roughly the same levels as before (n= 164). Results with the Brender‐Drazen data are generally comparable to, though slightly weaker than, those reported in Tables 2 and 3. The main reason for the difference, we believe, is the fact that most of the additional data has been collected for countries with a relatively high degree of transparency.            "
"45","Finally, lagged debt, included in all regressions above, significantly increases surpluses. However, whether lagged debt is included or not does not alter the effects of transparency on the electoral cycle. Including lagged debt does imply, in almost all specifications, that the output gap does not have a significant effect on deficits.26 There may be a connection to Maastricht here, since our data is for the 1990s and includes a period when a few high‐debt countries worked extra hard to reduce deficits and debt, but this does not show up in the data. The effect of lagged debt on deficits is not larger, or smaller, in countries participating in Maastricht. An investigation of whether countries participating in the Maastricht treaty behaved in a different way than non‐Maastricht countries revealed nothing of significance on the electoral variables.27"
"46","Does polarization promote electoral cycles in fiscal policy? As in the case of transparency, we begin by looking at a simple decomposition of the average surplus by polarization regime and election versus nonelection year. Table 1(B) suggests that deficits differ across polarization regimes: high‐polarization countries have slightly higher deficits than low‐polarization countries. The differences are more pronounced when conditioning also on election year. High‐polarization countries have higher deficits in election years, while the opposite is true for the low‐polarization countries. To see how that is affected by transparency and other controls, we again turn to econometrics.            "
"47"," Table 4 reports the regression results for the dichotomous polarization measure, with the specifications similar to those of Tables 2 and 3. All four columns provide strong evidence that more polarized countries experience larger electoral cycles in fiscal policy. Highly polarized countries increase public deficits before an election and decrease them afterwards, whereas low‐polarization countries exhibit no significant effects. The value of cycle, for example, calculated in the same way as above, is 1.22 with a standard error of .48 in the high‐polarization countries in the smaller, calendar year sample with no large output shocks. This is strongly significant (the ratio of cycle to its standard error is above 2.5 in all four columns) and only slightly smaller in absolute terms than the effect of low transparency. The value of cycle for the low‐polarization countries is usually greater than its standard error, but not significantly so. This is driven mostly by the post‐election adjustment for these countries.            "
"48","Does the polarization effect hold up independent of transparency? If we include both dichotomous transparency and dichotomous polarization, using the calendar year, large‐shocks‐omitted data, we obtain the cycle estimates shown in the first panel of Table 5. The electoral cycle appears prominently in the cases defined by high polarization and low transparency, which in our sample includes Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, and Switzerland. The value of cycle, calculated as before, is larger than when either variable is considered on its own, and is nearly four times its standard error. In no other case is there a significant electoral cycle of the sort we contemplate. In fact, in the opposite case, low polarization with high transparency, the cycle goes (significantly) the wrong way, with surpluses rising before and falling after elections. Nevertheless, despite this, the separate but reinforcing effects of polarization and transparency are evident in the table: independent of polarization, the cycle is bigger where transparency is lower, and independent of transparency, the cycle is bigger where polarization is higher.            "
"49","We have estimated (but do not show, except for an example in Table 1[A]) results for continuous measures of polarization and transparency analogous to Table 4. In this case, unlike the binary case, if we do not control for transparency but include the continuous polarization measure on its own, the results are correctly signed but nowhere near significant. However, once the continuous measure of transparency is included in the regression, the effect of transparency on the electoral cycle holds up when controlling for polarization, and the effect of polarization holds up when controlling for transparency. Higher polarization countries, everything else equal, have significantly higher deficits in election years, while higher transparency countries, again holding everything else equal, have significantly higher surpluses. These results hold up across the usual alternative samples and definitions.            "
"50"," Figure 3 presents an illustration of these results. The left panel shows, as above, the marginal effect of elections on the presence of a cycle as a function of transparency evaluated at the average level of political polarization (4.7). In comparison with Figure 2, the slope is more or less unaffected, but the effects are somewhat less precisely estimated, the confidence intervals being wider at the endpoints of the domain of transparency. The standard errors are only a little larger, consistent with the smaller sample and larger number of variables in the regression. In a similar way, the right panel shows the marginal effect of political polarization at the average level of fiscal transparency (4.2). The results remain significant—the 90% confidence interval does not touch zero—and both cases confirm the hypotheses suggested by the theory.28"

"52","In addition to the Laver‐Hunt measure of political polarization, we explored the data collected by Huber and Inglehart (1995), who follow the same methodology in sending out questionnaires to country experts. The correlation between the Laver‐Hunt and Huber‐Inglehart measures is positive but insignificant. We calculate the standard deviation of expert party scores for a country as an alternative measure of polarization. We find the regression results for the Huber‐Inglehart measures (used in binary form for comparison) to be similar to those for the LH measure in terms of signs and size of the coefficients: the cycle in high‐polarization countries is again strongly significant. Also, in results not shown, we find broadly similar, and often stronger (but sometimes weaker), results employing the Brender and Drazen data set.29"
"53","Polarization should reflect positions of all parties except those that could never conceivably take office and whose positions do not influence the platforms of other parties. The Laver‐Hunt measure of political polarization includes all parties and therefore may be biased as an estimate of an incumbent's platform's distance from that of the expected successor government (in the event of not being reelected). To deal with this we also explored a recent, alternative measure of political polarization, constructed by Golder (2004). She calculates political polarization as the absolute ideological distance between the largest left‐ and right‐wing parties in the party system, which must all be possible, if not always probable successors, based on data from the Manifesto Research Group, which evaluates parties on a scale from −100 to +100 (Budge et al. 2001). The correlation between the two measures of polarization is not high because they are based on different concepts. The correlation between the Golder and Huber‐Inglehart measures is lower still.            "
"54","Nevertheless, we find that using Golder's measure of polarization yields many qualitatively similar results, consistent with the Alt‐Lassen model, whether we use calendar year or adjusted year concepts. In particular, whether we use the measure in discrete or continuous form, more polarized countries adjust fiscal policy towards lower deficits in the year following an election, consistent with the theory. This estimated post‐election adjustment appears also when we control for measures of transparency. Indeed, when we include both Golder's polarization measure and transparency, we estimate a significant pre‐election deficit driven by election timing. The picture is not quite as neat in every respect as we would like, and we have nothing firm to say about how transparency and polarization interact. Nevertheless, the preponderant evidence is that the political budget cycle is more pronounced in countries where the parties are further apart ideologically. Moreover, we can also infer that, at least for the case of continuous measurement, the magnifying effect of polarization on the political budget cycle exists alongside the dampening effect of transparency."
"55","This section considers two substantive confounding effects, control of media and multiparty government. It also reconsiders the validity of annual data by examining electoral fiscal policy cycles in a more limited sample of quarterly data."
"56","The question is often raised of whether high transparency is sufficient to produce the effects we describe above, or whether there also has to be a free, active communications media to transmit to the public the information that transparency makes available, or indeed whether such media is itself sufficient regardless of institutional transparency. For example, extensive state ownership of media might present incumbents with the opportunity to control budget information in the same way we have attributed to low institutional transparency. Indeed, Shi and Svensson model transparency but use a proxy measure of media freedom in their empirical work."
"57","To examine how media ownership and control relates to the effects of transparency, we consider the share of state‐owned television stations in the aggregate market share of the five largest television stations by viewership in 1999 (from Djankov et al. 2003). In our sample of countries this variable ranges from 0% for the United States to 80% for Denmark. We again dichotomize this variable at the mean to yield two even‐sized groups. The second panel in Table 5 shows that the “action” is mostly where there is high state‐owned television and low transparency. In our sample, these countries include Denmark, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and Ireland. There is clearly some overlap between the effects of state‐owned media and of transparency, though the form of the electoral cycle is still there with low state‐owned television and low transparency.30 However, high state‐owned media independently increases the magnitude of the cycle, especially where there is low transparency. To better disentangle cause and effect, we will need panel measures of each.            "
"58","Finally, it is also ultimately an empirical issue whether the reasoning of the model works for coalition governments. To explore this, we partition the high‐ and low‐transparency countries into those with an above average number of parties in government (NOP) and those with below average NOP, using data taken from Franzese (2002b).31 This measure is time‐varying, so the number of parties relates to the government in office during the year in which the election was held. Briefly, as the third panel of Table 5 shows, there is no difference between electoral cycles in cases where more or fewer parties are in office. The frequent occurrence of coalition governments cannot be taken on its own as a reason to reject our model.            "
"59","Our main results are based on annual data. This is almost a universal standard in the political budget‐cycle literature. We use annual data to facilitate comparison with the literature, to be certain that our results are not the product of different data but rather of the introduction of fiscal transparency and political polarization measures into the empirical specification. Annual data are not perfect, however. Several countries have fiscal years that differ from calendar years, and even though fiscal reporting typically is done such as to compare countries across calendar years inaccuracies can remain. Moreover, while our use of adjusted election years appeared to remove measurement error in some cases, it too was not perfect. Hence, we repeat some of the analysis with quarterly data. Quarterly data increases the number of time periods and makes it possible to align better fiscal data with the date of the election. On the other hand, sufficient data are not available for all countries in the sample for a reasonable set of control variables, or only for a very limited number of years. Therefore, the analysis below is based on 15 countries.32"
"60","Even with more precise data available, we must take into account that incumbents cannot always implement fiscal policy changes that take effect, or are reported to the public, exactly before the election takes place, or whose effects cease immediately when the election is over. Therefore, we implement a specification that distinguishes the three quarters centered on the election from the average of the next three on either side.33 In this way, the fiscal variables are aligned with elections by quarters, but we still allow for some inaccuracy in the implementation of a possible budget cycle. The dependent variable is government net lending in percent of GDP, taken from the OECD Analytical Database, and we include controls for openness, the share of young and old in the population, (log of) GDP per capita and the output gap from the OECD Economic Outlook database;34 general government debt is available on a quarterly basis only for a few countries in our sample and therefore excluded.            "
"61"," Table 6 reports the results. The first column shows results for the simple electoral cycle model. Unlike the case of annual data, there is evidence of a trough in the nine‐month window surrounding an election even in the absence of a measure of transparency. The next column reports results for the full sample where we distinguish low‐ and high‐transparency countries. We find that both types of countries decrease their surplus around elections, but that the effect is larger, if less precisely estimated, for low‐transparency countries. If we leave out the greatly insignificant average measures from the quarters around the election window, the deficit induced by elections in the low‐transparency countries is twice that of high‐transparency countries; again, though, the difference is insignificant.            "
"62","In columns 4 and 5, we report results from the smaller sample, where cases with large output gaps are excluded. Column 4 reports the case with averages before and after the election period. Here, the signs are as above and the difference between high‐ and low‐transparency countries is now very large, but none of the coefficients are significant. Again, if we concentrate the analysis on the election quarters (column 5), the electoral deficit in low‐transparency countries is significant, and the difference between deficits in the two types of countries is also significant, at the 10% level.35"
"63","Finally, results for the continuous transparency measure are reported in columns 6 and 7, concentrated on the three election quarters. The results on the full sample (column 6) show that more transparent countries have smaller electoral deficits; the coefficient on the interacted transparency variable implies that the electoral cycle in deficits all but disappears when the transparency index reaches its maximum level of 11."
"64","As for polarization, we do not get clear results in the quarterly data (results not reported, available upon request). For the Huber‐Inglehart measures, the results generally support the hypothesis that highly polarized countries have significantly larger electoral deficits. For the Laver‐Hunt measure, the effect of elections on the deficit is virtually the same, and negative, for high‐ and low‐polarization countries, in particular in the case when we consider only the three‐quarter electoral window."
"65","The main results of this article contribute to the growing body of evidence of conditional political budget cycles in industrial countries. A key finding is that the scope for electoral cycles in fiscal balance depends on the degree of fiscal policy transparency: the political budget cycle is where you can't see it. We show using a recent transparency‐index measure on panel data for 19 advanced industrialized OECD economies over the 1990s that electoral cycles exist in low(er) transparency countries and that such cycles are statistically and economically significant. At the same time, we find substantive evidence of electoral cycles being induced by political polarization, a finding that in some cases reveals itself only after controlling for the level of transparency, but that turns out to reinforce the effects of low transparency. We also show that state‐controlled media reinforce the effect of low transparency, but that the presence of electoral cycles does not depend on the number of parties in government. The results hold for alternative codings and data sets and furthermore are robust to the exclusion of particular countries. Much remains to be done, however."
"66","One additional implication of the model still to be explored involves partisan choices of debt. The Alt‐Lassen model allows for differences in parties' choice of debt, given transparency and platforms. Comparative statics depend on parameter values in the model, but in most cases the low‐spending (right‐wing) party chooses a higher equilibrium level of debt. That implies that the size of the cycle at an election would be conditional on the sequence of parties: bigger where Right parties give way to Left, for example."
"67","We repeated the analysis with different dependent variables to see whether the electoral policy cycles identified above were driven by manipulating expenditures or revenues. We found few consistent and significant effects of fiscal transparency and political polarization on electoral cycles in revenues and expenditures separately.36 We find no effects of transparency on expenditure levels. Possibly revenues decrease in election years in both high‐ and low‐transparency countries, but subsequent post‐election adjustment takes place only in high‐transparency countries. High‐polarization countries have higher expenditures in election years, and lower expenditures in post‐election years, while the opposite is (weakly) true for low‐polarization countries. Possibly voters observe changes in revenues and expenditures more readily than fiscal balance; the latter imposes the added difficulty of combining information about revenues and expenditures. This is a subject to which we will return in future research.         "
"68","We do not here address the issue of reverse causation, or endogeneity of transparency, the possibility that transparency is just a matter of politicians having nothing to hide. However, Alt and Lassen (2006) include an instrumental variables estimate of their cross‐section results for transparency and debt, which suggests that their main results go through. We are addressing the incentive of politicians to create transparent institutions in a separate paper (Alt, Lassen, and Rose 2006) but any serious research into this issue requires a panel of transparency and polarization measures.         "
"69","Why do incumbent governments in high‐transparency countries refrain from running deficits before elections? If people can observe the deficits for what they really are, that is, opportunistic dead‐weight losses, they should not reward such behavior on the part of incumbents. However, in the case of low‐transparency countries, is it possible that voters do in fact reward deficit spending? An interesting extension would be to examine incumbent popularity conditioning on transparency regime. Just as the view of voters of fiscal conservatives (Peltzman 1992) may not hold up when conditioning on party governments (Lowry, Alt, and Ferree 1998) since voters expect parties to pursue different goals with respect to the size of government, the conclusion that voters do not reward deficit spending (Alesina, Perotti, and Tavares 1998) may be amended when conditioning on the political and institutional context. Allowing the impact of fiscal policy on approval ratings and electoral results to differ between high‐ and low‐transparency regimes would make it possible to assess whether perceptions held on the demand side of the political economy (by the voters) match those on the supply side (politicians). This could be done both on our 19 country OECD sample, as well as on the U.S. states, where we have constructed a similar though not identical transparency index (Alt, Lassen, and Skilling, 2002). This is another topic for future research.         "
"70","An additional subject long neglected in the analysis of political budget cycles is the role of regional and local governments. In many countries, the degree of decentralization of expenditures is greater than that of tax revenues, suggesting that central governments allocate expenditures to state and local governments even in countries where local taxation is mainly a matter for local governments. If central governments would engage in electioneering, it would be natural for them to distort the temporal pattern of both central and local spending, in order to maximize the probability of reelection. We plan to examine this, too, in future research."
"71","Finally, in a relevant, hardly lighthearted, effort to award a cycling prize between the current incumbent and an important figure from the past, Nixon, Rogoff wrote:         "
"72","                        "
"73","Presidents seeking a preelection boost can also run big deficits to increase domestic demand. Bush's high spending results from homeland security and “Iraqistan,” whereas Nixon experienced the mother of all financial pits: Vietnam. Both presidents slashed taxes before their reelection campaigns (although Nixon recognized that the economy would pay for his profligacy later). The Nixon budget deficit in 1971 and 1972 was around 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); Bush's deficit exceeded 4 percent in 2003 and will likely reach 4 percent again in 2004. Advantage: Bush. (2004, 80)"
"74","As a final thought, consider the recent American election. On a Persson‐Tabellini analysis, the United States, as a presidential system, should feature large electoral cycles in deficits. This amounts to the prediction that, other things equal, the deficit would be significantly reduced in 2005 (whether Bush was reelected or not). On our analysis, the United States, as a relatively transparent, not very polarized system, has smaller electorally induced cycles. On that view, the pre‐election deficit was more structural than tactical. Hence our analysis predicts that, after controlling for other factors, the U.S. deficit will not be significantly reduced in 2005.We'll see what happens.         "
