"1","The bulk of the Protagoras consists of Socrates' report to an unnamed comrade of a conversation he has just had with the famous sophist at the behest of the young and impetuous Hippocrates.1 Hippocrates has heard (because “all” say it: 310e6) that Protagoras is “wisest at speaking”; and he wishes to become the student of Protagoras evidently because he believes that acquiring such wisdom or skill himself is essential to fulfilling his political ambition—to his becoming “held in high regard in the city” (310e6‐7; 316b10‐c1). For his part, Socrates warns Hippocrates that he is about to entrust the education of his soul to a sophist even though he is ignorant of what wise matter the sophist teaches and hence of its worth. And despite his eagerness to study with Protagoras, Hippocrates blushes at the suggestion that he wishes to do so in order to become a sophist himself (312a2; compare 315a4‐5); even Hippocrates doubts the respectability of sophistry, however useful it may be. In these ways the argument and the action of the dialogue indicate its most obvious task: Socrates attempts to uncover, for the sake of Hippocrates, the character and worth of Protagoras' instruction—and indeed to warn him away from it. But as Socrates himself insists, to evaluate the worth of the education Protagoras offers, one must be a knower of the things that benefit and harm the soul or a “physician expert in what pertains to the soul” (313e1‐5). If Socrates' critique of Protagoras is to be convincing, then, it must not merely stymie or embarrass the sophist but demonstrate to us, its audience, the soundness of the standard or goal to which it looks in doing so. Does the education Protagoras offers meet the Socratic requirements of a good education—whatever these may be? The sophist as educator, especially in his difference from the philosopher, is the theme of the Protagoras.         "
"2","We may nonetheless wonder whether Socrates' concern for Hippocrates fully explains the conversation before us. After all, it is Socrates who suggests that he and Hippocrates make their way to Protagoras and the other sophists (314b6‐c2), just after he has issued a stinging rebuke to Hippocrates for his uninformed desire to do so, and at an important juncture in the dialogue Socrates assures Protagoras that his cross‐examinations have as their goal the discovery of the truth about virtue, about a question that perplexes Socrates himself; his conversation with Protagoras is intended to make certain one or more of Socrates' own thoughts, as only conversation with or “testing” of another can do (347c5‐349a6; consider also, e.g., 328d8‐e1, as well as 357e2‐8: Socrates is not consistently concerned with harming the business prospects of the sophists, Protagoras included). The first impression we receive from the dialogue of Socrates' concern for the moral education of Hippocrates, a concern remarkable not least for its patient forbearance, is due in part to the fact that Socrates is addressing or adapting himself throughout to his unnamed comrade (together with certain anonymous others: 310a2, 5‐7)—to a man who, however well‐disposed to Socrates he may be, is more interested in gossip than philosophy (309b2‐3, c1‐3), is thoroughly conventional in his deference to Homer and his preference for the homegrown over the foreign (309a1‐b2, c9‐10), and is even less privy to the intellectual happenings in Athens than is Hippocrates: if Hippocrates knew of the arrival of Protagoras a day later than did Socrates, the comrade remains unaware of it on the third day after the fact (compare 310b7‐8 with 309d3‐4). The comrade assumes the relationship between Socrates and Alcibiades, of which he playfully disapproves, to be a sexual one (309a1‐5), and Socrates does not stoop to correct this assumption (consider Symposium 219c6‐d2 and context). But the account he gives of his attempt to shield Hippocrates from an education at the hands of a sophist would go some way toward protecting him from suspicion that he in any way corrupts the young: he prevents their corruption. It is true that, after Socrates has succeeded in embarrassing Protagoras by pursuing questions that Protagoras finds annoying—that is, after he has dulled the luster of Protagoras' reputation in the eyes of his potential students—Socrates indicates his intention to leave the get‐together (335c3‐7). Yet Socrates stays in fact, and he must have suspected that the mere statement of his intention to leave would elicit the pleas and negotiations it did elicit and so permit the conversation to continue on terms more agreeable to him. It is certain that Socrates did not have any pressing matter to attend to elsewhere, as he claims to have, for upon finally leaving Callias' home he happens upon his unnamed comrade and repeats the just‐completed conversation in all but its entirety (compare 335c5‐6 and 362a2‐4 with 310a2‐5; for the omissions, see 314c3‐7, 316a6‐7, and 348b1). And Socrates never indicates what effect any of this had on Hippocrates (or for that matter on his comrade). Could it be that Socrates' deepest concerns, the question or questions he wishes to examine together with Protagoras, are presented in the guise of his concern for the moral education of Hippocrates, or at any rate that the latter is strictly subordinate to the former? If this is so, then Socrates demonstrates before our eyes his “good counsel concerning his own affairs,” which issues in a manifest or ostentatious concern for the affairs of others.         "
"3","As Socrates and Hippocrates arrive outside the home of Callias, the two complete a conversation the substance of which Socrates refrains from reporting to the comrade but which leads the feisty eunuch who does hear it to conclude that they too are sophists: to the mostly (but not entirely) uninformed, Socrates and the sophists are as one. With the begrudging compliance of the eunuch, Socrates gains entry and immediately surveys the scene inside: he first sees Protagoras, who enjoys the greatest number of followers, including very prominent Athenians (Callias, the two sons of Pericles, Charmides) as well as a good many foreigners; then Hippias with a smaller retinue that includes two sometime members of the Socratic circle (Eryximachus and Phaedrus); and finally Prodicus, who is also with a mix of Athenians (the young Agathon) and foreigners. Quoting from Odysseus' remarks in the course of his famous passage through the House of Hades, the Greek underworld, Socrates implies that Hippias is akin to Heracles, Prodicus to Tantalus and, more generally, the House of Callias to the House of Hades—and not without reason. For Callias and Hades enjoy the dubious distinction of having kept company with their respective wives and the mothers of their wives.1 Perhaps because he is distracted by Protagoras' delightfully comic chorus, Socrates neither describes Protagoras himself (beyond his capacity to bewitch people with his voice) nor indicates the subject matter of his discourse to which all are so attentive; Protagoras' voice fails to bewitch Socrates. Only in the case of Prodicus—a man “altogether wise and divine”—does Socrates make known his (unfulfilled) desire to hear what is being said (consider also 340e8‐341a4), and only in the second and central case does Socrates state the subject matter of the discussions: Hippias is giving detailed responses to certain astronomical questions pertaining to “nature and the things aloft” (315c5‐6; note also the mention of astronomy at 318d9‐e4). Coming in just behind Socrates are Critias and Alcibiades, the latter being the supposed object of Socrates' affection (316a6‐b2; 390a5). In this closely guarded and rather exotic underworld, filled to capacity with sophists and their devotees, foreigners with their foreign ways mix easily with the best of Athenian society or its youth—including a budding poet (Agathon), two future tyrants (Critias, Charmides), and a philosopher. In the unconventional and even decadent atmosphere created by the profligacy of Callias (Apology of Socrates 20a4‐6 and Xenophon Symposium 1.5), it would seem that the hold of the merely homegrown ways or customs (nomoi) is loosened considerably (consider again 309c9‐10). Here apparently one can enjoy the freedom necessary to discuss openly the gravest matters, including “the things aloft” and their fixed “nature”: here the things aloft are assumed to be not divine but natural—perhaps stones and earth, for example (Apology of Socrates 26d1‐5 and context). And here one can venture the view, as Hippias does later on, that those present are governed and united by nature and not at all by the “tyrant”nomos (337c6‐e2).         "
"4","The “sophisticated” atmosphere we are thus introduced to makes all the more striking both the extreme caution with which Protagoras speaks throughout and the delicacy, marked by forethought, with which Socrates first approaches him (316c5; 318d5‐7). Even here, in what is at most a semi‐public gathering, Protagoras' first concern is with the nature of the audience he is to address (316b3‐4; compare 317c6‐d1), and he is prompted by that concern to offer to the restricted audience of Socrates and Hippocrates some important reflections on the great danger to which his practice of sophistry subjects him and, in particular, on the difference between him and his predecessors in grappling with that danger. For whereas all previous sophists endeavored to conceal, by means of one sort of “cloak” or another, the very fact that they were sophists, the aptly named Protagoras (“first to speak out”) is perfectly open about his being a sophist. But for all his distance from the earlier sophists with their apparently clumsy and even counterproductive efforts at concealment—effective only with the many, who “perceive as it were nothing” (317a4‐5), as distinguished from the powerful few—Protagoras nowhere claims to have removed the necessity dictating the use of such concealment. On the contrary, Protagoras' openness is itself a precaution (317b5) meant to protect him, and he mentions but fails to specify certain other means of concealment that keep him from suffering harm as a result of agreeing that he is a sophist (317b6).1 Put another way, Protagoras' openness is only a partial openness and it too is motivated by the need for self‐protection. As the results of Socrates' cross‐examination of Hippocrates already suggest, Protagoras is frank about the fact that he teaches but not about what he teaches (consider also 352a8‐b1).         "
"5","Only under pressure from Socrates does Protagoras state more or less candidly the nature of his instruction: “The subject in question is good counsel concerning one's own affairs—how he might best manage his own household—and, concerning the affairs of the city, how he might be the most powerful in carrying out and speaking about the city's affairs” (318e5‐319a2). The successful student of Protagoras, then, will of course benefit himself by managing his private affairs well, but Protagoras leaves unclear the end with a view to which his student will exercise preeminent power in the city: will he be guided by the desire to benefit the city or himself? It is certainly true that Socrates immediately imposes on Protagoras the most respectable interpretation of his remarks possible—to the effect that Protagoras teaches the political art and good citizenship, words that had never passed Protagoras' lips—just as it is true that Protagoras happily concedes this to be what he publicly pronounces or “professes” (319a6‐7). But since we have just been alerted to the dangerous character of Protagoras' activity, to the “ill will and hostile plots” to which it can give rise (316d3), as well as to his necessary recourse to arts of concealment, we must be especially wary of becoming, like “the many,” his dupes. Could it be that Protagoras promises to teach his students how to benefit themselves in matters public as well as private, or that he teaches them how to gain preeminent power in order to use the common good for the sake of their own good? Is not Protagoras' claim to bestow the greatest political power on his students—that is, on anyone who can pay the tuition (consider 316b8‐9), however unpromising his nature1—at least a little troubling? All this suggests that when Socrates turns to raise the question of whether such good citizenship is in fact teachable, we must keep on the table the prior and more fundamental question of precisely what Protagoras teaches.         "
"6","To support his view that the political art or good citizenship (319a4‐5, 8‐9) cannot be taught, Socrates offers two pieces of evidence. First, when some technical matter requiring expert advice arises, the democratic assembly of Athens refuses to hear from any but the acknowledged experts. Whenever deliberation is required concerning the city's management more generally, however, any and every citizen is permitted to speak because—according to Socrates—all believe such political expertise to be unteachable and thus all citizens to be equally capable (or incapable?) of offering it; no special expertise in politics is attainable through instruction and hence it cannot be demanded. If the evidence Socrates offers is uncontroversial, his interpretation of it surely is. For would not the Athenians claim rather that all citizens are equally capable of giving political advice because all—all gentlemen, at least—not only possess the relevant expertise but can and do teach it to their fellow citizens (see, e.g., Meno 92e3‐6 and context)? Socrates would appear to be on more solid ground when he notes, in the second place, that even “our wisest and best citizens” cannot bestow on their own kin the expertise they possess, an expertise he now, and for the first time, calls “virtue” (319e2; also 320a3, b5). Pericles, for example, has as yet been unable to educate his young ward Cleinias, let alone turn him into another Pericles. It is clear on reflection that Socrates has in mind two quite different conceptions of political excellence, the one characteristic of the good or dutiful citizen, the other of the greatest statesmen: “good citizenship” differs from “the political art” at its peak, and if the latter cannot be taught, does not every city claim, at least, to teach the former? Or—since the teachability of virtue proves to rest on its being knowledge in the strict sense (epistēmē: 361a6‐c2; Meno 87b1‐c7)—does Socrates here mean to cast doubt on the rationality of what is conveyed in and through the “education” to citizenship? Socrates' challenge to Protagoras concerning the teachability of virtue certainly undermines the sophist's business prospects, but it also introduces the question of what properly constitutes virtue and whether in all its various forms or guises it is rational and hence teachable.         "
"7","Protagoras' lengthy response to Socrates includes the complex myth of Prometheus and Epimetheus for which the dialogue is probably best known. We limit ourselves to some preliminary observations.1 To begin with, the myth indicated is but one part of a long speech that also contains an argument, a logos, properly speaking (320c6‐7; 324d6‐7; 328c3), and the ostensible purpose of the long speech as a whole is of course to prove that virtue is teachable and that Protagoras himself can teach it. But Protagoras also achieves two different (if related) ends by means of it: he intimates to his potential students in the room, Alcibiades, Critias, and Charmides among them, the truth of what he (truly) teaches, even as he shores up the conventional opinions he and his successful students will exploit in their quest to become “most powerful.” For it seems that Protagoras believes of Zeus not only that he exists but that he is a divinely beneficent lawgiver—a Zeus who cares for the whole human race, who in his care for us gave justice and shame to all, and who made political life possible by setting it down as a law that anyone who does not share in these will be killed on the grounds that he is an illness in the city (322d1‐5). But in truth—even if one ignores the fact that all this is conveyed in what is explicitly a myth largely of Protagoras' creation—the details of it suggest a rather dark picture of the human condition. Zeus cares for the human race, i.e., he is indifferent to the fate of individuals; his concern for the race extends only so far that it not perish entirely (321a2, b6, and especially 322c1); and such care as he exercised took the form of intrusting our well‐being to two bunglers, for even the prudence of Prometheus (“Forethought”) did not prevent him from allowing the erring Epimetheus (“Afterthought”) to distribute the various capacities or powers to all creatures (320d4‐8). The world is fundamentally “Epimethean”: thought follows rather than precedes creation. The only comforts we have were invented by us through arts of our own devising; and we attained fire, the prerequisite of their development, only through an act of rebellion against the gods for which, “it is said,” Prometheus was later made to pay (322a1‐2). Our true condition is one of utter abandonment. There is only the natural order that (at most) favors the continuation of the human species. Even the brute animals are better off by nature than we are, for in addition to possessing natural defenses, they easily come together to form communities of a kind, whereas we fell to slaughtering one another almost as soon as we drew together. And to restrain ourselves, to make political life possible, it was necessary not that Zeus actually become a lawgiver but that “all” believe him to have done so. Protagoras' myth thus puts before our eyes the kind of conviction that human beings must have if they will restrain themselves sufficiently to form lasting political communities. But this is not quite correct: Protagoras notes as if in passing that not all are just in fact and that it would be madness to admit to one's injustice or to fail to pretend to possess justice (323a5‐c2). He does not say that it would be madness to be unjust, and he omits mention of the fatal wrath of Zeus extending to such unjust dissemblers. Political societies require, not the universal agreement as to the goodness of justice and the divine sanctions attending its violation, but the near‐universal agreement; political society will endure perfectly well if only a few understand the truth about justice, especially if these few also happen to be clever enough to conceal their true thoughts (consider 310e5‐7; 317b5‐c1) by “speaking with god” (compare 317b7), for example, or by using such devices as myth and poetry (339a3‐6).         "
"8","The subsequent exchanges between Socrates and Protagoras confirm the suspicion that Protagoras is a teacher of injustice. He teaches, that is, that the unjust way of life is superior to the just life, that the happy few exploit the ignorant many, and that the only true virtues are wisdom and courage:1 according to Protagoras' account of it, “political virtue” (323a6‐7, b2, 324a1) is limited to moderation, justice, and piety, or to what might be called ordinary decency, and the so‐called education necessary to instill it consists of exhortations, forced memorization, threats, and even beatings: “‘Do these things!’‘Don't do those!’” (325d5 and context; the beliefs of the Athenians and indeed of all human beings pertaining to virtue properly belong to Protagoras' myth rather than to his logos: see 322d5‐324d1 and the transition at 324d6‐7). This is not the education Protagoras offers, of course, but is rather what everyone receives initially at the hands of the law, of nomos broadly understood (consider 326c7‐d8, which is the climax of this section; by thus instilling justice, the altogether human law accomplishes the task initially assigned to Zeus). Such an “education” never mentions, because it has absolutely nothing to do with, wisdom, “the greatest of the virtues” according to Protagoras (330a2; 352d1‐3). In fact it is this mere habituation to unthinking obedience, to preferring the city's good to one's own, that Protagoras' instruction must undo—carefully but surely.         "
"9","In accord with this, when Socrates asks Protagoras whether the individual virtues are parts of a whole, either as bits of gold are part of gold or as mouth, nose, eyes, and ears are parts of the whole that is the face, Protagoras replies without hesitation that the latter is the case. He does so because “the virtues”—justice, moderation, and piety on the one hand, wisdom and courage on the other—prove to be distinct from one another in a way that the former image does not permit: as Protagoras admits, in an (almost) unguarded moment, “there are many who are courageous but unjust, and there are those who are just, in turn, but not wise” (329e5‐6). Courage and injustice can go together—successful bank robbers, for example—and justice can go together with a lack of wisdom or indeed foolishness (consider 332a4‐6). The crucial question is thus alluded to: is the combination “wise,”“courageous,” and “unjust” a possible one? More sharply stated, might the wise as such be unjust? Socrates tries, mostly unsuccessfully, to force Protagoras to concede that all the virtues are one inasmuch as justice is, or is most akin to, piety, wisdom to moderation, and, finally, justice (= piety) to moderation (= wisdom). Such begrudging agreement as Socrates is able to wrest from Protagoras results less from the cogency of his arguments here1 than from their extremely sensitive subject matter: as Socrates orchestrates things, Protagoras would have to agree that piety is unjust and justice impious (331a6‐b1), for example, were he openly to oppose him. Yet Socrates' failure to secure unambiguous agreement to the proposition that all the virtues are one means in the context that indeed the wise may not be just, and Protagoras finally asserts, under pressure from Socrates and not of course in his own name, that it is a mark of moderation—hence of thinking well, of deliberating well, of faring well, hence of possessing for oneself the good or advantageous things—to commit injustice. No wonder, then, that this line of argument immediately precedes the first breakdown of the conversation and strikes Protagoras as “annoying” (333d2; compare also 332a2).         "
"10","Socrates' initial question as to what a student will learn from Protagoras culminates in, because it is most honestly answered by, this exchange. It also prompts Protagoras to make a rather angry outburst concerning his understanding of the good that is preceded by his first oath or curse in the dialogue (333d10‐334c7). Protagoras stresses not only that “the good” must be judged in reference to the nature or needs of a given thing, but also, and for that very reason, that what is good or bad, advantageous or harmful, is extraordinarily complex—manure, for example, being highly advantageous to mature plants but harmful to young ones. For his part, Socrates notes only that lengthy speeches make him forget the question at issue (334c8‐d1). Shortly thereafter, Socrates stands up as though to leave. The threat of his departure prompts the future tyrant Critias to strike a moderate compromise between Callias' proposal and Alcibiades' counter‐proposal, although it is Socrates' own amendment—that Protagoras should pose questions to him, who will answer briefly and then pose questions again to Protagoras—that carries the day. For all the applause that Protagoras wins from his audience (334c7‐8), Socrates proves to be a master at getting the whole of the crowd on his side (338e2‐3): Socrates too is a clever speaker, one not above using such devices as flattery, for example (compare 338b4‐c6 with d6‐e2)."
"11","With considerable reluctance, Protagoras takes up Socrates' invitation or challenge, and he does so by initiating the discussion of poetry that appears to be a rather baffling, and lengthy, digression (338e6‐347a5). Yet Protagoras himself indicates what is at stake: “the question will concern the same thing that you and I are now conversing about, namely virtue.” The question of the unity of virtue, of virtue in its relation to wisdom, will somehow remain in play.1"
"12","Protagoras begins by quoting from the poetry of Simonides, whom he had earlier identified as a crypto‐sophist (316d7), to the effect that it is difficult to become a good man. But Protagoras' immediate interest in the ode proves to be less with the substance of the line than with the author's blatant self‐contradiction: Simonides states in his own name that it is difficult to become good and then promptly criticizes Pittacus, “a wise man” (339c4; also 343a2), for maintaining essentially the same view. Thus, “whenever he criticizes one who says the same things as he himself does, it is clear that he criticizes himself as well” (339d7‐8). Protagoras' immediate reason for speaking of poetry, then, is to air the complaint that one very clever man is criticizing another for holding exactly the same view he does. Now, Protagoras has already indicated that poetry is one means of sophistic concealment (316d6 and context), and we must put two and two together: does Protagoras mean to indicate to Socrates that he knows that Socrates too holds the same view about justice that he himself does, that it is improper of Socrates to criticize him in this way, and that he had better cease his aggressive cross‐examination? Socrates, for his part, lets us know that Protagoras' blow has hit home, for he is “dizzy and woozy” as a result of Protagoras' statement (and the crowd's reaction to it). Socrates lets us know too that in his opinion a poet who contradicts himself might speak correctly, if not nobly (339b7‐10, with the reading of mss. T and W): intentional self‐contradiction might well be excusable. Accordingly, the first two of his attempts to free Simonides from the charge of self‐contradiction are dismal failures. That is, when Socrates notes that Simonides had said it is difficult to become good, whereas Pittacus had said it is difficult to be noble, Protagoras simply dismisses the resulting view (of Hesiod, but apparently compatible with Simonides') that it is easy to possess virtue: it is the opinion of all human beings that virtue is the most difficult thing of all. Abandoning his first response without even attempting to defend it, Socrates next suggests that what Simonides meant by “difficult” was in fact “bad”: “so for these reasons … he also criticizes Pittacus for saying that ‘it's difficult to be noble,’ just as if he heard him say, ‘it's bad to be noble’” (341c3‐5). But the difficulty remains: if we suppose that Simonides understood “difficult” to mean “bad” in both his own lines and those of Pittacus, the self‐contradiction stands! And far from defending this suggestion, Socrates dismisses it, though not before he has made explicit its impious character (341d6‐9). It is striking that Socrates does not avail himself of the obvious difference between Simonides' saying and that of Pittacus: whereas Simonides speaks of becoming good (agathos), Pittacus speaks of being noble (esthlos). Since Protagoras takes each man to be saying the same thing, does he thus assume that the good and the noble are identical? Socrates leaves this assumption unchallenged here. The relation of what is noble to what is good proves to be a “touchy” subject, one to which Socrates will force Protagoras to return.         "
"13","Socrates' third and final response (342a6‐347a5) begins lightheartedly, with a portrait of the exceedingly philosophic Spartans. Yet the official view of virtue now on the table, according to which virtue is one because it is knowledge (wisdom), permits or requires Socrates to describe the Spartans as he does: the Spartans are exceedingly virtuous; therefore the Spartans are exceedingly wise. The premise that virtue is knowledge can thus lead to ridiculous results, for “virtue” is an ambiguous term, just as Protagoras has intimated: such courage as the Spartans possess (342b5) is not based on or identical to wisdom (compare 329e5‐330a2, where Protagoras places wisdom and courage together). The long speech that follows will state some of the serious consequences of the view that “virtue is knowledge,” i.e., something of what it would mean to possess such virtue as is properly identified with knowledge."
"14","In his laconic way, Simonides contends that while it is in truth difficult to become good, it is impossible to be (to remain) good over time; and because it is impossible to remain such, Pittacus was wrong to assert that becoming noble is merely difficult. All human excellence is doomed to decline as a result of time, toil, and illness, for example (345b2‐4), and it is precisely those who have gained the most knowledge and so act or fare best who have the most to lose—and will lose it eventually. Perhaps there is some consolation in the conviction that “best for the longest time are those whom the gods love” (345c3), but even this formulation suggests that the gods do not love all, that they do not protect forever those whom they do love, and that the goodness of the good does not owe its origin to the gods or their love. Simonides' poem, as interpreted by Socrates, insists on the frailty of human goodness and the necessarily exposed character of our happiness: knowledge or virtue is no guarantee against decline or misfortune. There is no “providential” care of human beings sufficient always to protect us."
"15","Going together with this harsh view is an explicit statement of Socrates' own thought, the only one in a passage that otherwise presents itself as his explication of Simonides' intention: “I pretty much think this: none of the wise men holds that any human being willingly [voluntarily] errs or willingly [voluntarily] does any shameful and bad deed. Rather they know well that all who do the shameful and bad things do them unwillingly [involuntarily]” (345d9‐e3). This view of the wise is but a variation on Socrates' dictum that virtue is knowledge and vice ignorance or (as he puts it in the Protagoras) that “this alone constitutes bad action—being deprived of knowledge” (345b5): all shameful and bad action is the product of a regrettable but strictly speaking involuntary ignorance (of the good), involuntary because no one would willingly or knowingly retain such ignorance; it is indeed contrary to “human nature” to seek out bad things when it is possible to secure the good (358d1‐2). Thus the wise, who understand these things and their consequences, do not blame those who do any shameful or bad deed. In the immediate context, this means that Simonides is not finally among the class of wise men, for he agrees with their defining opinion only partially or inconsistently: Simonides' last word here is “I blame” (347a3), and he blames Pittacus for the errors he makes because those errors concern “the greatest things” (347a2; compare 358c3‐5 and context). (Simonides contends that he will not blame the middle or middling view, but Pittacus' is just that: Hesiod maintains that virtue is easy, Pittacus that it is difficult but possible to possess, Simonides that it is impossible to do so.) Could it be that Simonides' self‐contradiction here, on this point, is not a prudent adaptation to political or familial authority but is rather the product of a certain confusion or that his attachment to justice goes well beyond the recognition of its utility to the city, of its necessity as (mere) convention (346c3‐5)? We suggest that, as Protagoras began the section on poetry with an implicit message to Socrates, so Socrates concludes it with one to Protagoras: the sophist who is concerned with wisdom for the sake of honor or ambition (343b7‐c3) and who seeks to gain a victory over a wise man (343a2), is not himself wise because he is inconsistent on a matter of fundamental importance. It is the burden of the remaining section of the dialogue to determine whether Protagoras shares some such inconsistency and, if he does, what its specific character is. In doing so, moreover, the final part of the dialogue also clarifies what the health of the soul would have to include according to Socrates and therewith a part of what the “physician of the soul” would look to in applying his treatments.         "
"16","After a brief interlude in which Protagoras appears to be shamed into continuing the conversation (348c1 and context), Socrates turns to examine the one virtue that Protagoras himself had introduced (329e5‐6) but that they have yet to examine, courage.1 Protagoras is now willing to amend his earlier position by conceding that the four other virtues—wisdom, moderation, justice, and piety—are “reasonably comparable to one another” (349d2‐4). On the one hand, this concession gives to Socrates a much clearer victory over Protagoras than did their original argument. On the other hand, by thus dropping the delicate question of the relation of wisdom to justice, Protagoras spares himself the threat of further embarrassment (or worse). Yet Protagoras does not concede everything to Socrates: courage, he insists, differs very much from the other virtues, for in the case of “many among the human beings,” at least—surely not Protagoras himself! (compare 349d6 with 333c1‐3 and context)—courage can go together with the greatest injustice, impiety, licentiousness, and lack of learning (ignorance). Courage, then, is not (necessarily) a “moral” virtue. It would seem to be rather a certain steadiness or toughness of soul, whether for the sake of heroic combat or illegal thievery.         "
"17","Given this “amoral” view of courage, Socrates wonders what the relation of courage to mere boldness or confidence is. In his response, Protagoras now has recourse not to the many but to their opposite: the courageous are indeed bold; they are even eager in the face of things “the many” fear to advance toward. The crucial premise in the ensuing exchange is Protagoras' contention, perhaps made with a view to what he must claim publicly as a teacher of virtue, lest he be held to be “mad” (349e3‐8; compare 323b2‐7), that the whole of virtue and hence courage in particular is altogether noble: the courageous are indeed bold, but not all the bold are courageous; only those who are bold in a noble way can be said to be courageous, and what distinguishes the noble virtue of courage from its shameful counterpart is knowledge. But why is knowledge so important? In the examples given—those of expert divers, cavalry men, and light‐shieldsmen (peltasts)—knowledge has the effect of diminishing the risk to the courageous themselves or of thus benefiting them, and in this respect Protagoras' understanding of courage is consistent with his implicit account of justice: justice is service to the good of others and hence foolish or “shameful,” courage is the strength of soul needed to accomplish good things with a minimum of risk to oneself and hence is sensible or “noble.” This amounts to saying that Protagoras does not here recognize any class of noble things that transcend the good or advantageous for oneself, that are choiceworthy on account of their intrinsic worth or beauty regardless of whether they are advantageous to those who possess them or act in accord with them. Far from objecting to Socrates' account of courage that links its noble character to advantageous knowledge, Protagoras here accepts it."
"18","Socrates attempts to take advantage of Protagoras' insistence that courage is marked by (a certain) knowledge, in contrast to his previous claim that courage can be combined with the greatest ignorance (compare 350a2‐3 and a6‐b1 with 349d4‐8; 360e1‐2), for this final step would allow Socrates to conclude, by means fair or foul, that virtue is knowledge. In response, Protagoras focuses on a logical blunder he attributes to Socrates, and because Socrates does not even attempt to defend himself,1 it could well appear that this first section (349a8‐351b2) of the last part of the dialogue constitutes a victory for Protagoras. His selfish account of nobility is permitted to stand.         "
"19","Protagoras' presentation of courage is not without complication. To repeat, Protagoras begins by insisting that great courage can go together with great ignorance, but he subsequently traces the noble character of courage, understood as a virtue, to precisely its being guided by knowledge; and then again, in response to Socrates' suggestion that “wisdom would be courage,” Protagoras appears to separate courage from boldness entirely and to trace the source of boldness to (among other things) knowledge,1 whereas courage he traces, not now to knowledge, but to nature and the proper rearing of souls (Weiss 1985, 19). Protagoras, it seems, uses “courage” ambiguously, in both a political and a private sense: courage is that habituation, achieved through the training of the body, meant to ensure that citizens never act as cowards in war and hence in service to the city, as Protagoras had noted in his description of the political “education” (326b6‐c3);1 and it is that steadiness or toughness, the product of both nature and the proper training of the soul (351a5‐b2), needed to benefit oneself in certain situations. It is true that neither conception of courage can be said to be knowledge strictly speaking, but the latter is at least in service of knowledge: those who know the truth about justice and the gods, for example, must also be courageous enough to act on that knowledge or to live their lives in accord with it. Protagoras surely understands himself to possess some such courage as this, for he enters large foreign cities to teach the young there, an act at once very risky, as he stresses, and very much to his advantage if successful (316c5‐d3; Meno 91d2‐4).         "
"20","For a reason that becomes clear only gradually, Socrates shifts direction by taking up the question of whether pleasure is the good. He prompts Protagoras to agree that to live with distress and pain would not be to live well, but Protagoras does not agree that to live pleasantly is to live well: that is so, he suggests, only if one “should live his life by taking pleasures in the noble things” (tois kalois g': 351c1‐2). Protagoras, then, is no hedonist. At any rate he is unwilling to admit publicly that he is one (note the mention of what is “safer” in his response: 351d3). Whether sincere or calculated, his stated position compels him to recognize a distinction between noble and base pleasures, which is to say that he here recognizes nobility as a standard higher than pleasure. Now, if Protagoras is to be consistent with his just‐stated view of the nobility of courage, he should mean by “noble things” no more than the good or advantageous: just as the nobility of courage stems from its knowledgeable use in order to benefit oneself under certain circumstances, so the nobility of the noble pleasures should stem from their being conducive to one's own good. Evidently assuming such consistency on the part of Protagoras, Socrates immediately equates the noble things with the good and the shameful things with the bad, for he does not ask whether Protagoras calls some pleasant things ignoble and some painful things noble, as one might expect given Protagoras' statement, but rather whether he calls “some pleasant things bad and some distressing things good” (351c2‐3, emphasis added). Protagoras refuses to state flatly that all pleasures are good or that pleasure itself is the good; he contends, rather, that there are some bad or harmful pleasures and some good or beneficial pains, a view characteristic of the many according to Socrates: Protagoras and the many are united in their rejection of hedonism or in their shared conviction that only noble pleasures are good (consider also 352b2, where Socrates again attributes to him the view of the many on this score). Still, Protagoras, in contrast to the many, need not mean by “noble” here anything other than the (truly) advantageous.         "
"21","The disagreement between Socrates and Protagoras concerning hedonism is momentarily abandoned when the two join forces to criticize the many for their view that it is not so much knowledge that rules us and determines our actions as it is the passions—spirited anger, pleasure, pain, erotic love, fear. Yet as Socrates explicitly indicates (351e3‐352a1 and following), the purpose of investigating this latter question concerning knowledge is to make clear that pleasure is the good, i.e., to overturn the view that Protagoras appears to hold in common with the many. We will be able to determine the connection between the two arguments, that knowledge determines our actions and that pleasure is the good, only by first setting forth Socrates' arguments meant to establish that it is knowledge alone that determines our actions or that one who knows the good will of necessity pursue it."
"22","Socrates first argues to the many that, whatever they may claim, they are hedonists in fact because they are unable to state any end of their actions other than the attainment of long‐term pleasure or the avoidance of long‐term pain (352e5‐354e2). Indeed, Socrates asks repeatedly whether the many could state any other end that governs them (353c9‐353e1; 354a3‐c3; 354c3‐e2; 355a1‐5), on each occasion insisting that they could not. Second, according to Socrates, to be “overcome by oneself”—to give in to temptation, as we might say—is nothing other than to make a mistake in one's calculations concerning pleasure and pain; Socrates insists, in other words, that this failing is a purely intellectual one (354e3‐356c3). Finally, Socrates proposes, as a remedy sufficient to correct this failing, a scientific “art of measuring” that would precisely determine the means to maximize pleasure and minimize pain throughout life and so “save” or “preserve” it (356c4‐357e8).1"
"23","Two difficulties with Socrates' argument deserve mention. First, Socrates' purely intellectual account of weakness does not seem to fit the facts in every respect. Is it not the case that some human beings are by nature unable to withstand the pull of certain immediate pleasures, or the repulsive force of certain pains, whatever their intellect may tell them? Do not some know that it is better (or more productive of pleasure in the long run) to visit the doctor regularly than to fail to do so, for example, but are nonetheless unable to bring themselves to do it? Socrates here dismisses out of hand the possibility of such underlying weakness. Second, is it true that the many could not state an end of their actions, or at least of some of them, other than pleasure? For the experience of being overcome (“giving in to temptation”) amounts to pursuing, for the sake of the advantage or pleasure involved, an action that appears both advantageous or pleasant and shameful, just as resisting temptation is to refuse to pursue such an action in order to be noble or to avoid shame. It is then the nobility of an action that is (also) of concern to us, that is the end of (some of) our actions—as both Protagoras and Socrates have already indicated (351c1‐3). In persistently arguing that the many make mistakes merely in calculating their own long‐term pleasure, rather than in weighing the pleasant or advantageous against what is noble, Socrates seems intent on stripping their view of its concern for nobility, of its “moral” character.1"
"24","We may now make a tentative suggestion as to a possible connection between hedonism, which Protagoras rejects, and the view that those who know the good necessarily seek it out, which he accepts. It is helpful to begin by returning to the view, stated by Socrates in his explication of the thought of Simonides in particular and “all” the wise in general, according to which being deprived of knowledge alone constitutes bad action or faring badly and hence (one may infer) acquiring or retaining knowledge alone constitutes good action or faring well (345b5 and context). The possession of knowledge, i.e., wisdom, is thus the proper end of human life, and this end makes possible a clear calculus, an art of measuring, by which to live: all that contributes to wisdom is virtue, all that detracts from it vice. But as we have already noted, the wise also refuse to blame anyone for any shameful or bad deed; evidently they cannot discern in the world the necessary supports of what might be called moral desert. Moreover, Socrates also sketches in the same context a world without “providence”: the good necessarily decline at the hands of illness, toil, and time, and neither gods nor knowledge protects them from these in the end. Such convictions of the wise, whatever their ultimate basis, would require of those who come to hold them considerable fortitude or toughness, a kind of courage (among of course other qualities). For if knowledge is indeed the good we seek, as the wise contend, there can be no guarantee that the world revealed by our seeking will support our every hope concerning it. If knowledge about the most important things comes at the price of our initial and perhaps dearest expectations of the world, it would to that extent be profoundly unpleasant or painful and hence would require some capacity in addition to a great intellect not only to grasp it but to live in accord with it. Those who cannot endure such pain would then cling with greater tenacity to opinions that act as a salve for it or prophylactic against it, opinions of the kind that Socrates obscures or abstracts from in his presentation of the many. And so—to return now to the question of hedonism in its relation to the power of knowledge—the toughness indicated would be unnecessary only if pleasure is the good and knowledge or wisdom is a pleasure untainted by pain: no particular toughness would be required to seek out, attain, and act in accord with knowledge so understood because it would be by definition pleasing to us.         "
"25","The purpose of these complex passages is not to establish the truth of hedonism, a doctrine Socrates elsewhere criticizes. Indeed, Socrates proves at most that the opinions of the many are confused: on the one hand they deny that pleasure is the good (351c3), deferring instead to what is noble; on the other hand they assert that pleasure is the good.1 The purpose of these passages is rather to make clear that, his manifest contempt for them notwithstanding (317a4‐5; 352e3‐4; 353a7‐8), Protagoras is as confused as the many; we understand now why Socrates had indicated in this context that he was about to reveal a further aspect of Protagoras' thought (352a8‐b1). For the reason indicated, Protagoras should maintain that the good is pleasure, if he wishes to maintain also that knowledge alone is sufficient to guide us aright. That he resists hedonism may mean in the context that he is insufficiently aware of the cost we may incur in pursuing the good that is wisdom or understanding, for he in effect assumes that the good has the character of the pleasant, which requires no special fortitude to pursue, even as he refuses to profess to being a hedonist. Put another way, Protagoras underestimates the importance of, and himself may lack, the steadiness or toughness needed in every case to follow the dictates of knowledge. And because he does not abandon his lofty view of knowledge (352c8‐d3), he is compelled in the sequel to accept or at least relent to a version of hedonism. This proves to be an element of his undoing.         "
"26","Socrates prepares to examine Protagoras by first opening up the conversation to include the others present (358a1‐359a1; compare 314b7‐8), and he establishes the following theses, with the aid of all or most of those present (compare sunedokei at 358b6 with the more inclusive agreements at 358b2‐3, c6, d4, and 359a1; Socrates makes explicit his own agreement only at 358d4): all actions conducive to living pleasantly and free of pain are noble, and a noble deed is as such both good and advantageous. Moreover, only ignorance, or having a false opinion about the most important things, is responsible for our errors in choosing better from worse, since no one willingly advances toward or does things he supposes to be bad. No one, that is, who either knows or supposes that other things are better than those that he does, then does the inferior things. And since being afraid of something is to expect something bad or harmful from it, no one willingly advances toward that which he is afraid of, if it is possible not to do so.         "
"27","Socrates now trains his sights on Protagoras (359a2 and following). Since it has just been shown to be impossible, given human nature, for human beings to advance willingly toward things they are frightened of, the courageous as much as the cowards must advance toward things they are confident (bold) about, that is, toward things from which they expect to gain some benefit: the courageous man enters battle because he believes doing so to be noble, hence good—hence pleasant (360a1‐3)! In this way Socrates does everything in his power to link courage with knowledge or wisdom—the knowledge of what is advantageous for oneself—and so to strip courage of that which most elicits our admiration of it, its noble (self‐sacrificing) character. That the good is here identified with the pleasant only furthers this goal, for the pleasure‐seeking courageous differ from the pleasure‐seeking cowards merely in their divergent opinions as to what is good and hence pleasant. Courage is now nothing other than knowledge of what is truly frightening or terrible, cowardice the ignorance of it, and this means either that the courageous will enter battle because they know there to be nothing truly frightening in doing so—and hence there to be nothing truly heroic in so acting, as with the highly skilled divers, cavalrymen, and light‐shieldsmen earlier; or that the courageous will know that it is indeed frightening to enter battle and so will do the only sensible thing in the face of such harmful terrors: flee them. It is these consequences of the proposition that virtue is knowledge, or more precisely of the reduction of courage to knowledge, that Protagoras cannot finally stomach, for he too is moved by the willingness of the courageous to enter battle, come what may for themselves (359e1‐4)."
"28","What Protagoras seeks to exploit in the case of justice, then, he admires in the case of courage, namely the willingness to sacrifice oneself for the sake of a good other and greater than one's own. Protagoras too, it turns out, admires a nobility not reducible to one's own good, to say nothing of one's own pleasure. This admiration is in harmony with the sensitivity to shame he has exhibited in the dialogue, especially such sensitivity as prompts him to continue a conversation the progress of which he surely, and rightly, suspects will harm him (348c1; consider also 333c1). And earlier in the conversation (332c3‐6), Socrates had unobtrusively brought out Protagoras' conviction, as further evidence of a general conclusion that had already been established clearly enough (332c1‐3), that there is only one contrary of the noble (namely the shameful) and only one of the good (namely the bad). But to agree to this is to hold that the noble and the good are distinct from one another, not that the noble is reducible to the good as Protagoras had maintained in his first discussion of courage. And although the separation of the noble from the good may have a nasty implication, to the effect that nobility is bad (“it is bad to be noble”), it may also mean that nobility is higher than any merely personal good and hence amounts to one vital aspect of what might be called the moral view: morality seems to demand that we sometimes choose to do what is noble whether or not we benefit ourselves thereby. To summarize, Protagoras had recourse in his initial discussion of courage to a nobility reducible to the good for oneself, and he subsequently reaffirms his view that “all noble actions” are as such “good” (359e5‐8); but Protagoras has shown himself to be unable to stick to this view of nobility because he has shown himself to believe that some things are noble and hence choiceworthy despite the fact that—or precisely if—they are bad or disadvantageous for oneself. Protagoras has thus shown himself to be confused.         "
"29","Toward the end of the Protagoras, Socrates notes that a strange inversion has taken place. For whereas Socrates had begun his examination of Protagoras by stating that he himself did not hold virtue to be teachable, he notes now that he has been arguing that virtue is knowledge and therefore teachable; and just as Protagoras had begun by contending that virtue is indeed teachable, so now at the end of the conversation he resists Socrates' attempt to link courage with knowledge and hence to imply, at least, its teachable character (361a3‐d6). To account for this peculiarity, one must track the different meanings of “virtue” in the dialogue: “virtue” first comes to sight as justice, piety, and moderation—all virtues conducive to political life and instilled in us by nursemaid, mother, father, teachers, and, as their ultimate guide, the laws themselves. What Protagoras offers his students instead is indicated by his unexpected expansion of virtue to include courage and wisdom, wisdom being the greatest of the virtues. According to Protagoras, moral or political virtue can be beaten into one but it cannot be taught strictly speaking, whereas courage and wisdom can be taught because they are rational or consist in knowledge, in the knowledge of the priority of the good for oneself (or the foolish character of justice) together with the necessary strength of soul both to see through the conventional virtues and to act accordingly. Protagoras thus admires those who, through the right combination of toughness and understanding, seek and attain their own good in the face of what family, friends, city, and gods say. But, as we have seen, he himself lacks such a combination of qualities; his knowledge of what is good does not consistently determine his actions because he lacks the “courage of his convictions.” In particular, he cannot consistently stick to the reduction of the noble to the good that the admiration indicated implies; or, he admires also those who are willing to sacrifice themselves, if not in the name of justice then in the name of courage. And being confused on this point, he could hardly bring his students to clarity concerning it.         "
"30","One might say that the Protagoras both diminishes the differences between philosopher and sophist (314d3) and sharpens those that remain: like Protagoras, Socrates holds the initial education we receive not to be an education properly speaking (p. 615 above) for his denial of the teachability of virtue pertains only to “the political art” and to political virtue strictly construed, not to virtue understood as knowledge (of the good). The chief difference between the two comes to sight when one considers Socrates' failed attempt to persuade Protagoras of the unity of the virtues as aspects of knowledge, a proposition to which Protagoras relents rather than agrees (360d8‐e5). The subordination of the virtues, or most of them,1 to knowledge seems to bring with it the consequence to which Protagoras objects so strongly (see also Meno 87e5‐89a5 for a comparable reaction). In order to agree to it, then, one would have to be free of the confusion characteristic of even Protagoras, who (to repeat) understands himself to seek only his own advantage but in fact also admires those who sacrifice theirs. Socrates is surely free of this confusion. But because a full account of the consequences of this freedom goes beyond the present reading of the Protagoras, it must suffice to note that, in reporting his conversation with Protagoras, Socrates permits us to put ourselves to the same tests to which he subjects Protagoras and so to begin to understand our own concern for virtue—a service that, being carried out without expectation of payment, makes clear both Socrates' relative indifference to lucre and the generosity that is compatible with the pursuit of true virtue.
