"1","As noted at the outset, political theorists agree that certain fundamental human interests ought to be universally protected. However, they disagree about the conditions under which these interests give rise to rights, such that their protection becomes a stringent matter of justice. One account of such conditions is offered by what I call the “agent‐based view.” On this view, whether a duty counts as one of justice depends, crucially, on the actual position of the duty bearer. This view, defended most famously byKant ([1797] 1991)9 andMill ([1863] 1998, chap. 5) and more recently by O’Neill (1996, chap. 5) and Meckled‐Garcia (2008), holds that “perfection” is a necessary condition for a duty to count as one of justice.10"
"2","                        "
"3","The agent‐based view: An agent is under a duty of justice only if the duty is perfect, i.e., its content and mode of performance are fully specified.               "
"4","When duties are perfect, duty bearers have no discretion in establishing the content of the duty and how it should be fulfilled: what they ought to do is determined with “mathematical exactitude” (Kant [1797] 1991, 6: 233). Unless duties of justice are mathematically precise, it is said, their recipients cannot have rights to their performance. For an agent A to have a right to X, there must be another agent B, with a duty to provide A with X, or to respect A's X (Raz 1986, chap. 7). But without a clear account of who B is, and what X amounts to, A cannot be said to have a right to X. Indeed, A does not know what the content of her right is and from whom she may claim its fulfillment.         "
"5","A few duties are perfect by their very nature. For instance, the content of the duty not to kill or assault is arguably clear, as it is clear that it is owed to each and every person, by each and every person. But since many other duties are not “precise” in this way, to qualify as duties of justice they need to be “made perfect” through institutional allocation (cf. Buchanan 1987, 570). For instance, we may all have duties to provide resources to the needy, but such duties cannot be regarded as duties of justice until institutions tell us who exactly ought to provide what for whom. Until then, there cannot be rights to resources because the corresponding duties remain indeterminate: there is no clearly identified agent who could violate them. Rights without duty bearers, proponents of the agent‐based view complain, are empty rhetoric (O’Neill 1996, 132–33; see also O’Neill 2000, chap. 6).         "
"6","On this view, institutions that precisely establish the bearers and content of duties of justice are a necessary existence condition of many of those duties. As O’Neill says, many rights, especially positive ones to goods and services, “presuppose institutional arrangements” (1996, 131, original emphasis) because without such arrangements, we cannot know who ought to do what towards the fulfillment of those rights. Is this a plausible view? It is not, because it gets the relation between justice and just institutions the wrong way round (see Ashford 2006, 2007, 2009; Tasioulas 2007).11 Institutions are best seen as vehicles for discharging duties of justice that already exist rather than as necessary conditions for their existence.         "
"7","Consider the following analogy. It makes perfect sense to say that the victim of a car accident is entitled to compensation from those responsible for it, even before they (or a court) establish exactly how much each one owes, i.e., even before they are each bearers of perfect duties. To be sure, we can easily identify the offenders as violators of the perfect duty to not harm, but in the absence of institutional allocation (or coordination), we cannot tell who exactly owes what to the victim. But is this sufficient to claim that the victim has no right to compensation? Clearly not. If the culprits fail to coordinate and give the victim what she is owed, we can criticize them for violating the victim's rights. It would be extremely counterintuitive to claim that, if those who have caused the accident (or indeed judges) fail to determine how to allocate responsibility, the victim has no right against them. As this example shows, precise allocation is necessary to discharge preexisting duties of justice; whether such duties exist or not rests on independent moral considerations.         "
"8","Similarly, whether the privileged of the world have duties of justice to relieve the plight of those in need (Haitians, New Zealanders, etc.) has nothing to do with whether such duties are perfect (precisely allocated via institutions) but rests on independent moral considerations. Precise institutional allocation only matters for the fulfillment of such duties, not for their existence. Otherwise, mere failures of coordination—when coordination is in fact possible—would suffice to free us from justice‐based obligations and deprive recipients of their entitlements, which seems absurd.         "
"9","To conclude, the agent‐based view is excessively status‐quo biased insofar as it takes de facto coordination and institutional allocation to be an existence condition of positive duties of justice. It conflates moral rights with de facto recognized ones, thereby reaching implausible conclusions."
"10","The recipient‐based view holds that all human beings have certain fundamental rights—including rights to material resources—solely by virtue of their humanity. This approach, recently defended by Sen (2004) and Caney (2007), is recipient‐based in that it defines (some) rights exclusively by reference to those human interests that ought to be universally fulfilled, such as life, bodily integrity, nutrition, shelter, sanitation, and so forth. From this perspective, Haitians, New Zealanders, and Japanese people whose fundamental interests have suffered a setback as a consequence of the relevant earthquakes are all entitled (i.e., have a right) to assistance.         "
"11","Although elegant and parsimonious, this view is also incomplete. This is because for any given right there must also be a duty. As proponents of the agent‐based view emphasize, rights without corresponding duties are empty rhetoric. How, then, do advocates of the recipient‐based approach seek to allocate the duties correlative to universal rights? Even though they say relatively little about this, we can envisage a number of alternative allocation principles compatible with their outlook.12 Each of these allocation principles corresponds to a particular account of the sufficient existence conditions of duties of justice.13"
"12","                        "
"13","Account 1: An agent is under a duty of justice if there are basic human interests to be fulfilled and she has the ability to fulfill them up to the level of marginal utility.14"
"14","On this view, a version of which has been famously defended by Singer (1972), each person has a duty always to act so as to promote the fulfillment of persons’ basic interests worldwide, so long as doing so does not undermine her own fundamental interests. Despite its simplicity, this solution is known to be problematically overdemanding (see Miller 2004; cf. Scheffler 1994). To ask people always to act so as to maximize interest‐fulfillment is to deprive them of a space within which to advance their own goals. A theory of justice denying agents the right to pursue their own projects is one that undermines the values it is meant to affirm.         "
"15","In response to this worry, recipient‐based theorists might focus on institutions as the most appropriate means of discharging the duties correlative to universal rights. Once institutional arrangements have been established, so the argument goes, people need no longer worry about rights fulfillment: institutions will take care of it (cf. Shue 1988 and Goodin 1985, 1988). In contrast to the agent‐based view, here, institutions are not existence conditions of duties of justice, but instrumental to their realization.         "
"16","Unfortunately, this solution is also susceptible to the overdemandingness charge. Considering how much institution building would be required to fulfill universal rights, people in the current generation would have to devote their entire lives to the construction of just global institutions, thereby neglecting their own projects."
"17","One might object that the costs of just institution building are so prohibitive only due to partial compliance. If everyone did their fair share, the costs of bringing about greater justice would be bearable.15 This leads us to a second possible account of the sufficient existence conditions of duties of justice.         "
"18","                        "
"19","Account 2: An agent is under a duty of justice if there are basic human interests to be fulfilled and she has the ability to do her fair share in fulfilling them.               "
"20","This option appeals to a principle like the following: your duties of justice always correspond to what your fair share would be, assuming full compliance (see Murphy 2000). This agent‐centered principle sits uncomfortably with a recipient‐based approach to justice. According to this principle, if the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain were equally well placed to address Haiti's (or some other country's) plight,16 and Haiti needed at least 10 billion dollars' worth of aid, each of these countries would have a duty of justice to invest 2 billion dollars in relief operations. If Italy and Spain failed to honor this duty, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom would still have a duty of justice to invest only 2 billion dollars each—which, ex hypothesi, would not be enough to address Haiti's plight—even if they could all easily invest more than that (for discussion of these kinds of cases, see Miller 2011; cf. Frankfurt 1987). This way of looking at things is clearly unacceptable from the perspective of a recipient‐based view, which means that Account 2 fails to provide a viable response to the difficulties with Account 1. How, then, can the advocates of a recipient‐based view escape the overdemandingness charge?         "
"21","A third suggestion is to place limits on “the amount that one may permissibly require of individuals” (Caney 2007, 296; see also Sen 2004, 339). On this “cost‐sensitive” version of the recipient‐based approach, the sufficient existence conditions of duties of justice can be defined as follows:         "
"22","                        "
"23","Account 3: An agent is under a duty of justice if there are basic human interests to be fulfilled and she can fulfill them at reasonable costs.               "
"24","Although appealing, this proposal robs rights and justice of much of their normative force. Consider a right to adequate nutrition. On the cost‐sensitive view, to say that there is such a right is to say that we have a stringent duty of justice to help fulfill this right up to a certain cost threshold, and no such duty above the threshold. If it turned out that the cost threshold would be met before the right is fulfilled, how could we say that there is a right to adequate nutrition in the first place, given that no one would be morally bound by a duty to provide adequate nutrition? We need to calculate costs and allocate duties before proclaiming the existence of rights strictly understood (Raz 1986, chaps. 7 and 8).17 The recipient‐based approach fails to do this, thus potentially turning talk of rights into empty rhetoric, as feared by proponents of the agent‐based view (O’Neill 1996, 133).         "
"25","What I call the “mixed view,” recently defended by Miller (2007), tries to bring together considerations about the moral position (i.e., the responsibility) of the agent and that of the recipient in defining what counts as a duty of justice. On this view, the sufficient existence conditions of duties of justice, as opposed to duties of charity, can be stated as follows:18"
"26","                        "
"27","The mixed view: an agent is under a duty of justice if she has the ability to meet basic needs and no one else, including the recipient, is responsible for bringing about the recipient's plight; if they are, they bear duties of justice (see Miller 2007, 47–48, 254–59).               "
"28","To illustrate how this account can be applied to specific cases, Miller offers a series of examples involving a needy society, call it “N,” such as Haiti, New Zealand, or Japan:"
"29","                        "
"30","Scenario 1. N is destitute due to its imprudent policies. In Miller's view, other bystander societies—call them “S” for brevity—have a duty of charity to assist N (Miller 2007, 258).               "
"31","                        "
"32","Scenario 2. N is destitute due to a natural catastrophe. In Miller's view, S have a duty of justice to assist N (Miller 2007, 254).               "
"33","                        "
"34","Scenario 3. N is destitute due to A's rapacious behavior. In this case, Miller says, A has a duty of justice to remedy N's situation, while S have a duty of charity to do so (Miller 2007, 257–58).               "
"35","Following Miller, we would have to conclude that Haiti, Japan, and New Zealand are all entitled to assistance on grounds of justice, insofar as their situation is analogous to Scenario 2."
"36","Is the view behind this conclusion plausible? Even though Miller's responsibility‐sensitive strategy points in the right direction, the rationale underpinning it appears excessively ad hoc. His attempt to be sensitive to the moral position of the duty bearer as well as to that of the recipient leads to an unfortunate lack of consistency."
"37","For instance, the different treatment of Scenarios 1 and 2 is meant to reflect the different moral position of the recipient of duties of aid: in Scenario 1, N is responsible for its plight, while in Scenario 2 it is not. However, it is unclear why this should make any difference to the nature of S's duties, given that their moral position remains unchanged. In both scenarios, S are simply bystanders who can help N at reasonable costs. If so, why should their duties be a matter of charity in Scenario 1, but of justice in Scenario 2?         "
"38","By the same token, there seems to be no principled reason why a society's duty towards N should remain of the same kind when it is responsible for causing N's plight (A in Scenario 3) and when such a plight has been caused by a natural catastrophe (Scenario 2). Surely, if I have intentionally or negligently harmed you, you have a right to compensation against me in particular, and I have a stringent duty of justice to rectify the harm caused. But why would my duty be of the same kind when I have nothing to do with your plight? The former example seems to involve a stringent duty of justice, while the latter a less stringent, but still important, duty of charity.19"
"39","Finally, Miller claims that S's duty towards N changes depending on whether N's plight has been caused by a natural catastrophe (Scenario 2) or whether it has been caused by an agent—be it some other society (Scenario 3) or N itself (Scenario 1). Yet, it seems more consistent to say that S's duty is one of charity across all three cases. If Charles is hanging off a cliff and I can rescue him at reasonable cost to myself, why should my duty towards him change depending on whether he has accidentally slipped off the cliff, has been pushed by John, or has deliberately taken a risk?20 In all three cases, I have a duty to help him because he is in difficulty, independently of other people's (and his own) responsibilities.21 Indeed, my moral position with respect to Charles does not depend on the cause of his current difficulties—unless, of course, I have brought them about. So long as I am a bystander and can help at reasonable costs, I have a duty of charity to do so.         "
"40","In sum, while Miller seems right in making responsibility central to the distinction between justice and charity, his attempt to balance agent‐based and recipient‐based considerations lacks systematicity and leads to counterintuitive conclusions. As our discussion of his scenarios shows, our judgments about justice versus charity seem to track the moral position of the duty bearer alone, independently of that of the recipient. Specifically, duties of justice appear to be triggered whenever the agency of the duty bearer contributes to bringing about the recipient's predicament (e.g., A in Scenario 3), but not otherwise (S in Scenarios 1 and 2). In the next section, I argue that we can use this insight to construct a more plausible and systematic account of the existence conditions of duties of justice.         "
"41","On what I call the “autonomy” view, the necessary and sufficient existence conditions of duties of justice can be stated as follows.         "
"42","                        "
"43","The autonomy view: An agent is under a duty of justice if and only if she has the ability to refrain from undermining the necessary conditions for others to lead autonomous lives (“autonomy conditions”).               "
"44","On the autonomy view, each person has a right not to be deprived of the social conditions to lead an autonomous life, and duties of justice are correlative to such a right. Since bad luck and others’ failure to abide by duties of justice may undermine persons’ autonomy conditions, morality also demands that we come to their aid when we can do so at reasonable costs: these demands correspond to duties of charity. As I have suggested elsewhere, duties of justice and duties of charity can be helpfully seen as implications of the fundamental demand of equal respect (Valentini 2011b, 180–81).22 On this view, to respect persons qua autonomous agents, we ought to both refrain from undermining their autonomy conditions and help them when we can do so without too much sacrifice. The greater stringency of duties of justice with respect to duties of charity is explained by the greater involvement of our agency in others’ predicament.23 We have a duty of justice to assist others—i.e., we owe them assistance—if we are responsible for their plight by having undermined their autonomy conditions (or are bound by special relations to assist them—a case which, as I said in the introduction, I do not consider in the present article).24 By contrast, if our agency is not involved in their plight, we have duties of charity to help them at reasonable costs.         "
"45","This proposed formulation of the existence conditions of justice (and charity) is very broad, and a lot hinges on how exactly we interpret each of its component parts. In particular, to determine what justice exactly requires, we need an account of (1) the notion of autonomy conditions and (2) the circumstances under which a person has the ability to refrain from undermining such conditions. In what follows, I discuss each of them in turn and then (3) explain what my view shares with, and how it differs from, competing outlooks on justice.         "
"46","What conditions have to be met for a person to be able to lead an autonomous life? A person's ability to pursue her ends and goals clearly depends on her mental and physical health as well as on the resources available to her (cf. Raz 1986, chap. 14). While, in specific cases, one's mental and physical health may be independent of social factors (think about genetically caused disabilities), a person's capacity for autonomy is generally dependent on the social conditions in which she finds herself. The social goods a person commands—including liberties, wealth, opportunities, services, and so forth.—are crucial determinants of her ability to lead an autonomous life. But how should such goods be distributed for each person to be in a position to pursue her ends and goals, i.e., for each to enjoy the autonomy conditions? There are at least two broad answers to this question (cf. Valentini 2011b, 173–78).            "
"47","First, on a sufficientarian account of the autonomy conditions, a person is in a position to lead an autonomous life if, and only if, she has “enough” goods or resources, such as access to nutrition, shelter, health care, sanitation, and a decent set of opportunities. From the perspective of this account, the fact that other people within my social context have access to better opportunities than me, or have more material resources with which to pursue their life plans, has no impact on my own ability to pursue my ends and goals. On this view, Bill Gates and a reasonably well‐paid shop assistant both enjoy the autonomy conditions.            "
"48","Second, on egalitarian or relational accounts of the autonomy conditions, a person's ability to pursue her ends and goals crucially depends on how other people are faring, beyond a sufficiency threshold. There are at least two versions of this view. One ties social inequalities to self‐respect and claims that the socially disadvantaged lack the necessary self‐respect to act as fully autonomous agents (Rawls 1971). The other holds that inequalities ought to be limited because they are conducive to relationships of social dependence. In the presence of steep social inequalities, so the argument goes, the more powerful are likely to dominate the less privileged and thereby to undermine their capacity for autonomy (cf. Anderson 1999; Pettit 1997).            "
"49","Of course, we can identify a vast array of positions both within and between the sufficientarian and egalitarian camps. Mapping out all the possible specifications of what it takes to be able to lead an autonomous life is a task that goes well beyond the scope of this article. In fact, that task corresponds to the elaboration of a full‐blown theory of justice. What matters is that any plausible account of such conditions will include protections for the following interests: life, bodily integrity, freedom of movement and thought, shelter, education, nutrition, sanitation, and health care. This is all we need to assume for present purposes (cf. Griffin 2008).            "
"50","What does it take for someone to have the ability to refrain from undermining others’ autonomy? Two conditions, I argue, have to be met: the foreseeability condition and the control condition.25"
"51","                              "
"52","Foreseeability condition: Agents must be able to anticipate the effects of their actions.                  "
"53","If I cannot anticipate whether my actions are going to undermine your ability to lead an autonomous life, I cannot make sure that they won’t. This means that, even if I do undermine it, I do not violate any duty. For example, I can be causally responsible for harming you—say because I have given you food to which you are allergic—without being morally responsible for it—because I could not have known about your allergy. In this case, I harm you, but I do not wrong you: I do not violate any duty. My moral (as opposed to physical) agency is not genuinely involved in causing this harm. From a moral point of view, then, this harm is no different from a harm caused by natural forces outside human control.            "
"54","                              "
"55","Control condition: Agents must be able to control their actions.                  "
"56","The control condition is also relatively straightforward. If “my” actions are part of a causal chain of events that result in my undermining others’ ability to lead autonomous lives, but I have no control over them, I do not violate any duties. For instance, if I suffer from an untreatable bodily spasm that often causes me involuntarily to hit people, I can be said to harm them, but not to wrong them. It is certainly bad that I hit others, but it is not a moral wrong: so long as the relevant actions are not under my control, they are not expressions of my agency."
"57","Duties of justice therefore only exist when the foreseeability and control conditions are fully satisfied. When is it plausible to assume that they are? My hypothesis is that these conditions can be fully satisfied only in societal settings. In a pure state of nature, without any coordination mechanisms, formal or de facto rules allocating entitlements to resources, and shared understandings on the basis of which resources can be intersubjectively valued,26 nobody can anticipate or control how her actions, combined with those of others, will affect persons’ ability to lead autonomous lives. In such a lawless scenario, the duty not to undermine others’ autonomy conditions would have a very restricted reach. Arguably, its demands would reduce to refraining from physically injuring others.            "
"58","This state of affairs is of course a limiting case, so removed from the circumstances of ordinary human existence to be extremely hard to picture. In fact, I suspect that our understanding of what it is to be a human agent, and to lead an autonomous life, is so bound up with our identities as social beings that coherently asking about justice against a nonsocial background is almost impossible.            "
"59","That said, we can think of different hypothetical stages of human existence along a continuum, from a pure state of nature, where the foreseeability and control conditions are satisfied only for a very minimal set of duties against physical injury, to a full‐blown (political‐legal) state. Different demands of justice will correspond to different stages along this spectrum, depending on what can be reasonably expected of people living under the relevant circumstances. The more we move away from a pure state of nature towards a social condition, the more complex the demands of the duty not to undermine others’ autonomy conditions become, because the range of what we can foresee and control expands. That is, the existence of social rules and institutions makes a difference to our duties of justice—i.e., it widens their scope—because it renders foreseeable what used to be unforeseeable, and feasible what used to be infeasible (cf. Gilabert 2009, 677).            "
"60","In a social condition, human beings (usually) have the epistemic tools to establish whether the patterns of conduct and social rules actually governing their relations are compatible with the demands of justice. They can establish whether their social organization respects each person's right to pursue her ends and goals. When it does not, namely when some people lack the necessary social conditions to lead autonomous lives, justice requires them to reform existing social rules or to coordinate to create new institutions capable of governing their interactions in accordance with justice. Without institutions explicitly designed to allocate duties and responsibilities, justice is unlikely ever to be realized. From this perspective, states, for instance, are vehicles through which individuals who recurrently interact with one another can discharge duties of justice that already apply to them (see Young 2006; cf. Ronzoni 2009 and Kant [1797] 1991).            "
"61","Even though in a social condition it is still true that no single individual can control global outcomes, different individuals have different degrees of control over them, depending on the particular place they occupy in the social structure. While in a tyrannical society the tyrant presumably bears most of the responsibility for persons’ (in)ability to lead autonomous lives, in a genuinely democratic one, such responsibilities are more evenly shared across the demos (Young 2006).            "
"62","These differences notwithstanding, the point is that to act—either directly or indirectly via social rules—in ways that result in some people lacking the necessary conditions to lead autonomous lives is to violate the demands of justice (cf. Pogge 2002). In turn, duties of justice are particularly stringent because they concern our contribution to others’ inability to pursue their ends and goals. This explains why, while we tend to regard our duties towards those who are in need through no fault of our own as a matter of charity, we think they are entitled to compensation on our part if we have contributed to causing their predicament.            "
"63","My view captures the virtues of the agent‐based, recipient‐based, and mixed views without reproducing their vices. In particular, like proponents of the agent‐based view, I have argued that certain types of social rules are a necessary existence condition of some demands of justice, insofar as they allow us to anticipate, and control, the joint consequences of our actions. I have also argued, contrary to the agent‐based view, and in line with its recipient‐based counterpart, that the presence of institutions explicitly designed to secure persons’ ability to lead autonomous lives is a necessary instrumental condition for the realization of the demands of justice (Abizadeh 2007). Moreover, like proponents of the mixed view, I take considerations about responsibility to be relevant to the distinction between justice and charity. Unlike the mixed view, however, the autonomy view does not suffer from a lack of systematicity. The way responsibility matters to it is both consistent and transparent: we have duties of justice towards others in need whenever our agency is involved in their plight, and duties of charity when it is not.            "
"64","Moreover, even though the autonomy view clearly belongs to a broad family of liberal approaches to justice developed by other scholars, it is not strictly identical to any of them, and it helps us illuminate some of their normative underpinnings. For instance, although reminiscent of Mill's harm principle and Kant's universal right to freedom, the autonomy view differs from, and improves on, these traditional liberal outlooks by rejecting the assumption that duties of justice must always be perfect (cf. the section on the agent‐based view)."
"65","In addition, thanks to its generality, the view can be seen as providing a broad schema from which prominent contemporary liberal accounts of justice can be derived as special cases. For instance, Rawls's (1971) theory of justice can be read as a domestic application of the autonomy view under an egalitarian account of the autonomy conditions. For Rawls, a society is unjust unless liberties, opportunities, income, and wealth are distributed roughly equally across citizens. When state institutions fail to meet these egalitarian standards, some citizens lack the necessary conditions to lead autonomous lives and are therefore victims of social injustice. They are wronged by their fellow citizens whose joint agency is channeled through social rules and institutions. Similarly, Pogge's (2002) approach to human rights can be seen as a global application of the autonomy view under a sufficientarian account of the autonomy conditions. For Pogge, the wealthy of the world are violating the rights of the poor by imposing a global institutional structure that causes their deprivation.            "
"66","In so saying I am not suggesting that these prominent liberal theorists would necessarily agree with this interpretation of their views.27 All I am claiming is that their views can be helpfully recast as special cases of the autonomy‐based account, thereby giving them more transparent normative foundations.            "
"67","Finally, a further advantage of the autonomy view is that it can help us answer questions about the nature of our duties of justice in the absence of formal institutional structures. While Rawls's and Pogge's theories presuppose, and can therefore only be applied to, institutional arrangements, the autonomy view enables us to reflect about justice across a wide range of circumstances, from preinstitutional to institutional. This allows the view to offer a coherent account of the double normative role of social rules and institutions: as existence conditions of some duties of justice as well as instruments to their realization. An ability to account for demands of justice when there are no institutions capable of fulfilling them appears particularly important when debating moral issues in the international context, where such institutions by and large do not exist."
"68","What are the implications of my arguments for the claim that, unlike Japan and New Zealand, Haiti is owed first and foremost justice rather than charity? All three countries have been hit by natural disasters, and from our discussion we have learned that natural disasters, per se, do not constitute injustices. The duty to help a society hit by a natural disaster is relevantly similar to the duty to rescue someone who has accidentally fallen into a lake and risks drowning. Bystanders who can help at reasonable costs certainly ought to intervene, but their duty would be one of charity, not one of justice. No relevant disanalogy would therefore seem to exist between Haiti, Japan, and New Zealand. Portions of their inhabitants find themselves in need due to natural disasters, and governments and citizens of other countries who can help at reasonable costs have a duty of charity to do so.         "
"69","This telling of the story depicts the world as an innocent bystander with respect to the plights of Haiti, New Zealand, and Japan. But there are reasons for doubting that this rendering of the facts is correct. Although these earthquakes themselves were natural events outside human control, their more‐or‐less devastating effects were, at least partly, man‐made. In Japan's case, arguably there would have been no nuclear crisis, or at least a smaller one, had the government and electricity company TEPCO adopted more cautious policies regarding nuclear energy and/or better handled the disaster (cf. Tatsumi 2011). In the case of New Zealand, had certain buildings been more robust, or had they adhered to higher safety standards, part of the tragedy could have perhaps been avoided (BBC 2011c).28 In both New Zealand and Japan, then, human agency is at least partly involved in the earthquake's catastrophic consequences, but the agents in question are, by and large, “domestic” ones. Their involvement makes no difference to the responsibility of outsiders, of the world at large.         "
"70","Haiti's case appears different. The country was already extremely poor and vulnerable prior to the earthquake, but it seems difficult to attribute responsibility for this poverty and vulnerability entirely to its own people. This is precisely what the critics of the charity‐based approach to Haiti's plight argue. They emphasize how Haiti's extreme poverty, which has made the impact of the earthquake all the more tragic (recall hundreds of thousands died), has to a good extent been the product of other states’ past aggressive conduct.29 As one critic argues, “Haiti's vulnerability to natural disasters, its food shortages, poverty, deforestation and lack of infrastructure, are not accidental. To say that it is the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere is to miss the point; Haiti, it is complained, was made poor—by France, the United States, Great Britain, other Western powers and by the IMF and the World Bank” (Kim 2010; cf. Chomsky 2004, who advances similar remarks, especially in relation to the United States, and Isaacs 2010).30"
"71","As critics emphasize, the poverty and vulnerability of Haiti are rooted in its history. After a long period spent under French colonial domination, Haitian slaves’ fight for freedom came to a successful end in 1804 (Danner 2010; Von Tunzelmann 2009). In return for its independence, however, Haiti was forced to pay an exorbitant amount in reparations to its former colonizer, France. In the process of paying these reparations, Haiti borrowed funds from Germany, France, and the United States, thereby becoming heavily indebted (Oxfam 2010). To ensure that it would repay its debt, the United States eventually occupied Haiti in 1915 and from then on continued to be involved in the country's affairs, often pursuing its own economic and strategic interests (Buschschluter 2010). By the time Haiti had finished paying its reparations (after World War II), it had become a deeply impoverished nation, plagued by political instability, poverty, and corruption.         "
"72","In more recent years, international lending institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF offered loans to Haiti, but on the condition that it would liberalize its economy. While economic liberalization can be beneficial for advanced industrialized nations, it is particularly risky for societies such as Haiti, whose economy is weak and therefore unlikely to withstand the pressures of global competition. For example, the IMF severely undermined Haiti's economy when, in 1995, it forced Haiti to open its markets to cheap (subsidized) rice from the United States, thereby preventing it from protecting its own agricultural industry (Oxfam 2008; Kim 2010; Isaacs 2010).         "
"73","Of course, there are many historical complexities that I cannot discuss in this article. But if the facts I have reported are correct, it follows that Haiti's tragedy results, at least to some extent, from a failure on the part of others to honor the duty not to undermine Haitians’ autonomy conditions. First, Haiti has been the victim of rapacious behavior on the part of other societies—France and the United States in particular.31 This behavior clearly represented a breach of duties of justice that deprived Haiti's people of the necessary social conditions to lead autonomous lives (on any plausible account of what such conditions entail).         "
"74","Second, global rules of financial and trade liberalization have been imposed upon Haiti. Given its poverty and destitution (and particularly its desperate need for financial support from the IMF and the World Bank), arguably Haiti was not in a position to subtract itself from such rules. Participation in these institutions was nonvoluntary. In fact, one might even argue that, in some sense, the very powers that control these institutions are also those that originally put Haiti into a position of dependence and vulnerability by “making it poor” (cf. Pogge's 2002, 199–204, similar but broader claims about the relationship between the global wealthy and the global poor).         "
"75","In light of this, it makes sense to say that the international community's duties towards Haiti (or at least the duties of a large portion of this community) go beyond charity: part of the devastating impact of the earthquake is the result of injustice carried out by outsiders, not by nature itself. Notwithstanding the importance of duties of charity, the autonomy view seems to vindicate the critics’ complaint. They are right to emphasize that the focus should be on what Haiti is owed, rather than on what the wealthy of the world can generously contribute to alleviating its plight. Moreover, to the extent that outsiders’ involvement in the tragedies of Japan and New Zealand is far smaller, it is also true that “the world’s” duties towards them are primarily a matter of charity.32"
"76","Of course, it is close to impossible to calculate in advance what exactly Haiti is owed by what countries (or individuals) in particular. This requires detailed factual information—which I am in no position to provide in this article—and coordination between the relevant duty bearers. But recall that, on the autonomy view (unlike on the agent‐based view), this fact is no challenge to the claim that Haitians are appropriate recipients of duties of justice. Duty bearers' current failure to put in place the institutional structures and allocation mechanisms that would allow them to fulfill their obligations and honor Haitians’ entitlements is grounds for criticizing them, not for getting them off the “justice hook.” Moreover, even if precise allocation is a complex matter, our analysis still allows us plausibly to conclude that some of the relief effort in Haiti is not a display of great generosity but a tardy and inevitably suboptimal attempt to give its people what they are owed (cf. Barry 1991).         "
"77","Many of our fellow humans often fall victim to natural catastrophes. Whenever this happens, we have duties to assist them. However, it makes a difference whether our duties are a matter of charity or a more stringent matter of justice. In this article, I have defended a particular account of the conditions under which our duties towards those in need are based on justice: “the autonomy view.” On this view, we have duties of justice towards the needy when our agency has contributed to their plight (assuming no other special relations—such as treaties of mutual help—are in place) and duties of charity when our “hands are clean” but we can still help them at reasonable costs. I have then applied this view to the cases of disaster relief in Haiti, New Zealand, and Japan and concluded that while the latter are appropriately seen as recipients of international charity, Haiti is primarily owed justice due to outsiders’ contribution to its plight."
"78","At this point, a skeptic might contest the factual claims on which this conclusion is based, suggesting that Haiti's misery is fully endogenous. Even if this claim were true, the main contribution of this article would remain unaffected by it. My aim has been to provide a standard for evaluating when our duties to assist the needy are a matter of justice as opposed to one of charity. I have shown that our answer to this question rests on a particular class of facts concerning the involvement of our agency in others’ plight. The point of the standard is not to ascertain what the facts are in any specific circumstance (this is the job of empirical research) but rather to identify what class of facts are relevant to normative assessments. My conclusions about Haiti, New Zealand, and Japan are based on what strikes me as a prima facie plausible account of the relevant facts. However, such an account can be challenged without thereby undermining the autonomy view.         "
