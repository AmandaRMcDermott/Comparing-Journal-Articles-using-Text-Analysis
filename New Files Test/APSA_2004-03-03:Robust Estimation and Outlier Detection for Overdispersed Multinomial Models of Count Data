"1","We use the overdispersed multinomial model for J≥ 2 outcome categories defined and motivated by McCullagh and Nelder (1989, 174). Let i= 1, … , n index an observed vector of J counts yi= (yi1, … , yiJ)′, and let  denote the total of the counts for observation i. Given probability pij, the expected value of yij is Eyij=mipij.

The covariance matrix for observation i is:            "
"2","To estimate the model we use robust estimators for σ2 and β: the least quartile difference (LQD) estimator (Croux, Rousseeuw, and Hossjer 1994; Rousseeuw and Croux 1993) for  and, given the estimate for σ, the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) estimator (Hampel, Rousseeuw, and Ronchetti 1981; Hampel, Ronchetti, Rousseeuw, and Stahel 1986, 160–66) for β. Here in the main text we sketch the main features of the estimation method. In the Appendix we present the further details required to use the approach with overdispersed multinomial data.         "
"3","The estimator has two key robustness properties. First, both the LQD and tanh estimators have the highest possible breakdown point for a regression model. The finite sample breakdown point of an estimator is the smallest proportion of the observations one needs to replace in order to produce estimates that are arbitrarily far from the parameter values that generated the original data (Donoho and Huber 1983). The concept of breakdown point that in a strict technical sense applies to the current estimation problem is more complicated, for instance to take into account the fact that asymptotic properties of the estimator under regularity conditions are generally of interest (Hampel et al. 1986, 96–98), but the intuition behind the more general concept remains the same: even large perturbations in a fraction of the data should not affect the estimator's performance. The LQD and tanh estimators have a breakdown point of 1/2. The nonrobust ML, AL, and the SUR estimators all have finite sample breakdown points of 1/(nJ)—asymptotically zero.         "
"4","The second important robustness property concerns the degree to which perturbations of the data affect the variability of parameter estimates. The tanh estimator is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the asymptotic variance of the estimates for a given upper bound on how sensitive the asymptotic variance is to a change in the distribution of the data (Hampel et al. 1981). The existence of such an upper bound implies that the tanh estimator has a finite rejection point, which means that an observation that has a sufficiently large residual may receive zero weight and hence not affect the parameter estimates at all. Given the value of σ, tanh estimators are by construction the most efficient possible estimators of β that may put zero weight on some observations (Hampel et al. 1986, 166).         "
"5","Under a wide range of conditions in which the data deviate to some extent from the specified model, the tanh estimator is asymptotically normal with covariance matrix given in general by the “sandwich” formula derived by Huber (1967, 231; 1981, 133) and in particular by the matrix  that we define in the Appendix. In the special case where the model is exactly correct for a majority of the data but the rest of the data are generated by some other process, the tanh estimator is consistent for the model's parameters. The fact that consistency holds when the model is correct for at least half of the data is an implication of the tanh estimator's high breakdown point. Huber (1981, 127–32) proves the general result for M‐estimators that applies in this case. In this special case the tanh estimator typically puts zero weight on the data that are generated by the alternative processes, such that two other familiar covariance matrix estimators are also expected to be correct: the inverse of a weighted Hessian matrix and the inverse of a weighted outer product of the gradient (OPG). We define those matrices in the Appendix, denoted respectively  and .         "
"6","A point of departure for our methods is the fact that given any estimated probabilities , the J residuals  for each i always sum to zero. This result follows from the fact that the multinomial model treats the sum mi of the counts for each observation i as given, so that each vector of counts yi has only J− 1 independent elements. That same feature of conditioning on the total implies that, like the counts, the simple residuals  are negatively correlated with one another. We use a formal Cholesky decomposition of the multinomial covariance matrix, which is an orthogonal decomposition method derived by Tanabe and Sagae (1992), to produce uncorrelated residuals for each observation, denoted r⊥i. By construction, the J‐th value r⊥iJ is zero, so that the first J− 1 values in r⊥i contain all the information. Dividing each of the J− 1 nonzero orthogonalized residuals by its respective standard deviation, which Tanabe and Sagae (1992) also derive, we obtain a set of normalized values, denoted , that have a normal distribution with variance σ2 if mi is sufficiently large and the model is correctly specified for all the data. This normalization adjusts for the heteroskedasticity associated with both mi and the probabilities pi.         "
"7","If the model is appropriate for only a majority of the data and the values of the model's parameters are known, then for the counts that were generated by the alternative processes, the residuals  computed using those parameters are typically large relative to the variance σ2. Ideally, information from those counts would not be used to estimate the parameters of the model that applies to most of the data. The robust estimators we use approximate that ideal behavior. For a given model specification—i.e., a set of observed counts yij, regressors xij, and linear predictor functional forms μij—the estimators find the parameter values that best characterize most of the data while downweighting information that is associated with normalized residuals that are larger than one would expect to observe in a sample of normal variates.         "
"8","Our estimator produces a vector of J− 1 weights for each observation, wi= (wi1, … , wiJ−1)′, with wij∈[0, 1]. The value 1 indicates that the tanh estimator is giving full weight to the orthogonal component of the data corresponding to , and the value 0 indicates that the estimator is completely excluding information from that component.         "
"9","Further details regarding the robust estimator are in the Appendix. To summarize briefly here, after using the formal Cholesky decomposition to reduce the multivariate robustness problem to a collection of uncorrelated problems, we use the optimizing evolutionary program called GENOUD (Sekhon and Mebane 1998) to find the LQD estimates. Then we compute the tanh parameter estimates via a weighted Newton algorithm and estimate the asymptotic covariance matrix. The use we make of the LQD and tanh estimators is novel, but we have nothing to add to the statistical understanding of those estimators per se. The statistical properties of those estimators are well established in the statistical literature, as are the properties of asymptotic covariance matrices for M‐estimators (Carroll and Ruppert 1988, 209–13; Huber 1967; White 1994), which we also apply.         "
"10","To assess the performance of the robust tanh estimator, the nonrobust ML estimator and the AL, SUR, and heteroskedastic SUR models under a range of conditions, we conduct a Monte Carlo sampling experiment using six different types of simulated data. We examine six different experimental conditions, replicating each condition 1,000 times. In each replication we generate observations consisting of four counts (J= 4) with mi= 10,000. We conduct the experiment for n= 50 and n= 100 observations. The linear predictors have the same functional form for all conditions. Each of the first J− 1 predictors includes a single, simulated regressor, denoted xi, and a constant, while the J‐th predictor is set to zero:            "
"11"," Table 1 lays out the overall design of the experiment. The first four experimental conditions all have the same linear predictors. The regressor is normally distributed with mean one and variance one. The regressor values are the same in every replication. For all the linear predictors, j= 1, … , J− 1, the coefficient parameters are βj0=−1 and βj1= 1. With this specification the expected outcome probability is approximately the same for all four categories: pi1=pi2=pi3= 0.2442 and pi4= 0.2673. Experimental condition 1 features uncontaminated multinomial data with no overdispersion, i.e., σ2= 1. Condition 2 is the same except that it includes overdispersion. We used the cluster‐sampling model (McCullagh and Nelder 1989, 174) to generate counts for which σ2= 5.5. Conditions 3 and 4 have ten percent of the data generated by a different process from the rest of the data. In condition 3, ten percent of the condition 1's observations are perturbed in such a way that the constant parameters in their linear predictors are approximately β10=−2.099 and β30=−0.489. The other four parameters are the same for all observations. Condition 4 is the same as condition 3 except with the same kind of overdispersion as in condition 2.         "
"12","Experimental conditions 5 and 6 feature ten percent contamination with skewed outcome probabilities. For ninety percent of the observations the regressors are again normally distributed with mean one and variance one, but the constant parameter values are β10=−3.5, β20=−3 and β30=−1, and β11=β21=β31= 1. The expected outcome probabilities are approximately pi1= 0.0366, pi2= 0.0603, pi3= 0.4453 and pi4= 0.4578. The remaining ten percent of the observations have regressor values that are normally distributed with a mean of −.5 and a variance of 4. The parameters for these contaminated observations are β10=β20= 0.001, β30= 2.000, β11=β21=−2.000 and β31=−1.000. The values of the regressor are constant across replications. Unlike the first four conditions, in conditions 5 and 6 the counts that are contaminated because they are generated according to different parameter values are also associated with regressors that have a different mean and variance than the regressors associated with the balance of the data. These high‐variance regressors have high leverage (Carroll and Ruppert 1988, 31–33), which means that nonrobust estimated regression lines should be induced to pass near the contaminated observations.         "
"13","For each replication we use all five models to compute estimates for the coefficient parameters. The nonrobust ML estimates use the multinomial model likelihood. In the absence of contamination, such ML estimates are consistent for the coefficient parameters whether or not there is overdispersion. For the ML estimates we compute confidence intervals using both the nonrobust inverse Hessian matrix alone and the nonrobust inverse Hessian multiplied by the usual nonrobust estimate of dispersion (McCullagh and Nelder 1989, 175). For the tanh estimates we compute confidence intervals based on the Huber‐White sandwich, the inverse weighted Hessian and the inverse OPG estimators. For the AL model we compute confidence intervals based on the estimate of the asymptotic covariance matrix computed by inverting the Hessian matrix of the model's log likelihood function. For the SUR model we use the same FGLS approach as do Tomz et al. (2002).4 For the heteroskedastic SUR model we use the covariance matrix estimate given by Jackson (2002, 54, eq. 13).5 We compute symmetric confidence intervals using ordinates of the normal distribution and standard errors computed as the square root of the diagonal of each covariance matrix estimate.         "
"14"," Table 2 summarizes the results for n= 100, pooling over all the coefficient parameters. The second column reports the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the coefficient estimates compared to the values used to generate all (conditions 1 and 2) or most (conditions 3–6) of the data. The results illustrate that the tanh estimator gives accurate point estimates even when there is contaminated data: the RMSE is small in every condition. The nonrobust ML estimator need not give accurate point estimates given contaminated data: the RMSE is small when there is no contamination or only slight contamination but very large when there is serious contamination. In particular, in experimental conditions 5 and 6 the RMSE is 1.11. The SUR and heteroskedastic SUR models give point estimates similar to the nonrobust ML estimator.6 The AL model has accurate point estimates in every condition, although the RMSE of the estimates is larger than the RMSE using the tanh estimator. Similar results (not shown) occur when n= 50.         "
"15"," Table 2 also shows that the estimated covariance matrices of the tanh estimates support confidence intervals that are approximately correct even when there is contamination. The coverage results in the table report the proportion of replications in which the nominal 90% or 95% confidence interval contains the parameter value that generated all (conditions 1 and 2) or most (conditions 3–6) of the data. With no contamination and no overdispersion (condition 1), the intervals based on the Huber‐White sandwich estimator under cover by about three (n= 100) percent (for n= 50, four percent). The intervals based on the weighted Hessian do slightly better in this condition, and the intervals based on the weighted OPG are even more accurate, under covering by one percent or less. The results with overdispersion (condition 2) are similar. In the other experimental conditions the coverage of the sandwich and weighted Hessian estimators typically improves by about one percent, while the weighted OPG intervals continue to be basically accurate. All three interval estimators have reasonably good coverage even with contaminated data.         "
"16","In contrast, Table 2 shows that nonrobust confidence intervals are essentially worthless when there is contamination. Both of the nonrobust ML interval estimators produce correct coverage when there is neither contamination nor overdispersion (condition 1). When there is overdispersion but not contamination, correct coverage occurs only when the estimator takes the dispersion into account (condition 2). Given contamination and the symmetric outcome probabilities (conditions 3 and 4), the intervals that are based on ignoring overdispersion include the target values in less than one‐third of the replications. The intervals that take overdispersion into account almost always include the target values, because the intervals are too wide. Given contamination and the asymmetric outcome probabilities (conditions 5 and 6), we have the spectacular result that the intervals (with or without the dispersion correction) never include the target parameter values. The heteroskedastic SUR model performs similarly, with slightly greater degradation at the smaller sample size. The SUR model never gives correct coverage.         "
"17"," Table 2 shows that the accurate point estimates of the AL model are not matched by accurate confidence intervals. With no contamination and no overdispersion (condition 1), the intervals under cover on average by three or four percent for n= 100 (by five or six percent for n= 50). With overdispersion (condition 2) the under coverage typically worsens by one or two percent. With contamination (conditions 3–6) coverage performance degrades further, with under coverage ranging from six to ten percent for n= 100 (from seven to twelve percent for n= 50). The detailed results for each parameter show that Table 2 understates how inaccurate the AL model's confidence intervals are. For instance in condition 1, with parameters ordered as in Table 3, for n= 100 the nominal 90% intervals have coverages 0.91, 0.81, 0.91, 0.80, 0.92, and 0.81, and nominal 95% intervals have coverages 0.95, 0.89, 0.96, 0.88, 0.96, and 0.89.         "
"18","The estimation results with contamination warrant detailed examination. Table 3 shows results for condition 3 (symmetric probabilities, 10% contamination and no overdispersion), with n= 100. We report the means and RMSEs of the estimates over replications and coverage results for the estimated confidence intervals. The tanh point estimates are accurate and the tanh intervals have good coverage for all parameters. The AL model has accurate point estimates but mostly incorrect confidence intervals. Intercept parameter intervals are correct or under cover only slightly, but intervals for the other coefficients under cover by as much as twenty percent.         "
"19","The contamination of ten percent of the data causes serious problems for the nonrobust estimators. Four of the nonrobust ML parameter estimates are biased: β10, β30, β11, and β31. The confidence interval estimates for those parameters utterly fail to cover the target values. Coverage for the estimates that ignore overdispersion ranges from zero to 0.001—overdispersion should be ignored because there is no overdispersion in this condition. Notice that the estimates for β20 and β21 lack bias, and the overdispersion‐ignoring confidence interval estimates for those parameters are accurate. These results reflect the success of our experimental manipulation, which sought to leave the estimates for these parameters undistorted. The nonrobust ML interval estimates that try to accommodate overdispersion all fail to have accurate coverage because they are too wide. The inaccuracy of the parameter estimates generates a biased—too large—estimate for the overdispersion, producing excessively large estimated standard errors. Results with the SUR and heteroskedastic SUR models are similar. Detailed results for n= 50 and condition 4 (not shown) are similar.         "
"20"," Table 4 shows detailed results for condition 5 (asymmetric probabilities, 10% contamination and no overdispersion), with n= 50. For the tanh estimator the results are similar to those for condition 3. The coverage results for the sandwich and weighted Hessian confidence intervals are slightly worse. The AL model again has accurate point estimates and incorrect confidence intervals. All the nonrobust estimates are seriously biased. Indeed, for β11 and β21 the mean nonrobust ML estimate has the opposite sign from the parameter values that generated 90 percent of the data. Interestingly, the two parameters that have incorrect signs are significantly different from zero according to confidence intervals constructed using the nonrobust ML covariance matrix. The confidence interval estimates from the nonrobust estimator utterly fail to cover the parameter values that generated 90 percent of the data: the intervals never include those values. Results with the SUR and heteroskedastic SUR models are similar. Detailed results for condition 6 (not shown) are similar.         "
"21","The tanh weights wij correctly identify the contaminated observations. For the uncontaminated observations the weights have a median of 1 over all six conditions for n= 100 (mean 0.994, standard deviation 0.043), and for n= 50 the median is also 1 (mean 0.994, standard deviation 0.041).7 For the contaminated observations, in conditions 3 through 6, the median weight is 0 for n= 100 (mean 0.029, standard deviation 0.143), and for n= 50 the median is also 0 (mean 0.039, standard deviation 0.171).8"
"22","To summarize, the sampling experiment shows that the robust estimator performs well under a wide variety of circumstances: with or without contamination; with or without overdispersion; with symmetric or with highly skewed choice probabilities. Even when some data are contaminated and have high leverage regressors, point estimates for coefficient parameters are accurate and precise, and confidence interval estimates are accurate. In contrast, contamination in part of the data generally destroys the nonrobust estimators. When there is contamination, the nonrobust ML estimator produces estimates that exhibit substantial bias, including incorrectly signed coefficient values. The nonrobust SUR and heteroskedastic SUR models fail similarly. The nonrobust confidence intervals are untrustworthy and useless: recall that in two experimental conditions (5 and 6) the intervals fail to cover the target parameters even one time in 1,000 replications."
"23","The AL model typically produces accurate point estimates but incorrect estimates of the sampling error and hence incorrect statistical inferences. The model fails even when there is no contamination because it ignores heteroskedasticity. The SUR model of Tomz et al. (2002) also has this defect. If the multinomial model holds, then the AL model does not satisfy a regularity condition necessary for asymptotically normal estimation (e.g., White 1994, 92, Assumption 3.2′): the counts become normal as the mi values get large, so that the true value of the multivariate‐t distribution's DF parameter goes to infinity. An indication of this occurs in the data for experimental condition 1, where for n= 100 the median estimate for the DF is 20.8, but 48 of the 1,000 estimates are greater than 106. For n= 50, the median DF is 47.4, but 109 estimates are greater than 106.         "
"24","If there is substantial contamination, then the AL model fails to produce asymptotically normal estimates because the DF value becomes too small. If DF < 2, the distribution lacks a finite variance, and if DF < 1, the distribution lacks a finite mean. In such cases ML estimates are not asymptotically normal. DF values less than 2.0 or less than 1.0 occur frequently in the experiment data. In conditions 3 through 6 for n= 100, the median DF estimates are respectively 1.2, 1.6, 0.96, and 1.1, and for n= 50 the median values are 1.2, 1.5, 0.94, and 1.1. Lange et al. (1989, 884) acknowledge that excessively small DF values may occur, observing that “the t model is not well suited to data with extreme outliers.”         "
"25","For the first example using real data we consider votes cast for president in the 2000 election in Florida. We compare the tanh estimator to the nonrobust ML estimator and the AL, SUR, and heteroskedastic SUR models. Statistical inferences based on the tanh estimator match important features of the election that the other four estimators miss. As in the sampling experiment, the point estimates for the AL and tanh are similar, but statistical inferences based on the estimators differ substantially. Also as in the experiment, differences between the tanh and the other estimators are greater. The tanh results replicate and extend the key results of Wand et al. (2001) regarding the effects of Palm Beach County's butterfly ballot.         "
"26","We judge the substantive results of the estimators in light of two key features of the 2000 presidential election in Florida. First, during 2000 Gore launched a mobilization drive throughout Florida that brought many voters into the electorate for the first time (e.g., Bonner and Barbanel 2000). About 40 percent of blacks voting in Florida in the 2000 election were new voters (Mintz and Keating 2000). This mobilization suggests that changes in Democratic registration between the 1996 and 2000 elections ought to be important for the Gore vote. Second, not only did the Elián González episode provoke an extremely negative reaction to Gore among many Cuban‐Americans, especially in Miami (e.g., Forero and Barringer 2000; Toobin 2001, 149), but Cuban‐Americans tend to be strongly Republican (Alvarez and Bedolla 2003; DeSipio 1996; Moreno 1997). For instance, while on the whole Miami‐Dade County favored Gore over Bush by 53 percent to 46 percent, in that county Bush received 75.8 percent of the two‐party vote in census tracts in which 50 percent or more of the population is Cuban‐American.9"
"27","We analyze the number of votes cast in Florida in 2000 for presidential candidates Buchanan, Nader, Gore, Bush and a residual category consisting of votes for all of the other candidates. The candidates in the residual category include Harry Browne (Libertarian), Howard Phillips (Constitution Party), John Hagelin (Natural Law Party), and any other candidate listed on the ballot as well as any write‐in candidates. We ignore undervotes (no apparent vote recorded on the ballot), overvotes (votes for more than one presidential candidate on a single ballot) and other spoiled ballots. We use all five estimators assessed in the sampling experiment to analyze county‐level data from Florida's 67 counties. Using an improved set of regressors, the tanh estimates replicate the basic findings of Wand et al. (2001) regarding the vote for Buchanan in Palm Beach County. The tanh estimates also show that having a higher proportion of Cuban‐Americans in a county produced more support for Bush than for Gore, and that increases in Democratic registration produced more votes for Gore. The other estimators fail in various ways to produce these results.         "
"28","For the county‐level model, we use linear predictors μij that are functions of presidential vote proportions in the 1996 election, changes in party registration proportions from 1996 to 2000, the proportion of the population in each county in the 2000 Census that is of Cuban national origin, and a principal component computed using the same nine demographic variables that were used in Wand et al. (2001, 796–97).10 The idea is that the vote for a party's candidate in the previous presidential election is a proxy for the interests, party sentiments and local party and other organization in each county, while the collection of demographic variables picks up changes during the intervening time period. The party registration variables for each county should provide sharper measures of the political changes than the demographics alone do, and so their inclusion represents an important substantive improvement over Wand et al. (2001). We use a principal component instead of the separate demographic variables to enhance the efficiency and interpretability of the other coefficients—the demographic variables are nearly aliased (McCullagh and Nelder 1989, 61–62) with previous vote, party registration and Cuban population.         "
"29","With J= 5, the linear predictors may be written as follows.            "
"30"," Table 5 presents the tanh estimation results, with sandwich standard errors. Votes in 2000 are significantly related to the 1996 election results for all of the candidates except Nader. Changes in voter registration between 1996 and 2000 matter for all of the candidates. The estimated effect of Democratic registration changes on votes for Gore (β32) is not significantly less than the estimated effect of Republican registration changes on votes for Bush (β42). The proportion Cuban‐American has significant effects in the linear predictors for Buchanan, Gore and Bush. For Buchanan the effect is large and negative (−5.73), while the effects are positive for the other two candidates, larger for Bush (2.75) than for Gore (2.03). The discrepancy between the estimates for Gore and Bush, which is larger than two standard errors, represents a significant tendency for Cuban‐Americans to support Bush more than Gore, net of previous voting history or current partisanship.         "
"31"," Figure 1 summarizes the results for all five models in a graphical form that facilitates comparisons across models. For each model's estimate of each coefficient, the figure plots the value of  and the usual 95% confidence interval ( times standard error). The nonrobust ML estimator's standard errors take overdispersion into account.14 The nonrobust ML, AL, SUR, and heteroskedastic SUR results differ significantly from the tanh results for several coefficients. For instance, all four estimators produce insignificant estimates for the effects of change in Democratic party registration on votes for Gore, and all four significantly underestimate the effect of Green party registration on votes for Nader. The estimate of the effect of changes in Democratic party registration is important not only because of the reported pattern of Cuban‐Americans dropping their Democratic registrations in Miami‐Dade county, but also because of the mobilization drive Gore launched in 2000 throughout Florida that brought many voters into the electoral system for the first time. The tanh estimate is the only one that supports concluding that these patterns of disenchantment and mobilization had a significant effect on the Gore vote.         "
"32","                 Five Models for 2000 Election Vote Counts, Florida Counties                      "
"33","The models convey significantly different impressions about how Cuban‐Americans voted. The tanh estimator is the only one to produce a significant effect for Cubani on votes for Buchanan. Buchanan's anti‐immigrant reputation makes the tanh estimate more plausible than the others. And the tanh estimator is the only one to support an inference that Cuban‐Americans were significantly more likely to vote for Bush than for Gore (i.e., an inference that β33≠β43). The insignificant estimated differences are dubious in light of Cuban‐Americans' pro‐Republican bias and the particular hostility toward Gore sparked by the González affair.         "
"34","The nonrobust ML estimator and the SUR model feature one estimate that appears to be significant but with the opposite sign from the tanh estimate: the effect of the principal component on votes for Bush. The AL and heteroskedastic SUR models also estimate a negative value for this parameter, but the estimates those models produce do not appear to be statistically significant and indeed fall within the tanh estimator's 95% confidence interval. The nonrobust ML estimates also have a significant sign reversal for the effect of the principal component on votes for Gore. Even though effects associated with the principal components are not readily interpretable, these results demonstrate that the pattern of sign reversals illustrated in the sampling experiment can occur in practice with real data."
"35"," Table 6 lists all the counties that contain a studentized residual of magnitude greater than 4.0, which typically implies that the corresponding count receives a weight of zero in the analysis.15 To facilitate the presentation each studentized residual is computed after permuting the categories to place the referent candidate in the first position, i.e., in Table 6 all the residuals displayed for each county are in the form  (defined in Equation (A3)). These residuals have the virtue of being readily associated with the candidates.         "
"36","The residuals reveal that to diagnose the effect Palm Beach County's butterfly ballot had on would‐be Gore voters, it is important to focus on the vote for Buchanan. In Palm Beach County the value (22.79) is large for Buchanan while the value for Gore is negative but not large. The number of votes that went to Buchanan by mistake because of the butterfly ballot is a very high proportion of the total number Buchanan received in Palm Beach County. According to Wand et al. (2001), somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 of Buchanan's 3,411 votes were mistaken would‐be Gore votes. But the number is a tiny fraction of Gore's vote total (269,732) there.         "
"37","For the second example we use the tanh estimator to reestimate Jackson's (2002) model for votes in the 1993 election for the lower House of the Polish parliament.16 For several important parameters, the tanh estimator produces sharper inferences than the heteroskedastic SUR model that Jackson (2002) used to analyze the same data.         "
"38","We estimate the form specified for the model and estimated by Jackson (2002). Votes are aggregated to the level of the Polish province, or voivodship, producing 49 voivodship observations. The total number of votes cast in each voivodship (mi) ranges from 83,840 to 1,323,540. The analysis focuses on the votes cast for six party groupings: the Democratic Union plus Liberal Democratic Congress (UD+KLD); the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD); the Polish Peasants' Party (PSL); the Union of Work (UP); a coalition of Catholic parties; and all other parties (Other). Jackson (2002) and Jackson, Klich, and Poznańska (2003) define and motivate the regressors used in the analysis: the proportion of jobs in new and small private firms; the unemployment rate; the proportion of jobs in state‐managed firms; the proportion of people attending church; mean years of schooling; mean age; the proportion of the population who are farmers; the proportion of the population living in villages. The UD+KLD is treated as the reference party, so that except for a dummy variable that indicates the home voivodship of the UD party leader, Hanna Suchocka, all coefficients are zero in this party's linear predictor. Otherwise all the regressors appear in the linear predictors for the other five parties, except that the farmers and villages variables appear only in the linear predictor for PSL. Finally in each of the linear predictors for SLD, PSL, and UP there is a dummy variable to indicate the home of the respective party leaders.         "
"39","We compare the tanh estimates to the estimates obtained using Jackson's (2002) heteroskedastic SUR model. All offects that are statistically significant with the heteroskedastic SUR model (see Jackson 2002Table 1) are also statistically significant with the tanh estimator. But reflecting the sampling experiment result that the heteroskedastic SUR model frequently produces excessively wide confidence intervals, the tanh model estimates a few effects to be significant that the heteroskedastic SUR model does not.         "
"40","Some of these differences are substantively important. In Jackson (2002, Table 1) the constant is estimated to be large but insignificant for the SLD and the PSL, two postcommunist parties (Jackson et al. 2003, 91–92). In Table 7, which reports the tanh results, the estimated constant is significant for the SLD, but it is much smaller in magnitude and not significant for the PSL. Notwithstanding their statistical insignificance, Jackson interprets the constants he estimates for the SLD and the PSL as “reflecting broad dissatisfaction with the consequences of the harsh economic reforms” (Jackson 2002, 55). The tanh estimates suggest that while such an interpretation may hold for the SLD, for the PSL vote support was more purely contingent on voivodship‐level factors. Another important difference from the heteroskedastic SUR results is the effect jobs in state‐managed firms are estimated to have on votes cast for the UP and for the Other parties. The tanh estimates are significantly positive, but the same effects are not significant in Jackson (2002, Table 1). These results do not challenge Jackson's conclusion that support for the two post‐communist parties, SLD and PSL, did not depend on employment in state‐managed enterprises (Jackson 2002, 55), but the tanh estimates suggest it would be wrong to conclude that employment in state‐managed firms had no significant effect on the election at all. That the UP's support in part depends on such employment resonates with what Jackson et al. (2003, 92) describe as the UP's opposition to privatization.         "
"41","The sampling experiment shows that the heteroskedastic SUR model usually produces reasonably good coverage results when the model is correct and there is overdispersion. The tanh estimate of  indicates a large amount of overdispersion—much larger than the value of  estimated among Florida's counties in 2000. So the differences between the tanh and heteroskedastic SUR results must trace either to there being significantly different electoral processes in some voivodships or to some other kind of model misspecification. In the Polish data there are no outliers, meaning that the tanh estimator does not completely reject any observation by giving it a weight (wij) of zero. But one observation comes close to that status. The studentized residuals , computed as in Table 6 with each party successively placed in the first position to facilitate interpretation, show a value of  for the Catholic parties in Bialystok Voivodship. The next largest value is  for the SLD in Bydgoszcz Voivodship. Given the ordering of the categories—the SLD is the first party and the Catholic parties are ordered fourth—the weights associated with these residuals are wi4= 0.30 for the Bialystok observation and wi1= 0.55 for the Bydgoszcz observation. The remaining studentized residuals are all smaller than 3.0.         "
"42","Nonrobust estimation is very likely to produce misleading results, often grossly misleading results such as seemingly significant coefficient estimates that have the wrong sign. Until recently the amount of computing required to calculate a good robust estimator was perhaps prohibitive, but nowadays the availability of cheap and plentiful computing power makes it feasible to apply robust estimation to a wide range of interesting models and data. Robust estimators with good properties have been available since at least the early 1980s for linear and generalized linear regression models (e.g., Huber 1981; Hampel et al. 1986; Stefanski, Carrol, and Ruppert 1986). Robust estimation software is available for a wide variety of models and data. Many statistical packages include redescending M‐estimators for the linear model, including R, SAS, S‐Plus, and STATA. S‐Plus offers the most comprehensive robust estimation software library, including routines for time‐series data (Martin 1981), individual‐level logistic regression (Carroll and Pederson 1993), Poisson regression (Künsch, Stefanski, and Carroll 1989) and covariance matrices (Rousseeuw and van Driessen 1999). Software for our estimator is available from the authors.         "
"43","The estimator we have introduced in this article extends robust estimation technology effectively to models for count data. The results of the sampling experiment illustrate how erroneous and misleading the results of nonrobust estimation can be. If the regressors associated with them have high leverage, a small proportion of contaminated observations can cause coefficients to be estimated with apparent statistical significance but the wrong sign. Sign reversal due to such high leverage observations is a well known phenomenon in ordinary linear regression models (e.g., Rousseeuw and Leroy 1987, 5). In such cases the residuals from a nonrobust estimation will often not be large for the contaminated observations, so that the reason for the grossly wrong results—and even the fact that the results are wrong—may be masked (e.g., Atkinson 1986). If for no other reason, robust estimation should be used to provide insurance against the seriously misleading conclusions such grossly wrong estimates may appear to support. Even when results as bad as significant sign reversals do not occur, contamination will usually make nonrobust estimates inaccurate or otherwise distort estimates of sampling error variances, leading to incorrect inferences.         "
"44","The robust estimation method we have introduced provides accurate parameter estimates and is a powerful technology for detecting irregular outcomes. Accurate parameter estimates can be produced, of course, only when the processes that generated most of the data are well approximated by the specified model. In some cases, outliers the estimator detects may be helpful in diagnosing problems with the model such as erroneously omitted variables. For instance, in the Florida data, estimating a model that omits the Cuban‐American variable results in very large studentized residuals for Miami‐Dade County, even larger than the residual found for Buchanan's vote in Palm Beach County.17 As we previously observed, with the Cuban‐American variable included, no outliers occur for Miami‐Dade County. There may be many plausible explanations for an observed anomaly. Robust estimation and outlier detection are inherently part of a strategy of triangulation. Such an approach calls for mobilizing different kinds of knowledge, data and analysis and doing many different kinds of comparisons, often at different levels of observation and analysis. Wand et al. (2001) did that for the vote for Buchanan in Palm Beach County.         "
"45","The tanh estimator is not the only approach to robust estimation with count data. For instance, the estimator developed by Victoria‐Feser and Ronchetti (1997) could possibly be augmented to allow for overdispersion. The estimator proposed by Christmann (1994), using the least median of squares (LMS), could likewise be modified for overdispersion, although the low efficiency of LMS would be a limitation.         "
"46","More work is needed to verify the estimator's performance with smaller sample sizes and with more complicated forms of contamination than we have examined here. Nonetheless we have great confidence that robust estimation using the tanh estimator is vastly superior to nonrobust estimation. Nonrobust estimation should be avoided whenever possible."
