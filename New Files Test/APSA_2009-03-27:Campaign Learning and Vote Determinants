"1","Campaigns alter the outcome of the elections and they influence the decisions of individual voters. There is little scholarly doubt about this. Macro‐level campaign research indicates that campaigns have a substantial influence on how the electorate decides (Campbell 2000; Gelman and King 1993; Holbrook 1994, 1996; Shaw 1999; Stimson 2004; Wlezien and Erikson 2002). We know from the polls that every election elicits changes in the electorate's preferences. These changes represent voters' reactions to the content of the campaign and the electorate responds relatively predictably, and much of the movement in the polls, especially the late polls, represents real shifts in the public's preferences in the election (Stimson 2004).         "
"2","These aggregate‐level analyses are merely suggestive of how these changes manifest at the individual level. We can only infer that the likelihood of any individual favoring one candidate changes over time. We do not know why. One obvious cause of these dynamics is that the attitudes of the electorate change over time and become more in line with one candidate. Across a large number of elections and data sources, the dominant conclusion is that presidential campaigns do not change voters' minds much (Finkel 1993; Markus 1982; Miller and Shanks 1982; Patterson 1980). Campaigns could also lead voters to change how they use the attitudes they have by altering the weight they apply to the determinants of vote choice. To borrow Riker's (1990) term, campaigns could work by inducing heresthetic change in voters' decisions (Carsey 2000). Looking at only the survey marginals cannot separate these two phenomena. Thus, while the macro studies show that campaigns matter, they are silent on how they matter.         "
"3","There is no shortage of available theories about how campaigns induce these heresthetic changes (Bartels 2006; Carsey 2000; Gelman and King 1993; Johnston et al. 1992; Johnston, Hagen, and Jamieson 2004). The early Columbia scholars argued that campaigns worked by activating the predispositions of voters (Berelson, Lazardsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Lazardsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1948). This notion of activation evolved into a number of different theoretical justifications for these changes: enlightenment (Gelman and King 1993), priming (Bartels 2006; Johnston et al. 1992; Johnston, Hagen, and Jamieson 2004), changes in salience (Carsey 2000), or the reduction in uncertainty (Alvarez 1998; Peterson 2004). Each theory shares the same basic function of the campaign. It provides information to the electorate, which leads voters to change how they weigh determinants of vote choice.         "
"4","Each of these theories posits a different reaction by voters to the campaign, and often the scholars present the theories as fundamentally distinct from one another. In many cases, either the early activation theory of Berelson and Lazardsfeld or the enlightenment theory of Gelman and King serve explicitly as the foil for a new theory of how campaigns work. Despite these supposed differences, all of these works share three features. First, they all share the same basic notion of how campaigns influence voters. The information the voters receive helps them sort through the different determinants of vote choice and alter the weights they apply to them."
"5","Second, when the empirical tests of campaign effects contain a dynamic component, they all share the same basic measurement of the campaign: time. Berelson, Lazardsfeld, and McPhee (1954) and Lazardsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet (1944) compare the survey marginals between social groups and vote choice in different waves in their panel. Gelman and King (1993) model the effect of predictors of vote choice as a function of the time since the beginning of the campaign. Carsey (2000) compares the coefficients between determinants of vote choice and the choice in up to seven different preelection polls. Bartels (2006) compares the strength of coefficients in the pre‐ and postelection waves of the NES. Johnston et al. (1992) compare the differences in coefficients before and after key campaign moments such as debates. Johnston, Hagen, and Jamieson (2004) describe the role of different determinants during three “phases” of the campaign and base the differences on the coefficients from models separating voters according to when the interview occurred. In short, almost all of the empirical evidence marshaled behind the heresthetic changes induced by campaigns relies on operationalizing the campaign as some function of time.         "
"6","This creates a problem sorting through the various theories. If most of the competing theories rely on the same specification, but use a different label for time, then it is impossible to develop a test that differentiates between the theories. Without superior specification and measurement, it is nearly impossible to determine which theories have more empirical support and which have less."
"7","The third shared feature of the extant work is the specification of campaign effects. The campaign is treated as a macro‐level concept where the effect of the campaign is specified as the average difference across these aggregations. When the interest is the dynamic differences in campaign effects, the effect of the determinants of vote choice is compared across time points. In the work that uses the geographic differences in campaign intensity (e.g., Kahn and Kenney 1997), voters are grouped by some geographic boundary, and the average effect in one state, for instance, is compared to the average effect in a different state. Even when the measures are more subtle than merely geography, measuring something different about the campaign across the states, the standard approach is to focus on the campaign as averaged across individuals within the units.1 These multilevel studies do show that individuals respond to macro changes in the campaign, but do not show what about the individual mediates these changes.         "
"8","This approach ignores the individual‐level differences in how people use and adapt to campaign information. Ultimately, the question of how the campaign influences voters is a question about voters. The independent variables measuring the campaign should focus on what the campaign is expected to influence in voters' minds. By focusing on the psychological mechanism behind these campaign effects, we will have a more accurate sense of how campaigns matter and can directly test the psychological mechanisms."
"9","In short, the theories outlined so far share three features. (1) Campaigns work by changing the weights applied to determinants of vote choice. (2) The strength of the coefficients on these determinants changes as a function of time. (3) These effects are shown to be the average differences across time points, but are not specified as functions of anything about the individual voters. If theory about campaign effects is to move forward, it should explain why and how campaigns create heresthetic changes in voters, provide a clear measurement strategy for the aggregate differences in campaign beyond changes in time, and be demonstrable at the level of individual voters. The next section of the article builds on theories about the role of uncertainty to do all three of these things."
"10","The work on the role of uncertainty in voter decision making theorizes that campaigns influence voters by changing the level of uncertainty voters have about the candidates. The more certain a voter becomes, the more heavily he or she weighs that attitude when voting. Campaigns alter the level of certainty voters have (Alvarez 1998; Franklin 1991) and cross‐sectional differences in uncertainty moderate the use of determinants of vote choice (Alvarez 1998; Glasgow and Alvarez 2000; Peterson 2004, 2005). In combination, this implies that campaigns should heighten the use of attitudes in vote choice insofar as they change how certain voters are about the candidates. Surprisingly, this hypothesis has not been directly tested.         "
"11","The role of uncertainty in campaigns has its motivations in both decision theoretic models (Alvarez 1998) and social psychological theory (Peterson 2004). The decision theoretic approach models the role of uncertainty through specifying voters' loss functions as probabilistic functions where the errors in perception of candidates create a discounting of attitudes based on how uncertain the individual is. The social psychological approach builds on uncertainty as one of the many types of attitude strength (Gross, Holtz, and Miller 1995; Krosnick and Petty 1995; Miller and Peterson 2004). The voluminous research on attitude strength shows that the link between one attitude and another (or a behavior like voting) is moderated by the strength of the attitude (for a review, see Krosnick and Petty 1995 or Miller and Peterson 2004).         "
"12","The concept of attitude strength developed out of the crisis of confidence in the attitudes literature in social psychology. Early work showed that attitudes rarely predicted behavior (Wicker 1969). The initial challenges to the dominant role of attitudes led scholars to refocus their research from “do attitudes predict behavior” to “which attitudes predict behavior and why.” This focus led to the idea of attitude strength. Stronger attitudes are those that persist, resist change, alter information processing, and guide behavior (Krosnick and Petty 1995; Miller and Peterson 2004). Social psychological work on uncertainty developed out of this tradition and numerous works show that certainty often moderates the use of attitudes (for examples, see Brinol et al. 2004; Gross, Holtz, and Miller 1995; Skitka and Mullen 2002).         "
"13","Both of the approaches generate the same hypothesis about campaigns. Campaigns produce heresthetic change by altering the uncertainty about the candidates. Thus, it is another explanation for the observed effects. It is also entirely consistent with the empirical evidence—as the campaign progresses, several determinants matter more because voters learn about the candidates and reduce their uncertainty. Uncertainty as the mediator of campaigns, however, can lead to both more nuanced measurement and an individual‐level specification."
"14","The first real advantage uncertainty gets us is that it can motivate a very specific measurement strategy for both the aggregate‐ and individual‐level consequences of the campaign. Campbell (1983) demonstrates the validity of using the measures of the electorate's variance to tap Shepsle (1972) and Page's (1976, 1978) conceptualization of the uncertainty about where the candidates stand. Franklin (1991) relies on the error variance in a regression model to capture voters' uncertainty. While Franklin specifies the effect of the campaign on the specific individual, the explanatory power in his model stems from the campaign‐level variables. Alvarez (1998) develops both aggregate‐ and individual‐level measures of uncertainty about the candidates based on the variance in voters' perceptions and shows that campaigns shrink the electorate's uncertainty about the candidates.         "
"15","In short, several scholars have used aggregate‐level measures of uncertainty as indicators of how much voters have learned about the candidates during the campaign. These empirical strategies provide a clear measure of how much voters are learning. If uncertainty is the mechanism behind the campaign effects captured in the time indicators in the extant work, then these aggregate‐level measures should serve as more superior measures of the campaign than time."
"16","These aggregate measures, however, are not direct measures of the theoretic mediator of campaign effects. The theory is that the campaign shapes the level of uncertainty the voters have about the candidates, and these individual‐level differences moderate how voters use their perceptions of the candidates when voting. The best empirical test of this basic hypothesis relies on the individual‐level measures of uncertainty. Thankfully, there are well‐established techniques for measuring individual‐level uncertainty about the candidates (Alvarez 1998; Miller and Peterson 2004; Peterson 2004, 2005).         "
"17","Of course, uncertainty is not the only possible psychological moderator. It is merely one of many different psychological concepts that fall under the general rubric of attitude strength, a term that also includes accessibility and importance (see Miller and Peterson 2004). Why the exclusive focus on uncertainty as the mediator of campaign effects? Miller and Peterson argue that our extant theory lacks the clarity to predict which type of strength should matter in particular circumstances. Instead, they suggest that scholars rely on empirical regularities. Uncertainty is the moderator that has been shown to most consistently matter in the realm of candidate evaluations. Visser, Krosnick, and Simmons (2003) demonstrate that uncertainty and not importance moderates the link between issues and vote choice. Similarly, Peterson (2004) shows that uncertainty is a stronger moderator than accessibility for candidate evaluations. If uncertainty matters for issue attitudes in the realm of candidate evaluations, it is likely to matter for other antecedents of evaluation as well.         "
"18","Ultimately, this is an empirical question. This article focuses exclusively on uncertainty because the data requirements do not provide a choice. Surveys with the necessary structure to test campaign effects or the necessary measures to assess multiple types of attitude strength are rare. Surveys that contain both of these do not exist. Obviously, it would be superior to be able to directly compare these rival mediators of campaign effects, but it simply is not possible."
"19","The above discussion leads to several hypotheses. The standard explanation and specification of campaign effects suggest that the link between vote determinants and vote choice should be a function of time. Hypothesis 1, therefore, is: As the campaign progresses, the link between vote determinants (partisanship, issue positions, trait perceptions, and economic perceptions) and vote choice will be stronger. This is the standard test in the extant literature and will be the starting point of the analyses that follow.         "
"20","Because time is not a nuanced measure of how voters respond to the campaign, this is not enough. Hypothesis 2 expands this by adding the aggregate level of uncertainty to the time measure: The link between the vote determinants and vote choice should be moderated by the changes in the electorate's uncertainty about the candidates.         "
"21","These hypotheses focus on how the aggregate differences affect voters. Because campaign effects are really the effect of the campaign on individual voters, the final set of tests addresses how individual‐level uncertainty mediates the campaign. The standard test for mediation (Baron and Kenny 1986) requires showing that the antecedent (the campaign) produces change in the mediator (uncertainty) and that accounting for these changes diminishes or eliminates the explanatory power of the antecedent. Thus, the third hypothesis is: Individual‐level uncertainty will be reduced as the campaign progresses. Finally, the fourth hypothesis is: The link between vote determinants and vote choice will be moderated by the individual's level of uncertainty and the aggregate‐level measures will no longer be significant moderators of the vote determinants.         "
"22","Testing for changes induced by the campaign is not an easy task. Testing these hypotheses requires measures of four things: (1) an individual's vote choice; (2) his or her partisanship, issue positions, perceptions of the candidates' character traits, and retrospections about the economy; (3) aggregate measures about the degree of uncertainty the electorate has at enough time points to have the statistical power to adequately test the hypotheses, and (4) appropriate individual‐level measures of the voters' uncertainty about the candidates. Even with proper data, however, the connection between the individual‐level determinants of vote choice and the macro‐level campaign effects creates tremendous difficulties in estimation."
"23","The only large, publicly available survey of an American presidential election that has a large number of independent cross sections at numerous times during the campaign and enough data to generate valid measures of the aggregate level of uncertainty is the 1984 CMS. The CMS contains 46 different independent cross sections each of roughly 80 respondents. Each sample is an independent, random sample of the American electorate that can be treated as representative of what the electorate is thinking at that moment in time."
"24","The unique needs of data limit this analysis to a single year. The 1984 presidential election may present a problem in looking for campaign effects. The campaign was largely uneventful. Campbell goes so far as to say that there is “no evidence” for the campaign being decisive in 1984 (2001, 449). By January, Reagan had an early lead, which he maintained through the year. Additionally, both candidates were well known going into the election. Reagan had served as president for four years, and Mondale was clearly identified with the Carter administration and the liberal side of the Democratic Party. What this means in terms of this analysis is that 1984 is perhaps a conservative test of campaign effects.            "
"25","The inclusion of a specific measure of how campaigns influence voters should expand the generalizability. It is obviously difficult to generalize from the existing demonstrations that time matters. Concluding that time mattered in a specific election does not provide much help in predicting how the campaign will matter in other elections. If campaigns work by altering voters' uncertainty, however, the theory generalizes. By providing the underlying mechanism behind the changes, the theory and the results provide a clear prediction about other elections."
"26","While the structure of the CMS is unique, the questions asked are the standard ones developed by the NES. Therefore, decisions about measurement are relatively easy."
"27","Dependent variable The dependent variable is the vote choice, coded “one” if the respondent voted for Mondale, “zero” if he or she voted for Reagan. A problem with this measure is that it is not asked before the twenty‐third week of the CMS—until the Democratic convention. Rather than throw out the first half of the sample, I construct a vote choice for these respondents based on the relative feeling thermometers. A respondent is coded as a one if he or she rates Reagan lower than he or she rates Mondale. Respondents who rate the candidates equally are treated as missing (as are those who cannot decide later in the sample).               "
"28","Determinants of vote choice The micro‐level determinants of vote choice are partisanship, the amount of policy disagreement between the candidate and the respondent, the respondent's assessment of the candidate's personality traits, and perceptions of the national economy. The partisanship measure is the standard 7‐point scale coded such that higher means more Republican. Following Alvarez (1998), the issue measure is the average squared differences between the respondent's self‐placement and the candidate's position estimated by the sample mean of the candidate placement on the policy questions.2 Lower values correspond to greater agreement between the candidate and the voter. The trait measures are additive scales based on the battery of questions asking the respondent to rate the candidates' character traits.3 Higher scores represent attitudes that are more positive about the candidate. The measure of economic perceptions is the respondent's retrospective view of how the national economy changed in the previous year (higher scores representing a more positive view of the economy). Finally, I include the following demographic characteristics as controls: race (white = 1), gender (male = 1), and age in years.               "
"29"," Figure 1 presents the over time changes in these means of these micro‐level measures over the course of the campaign. There is little evidence of systematic movement in these attitudes in Figure 1. There is some movement in these aggregate numbers over the campaign, but none of them trend significantly in either direction. It seems doubtful that there was consistent movement in favor of one candidate during the campaign—a result consistent with other studies of campaign effects (Finkel 1993; Lazardsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1948; Miller and Shanks 1982; Patterson 1980).               "
"30","                 Over Time Change in Independent Variables (Aggregated)                            "
"31","Macro‐level campaign measures The effects of the nondemographic determinants of vote choice vary as a function of the campaign. In the specification of the first model, the effects of party, issue positions, trait perceptions, and economic retrospections vary as functions of the standard measure: time.               "
"32","The hypotheses outlined above, however, provide some guidance about the underlying mechanism beneath these changes. The theory is that campaigns work insofar as they decrease the amount of uncertainty voters have. Thus, I first move beyond simple measures of time to account for campaign effects and specify the link between vote choice and its determinants as a function of the electorate's uncertainty."
"33","The measures of the uncertainty the electorate has about the candidates are derived from the connection between uncertainty and variance (Alvarez 1998; Campbell 1983; Franklin 1991). Campbell measures the electorate's uncertainty about a candidate on a single issue by the sample variance in the placement of the candidate on the 7‐point issue scale. Alvarez's aggregate measure of uncertainty builds on Campbell's but averages the variance across the set of different issue scales. I measure the electorate's uncertainty of the candidates' issue positions by taking the average variance of the sample placement for each weekly sample. This produces a simple measure of how unsure the electorate is about where the candidates stand on the issues. While there is likely to be some noise in this measure, it is relatively smooth over time and generally trends downward as the electorate becomes more certain during the campaign.4"
"34","The trait uncertainty measure uses the same approach. Instead of the issue placements, I rely on the variance in the trait assessments of the candidates. The more uncertain the electorate is about the candidates' character, the greater the variance. This is also a potentially noisy variable that tends to trend downward."
"35"," Figure 2 presents the over time movement in these uncertainty measures. The general trend for all of the uncertainty measures over time is downward. As the campaign progresses the electorate tends to become less uncertain. But this movement is neither monotonic nor consistent. There are some upward movements over time and the general downward trends occur at varying paces.               "

"38","Micro‐level uncertainty measures The individual‐level measure of uncertainty employed here is the one developed by Alvarez (1998). Alvarez uses the averaged squared difference between the respondent's placement of the candidate's and the average placement by all of the respondents averaged across several questions—essentially an estimate of the respondent's variance in the placement of the candidate on the issue or character trait scales in the survey. The approach assumes that each respondent's error in placing the candidate will have a mean of zero and a variance determined by the respondent's uncertainty. The one wrinkle (shared by Alvarez) is the coding of people who do not provide an answer to the candidate placement scale. These respondents are coded as maximally uncertain on that issue or trait.               "
"39","Predictors of uncertainty The third set of tests will examine how the individual‐level uncertainty mediates the effects of the campaign. The first stage of these analyses demonstrates that uncertainty responds to the campaign. The main independent variable of interest is time. While the different samples are random, it is worth controlling for other explanations of a person's uncertainty. Alvarez shows that uncertainty is driven by the amount of information the person receives, the voter's information costs, and the person's attachment to the political world. Thus, I include measures of race (white = 1), gender (male = 1), age in years, education (the NES 4‐point scale), partisan strength (a 4‐point scale ranging from pure independent to strong partisan), exposure to television news (how many days a week), interest in the campaign (a 4‐point scale), church attendance, and if the person is married.               "
"40","The hypothesis developed above is not a standard “X causes Y” relationship that political scientists normally test. The usual approach is to hypothesize about a direct (usually linear) relationship between two variables and use a technique such as OLS, logit, or probit (depending on the dependent variable) and make inferences based on the coefficient(s) of interest. The hypotheses here, however, are not directly about the relationship between the micro‐level predictors and vote choice. They are about how the campaign alters these relationships. Using standard regression‐based techniques, this is impossible to test; the coefficients are constant across observations by assumption and necessity. What is needed is an approach that treats the coefficients as “random” in that they are drawn from a random distribution whose mean is a function of the sample week. The method used here is a fully Bayesian hierarchical logit model, estimated with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods estimated via WinBUGS (Gilks, Thomas, and Spiegelhalter 1994; Gill 2002; Jackman 2000; Western 1998).            "
"41","Hierarchical models are becoming increasingly common in political science, but are new enough to warrant a brief comment. The simple idea behind these models is that the data are observed at two levels, where the observations at the lower level are clustered within some higher level. In this case, the individual survey respondents are clustered within weeks of the campaign, and there is something about the higher level (week) that is of substantive interest. This type of data creates several complications. First, the observations are no longer independently identically distributed. Observations from one week are likely to have a different error variance than variance from another week. Second, if there are variables of interest that occur at the higher level of aggregation, then traditional models will overstate our confidence in their estimation. That is, if there are 1,000 total individuals grouped into 10 weeks, a normal model will assume that there are 1,000 observations. There are not. There are only 10 degrees of freedom. Finally, the higher level (week) effect is not deterministic—this effect should contain an error term like any other statistical model. But these errors are very difficult to estimate and complicate the model, especially with a binary dependent variable like vote choice."
"42","Hopefully, writing out the equations of the model will clarify the estimation strategy. The micro‐level specification of vote choice is straightforward:                "
"43","While the estimation of this model is difficult, the tests of the hypotheses are simple. The effect of the macro‐level predictors is specified as a single coefficient for each of the individual‐level predictors. The tests of the hypotheses are merely the sign and statistical significance of these coefficients. For instance, the hierarchical logit tests how the link between issue distance from Reagan and vote choice is altered by time (γ31) and the aggregate uncertainty in Reagan issue positions (γ32). A single coefficient is estimated for each of these terms that can be used to test hypotheses.            "
"44","There is one final note before presenting the results of the hierarchical logit. The results of an MCMC statistical technique are not as straightforward as traditional models. With simple regression or maximum likelihood models, it is simple to test hypotheses. The ratio of the coefficient to the standard error is compared to some critical value of a normal or t distribution. In this model, the ratio is not assumed to follow some simple distribution. MCMC methods provide a sample of parameters' posterior distributions instead of simply their mean and variance. It is possible to develop a point estimate and sense of variability for these distributions that are analogous to the coefficient and standard error in regular models. The results report the sample mean and standard deviation for each coefficient. Statistical inference is based on whether or not the 95% confidence region of the coefficient estimate contains zero.6"
"45","At this point, it is possible to proceed with the analysis. The discussion developed three sets of hypotheses, the data allow for clean tests, and the statistical technique accurately models the process and boils the comparison down to a few coefficients. The tests of the first two models (those that focus only on the aggregate campaign measures) are presented in Table 1.         "
"46","The first column in Table 1 presents the time‐only specification. While some of these results are complicated, the bottom three rows of the table are straightforward. Whites are more likely to vote for Reagan while there is no evidence that age and gender affect vote choice. The interpretation of the other variables is not as obvious. The coefficients can be thought of as interaction terms where the “Intercept” is the main effect and “Time” (and “Uncertainty” in the second model) is the interactive term. These terms specify how the effect of the determinant is expected to change as a function of time (or uncertainty). For each of the variables, including the constant, the parameters are collected under the italicized headings. In the constant equation and the Mondale policy equation, none of the coefficients are distinguishable from zero. At no point in the campaign is the policy distance from Mondale a significant predictor of vote choice, controlling for the other variables in the model.         "
"47","The rest of the model has more noteworthy results. The party and Reagan policy equations have a different pattern. Here the intercept terms are significant—the effect of these variables is significant even at the start of the campaign (time is equal to zero), but there is no significant change over the campaign. The economic retrospections equation shows the opposite pattern. At first, differences in views of the economy are not consequential for vote choice, but they grow in effect as the campaign progresses. Finally, all four of the trait coefficients are significant. Trait perceptions matter at the start of the campaign, and their effect grows."
"48","These initial results are more or less consistent with the basic model. Some of the determinants of vote choice respond to the campaign and become stronger predictors of vote choice. The second column of Table 1 takes this model and adds the aggregate uncertainty terms to it. Of the four terms being added, only one has a confidence region that does not contain zero—the trait uncertainty term for Reagan. As the electorate becomes more certain about Reagan's character, it becomes a stronger predictor of vote choice. While this is the only term that is significant, a test of model fit supports the hypothesis that the inclusion of these terms improves the fit of the model. They contribute to the depiction of campaign effects beyond the effects attributable to time by itself.         "
"49","The final test of the role of uncertainty presented here is how individual levels of uncertainty mediate these aggregate‐level changes. Mediational analysis requires three steps (Baron and Kenny 1986). First, we need to show that these aggregate‐level changes alter how voters make decisions. Table 1 does precisely that. The second step is to show that the changes in time produce differences in individual‐level uncertainty. The third and final step is to reestimate the model in column B of Table 1 including the individual‐level interactions between the determinants of vote choice and their levels of uncertainty.7 If the campaign is mediated by changes in individual‐level uncertainty, then (1) time should be a significant predictor of individual‐level uncertainty; (2) the individual‐level interactions in the vote model should be significant; and (3) including the individual‐level interactions should make the moderating influence of time (and aggregate‐level uncertainty) insignificant.            "
"50"," Table 2 presents the second set of these tests. Here each column represents a different dependent variable. For all four relevant measures of uncertainty, the log of the week the respondent is surveyed during is a significant predictor. In each case, voters surveyed later have less uncertainty about both of the candidates' stances on the issues and their character than those surveyed earlier. Time is the most consistent predictor and the only one that is significant in every model. The effects of the control variables are largely consistent with other work predicting levels of uncertainty (Alvarez 1998). The second criterion for mediation is met. Time creates differences in voters' uncertainty about the candidates.            "
"51"," Table 3 presents the final model of vote choice, taking the results from Table 1 and adding the individual‐level uncertainty interactions. Two general patterns hold. First, all four of the individual‐level uncertainty interactions are statistically significant (the confidence region from the MCMC output excludes zero in all four cases). At the individual level, differences in uncertainty produce differences in how voters use issue positions and candidate character traits when they vote. This is not new (Alvarez 1998; Glasgow and Alvarez 2000; Peterson 2004, 2005). What is new is how this changes the aggregate‐level interactions. The second key pattern is that all of the coefficients representing the aggregate‐level moderation now overlap zero and there is no evidence that these factors (time or the degree of aggregate learning) provide any added moderating effect on vote determinants once the effect of the individual‐level uncertainty is accounted for. All of the important effects of the campaign are mediated by the differences in the individual‐level uncertainty.            "
"52","The conclusions presented here suggest that the campaign altered how voters made their decisions and that this change stemmed from the changes in uncertainty about the candidates. The coefficients summarize the results, but do not provide much insight in the magnitude of these effects. The most straightforward way to present these results is by looking at how different levels of uncertainty produce different changes in the predicted probability of voting for Mondale based on constant shifts in trait perceptions and issue positions."
"53","This requires several steps. Because this is a logit model the effect of a change in one independent variable is conditional on the values of the others. Thus, all variables (except for the one of interest) are set to their median. Second, I need to specify exactly what is the correct metric for comparison. In Figure 3, I will graph the difference in expected probability of voting for Mondale between two hypothetical voters: one who is a standard deviation above the mean and one who is a standard deviation below the mean of the relevant independent variable. This is the y‐axis, the difference in the expected probability of voting for Mondale between these two voters, and it summarizes how important this difference is during the campaign. As the difference grows in absolute value, the effect of the independent variable increases. The change in this difference is due to changes in the uncertainty voters have about the candidates. The x‐axis is time. And at each point in time, I set the weekly average level of individual uncertainty using the results in Table 2. For instance, the individual‐level policy uncertainty about Reagan is set to 0.40 at the start of the campaign and then declines at a rate of −0.18 multiplied by the natural log of the week (the coefficient in Table 2). To be clear, the difference in the levels of the attitude (issue or trait) is held constant over time. Only the individual‐level uncertainty varies. Because these are MCMC results, I have a sample of 10,000 draws from the posterior distributions of the coefficients in the model. I use this sample to determine the confidence I have in this difference in predicted probability by calculating the difference for each of the 10,000 estimates of the parameters. This confidence interval is graphed as the dashed lines in the figures.            "
"54","                 Change in the Effect of Issue Distance from Reagan (Panel A), Issue Distance from Mondale (Panel B), Reagan Trait Perceptions (Panel C), and Mondale Trait Perceptions (Panel D)                         "
"55","Thus, the x‐axis is the time of the campaign and the level of uncertainty is set to the predicted average level of individual‐level uncertainty based on the results in Table 2. In each case, the negative coefficients in Table 2 mean that uncertainty will decrease. The results in Table 3 show that uncertainty has a suppressing effect, so as uncertainty declines, the effect of the variable should increase in magnitude. The magnitude of the change in the graph depends on both how the campaign changes the levels of uncertainty the voters have and how these changes manifest themselves in moderating the role of issues or character traits.            "
"56","All of these effects grow in magnitude as a result of the campaign. The policy distances have smaller effects than the trait perceptions, both in terms of absolute magnitude and responsiveness to the campaign. The issue distance from Reagan at the start of the campaign has about a 0.14 change in probability, increasing by about one‐half of its value by the end of the campaign to 0.22. The issue disagreement with Mondale starts much lower (−.05) and roughly triples in magnitude (to −0.18). The issue disagreement with Mondale also starts out statistically insignificant and is not a significant predictor of vote choice until June (the 21st week of the campaign). The trait perceptions of Reagan start off having a small but significant −0.05 change in the predicted probability of voting for Mondale, and increase nearly fivefold (to −0.25). The trait perceptions of Mondale show a similar growth from a statistically insignificant 0.06 difference in the predicted probability of voting for Mondale to a much larger 0.25 difference. The trait perceptions of Mondale become statistically significant quickly in the campaign as the confidence region excludes zero by the start of February. Overall, all four of these determinants are affected by the campaign and increase in their explanatory power, though the trait perceptions increase more. Additionally, the variables reflecting attitudes about Reagan are significant across the entire campaign while attitudes about Mondale take time to be connected to vote choice. Given Reagan's status as the incumbent, this should not be surprising.            "
"57","These changes suggest that voters sort themselves out during the campaign and use the information they gather about the candidates to make choices more in line with their perceptions of the candidates. But the dependent variable here is vote choice and the ultimate concern of this theory is the choices the voters make. Given the results presented above it is possible to predict if a voter would have voted differently at different levels of uncertainty. To do this, I took the voters from the CMS who were sampled after the election (184 respondents) and calculated which candidate the person is predicted to vote for given the levels of uncertainty over the campaign. Figure 4 presents the proportion of the sample that is predicted to vote differently for each week. There is notable movement among voters. If the voters at the end of the election had been as uncertain as the voters at the beginning of the campaign, more than 10% of them are expected to switch their vote. While much of the movement cancels out, these results suggest that the changes in uncertainty netted Mondale around 2% of the vote. While it didn't make much of a difference in the outcome in this election, this amount of change might be consequential in other years.            "

"59","Understanding the dynamics of voter preferences in presidential campaigns is necessary to diagnose the usefulness of campaigns and the health of our system of representation. The role of political scientists is to uncover the systematic patterns in campaigns that stir the minds and hearts of voters. If voters do not cast their ballots based on polices the candidate espouses during the campaign, then elected officials are not necessarily held responsible for what they do in office. If the electorate chooses the candidate further away from their aggregate preferences, representation may not work. If, as V. O. Key argued (1966), the voice of the electorate is but an echo of the inputs from the candidates, it is essential that we determine the contours of the echo chamber.         "
"60","What do these results mean for the effectiveness of campaigns? The model developed here is compatible with Key's metaphor of the echo chamber (Key 1966), and the conclusion of this work reiterates the consensus in the literature: campaigns matter. They alter what considerations voters use when deciding. Where this work adds to our understanding of campaigns is in specifying and testing how and why campaigns matter. In addition to the standard reliance on the blunt measure of time as a proxy for the campaign, these results demonstrate that campaigns have some of their effect by altering how uncertain voters are about the candidates. Because the interaction of the voters and the campaign determines which attitudes matter for voters, changes in the information environment change the decision‐making criteria voters use.         "
"61","Normatively, this is both frightening and heartening. Frightening insofar as it suggests voters are more susceptible to the influence of the campaign than the previous work. Gelman and King (1993), for instance, suggest that campaigns not only matter, they “work.” Campaigns necessarily increase the reliance on what they deem to be fundamental variables by enlightening voters. These results, however, suggest that how well campaigns work depends on how the campaign is conducted. An emphasis on candidate character will make it and not what policies the candidate will enact if elected the dominant determinant of voters' choices. These conclusions are heartening because this is not as bad as it sounds. Campaigns matter in this work more than in the extant literature. It may change the weights applied to determinants that scholars would, normatively, wish that it would downplay, but this is a function of the content. If the campaign focuses more on issues, the effect of the campaign may change. As Key suggested, voters behave as rationally and reasonably as could be expected given the campaign.         "
"62","This work is not definitive. The nature of the 1984 campaign limits the generalizability of the results. The election pitted a sitting incumbent against a well‐known former vice president who had been through two previous elections. If both candidates were relatively well known going in to the campaign, this may be a poor choice of an election to generalize from. Moreover, Reagan's tremendous and nearly constant lead may have limited the amount of change. Both of these problems, however, would tend to mitigate the findings, making it difficult to find systematic change in voters as a result of the campaign. The 1984 election, because of its idiosyncrasies, may be a conservative test of how campaigns influence people."
"63","One particular example of this may be the differential effect of the campaign on voters' use of issue positions and character assessments. This may be a general feature of campaigns, or it may be the result of the strategic choices and campaign emphasis of the candidates. Given Reagan's early lead, the strategy outlined by Lee Atwater was to emphasize Reagan's leadership and personality, choosing the slogan “Leadership That's Working” (Abramson, Aldrich, and Rohde 1986; Goldman and Fuller 1985). This strategic emphasis may be behind the differential results. Without more evidence from other years, it is difficult to develop a general theory of which determinants of vote choice respond more to the campaign.         "
"64","The actual pattern of what is significant when may also be ungeneralizable. As noted, the Reagan attitudes were significant throughout the campaign, while the Mondale attitudes took time to be connected to vote choice. The obvious rationale is that Reagan was clearly the candidate throughout the election and voters started out knowing him well. In addition, Mondale was probably better known than many eventual nominees, which could account for the speed at which attitudes about him become certain enough to be connected to vote choice. A less well‐known candidate (perhaps Dukakis) may take longer to forge the link between his or her positions and character and voters' evaluation of the candidate."
"65","Finally, I still cannot directly rule out that the relationship demonstrated here is not spurious. It could be that accessibility or importance is the appropriate moderator and omitted variable bias creates these effects. There is, however, no evidence of this occurring in other studies. Whenever importance or accessibility is compared to uncertainty as a moderator in candidate evaluations, uncertainty is superior. So while it is possible that I have specified the wrong mediator of campaign effects, the empirical evidence suggests this is improbable."
