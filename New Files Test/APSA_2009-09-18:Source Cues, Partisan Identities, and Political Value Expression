"1","We begin by defining the key concepts and then explain why cues pertaining to party identification can be expected to shape core political values individually and collectively. Party identification represents an enduring sense of psychological attachment to a political party. Its importance in models of preference formation and political behavior arises from findings that partisan identities are the most stable predisposition in political belief systems; that they color a wide range of short‐term political perceptions; and that they lie beyond the influence of most short‐term perceptions (Campbell et al. 1960).1 Core political values are abstract normative beliefs about desirable end‐states or modes of conduct that operate in the political domain (Feldman 1988; Rokeach 1973; Schwartz 1994). They, too, are quite stable and guide preferences on short‐term political controversies and the issues of the day.         "
"2","The first theoretical question to address is how party identification shapes political perception and judgment. Political parties serve as reference groups for citizens by providing them with a simple evaluative basis for rendering judgments about political communications (Campbell et al. 1960; Jacoby 1988). Although Democrats and Republicans in the electorate may sometimes spontaneously process political information in a partisan fashion, they are more likely to do so when primed by the parties and their leaders to think in partisan terms (Zaller 1992). When someone hears a recognizable partisan source advocating some position, her partisan leanings are activated, which in turn lead her to evaluate the message through a partisan lens. If the cue giver and recipient share a party label, the latter will trust the former and accept the message without reflecting much on message content. But if the cue giver and recipient lie across the partisan divide, the recipient will mistrust the source and reject the message, again without much reflection. In sum, when it comes to political communications most people do not analyze systematically the messages they encounter. Instead, they usually turn to simple heuristics, such as whether or not they like or trust the source, when evaluating a message (Carmines and Kuklinski 1990; Mondak 1993).         "
"3","The proposition that party sources lead partisans to modify their positions on short‐term perceptions like the state of the economy or presidential popularity rests on a firm empirical foundation (Bartels 2002). We posit that political values are susceptible to partisan influence as well. Thus, the second theoretical question we must address concerns why partisan bias should influence political values, which, conventional theorizing holds, are more durable and resistant to change than short‐term perceptions. Put simply, we believe that partisan identities are more central and enduring elements in mass belief systems than political values.2 Partisan identities are grounded in group attachments, which are easier to develop and understand than normative beliefs about what should be done in a given policy domain. In light of this, we suspect that partisan identities precede political belief in the developmental sequence. Green, Palmquist, and Schickler capture this sentiment well: “When people feel a sense of belonging to a given social group, they absorb the doctrinal positions that the group advocates” (2002, 4). Just as religious adherents often accept matters of belief and faith without much critical thought, so too should partisan adherents accept party doctrine on fundamental political questions.         "
"4","Recent evidence is consistent with this point. Goren (2005) asks whether party ties shape political values or vice versa. He compares the partisan‐influence hypothesis, which holds that group identities shape value positions, with the values‐influence hypothesis, which posits that values shape partisan loyalties. These hypotheses are tested by applying structural equation modeling techniques to two‐ and three‐wave NES panel data to estimate a series of cross‐lagged models between party identification and equal opportunity, limited government, family values, and moral tolerance. The results suggest that party identification is more temporally stable than these values and that it dynamically constrains values, without being simultaneously constrained by them. In addition, research by McCann (1997) uses NES panel data to show that beliefs about equality and traditional morality are dynamically constrained by candidate evaluations, but do not manifest comparable influence over candidate evaluations. Given that candidate evaluations are grounded heavily in partisan biases, McCann's results yield indirect evidence that partisanship shapes value positions. In conjunction, these two studies provide solid justification for positing that party identification has temporal priority over, and thus, the ability to shape, some political values.         "
"5","To be clear, we are not claiming that core political values are akin to other short‐term perceptions. We believe, like many others, that political values are central elements in mass belief systems. Nor do we expect that partisan influence will produce wholesale value change. Instead, partisan forces should affect values at the margins, essentially leading identifiers to become a little bit more or less enamored of a given value."
"6","To summarize our first theoretical claim: since partisan identities are more basic orientations than political values and partisan biases are activated easily in the presence of partisan source cues, we anticipate that the expression of political values will move in response to partisan appeals. This theoretical framework leads to the following pair of expectations. Our first hypothesis is that the relationship between individual partisan identities and positions on political values will become more pronounced in the presence of party source cues. Our second hypothesis is that when political values are endorsed by Democrats, support will rise among Democratic identifiers and fall among Republicans. Similarly, values accompanied by Republican endorsements should see a rise in support among GOP partisans and declining support among Democrats."
"7","Two refinements are necessary to establish some boundary conditions for our theory. First, there are grounds for suspecting that source cues will have asymmetrical effects on value expression. Specifically, party cues should produce larger changes in value support among opposition partisans compared to like‐minded partisans. In other words, a type of negativity bias should be present. The superior power of negative information over positive information is firmly established in psychological literatures (for a review, see Baumeister et al. 2001). Although several explanations exist as to why negative information is more powerful, the most relevant, in our view, is the “figure‐ground” explanation. This perspective holds that negative information is more consequential for information processing and judgment than equally extreme, positive information because it stands out against a positive background (Lau 1985).         "
"8","Since political values are quite popular, the perceptual background surrounding them is positive. Hence, when perceivers encounter a value message with an out‐party endorsement, the negative valence of the out‐party cue will contrast with the positive valence of the value. However, for perceivers who share a party label with a source, the entire message is positive. The net result is that out‐partisans, who confront some negative information, should move more than in‐partisans, who encounter entirely positive information. To illustrate, Democratic endorsement of equal opportunity should diminish Republican support more than it enhances Democratic support. This leads to our third hypothesis. When a political value is sanctioned by a political party, the drop in expressed support for the value among opposition partisans will be greater than the rise in expressed support among like‐minded partisans.3"
"9","Our next theoretical refinement centers on the role liberal‐conservative identification likely plays in the process. We define this construct as a sense of psychological attachment to an ideological label based on feelings about liberal or conservative groups, ideas, or symbols (Conover and Feldman 1981). We think that the influence of the party source cue will be stronger among ideologically congruent partisans (i.e., liberal Democrats) than when ideologically congruent and incongruent partisans are grouped together (i.e., liberal and moderate and conservative Democrats).         "
"10","Why should this be so? Imagine a pair of Democrats identical in all respects save that the first is conservative, the second liberal. Upon hearing that conservative Republicans support the principle of self‐reliance, their reactions may differ. The liberal Democrat confronts reinforcing pressures—one partisan, one ideological—to cool her enthusiasm for self‐reliance. In contrast, the conservative Democrat is cross‐pressured: partisanship dictates less enthusiasm, ideology more. It seems plausible that the liberal Democrat will express less support for self‐reliance than the conservative Democrat. When we compare responses for liberal Democrats alone to those of liberals and moderates and conservatives inclusive, the ideologically “pure” should prove more responsive to source cues than the ideologically “mixed.” Thus, our fourth hypothesis predicts greater shifts in value endorsement among ideologically congruent partisans versus the ideologically pure and cross‐pressured."
"11","To repeat, the first major prediction our theory makes is that party cues will condition the impact partisan loyalties have on political values under varying circumstances. In addition to shaping individual value positions, we expect party cues will influence how discrete values are organized into broader value systems. More succinctly, our final hypothesis predicts that party cues will enhance constraint between political values. In his classic essay, Converse defines constraint “to mean the success we would have in predicting, given initial knowledge that an individual holds a specified attitude, that he holds certain further ideas and attitudes” (1964, 207). To illustrate for the case of political values, imagine knowing someone who favors equal opportunity. Armed with this knowledge, one might further predict she favors moral tolerance. If she holds these two positions, we can conclude that her values are horizontally constrained. Constraint, in other words, denotes left‐right cognitive organization.         "
"12","Why should party cues enhance value constraint? When individuals hear that Democrats favor one set of values and Republicans another, they should modify their expressed value positions for the reasons discussed above. This is the first‐order effect of partisanship. Because of this, value positions will become more polarized, the result of which will be stronger left‐right constraint among all the values. This is the second‐order effect. In this manner, party cues help people organize their political values more tightly, just as they promote attitude constraint on specific issues (Layman and Carsey 2002; Tomz and Sniderman 2005). Insofar as this is the case, we can infer that the influence of partisanship extends beyond simply shaping value expressions.         "
"13","We tested our hypotheses by carrying out survey experiments that manipulated whether or not respondents received source cues when answering a series of questions about political values. The survey was administered using random digit dialing techniques to the U.S. voting age population in the 48 contiguous states and was conducted from February 11 to April 26, 2006, by the Institute for Social Science Research at Arizona State University. A total of 1,201 interviews were completed. We restrict our attention to respondents in three of the four conditions as described below, which yields a sample of 899. 4 Given our interest in the influence of partisanship on expressed value support, we emphasize the internal validity of our results over their external validity throughout the analyses.5"
"14","The key questions ask respondents how strongly they agree with statements about four important values in American political culture: equal opportunity, self‐reliance, moral traditionalism, and moral tolerance. We selected these values because they represent fundamental lines of political cleavage in two of the major policy domains in contemporary American society. First, in the social welfare domain political conflict has long centered on how best to strike a balance between equal opportunity on one hand and self‐reliance on the other (McClosky and Zaller 1984). In a similar vein, political conflict in the cultural‐moral issues domain has focused on the tension between the defense of traditional values and the acceptance of progressive alternatives (Layman 2001). Finally, each of these value conflicts maps onto the party system in identifiable ways. The Democratic Party places more emphasis on equal opportunity and moral tolerance while the GOP stresses self‐reliance and traditional morality.         "
"15","Each of these principles represents an abstract belief about a desirable end‐state or mode of conduct. Equal opportunity is the belief that everyone should have the same chance to succeed and prosper in life. Self‐reliance represents the idea that each person should rely on individual initiative and self‐discipline to get ahead. Moral traditionalism reflects the degree to which one favors customary or traditional codes of moral behavior and conduct, particularly with respect to family structures. Finally, moral tolerance is the idea that the good and just society accepts individuals and groups whose beliefs and behaviors regarding right and wrong differ from those of the mainstream (Feldman 1988; Goren 2005). Respondents were asked to rate how strongly they agree with propositions regarding each value on a 0–10 scale (higher scores reflect more support). We employ three statements per value to enhance measurement validity and reliability. Question wording for each statement appears in Table 1.         "
"16","Respondents in the control group received the “Some people believe” cue in each value question. In the party treatment group, respondents were informed that “Democrats believe” in equal opportunity and moral tolerance and “Republicans believe” in self‐reliance and moral traditionalism. In the ideology‐plus‐party treatment group, respondents were told that “Liberal Democrats believe” in equal opportunity and moral tolerance and “Conservative Republicans believe” in self‐reliance and traditional values. After hearing these cues, respondents were asked about their own positions on each value. In sum, control group respondents received no cues across the 12 value questions while treatment group respondents encountered six Democratic/liberal Democratic and six Republican/conservative Republican cues."
"17","We use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to estimate the degree to which the value items are valid and reliable indicators of our value constructs (all variables have been normed to 0.00–1.00 scale).6 The model we estimate has four factors—one for each value—with the items for each value loading onto the respective factors. For each factor, the loading for the first item is set to 1.00. Factors are coded so higher scores reflect stronger endorsement of the value. We report the standardized factor loading of each indicator on each factor, Cronbach's α reliability coefficient for the respective multi‐item scales, and standard global fit statistics. The measurement analyses are restricted to control group respondents since their answers to the value items are not contaminated by source cues.            "
"18","The Table 2 estimates reveal that the observed value items do a good job tapping latent values. First, all of the items are valid indicators of their respective constructs with item‐factor correlations ranging from a low of .56 to a high of .94.7 Next, the individual items are quite reliable as well (as determined by squaring the item‐factor correlations): latent egalitarianism explains 58–81% of the observed variance in its items, latent self‐reliance accounts for 49–88% of the observed item variance, latent moral traditionalism explains 48–77% of the variance in its items, and latent moral tolerance accounts for 31–74% of the observed variance. The respective multi‐item scales are also highly reliable, with Cronbach's α equaling .79 for equality, .81 for self‐reliance, .82 for traditionalism, and .76 for tolerance. Also, while the model χ2 is significant, the other indices reveal excellent global model fit (e.g., CFI = .99, TLI = .99).            "
"19","For comparison, we also estimated several alternative models. First, we examined a simple model in which all 12 value items were taken as indicators of a single value dimension. This alternative model fit the data very poorly (χ253= 1423.90, p < .0001, CFI = .92, TLI = .86), with a χ2 difference test indicating that the one‐factor model provided a significantly worse fit than our four‐factor model (Δχ26= 396.53, p < .0001).8 Second, we examined the possibility that equality and self‐reliance might be oppositely valenced indicators of a common “economic values” dimension and that moral traditionalism and tolerance might be oppositely valenced indicators of a common “social values” dimension. This two‐factor model—which constrained the equality and self‐reliance items to load on one factor and the traditionalism and tolerance items to load on the other—also fit poorly (χ252= 1113.31, p < .0001, CFI = .94, TLI = .89), with a χ2 difference test indicating that the model provided a significantly worse fit compared to our four‐factor model (Δχ25= 258.59, p < .001). Finally, we considered an alternative two‐factor model that grouped the values by their left‐right flavor. In this model, the equality and tolerance items were allowed to load on a common “left” factor, while the self‐reliance and traditionalism items were allowed to load on a common “right” factor. This model also provided a significantly worse fit than the four‐factor model (χ252= 664.84, p < .001, CFI = .96, TLI = .94; Δχ25= 151.54, p < .001). In general, then, the results suggest that a four‐factor value structure most adequately describes the data, and that each set of items provides a valid, reliable measure of a key political value.            "
"20","Our first hypothesis maintains that partisan source cues activate Democratic‐Republican identifications in the minds of citizens which lead them to take somewhat different value positions. If this is to hold empirically, then expressed value positions should depend more heavily on partisan identities in the party and party‐plus‐ideology treatment groups relative to the control group. We test this prediction using structural equation modeling techniques in which the four latent values—measured using the items as indicated in Table 2—are regressed on latent partisanship in each of the three experimental groups. Latent partisanship is measured with three indicators. The first is the standard NES 7‐point self‐categorization scale. The second and third measures are feeling thermometers for the Republican and Democratic parties, with the latter reverse‐coded. These items are scaled from 0 to 10, “with 10 meaning a very warm, favorable feeling, 0 meaning a very cold, unfavorable feeling, and 5 meaning not particularly warm or cold.” Higher scores on latent partisanship denote stronger Republican attachments.9 Note finally that all variables have been normed to run from 0.00 to 1.00.            "
"21","The estimates for the structural model in each condition are reported in Table 3. The second column represents the impact of latent partisanship on each value in the no‐cue condition; the third column estimates the impact of party on each value in the party‐cue condition (i.e., “Democrats believe” for equal opportunity and moral tolerance and “Republicans believe” for self‐reliance and moral traditionalism); the fourth column does the same for the party‐plus‐ideology cues (i.e., “Liberal Democrats believe” for equal opportunity and moral tolerance and “Conservative Republicans believe” for self‐reliance and traditional values). Let us begin with the party identification–equal opportunity relationship. As one would expect, increasing GOP partisanship is negatively related to beliefs about equal opportunity in each group. In the control group, movement from the Democratic to the Republican extreme on latent partisanship is associated with a .49 unit decline in support for equal opportunity. Next, in the party‐cue group comparable movement on latent partisanship leads to a .63 unit decline in support. Finally, in the party‐plus‐ideology group movement across latent partisanship is associated with a .75 unit decline. To sum up, the impact of party ties on equal opportunity rises monotonically in the presence of increasingly explicit party source cues.            "
"22","A similar pattern of results holds for self‐reliance and moral tolerance and, to a lesser extent, moral traditionalism. First, Republican partisanship is positively associated with support for self‐reliance in all three conditions. The structural coefficient for latent partisanship equals .25 in the control group, .38 in the party‐cue group, and .62 in the party‐plus‐ideology group. Second, Republican ties are inversely related to moral tolerance, with the effect rising in magnitude from −.24 to −.41 to −.59 across the respective conditions. Third, moral traditionalism is positively related to Republican partisanship. Its dependence on partisanship is the same in the control and party‐cue groups; however, when respondents hear that conservative Republicans endorse family values, the impact of partisan loyalties on value positions grows from .45 to .74."
"23","Broadly speaking, the Table 3 estimates suggest that partisan source cues lead individuals to rely more heavily on partisan identities to vertically constrain their core political principles. Likewise, the differences in the magnitudes of the party coefficients across the conditions are in the expected direction and substantively significant. To formally test whether the party identification coefficients differ across the groups, we estimate two additional models in which the coefficients for the effect of party identification are constrained to equality for (1) no‐cue and party‐cue respondents and (2) no‐cue and party‐plus‐ideology cue respondents. Robust WLS χ2 difference tests indicate that the constraints produced a significant decrease in fit for the no‐cue versus party comparison (overall fit: χ2270= 654.04, p < .01, CFI = .99, TLI = .99; Δχ24= 9.17, p = .057) and for the no‐cue versus party‐plus‐ideology comparison (overall fit: χ2270= 866.72, p < .01, CFI = .99, TLI = .99; Δχ24= 31.48, p < .001). In conjunction, these estimates reveal that partisan cues strengthen vertical connections between partisan loyalties and beliefs about equal opportunity, self‐reliance, moral tolerance, and, to a lesser extent, moral traditionalism, thereby supporting our first hypothesis.10"
"24","In these analyses, we rely on omnibus tests since we are interested in across‐group differences in the overall relationship between partisanship and the group of values as a whole. However, in order to see what relationships were most implicated in these across‐group differences, we also conducted analyses that constrained the party‐value coefficients to equality across groups one at a time. For the control versus party comparison, these tests indicated the omnibus difference was driven primarily by group differences in the effects of partisanship on self‐reliance (p < .10) and tolerance (p < .05). For the control versus party‐plus‐ideology comparison, these tests indicate the omnibus difference was driven by group differences in the effects of partisanship on all four values, but especially self‐reliance and tolerance (p < .06 for equality; p < .001 for self‐reliance; p < .06 for traditional values; p < .001 for tolerance)."
"25","The next step is to test the negativity bias prediction that out‐party cues will produce bigger net changes in value orientations than in‐party cues. We cannot use structural equation modeling techniques here because the sample sizes in some cells are too small (≈25–50) to generate stable parameter estimates. Instead, a series of dummy variable regression models are specified whereby the independent variables reflect different configurations of party identification and experimental conditions. In estimating these models, we also account for the possibility that the high level of endorsement for some values may have created a situation where responses were “right‐censored” or subject to a ceiling effect. Many respondents endorsed each value to the maximum possible extent. This “bunching” at the top end of the scale suggests that the scale itself may have imposed an artificial ceiling on responses and that respondents at the maximum observed point may actually differ in terms of latent support for the value, with some endorsing it more than others. In cases like this, the use of ordinary least squares can produce inconsistent parameter estimates biased toward zero (Greene 2003; Long 1997). Therefore, we estimate our models using right‐censored maximum‐likelihood tobit regression, which is appropriate for dependent variables where a ceiling effect is suspected (Greene 2003). This approach “fills in” the missing information about variance in the dependent variable at its ceiling by incorporating information about different cases’ probability of being censored at the top of the scale, thereby producing consistent estimates of the effects of the independent variables (Long 1997).11"
"26","The critical question is whether Republicans respond more forcefully than Democrats when cued that “Democrats believe” in equal opportunity and moral tolerance, and whether Democrats respond more vigorously than GOP partisans when hearing that “Republicans believe” in self‐reliance and moral traditionalism.12 If negativity bias is present, then the absolute value of the decrease in expressed value support for partisans getting the out‐party cue should exceed the increase among the cue giver's fellow partisans.13 We explore these patterns for partisans in general (i.e., strong, weak, and leaning identifiers on the 7‐point self‐categorization scale) and extreme partisans (i.e., strong identifiers on the 7‐point scale).            "
"27"," Table 4 presents the predicted mean level of expressed support for each value (on a 0.00–1.00 scale) among identifiers in the control and party‐cue groups. We begin with equal opportunity. For Democrats the equal opportunity mean is .89 in the uncued group and .93 in the cued group, indicating that the Democratic source cue enhances expressed support among Democratic partisans (p < .10). As predicted, the source cue proves more consequential among Republicans as their expressed support for equality declines from .73 in the control group to .63 in the treatment group (p < .05).14 The same pattern holds for strong partisans. When strong Democrats hear that Democrats believe in equal opportunity, their expressed support rises from .96 in the uncued group to 1.02 in the cued group (p < .10). When strong Republicans receive what is for them a negatively valenced cue, expressed support for equal opportunity falls from .70 to .60 (p < .05). In short, the Democratic source cue produces a bigger net change in value endorsement among Republicans than among Democrats.            "
"28","Does the same pattern obtain when Republican sources endorse self‐reliance? When Democrats receive this message, expressed support declines from .72 in the control group to .63 in the treatment group (p < .01). The decline is even more pronounced among strong Democrats as the Republican cue yields a .77 to .61 decline (p < .01). In contrast, the Republican endorsement does not systematically affect positions taken by Republican identifiers. The cue leads to a decline in expressed support among Republicans (p < .05); however, this counterintuitive effect vanishes among strong partisans (.91 vs. .90, ns). More broadly, the self‐reliance experiment demonstrates that out‐party cues have more potent effects on identifiers’ expressed values than in‐party cues."
"29","The results for the moral traditionalism experiments appear in the third panel of Table 4. Here we find more limited evidence that party cues motivate changes in expressed value support among opposition partisans. To elaborate, Republican endorsement of family values has no effect in the larger partisan groups. Cued Democrats are no less willing to endorse family values than uncued Democrats (.61 vs. .62, ns); the same holds true for GOP identifiers (.86 vs. .84, ns). When attention turns to strong partisans, Republican endorsement of traditional morality drives expressed Democratic support down from .68 to .59 (p < .10) and has no effect on the views of ardent Republicans (.98 vs. .96, ns). In short, negativity bias seems to emerge only among strong partisans.            "
"30","Moral tolerance is the final value under consideration. These experiments do not support our expectations. First, the Democratic source cue does not appear to influence expressed value support among Democrats or Republicans. Second, among strong identifiers the source cue effect is again limited to one side of the spectrum, in this case increasing expressed support among those on the left. When strong Democrats are told their copartisans believe in tolerating those with diverse moral viewpoints, tolerance scores rise from .68 to .78 (p < .05). Strong Republicans, in contrast, prove unresponsive, with those in the cued group as cool toward tolerance as those in the uncued group (.45 vs. .43, ns)."
"31","To summarize the results so far, out‐party cues produce larger effects on expressed value support among partisans in general on two of four values (equal opportunity and self‐reliance) and among strong partisans on three of four values (equal opportunity, self‐reliance, and moral traditionalism). So far, then, the negativity bias hypothesis receives real if not overwhelming support. However, as we shall see shortly, evidence on its behalf is even stronger when analysis is confined to ideologically congruent partisans."
"32","The next step in the analysis is to test the hypothesis that the interaction between source cues and partisan loyalties is stronger for ideologically pure partisans than for partisan groups containing those of all ideological stripes. We test this hypothesis by estimating tobit regression models for self‐identified liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans in the control group (i.e., no cue) and second treatment group (i.e., the “Liberal Democrats” or “Conservative Republicans” cues) and comparing these results with those reported for the ideologically mixed samples in Table 4.            "
"33","Liberal‐conservative identification is measured using a 7‐point self‐categorization scale.15 We use responses to both the party and ideology self‐identification scales to classify individuals into the following comparative groups: (1) liberal Democrats versus conservative Republicans and (2) strong liberal Democrats versus strong conservative Republicans. The first pairing distinguishes anyone on the left or right side of both divides; the second distinguishes those at the left or right extremes.            "
"34"," Table 5 contains the value means for all relevant groups. Overall, the results are by and large consistent with expectations. First, changes in expressed value support are typically larger for ideologically congruent partisans compared to ideologically mixed partisans. To take one example, in the presence of a left‐wing cue, support for equal opportunity falls more among the ideologically pure strong Republicans in Table 5 (from .67 to .52, p < .01) compared to the ideologically mixed strong Republicans in Table 4 (from .70 to .60, p < .05). To take another example, when the GOP endorses traditional morality, support from strong liberal Democrats in Table 5 falls more (.50 to .33, p < .01) than that of the ideologically mixed Democrats in Table 4 (.68 to .59, p < .10). The point is clear. Generally speaking, source cues produce more substantial changes in expressed value support when citizens’ liberal‐conservative leanings reinforce their party loyalties. These results lend solid support to our fourth hypothesis.            "
"35","The second point to emphasize is that out‐party cues again prove more powerful than in‐party cues. To illustrate, the “liberal Democrats” cue for equal opportunity leads to big declines in expressed support for this value among conservative Republicans (from .71 to .58, p < .01) and strong conservative Republicans (from .67 to .52, p < .01). In contrast, liberal Democrats and strong liberal Democrats hold steady in their expressed value support (.90 to .92, ns, and 1.05 to 1.05, ns, respectively). To take another case, the conservative Republican cue for self‐reliance significantly reduces expressed liberal Democratic support (.69 to .60, p < .01) and does not influence the support offered by conservative Republicans (.89 vs. 91, ns). Furthermore, the cue produces a much larger drop in expressed support among strong liberal Democrats (.71 to .53, p < .01) versus the smaller rise in expressed support among strong conservative Republicans (.93 to 1.02, p < .10). When we take a step back to consider the bigger picture, the tobit estimates reveal that out‐party cues produce bigger shifts on three of four values for both ideologically pure partisans (equal opportunity, self‐reliance, and moral tolerance) and strong ideologically pure partisans (equal opportunity, self‐reliance, and moral traditionalism).16 In conjunction, the results from Tables 4 and 5 support the negativity bias hypothesis in 11 of 16 tests.17"
"36","Our final hypothesis predicts that levels of constraint among political values will rise in the presence of party source cues. If we can demonstrate that party cues strengthen our ability to predict support for one value from another, then we can be more confident that the changes produced by the cues have important effects beyond shaping expressed value positions. To test this prediction, we estimate a multigroup version of the four‐factor model shown in Table 2 for the control group, the party group, and the party‐ideology group. The key estimates we need are the correlations between the latent factors in each experimental group. These estimates are reported in Table 6.            "
"37","A quick glance at the factor correlations reveals that core political values are indeed more strongly interrelated—in the predicted directions—in the two treatment groups. While the mean of the absolute value of the correlations in the no‐cue condition is .27, the equivalent averages in the party‐cue and party‐plus‐ideology cue conditions are .45 and .41, respectively. These results suggest that most of the increase in value constraint is driven by the party cue. To formally test whether the factor correlations differ in magnitude across the groups, we estimate two additional models in which the correlations are constrained to equality for (1) no‐cue and party‐cue respondents and (2) no‐cue and party‐plus‐ideology cue respondents. Robust WLS χ2 difference tests indicate that the constraints produced highly significant decreases in fit for the no‐cue versus party‐cue comparison (overall fit: χ2163= 619.09, p < .001, CFI = .99, TLI = .99; Δχ26= 29.63, p = .001) and the no cue versus party‐plus‐ideology comparison (overall fit: χ2163= 723.98, p < .001, CFI = .99, TLI = .99; Δχ26= 41.81, p < .001). Hence, the cues provided to our respondents not only induce changes in their expressed value positions, but also induce changes in the deeper structure of their values. In the presence of cues about “who” supports different values, mass belief systems become more tightly constrained.            "
"38","For nearly half a century research on party identification has trod along familiar grounds. Most studies estimate statistical models using nonexperimental NES data to gauge how partisan loyalties shape retrospective judgments, candidate evaluations, and other short‐term perceptions (e.g., Bartels 2002; Goren 2002). A few works utilize experimental designs to isolate the causal impact party ties have on short‐term perceptions (Rahn 1993; Lau and Redlawsk 2006). To the best of our knowledge no prior work employs experimental designs to assess the causal impact party identification has on long‐term predispositions.         "
"39","We have argued that partisan source cues in general—and opposition‐party cues in particular—evoke partisan biases in the minds of citizens that subsequently influence expressed support for equal opportunity, self‐reliance, moral traditionalism, and moral tolerance. We further posited that the source cue–party identity effects will be more pronounced when ideological sentiments reinforce partisan leanings. Finally, we expected party cues to promote horizontal constraint among these values. These propositions were tested via a series of novel survey experiments administered to an adult cross‐section of the U.S. population."
"40","Four compelling findings have emerged from the analyses. First, the relationship between individual partisan identities and expressed value support is stronger in the presence of party source cues. Second, out‐party cues typically prove more powerful than in‐party cues in shaping expressed value support. Third, these relationships are usually more pronounced among ideologically congruent partisans than among partisans of all ideological stripes. Fourth, party cues promote horizontal constraint among these values. The source cues did not always interact with political identities in the manner predicted and some of the reported effects are of modest magnitude; nevertheless, the general pattern of results suggests that partisanship has the power to shape expressed support for—and the cognitive organization of—political values under a variety of conditions."
"41","As is the case for most survey experiments, questions can be raised about the generalizability of our results beyond the research setting. Our work shows that the presence of party cues leads partisans to alter their responses to value questions in the context of a single survey. It does not demonstrate that party cues lead to fundamental changes in latent value positions that endure over the long haul. Repeated exposure to consistent partisan messages on party‐value linkages would be necessary to produce lasting value change. Of course, if the latter type of change is to occur at all, we must observe precisely the types of changes in value expression we have found here."
"42","We believe the results of our survey experiments have real‐world analogues for the following reasons. If partisan political elites take consistent positions on political principles for an extended period of time, it seems fair to posit that the movements we uncovered in our experiments will occur in the minds of citizens outside the survey context. Although our work cannot speak directly to this, some evidence corroborates our claim. With respect to political elites, work on polarization indicates that the national parties have taken increasingly distinct ideological profiles in recent years. Democratic elites have moved to the left, Republicans to the right, on most issues (Hetherington 2001; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006). Presumably, this holds for the types of values discussed here. Insofar as elite cues compel ordinary citizens to think in partisan terms, one might expect that citizens use their partisan ties to update their value positions. As mentioned above, this is precisely what Goren (2005) finds. He shows that party identification leads to value changes two‐to‐four years out. Although Goren does not test for the underlying mechanism driving these results, the claim that elite influence is paramount seems highly plausible. In sum, since our experimental findings are consistent with those generated by nonexperimental research situated over much longer time frames, we have some confidence that our results represent more than experimental artifacts.         "
"43","Another objection to our claim is that party cues induce nothing more than a temporary change in value expression based on how people interpret value messages. To elaborate, political values may be vulnerable to the influence of source cues because they lack the cognitive support necessary to inoculate them from attack (Maio and Olson 1998a, 1998b). Since values are self‐evidently good, there is no need to develop reasons for supporting them. This renders political values susceptible to short‐term partisan influence because citizens can use the source cues to fill in the missing information.18 To illustrate, a declaration that “some people” support equal opportunity may imply something different from a claim that “some Democrats” support equal opportunity. The first statement represents a fundamental component of the American political creed. In the second statement, respondents may interpret the party cue as implying support for helping African Americans and then use this information to guide their value expressions. The source cue, in essence, supplies the missing cognitive support (cf. Kuklinski and Hurley 1994). However, once the persuasive attempt has passed, the value expression is forgotten and the latent value resets to its default position.         "
"44","Although this represents a plausible account as to what occurs in a single instance, we do not believe that it undermines our fundamental conclusion. In isolation, one cue is unlikely to produce lasting change. In conjunction, a series of reinforcing cues should chip away at the initial value position precisely because this position lacks much in the way of cognitive justification. The key to the process, then, would be for the parties and their spokespersons to take consistent left‐right positions on political values. The polarization research cited above suggests that they have done so in recent decades. Again, even if citizens’ interpretations of party‐cued value messages lead to short‐term changes in political value expression rather than in latent value positions, the cumulative impact of a series of party cues over time should lead to long‐term modification of core political principles."
"45","Next, we reiterate that partisanship does not motivate citizens to abandon their political values. Our findings suggest partisanship influences value support at the margins rather than inducing wholesale change. Republicans do not reject equal opportunity when informed that Democrats believe in it, nor do Democrats abandon self‐reliance when told that Republicans are for it; instead, expressed support for these values cools slightly. Hence, no claim is made that political values are nonessential elements in mass belief systems, on par with judgments about presidential performance or evaluations of the economy. Our claim is simply that the political value positions citizens are willing to endorse depend partly on Democratic‐Republican identifications."
"46","We conclude by noting some of the broader implications our findings have for the study of public opinion and political psychology. First, the findings complement nonexperimental studies documenting partisan bias over a wide range of other political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors (Bartels 2002; Green and Palmquist 1990). Our contribution on this score is showing that party affects normative political beliefs. Second, the evidence that out‐party cues exert more influence over value judgments than in‐party cues complements a large body of research documenting negativity bias in politics across diverse areas, such as evaluations of political candidates (e.g., Goren 2002), evaluations of political institutions (e.g., Grosskopf and Mondak 1997), and retrospective voting (Hetherington 1996), to name but a few. It seems clear that “bad” party cues are stronger than “good” party cues (Baumeister et al. 2001). Finally, our results speak to questions regarding the nature of human belief. While it is true that people can work out what they believe is best for society irrespective of their group loyalties, it seems fair to say that group attachments usually weigh rather heavily on such beliefs (Greene 1999). In the domain of public affairs, a citizen's commitment to a particular vision of the good and just society may be swayed by what partisan friends and foes believe.         "
