"1","Over the last 30 years, increased foreign investment has promoted rapid industrial development and well‐paid jobs for many workers in developing countries. Yet there is also considerable evidence that foreign direct investment is associated with increases in industrial strikes and protests. The recent labor strife in China's high‐growth export sector, for example, is not a new development but rather the culmination of decades of conflict between migrant workers and management in foreign‐owned firms (Gallagher 2005). Nor is China exceptional. Violence and acts of extreme desperation were the hallmarks of protest in Sri Lanka's export processing zones in the late 1990s (Teitelbaum 2007). In the early 1990s Southeast Asian countries also experienced a surge of social protest on the part of workers engaged in export‐oriented production (Kammen 1997). Even in the supposedly quiescent post‐Communist space, foreign investors have recently become a primary target for labor mobilization by independent labor organizers (Greene and Robertson 2009). This three‐way relationship between FDI, rising wealth, and rising protest presents a puzzle: why does foreign direct investment bring increases in worker protest?         "
"2","One possibility is that investment is associated with upturns in the business cycle, which generate scarcity in labor markets, increase worker leverage, and so lead to more strikes (Ashenfelter and Johnson 1969; Kennan 1986). However, there are at least three deeper reasons why foreign firms in particular are likely to be more vulnerable to labor unrest than their domestic counterparts, whatever the point in the business cycle. The first relates to the social dislocation associated with rapid inflows of foreign direct investment in low‐ and middle‐income countries (Piore and Schrank 2006). Foreign‐dominated sectors are usually located in cities or special economic zones and are staffed primarily with recent migrants from far‐flung rural areas. These workers leave their villages and traditional social networks and are very vulnerable to abuse by their employers. However, they are socially isolated, and so have few traditional networks or institutionalized means to address their grievances. As a result, these kinds of workers are more likely than other workers to engage in strikes.         "
"3","A second reason derives from the reputational costs of labor repression. With international reputations to protect, foreign investors are often less likely to be in a position to use repression against labor organizers or striking workers. This is because foreign companies have broader interests than just the particular country in which organizing is taking place. Foreign investors who are seen as complicit in using force or extreme measures to inhibit strikes may be vulnerable to sanction by their own home country nationals, unions, international human rights groups, and consumers in the rich countries for which production is intended (Keck and Sikkink 1998). The other side of this coin too is that domestic governments for their part may have some reluctance to be seen using their repressive apparatus to defend the interests of foreigners against their own citizens.         "
"4","A third reason pertains to the structure of multinational production. As is well known, contemporary multinational production often relies on long and complex supply chains with little built‐in redundancy, making multinational production vulnerable to stoppages in one country (Moody 1997). This tends to give would‐be labor organizers better prospects of success in trying to organize in foreign firms. In addition, the multisite nature of multinational production creates unique opportunities for the articulation of grievances that are unlikely to arise for domestic employers. The globalization of production means that multinational firms often have workers performing similar jobs in different countries under very different conditions and for very different wages. Workers can often access this information, making it easier for labor organizers to focus discontent on the injustice of current conditions, even if these may be better than those prevalent in domestic firms or in nonindustrial employment. Since information is a crucial part of organizing protests and strikes (Javeline 2003), organizers in multinational firms are more likely to frame their grievances not in terms of wages and conditions in their own country, but in terms of those of workers doing similar jobs for more money within the same firm in a different country. This has clearly been the case, for example, in strikes at Ford and General Motors plants in Russia (Vecherniaia Moskva 2007). The possibility of creating such international “injustice frames” makes foreign‐owned enterprises an inviting target for would‐be labor organizers.         "
"5","Hence, even if FDI has a net or long‐run positive impact on incomes and economic growth, and even if jobs in foreign firms are often better paying than the domestic alternatives, there are strong reasons to expect that increases in foreign investment are likely to lead to increases in labor protest."
"6","In long‐standing democracies, protest is both a normal and a frequent element of political life. Indeed, some have argued that contemporary liberal democracies are increasingly “movement societies” in which the diffusion and professionalization of protest have made it part of the standard repertoire of political participation for many ordinary citizens (Meyer and Tarrow 1998). Consequently, democracies generally have higher levels of protest than nondemocratic regimes (Goldstone 2004; Tilly 1978). It might seem reasonable then, given our arguments about the effect of FDI on protest, to expect FDI to lead to larger increases in industrial protest in democracies, where strikes enjoy more legal protections. However, we argue in this section that while democracies are likely to feature more protest than autocracies, they also have other characteristics that make them better able to manage conflict, including industrial conflict associated with FDI. Specifically, two mechanisms enable democracies to handle worker grievances better than authoritarian regimes—political competition and the provision of freedom of association rights. We argue that these institutional mechanisms make democratic regions better equipped to handle the dislocations associated with FDI than authoritarian regimes. We therefore hypothesize that the marginal effect of investment on industrial protest will actually decline as the level of democracy rises: a given increase in FDI should have a larger effect on protest in more authoritarian regimes and a smaller effect in more democratic places.         "
"7","The effect of an increase in foreign investment in a given country is likely to be strongly conditioned by the degree of political competition in that country. This is because increases in the degree of political competition fundamentally change the nature of the interaction between workers, employers, and the state from one of repression to one of negotiation and exchange."
"8","In entirely closed authoritarian regimes, where there is no public political competition, the dominant approach to dealing with the tensions associated with foreign investment is repression, followed perhaps by paternalistic gestures designed to assuage or at least distract from underlying grievances. This method has been typical in regimes such as contemporary China. However, introducing even a degree of political competition, as in competitive authoritarian regimes such as Mexico under PRI hegemony or present‐day Russia, begins to change the relationship. In these systems, the possibility of electoral difficulties for incumbents, whether in terms of actual results or just turnout, shifts a degree of power away from the state and gives at least some negotiating power to social organizations such as labor unions (Magaloni 2006).            "
"9","As we move further along the scale of increasing political competition, political parties have autonomy from the state and the relationship between unions and other social organizations and the state changes radically. First, the political costs of a “crush” strategy of directly repressing workers' organizations are likely to become untenable (though of course a myriad of laws can be created to make organizing difficult). Second, where political competition is more open, political parties are forced to incorporate working‐class voters and their organizations in order to win elections. Historically, in Europe, the effort to compete for and incorporate the votes of workers led to the emergence of labor‐based socialist parties on the left (Przeworski and Sprague 1986) and Christian Democratic parties on the right (Kalyvas 1996), creating a relationship of “political exchange,” and effectively shifting the locus of class politics from the industrial relations to the political arena (Swenson 1989).            "
"10","In terms of protest, the emergence of political exchange dramatically altered the character of strikes. In Western countries, the integration of unions into politics generally made strikes shorter, but more frequent and larger as the working class became better organized (Shorter and Tilly 1971). Where the process of political incorporation of labor went furthest, in the Nordic countries and Austria, labor‐based social‐democratic parties gained power and designed a system in which the dominance of working‐class organizations rendered contention in labor markets superfluous, almost completely eliminating strikes (Hibbs 1978; Korpi and Shalev 1980).            "
"11","The historical experience of Northern Europe, of course, is not likely to repeat itself in the developing world, but there is nonetheless evidence that increasing political competition in places like India has driven political parties to seek to become more encompassing and to restrain union allies from engaging in politically costly strikes (Teitelbaum 2010a). Moreover, though the qualitative change in the nature of relations between unions, employers, and the state brought about by political competition does not always translate into lower levels of strike activity, our claim is that as political competition increases and parties increasingly integrate workers’ interests into their strategies, conflicts that might previously have led to an industrial dispute are more likely to be dealt with on a political level, without a strike. Sometimes, particularly when structural adjustment policies or radical reforms challenge the existing system of interest articulation, this politicization of conflict can lead to increased protest (Murillo 2001; Robertson 2004). More often, however, shifting conflict from the factory to the political level will yield a more stable equilibrium that results in fewer industrial disputes.            "
"12","The other mechanism that we argue contributes to fewer strikes in response to changes in FDI is the provision of worker rights such as the right to establish and join worker organizations, the right to collectively bargain, the right to strike, and the right to freely engage in other union‐related activities. The degree to which governments protect such rights varies systematically with regime type, with democracies providing more robust protections of worker rights than authoritarian regimes (Kucera 2001, Appendix A.2). This association between regime type and labor rights helps to explain why democracies do better in managing FDI than authoritarian regimes.            "
"13","Leaders in democratic countries grant labor rights not simply out of altruism and fairness, but out of the recognition that industrial conflict is costly to both employers and workers and can negatively affect growth. Consequently, democracies have put considerable effort into developing institutional solutions that help to address informational asymmetries that can lead to bargaining failures and strikes (Hicks 1932). These institutions, which include labor review boards, independent conciliation services, and legislation designed to facilitate collective bargaining, promote respect for workers’ rights and, while far from entirely eliminating strikes, have markedly reduced their occurrence, as well as shaping their incidence (Card 1988).            "
"14","The provision of workers’ rights, particularly granting workers greater freedom to form worker organizations and engage in union activities, provides democracies with an advantage over authoritarian and hybrid regimes in the management of industrial conflict. Freedom of association gives workers independence from employers and the state that allows the organization of effective trade unions and the negotiation of legally binding collective bargaining agreements, the foundation of long‐term labor peace (Kucera 2007). For the same reason, the right to form a union and the right to engage in union activities enhance the effectiveness of labor institutions as well as the benefits of union‐party ties. Without freedom of association, institutions such as labor courts, tribunals, and arbitration proceedings become mechanisms for the imposition of employers’ interests and state‐labor ties a mechanism for the cooptation of workers. Consequently, freedom of association is essential if grievances are to be adequately resolved, rather than temporarily repressed.            "
"15","In sum, we have argued that democracy is likely to moderate the effects of FDI on strikes both due to the political competition democracy fosters and through the rights that democracies grant. In the remainder of the article we test these propositions, using both broad measures of democracy that capture democratic political institutions and civil rights, and more specific measures of political competition and freedom of association."
"16","Comparative studies of the causes and effects of protest have been hampered by the absence of reliable, cross‐national datasets. The gathering of reliable data on protest is time‐consuming and requires large investments of time and resources (Mueller 1997). Consequently, cross‐national studies that are careful about measuring protest have been limited to a relatively small number of countries, achieving validity of measurement at the expense of generalizability (Ekiert and Kubik 1998). Larger datasets, especially those that rely on press reports, achieve generalizability but tend to suffer from reporting bias introduced by the heavy reliance on a single source or a handful of sources. To address this issue, Earl et al. (2004) recommend the “triangulation of multiple sources” to record more events and to incorporate multiple descriptions of those events.            "
"17","For our analysis, we use data from the High Profile Strikes Dataset (HPSD), which allows for the analyst to distinguish among a greater number of strike characteristics and corrects for some of the reporting bias of available measures. The data for the HPSD come from press reports, which were gathered using broad search terms (e.g., “labor” and “strikes”) to gather all articles in the “World Publications” section of the Nexis database documenting political or economic trade union protest in all countries that could be categorized as “non‐OECD countries” as of 1980. This process yielded 1,069 protest events in 84 countries from 1980 to 2005, of which 603 can be clearly defined as industrial disputes and 351 as political strikes.4"
"18","While it cannot cover every strike that occurs in the developing world, a key advantage of the HPSD is that it draws on a broader range of sources of information to compile its measures than other datasets. The Nexis database includes nearly 700 news sources with international, regional, and country‐specific coverage. In cross‐national studies, the most commonly used measure of strikes is the count of general strikes in the Cross‐National Time‐Series (CNTS) dataset (Banks 2008). The CNTS data are compiled from a single source, the New York Times, reducing the chances of even major strikes in low‐ and middle‐income countries being included. For the period and countries included in our analysis, the CNTS records just 514 strikes—less than half the number recorded in the HPSD. Moreover, a comparison of strikes recorded in the two datasets reveals problems with the regional coverage of the CNTS. Specifically, there is severe undercoverage of Asia and overcoverage of Latin America. Fifty‐one percent of the strikes recorded by CNTS in non‐OECD countries occurred in Latin America and 27% in Asia. In the HPSD, the percentages for Asia and Latin America are almost exactly the opposite (50% and 26%, respectively), though the number of events recorded for Latin America was broadly similar.5 This suggests that the value of the additional sources included to construct the HPSD is primarily in improving coverage outside of the western hemisphere.            "
"19","We measure the level of foreign direct investment using the natural log of FDI flows into a given country/year. Normalizing by gross capital formation (investment) does not change our results (see the online Supporting Information [SI] Table 14), but we think it is inappropriate for our analysis. Normalizing by total investment makes sense when one assumes that FDI will have a larger effect in small economies than large economies; but because FDI generates new employment, we anticipate that the effects of an additional dollar of FDI will have similar effects on the number of protest events in large and small economies.            "
"20","According to our theory of industrial conflict, democracy matters for managing industrial conflict both due to the procedures for winning office and due to the rights that democracies grant. Procedural democracy is important because it encourages electoral competition for workers’ votes, and civil liberties are also crucial because they include the provision of worker rights and the conditions for the enforcement of those rights, such as relatively independent and fair courts. Hence, as the broadest test of our theory we analyze the relationship between labor protest and two measures of democracy: the Polity2 score from the Polity IV dataset as a measure of democratic institutions; and the Freedom House civil liberties index. For our analysis, we invert the Freedom House measure so that higher scores entail more democracy."
"21","To more precisely test the two mechanisms through which democracy influences worker protest, we look at the political competition index from the Polity IV dataset and an index of freedom of association rights."
"22","The Polity IV political competition measure, polcomp, is a 1–10 scale that combines both state regulations over political activity and the nature of the competition that predominates within a regime. At the low end are regimes that completely repress or heavily suppress competition. Places with some competition but where competition is unequal, poorly institutionalized, or sectarian in nature come in the middle of the index, while places with well‐institutionalized, stable political competition score at the upper end of the scale. With its emphasis on competition and institutionalization, this scale should allow a good test of our argument that the response to a given shock will depend on the degree to which workers’ interests are represented at the political level.            "
"23","The precise measurement of freedom of association presents a challenge. As with measuring other labor standards, the central difficulty in measuring FACB rights lies in the dearth of available data. Although the de jure provision of labor rights is relatively easy to assess, the absence of data on collective bargaining coverage and union density makes it difficult to grasp the extent to which workers actually benefit from legal protections. Scholars have dealt with the paucity of data available for the direct measurement of labor rights by relying on expert coding schemes. One increasingly influential approach has been developed by Kucera (2007) and extended by Mosley and Uno (2007) and measures labor rights by recording violations of FACB rights in three textual sources: the U.S. State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the ICFTU's Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights, and the ILO's Report of the Committee of Freedom of Association. We modify this approach to correct for shortcomings in existing indexes and to develop a more specific measure of freedom of association rights.            "
"24","Specifically, we make two key modifications to the Kucera/Mosley and Uno approach. First, we correct for the fact that a large number of countries score high on the existing Kucera/Mosley and Uno index not because they have good freedom of association rights but because their governments are so effective at repressing society that few labor rights abuses are ever reported (Teitelbaum 2010b). To account for this problem, we use the freedom of speech index from the Cingranelli and Richards (2006, CIRI) human rights dataset to weight each violation recorded in the Kucera/Mosley and Uno data. In the countries with the lowest freedom of speech scores, recorded violations are weighted more heavily than those that occur in more free countries. This step corrects for the problem of very repressive places with a low number of recorded violations scoring high on the index.            "
"25","Our second modification to the Kucera/Mosley and Uno approach is to use factor analysis to develop a more specific measure of freedom of association rights. The factor analysis reveals that the recorded violations are of four different kinds, the most coherent set of which incorporates violations related to the ability of workers to join unions and to engage in union activities. We use the indicators that load on this dimension to construct a freedom of association index (as opposed to an index of labor rights more broadly) by generating predicted scores from the factor analysis. Doing so enables us to narrowly test our hypothesis that it is specifically freedom of association rights that mitigate the socially disruptive effects of FDI, rather than just labor rights in general. While still not a perfect measure of freedom of association rights, this modified index is an improvement on the original method. It provides a specific measure of freedom of association rights that is better suited to the purposes of our analysis. It has better face validity than the original method because it does not rank known rights violators high on the index. Finally, the index has better construct validity than the Mosley‐Uno scores in that it correlates positively with standard measures of democracy.6"
"26","In analyzing the effects of investment and regime on protest, we control for a range of existing theories of strike patterns related to bargaining power, business cycles, and hardship. The essential insight of bargaining power theories is that we should expect to see more mobilization in regions where workers’capacity to self‐organize is high (Snyder 1977). Capturing the capacity for self‐organization of workers is tremendously difficult, particularly in a broad cross‐national analysis. Standard approaches using union density are largely useless outside of the OECD because even where data do exist, we have no general way of telling whether unions reflect workers’ self‐organization, or efforts by the state to control workers (Robertson 2007). In the absence of better data, we are limited to controlling for the level of urbanization, a factor that has been consistently shown to be related to organizational capacity (Javeline 2003).            "
"27","As noted earlier, bargaining power is also related to business cycles. In advanced industrial economies, the expectation is that the best time to strike is when labor markets are tightening, unemployment is falling, and workers are in shorter supply, and so are relatively stronger. We use GDP growth and inflation as proxies for the economic cycle.            "
"28","There is an older tradition in comparative politics that associates protest with hardship (Gurr 1970). Economic hardship might be expected to affect protest levels in at least two ways. First, there is the effect of hardship itself. One view holds that the greater the hardship experienced, the more strikes we should see. Second, theories of wildcat strikes, that is, protest without the sanction of officially recognized labor unions, suggest that such action is more likely when hardship provokes a sense of moral outrage or injustice (Gouldner 1954; Zetka 1992). As a measure of absolute and relative hardship, we control for GDP per capita and changes in GDP, and we look at exchange rate changes to control for financial crises.            "
"29","To control for the effects of other aspects of globalization, we include trade openness, measured as the sum of imports and exports divided by GDP. We also include population to control for the possibility that larger countries will experience a higher volume of protest than smaller countries. We include a time counter to account for the possibility that democracy, FDI, and protest are all upward‐trending variables."
"30","In Table 1, we look at the effects of investment, democracy, political competition, and freedom of association rights on industrial protest. The analysis treats the dependent variable as a time‐series cross‐section of annual counts, modeled using a negative binomial distribution. This approach is preferred to account for the discrete, nonnegative nature of the dependent variable, and because it models directly overdispersion (contagion) in the observed counts (Hausman, Hall, and Griliches 1984). Since the number of countries is relatively large, we estimate random effects models. The models include a one‐period lagged dependent variable. This is appropriate for two reasons. First, as is well known, strikes tend to take place more often where they have taken place before, so previous events have an effect on the number of events in the future. Second, strikes in reality occur continuously rather than as separate annual observations, as they appear in a dataset. As a result, strike counts in a given year can be directly affected by continuing strikes from the previous year. Extensive robustness tests using different control variables and different model specifications are shown in the SI.         "
"31","To recap, we hypothesized that the effect of both FDI and democracy on strikes would be positive, but that democracy would condition the effect of FDI on protest. Model 1 presents the direct effects of FDI and democracy on protest. As expected, both FDI and democracy have a statistically significant and substantively large effect on the number of strikes. According to the model, an increase of one unit in the natural log of FDI (which ranges from −9 to +11) increases the expected number of strikes by 30%, whereas an increase of one unit in the 21‐point Polity score leads the expected number of strikes to increase by about 7%."
"32","However, according to our argument, Model 1 is misspecified, since it does not include the interactive effects that we have claimed for democracy and FDI. Theoretically, we would expect the effect of FDI on protest to be conditioned by the level of democracy, both through democratic procedures and through the extension of civil rights. Models 2 and 3 show the results when the interaction of democracy and investment is included. In Model 2 we use the Polity2 measure of democracy to capture the effects of democratic procedures. As expected, the interaction effect is significant and negative. While FDI leads to higher levels of protest, the effect decreases as a country becomes more democratic."
"33","In Figure 1A we illustrate this by graphing the total marginal effect (the direct effect plus the interaction effect) of a one‐unit increase in the log of FDI flows on protest at different levels of democracy. At very low levels of democracy (Polity2 equal to −9), a one‐unit increase in log FDI flows increases the expected number of strikes by a factor of 1.99. However, as the level of democracy increases this effect, though still positive, declines. At high levels of democracy, for example at a Polity2 score of 6, a one‐unit increase in the log of FDI flows only increases the expected number of strikes by a factor of 1.22. At Polity2 scores of 8 and higher the effect of increases in FDI on strikes is statistically indistinguishable from 0. As the figure shows, the factor changes at high and low levels of democracy are also clearly statistically different from one another.         "
"34","                 (A) Effect of FDI on Strikes at Different Levels of Democracy Rights. (B) Effect of FDI on Strikes at Different Levels of Civil Rights. (C) Effect of FDI on Strikes at Different Levels of Political Competition. (D) Effect of FDI on Strikes at Different Levels of Freedom of Association Rights.                      "
"35","Model 3 presents the same analysis, but using the Freedom House index of civil rights instead of the Polity scores. The results are very similar to those in Model 2. Figure 1B illustrates the marginal effects. Using Freedom House civil rights, we see that the greater capacity of democracies to manage conflict means that, although the effect of a one‐unit increase in the log of FDI flows increases the number of strikes by a factor of 1.84 in countries ranked at 7 on the Freedom House civil liberties index (1 on the inverted scale shown in the graph), the effect is indistinguishable from 0 at 95% confidence intervals in countries that score 3 or better (5 on the inverted scale used here).         "
"36","In Models 4 and 5 we test our claims about the mechanisms through which we expect the moderating influence of democracy to work. To recap, we posited two primary mechanisms: political competition and association rights. In terms of political competition we argued that competition for the working‐class vote leads in turn to a series of institutions, such as union‐party links, that help to manage the strains associated with foreign direct investment. To show this, we test the political competition subcomponent of the Polity IV dataset separately. The results are similar to what we found before, namely, the interaction effect of FDI flows and political competition is significant and negative. Where levels of political competition are low, increases in FDI have a large effect on the probability of a strike taking place, but where political competition is high, these effects are greatly reduced."
"37","These effects are illustrated in Figure 1C. For example, when political competition is scored as a 2 on the 1–10 scale, a one‐unit increase in log FDI flows increases the expected number of strikes by a factor of 1.75. By contrast, at a political competition score of 9 on the political competition index, the effect of a one‐unit increase in the log of FDI on strikes is only 1.1 and statistically indistinguishable from 0.         "
"38","Finally, in Model 5, we look at the effects of labor rights, as measured by our index of freedom of association rights. Once again, the regression results follow the same pattern, with a negative and significant coefficient on the interaction between FDI flows and freedom of association rights. Figure 1D shows the marginal effects. The effect of a one‐unit increase in log FDI flows at the 10th percentile of FACB rights (−1.99 on the scale) is to increase the expected number of strikes by a factor of 1.88. At the 90th percentile (.85) on the scale, the effect falls to a factor of 1.18 before becoming no longer statistically significant. Once again, the effects at the different ends of the percentile range are clearly statistically different from one another.         "
"39","The results presented in this section provide strong support for our hypotheses about the conditional effects of investment on labor protest. The regression results and the marginal effects plots confirm a direct effect of increases in both FDI and democracy on industrial protest. However, they also show a strong interaction effect that illustrates the capacity of democracy, and of political competition and freedom of association rights in particular, to moderate the stresses of development."
"40","In this article, we used a new dataset to investigate the relationship between globalization and labor protest in non‐OECD countries. We have shown that both FDI and democracy are positively associated with labor protest, but that the positive effect of FDI on labor protest is conditioned by the degree of democracy both as a result of the effects of political competition and of freedom of association rights."
"41","These results have implications for long‐standing debates in the comparative and international political economy of development between those who think a strong authoritarian hand is needed to manage economic development in low‐ and middle‐income countries and those who believe that democracy provides better results. While we have expressly not compared economic outcomes under different regime types, we have compared how authoritarian and democratic strategies condition the effect of economic flows on protest. We have shown that advocates of a “strong hand” are mostly wrong, and that when they are partly right, it is for the wrong reasons. It is not true that authoritarian regimes are likely to provide a quieter place for international corporations to invest. Although it is true that democracy in less developed countries may lead to higher levels of social protest, that effect is largely a product of the liberalizing effects of democracy itself and has little to do with foreign investment. In fact, democracy helps low‐ and middle‐income countries deal with the inevitable stresses associated with foreign‐owned factories and improves their capacity to process the inevitable conflicts that arise."
"42","Further research is required on the precise ways in which democracies mitigate conflict. We have demonstrated a general set of relationships and proposed a set of potential mechanisms that underlie those relationships. We have not, however, directly tested which mechanisms for the institutionalization of conflict are most effective. Nor have we addressed the important issue of whether democratic institutions actually solve the problems of working people in a context of globalization, or whether they just provide safety valves through which elites manage protest and avoid making real concessions. These questions constitute an important research agenda."
"43","Similarly, further research is needed on labor relations in contemporary authoritarian regimes. The arguments in this article also engage the growing literature within comparative politics on varieties of authoritarianism in the contemporary world. The resilience of nondemocratic forms of government has renewed interest in how different kinds of nondemocracies function (Diamond 2002; Levitsky and Way 2010). Much of this literature looks at institutions such as legislatures (Gandhi 2008; Kim and Gandhi 2010), or at political parties (Smith 2005) and hierarchical labor unions (Robertson 2007) that help authoritarians manage politics. Here we demonstrate the importance of two mechanisms, political competition and association rights, that are clearly likely to affect how formal institutions like legislatures and organizations like unions function and so may well underlie some of the existing findings. Exploring these relationships more closely will be important to understanding the economic and political dynamics of contemporary authoritarianism.         "
"44","The analysis here also adds nuance to debates about globalization and labor rights. The relative advantages of democracy over dictatorship in the competition among states for scare investment capital are probably underestimated by investors. The very noisiness and contentiousness of developing democracies are usually seen as negatives from the perspective of multinational corporations. However, the more competitive and vibrant a democracy is, our analysis suggests, the better prepared a country is to handle increases in foreign investment. This is both important as a policy conclusion and a significant addition to existing scholarly debates on both globalization and contentious politics."
