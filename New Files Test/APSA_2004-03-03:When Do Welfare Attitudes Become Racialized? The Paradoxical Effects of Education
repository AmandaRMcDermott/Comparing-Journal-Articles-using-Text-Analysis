"1","Given these troubling implications, researchers have begun to ask whether there are factors which might inhibit the “racialization” process (Huckfeldt and Kohlfeld 1989; Sniderman and Carmines 1997; see also Monteith and Voils 2001). In this regard, education is perhaps one of the most likely candidates. As a large body of research suggests, higher levels of educational attainment—particularly the completion of a college degree—are associated with increased racial tolerance and more positive attitudes toward blacks (Greeley and Sheatsley 1974; Lipset 1960; McClosky and Zaller 1984; Steinberg and Selznick 1969; Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991; Sniderman and Piazza 1993). This effect is thought to be mediated by two psychological changes associated with the educational process: (1) an improved understanding and internalization of democratic norms (e.g., McClosky and Zaller 1984) and (2) improved cognitive skills, which enhance people's ability to recognize the logical implications of the norms they internalize and act in accordance with them (Bobo and Licari 1989; Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991).         "
"2","Results like these suggest a relatively straightforward hypothesis about the racialization of welfare attitudes. Compared to those without college degrees, opposition to welfare may be less connected to perceptions of blacks among college‐educated respondents, since the latter should be more aware of the norm of tolerance and more inclined to correct for the tendency to cognitively link perceptions of African Americans with welfare (Monteith and Voils 2001). Instead, we might expect college‐educated individuals to rely more heavily on abstract, race‐neutral political concepts like ideology, since education has also been linked to an improved ability to make use of these relatively complex bases for political judgment (Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991; see also McClosky and Zaller 1984). While this hypothesis has not been examined in the context of welfare attitudes, it has received a great deal of attention in the broader literature on race and politics, where it has especially informed the “politics‐centered” perspective on white racial‐policy attitudes (Sniderman and Piazza 1993). One of the key tenets of this perspective is that changes in white racial attitudes over the course of the last forty years have substantially reduced the impact of prejudice on racial‐policy reasoning, most notably among individuals educated enough (1) to see the contradiction between prejudice and democratic values and (2) to use abstract political concepts like ideology. A number of sophisticated analyses have provided evidence for this hypothesis in the case of explicitly racial policy attitudes. For example, Sniderman and Piazza (1993) have shown that college‐educated whites are less likely than whites without college degrees to employ a double standard by offering more support for government efforts to guarantee equal opportunity for women than for similar efforts targeted at blacks. Moreover, their analyses suggest that ideology is the strongest predictor of policy attitudes among these respondents, regardless of the group the policy is designed to assist (see Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991).         "
"3","However, a closer look at the argument that education enhances both the learning of democratic norms and the development of skills that allow people to apply these norms suggests the role of education may be more complicated this traditional account suggests. More precisely, once we entertain the possibility that these two mediating factors may not have uniformly liberalizing effects with regard to the impact of racial perceptions, a clearer picture emerges. On one hand, as most research on education suggests, individuals with more schooling may have indeed learned that racial hostility is inconsistent with the principle of tolerance. Thus, if we look directly at the “main effect” of education on racial perceptions, we should find a pattern broadly consistent with the spirit of the politics‐centered approach to racial‐policy attitudes and most other work on the effects of education—that is, negative racial perceptions should be less evident among the college‐educated than they are among respondents without college degrees.         "
"4","On the other hand, the other correlate of educational attainment—an improved ability to connect policies with general predispositions—may not always be associated with positions which are less informed by negative racial perceptions. Rather, the likelihood of this outcome may depend critically on whether one has actually internalized tolerant norms. Relevant to this point, it is clear that education by no means eliminates intolerance altogether, even though it does reduce the overall proportion of people who endorse intolerant ideas. Even among well‐educated citizens, there is still considerable variance in racial attitudes (Jackman 1978; Sidanius, Pratto, and Bobo 1996). If education makes it easier for people to draw conclusions about specific policies which resonate more strongly with their general predispositions, then this may happen among both those negatively and positively inclined toward blacks: consistent with their respective predispositions, individuals who perceive blacks negatively should display more negative attitudes toward race‐linked policies, while individuals who perceive blacks more positively should display more positive attitudes. In this vein, a number of studies suggest that attitudes toward blacks are actually more strongly associated with explicitly race‐related policy attitudes among the college educated than they are among those without college degrees, contrary to the spirit of the politics‐centered model (Federico and Sidanius 2002a, 2002b; Sidanius, Pratto, and Bobo 1996). For example, Federico and Sidanius (2002a, 2002b) found that the relationship between perceptions of black racial inferiority and opposition to affirmative action was stronger among the college‐educated than it was among those without college degrees. Thus, if we were to look at the relationship between racial perceptions and policy attitudes among those with different levels of education—rather than looking at the “main effect” of education on racial perceptions—we should find a pattern more consistent with criticisms of the politics‐centered approach: a stronger relationship between racial perceptions and policy opinions among the college‐educated than among those without college degrees, despite a tendency for education to be associated with fewer negative racial perceptions.         "
"5","However, we must also remember that the reasoning behind the second part of this hypothesis has its roots in research on explicitly racial policies, such as affirmative action. With regard to the latter, it is perhaps not as surprising that education is associated with a stronger relationship between racial perceptions and policy attitudes, since the racial relevance of the policy is clear. In the case of welfare, though, the applicability of this prediction is not as clear. Unlike opinions about affirmative action, attitudes toward welfare are only implicitly racial. Moreover, they can much more easily be framed in terms of nonracial ideological conflicts over the role of government and self‐reliance (Feldman and Zaller 1992; Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991). This raises the alternative possibility that results more consistent with the politics‐centered model might be found for welfare attitudes. That is, contrary to the predictions offered here, education may be associated with both a weaker tendency to perceive blacks negatively and a weaker relationship between racial perceptions and policy attitudes; instead, ideology may be the stronger predictor of welfare attitudes among the well‐educated. On the other hand, recent work by Mendelberg (2001) implies that the effect of education on the relationship between racial perceptions and policy attitudes may actually be stronger in the case of implicitly racial issues. In this vein, Mendelberg's work suggests that the policy impact of negative racial perceptions is more likely to be blocked when perceivers believe that a given stance violates tolerant, egalitarian norms. Given the aforementioned socialization effects of education, this self‐censoring tendency is likely to be stronger among the college‐educated. However, implicitly racial issues make an end run around norms of equality and tolerance: perceivers are not aware of their reliance on racial perceptions when making judgments about issues like welfare, thereby short‐circuiting the self‐censoring mechanism. So, if education is unable to weaken the relationship between racial perceptions and explicitly racial policy attitudes, it may be even less effective with regard to implicitly‐racial policies.         "
"6","However, even if the hypothesis developed here does provide a better fit to the data, other studies suggest the need for additional qualifications. In particular, a long line of work has indicated that the attitudes of the well‐educated are generally more tightly bundled, across many domains (Converse 1964; Judd et al. 1981; Zaller 1992). This suggests that any tendency for education to be associated with a stronger relationship between racial perceptions and policy attitudes may be nonspecific. If so, then we might expect both (1) a stronger relationship between all predispositions (not just racial ones) and welfare attitudes among the college‐educated; and (2) a stronger relationship between racial perceptions and a variety of policy outcomes, not just race‐linked ones.         "
"7","However, for a variety of reasons, the perspective advanced here suggests that this should not be the case. First of all, as noted above, previous work strongly suggests that race has been the primary frame for public discussion of welfare and the least “sympathetic” forms of poverty over the last few decades (Gilens 1999; Mendelberg 2001). If race has indeed dominated public discussions of welfare—if only covertly—then the tendency for various predispositions to be more strongly linked among the well‐educated may be limited to race‐related predispositions. Consistent with this reasoning, studies suggest that cognitive skill tends to strengthen the relationship between a given issue‐relevant consideration and policy attitudes only when that consideration is frequently invoked in public discourse on that issue (Chong 1996; Goren 2002). This argument also speaks to the possibility that the interaction between education and racial perceptions may not be specific to welfare attitudes. In this vein, it is clear that not all forms of public assistance have become implicitly racialized. Only the programs commonly thought of as “welfare” appear to be evaluated primarily in terms of racial perceptions; the “welfare” cue appears to be critical to the activation of race (Gilens 1999). If this is the case, then the tendency for education to be associated with a stronger relationship between racial perceptions and policy opinions may be more evident with regard to evaluations of policies which have become discursively linked to race, i.e., welfare programs. In contrast, the predictive power of racial perceptions may not vary as strongly as a function of education with regard to policies not implicitly framed in terms of race, such as generalized “spending on the poor.” As such, these considerations suggest that the interaction between education and racial perceptions may be quite complex, and not merely an artifact of the general tendency for the well‐educated to show more attitude constraint.         "
"8","As noted earlier, previous work on welfare attitudes suggests that opposition to the policy may be anchored in the perception that welfare recipients are predominantly black. Consistent with this argument, Gilens (1999) has found that negative evaluations of specific welfare recipients are more strongly associated with negative evaluations of the policy in general among whites who are asked to make judgments about black (rather than white) recipients. In the present context, findings like these raise the issue of how this “racialized” generalization of attitudes toward specific welfare recipients to the program as a whole might intersect with education.         "
"9","In this vein, much of the belief‐systems work cited earlier implies that education should be associated with closer connections between attitudes toward specific applications of a policy and global evaluations of it. As noted earlier, this is because education is typically associated with more tightly organized representations of political objects and a stronger ability to perceive connections between related attitude objects (e.g., Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991). This suggests that the relationship between evaluations of specific recipients and attitudes toward welfare in general should be stronger among the college‐educated, regardless of the recipients' race. However, the perspective developed here suggests that the effects of education on this relationship may depend on who respondents have in mind when they think about welfare. As we have seen, work on the effects of sophistication‐related dimensions suggests that variables like education strengthen the relationship between policy‐relevant cognitions and policy attitudes only when that consideration is frequently invoked in public discourse (see especially Chong 1996). Since black stereotypes are now a dominant subtext in discussions of means‐tested assistance (Gilens 1999; Goren 2002), evaluations of black welfare recipients may be more strongly integrated into people's cognitive representations of “welfare” than evaluations of white recipients. If this is the case, then the relationship between evaluations of specific welfare recipients and attitudes toward welfare in general may be stronger among the college‐educated only when the recipients belong to a group stereotypically associated with welfare, i.e., blacks.         "
"10","The studies reported here explore the possibility that the racialization of welfare attitudes may be conditional on education in a number of complex ways. Study 1 uses data from two national surveys to demonstrate (1) that the college‐educated are less likely to perceive blacks as lazy and overly interested in “special favors,” and that they are less likely to see blacks as dependent on the welfare system; (2) that racial perceptions—but not nonracial political predispositions—are nevertheless more strongly related to welfare attitudes among the college‐educated, and (3) that this moderating effect of education is far more pronounced with regard to forms of assistance which have become implicitly race‐linked than with regard to other forms of assistance. In doing so, these analyses also demonstrate that the tendency for racial perceptions to be more strongly related to policy attitudes among the college‐educated extends not only to explicitly racial policies like affirmative action, but also to implicitly racial ones like welfare. In turn, Study 2 demonstrates that the interactive effects of education are even more specific, facilitating the generalization of attitudes toward specific recipients to welfare in general only when recipients are members of a group stereotypically associated with welfare, i.e., blacks. Since the argument developed here turns (in part)on the discursive prominence of the welfare issue, and recent work suggests that the overall salience of this issue has declined greatly in both media coverage and mass attitudes since the 1996 welfare reforms (Shaw and Shapiro 2002a, 2002b), both studies relied on data taken from surveys conducted between 1990 and 1992. During this time, the salience of the welfare issue and its racialized components was relatively high (see Gilens 1999).         "
"11","Study 1 used data from the 1992 National Election Study (NES; N= 2,487) and the 1990 General Social Survey (GSS; N= 1,372). Both of these surveys fell within the aforementioned time frame, and together, they included all of the measures needed for the key analyses. Given the focus of this study, only non‐Hispanic whites from each dataset were used (n = 1,880, in the NES; n = 1,150, in the GSS). Except for age and income, all variables described below were recoded to run from 0 to 1. Coding details and descriptive statistics (for the 0–1 codings) can be found in the appendix.         "
"12","Racial Resentment.  Previous work on race and welfare suggests that the negative racial attitudes most strongly linked to welfare opposition are those depicting blacks as lazy, insufficiently self‐reliant, and overly demanding (Gilens 1999). In order to tap this racial‐attitude dimension, four items measuring “racial resentment” were used. These items tap into the “belief that blacks do not try hard enough to overcome the difficulties that they face and that they take what they have not earned” (Kinder and Sanders 1996, 105–06), providing a good fit to the racial‐hostility dimension believed to drive welfare opposition. Higher scores indicate greater resentment.               "
"13","Work‐Ethic Perceptions.  While the racial‐resentment measure does tap into many of the perceptions central to racially mediated welfare opposition, the items included in it have been criticized for their conceptual overlap with nonracial conservatism and beliefs about government (e.g., Sniderman and Tetlock 1986; see also Sears et al. 2000). While this potential hazard was minimized somewhat by the inclusion of several nonracial controls in the multivariate analyses which follow, the analyses were also replicated using a single‐item work‐ethic perceptions index measuring the degree to which blacks were seen as lazy. Higher scores indicate stronger perceptions of black laziness.               "
"14","Political Predispositions.  In order to get a clearer look at the unique effects of racial perceptions, several political predispositions were included in the analyses as controls. More specifically, four dimensions highlighted by earlier research on welfare attitudes (see especially Gilens 1999; see also Hasenfeld and Rafferty 1989; Kluegel and Smith 1986) and more explicitly racial policies (e.g., Federico and Sidanius 2002b; Kinder and Sanders 1996) were included: (1) ideology, (2) party identification, (3) beliefs about government, and (4) antiegalitarianism. Since one of the goals of the analyses reported below was to compare the effects of the racial variables to the effects of these controls, composite measures were used whenever possible in order to maximize reliability (Nunally and Bernstein 1994). This is consistent with earlier work in this area as well (e.g., Federico and Sidanius 2002b; Sears et al. 1997). On all scales, higher scores indicated a more “right‐wing” response.               "
"15","Education.  This was assessed using the NES highest‐degree item. Since earlier work on the role of education has focused on the completion of a college degree as a critical educational experience in the development of racial tolerance (e.g., Federico and Sidanius 2002a; Sniderman and Piazza 1993), a dummy variable consisting of the two key educational categories was created: those who had not completed a bachelor's degree (n = 1,404; coded as 0) and those who had (n = 476; coded as 1).1"
"16","Public Assistance Attitudes.  Attitudes toward public assistance were assessed using five items. Following Gilens (1999), three items measured attitudes toward welfare‐related programs (spending on welfare, spending on Food Stamps, ratings of people on welfare), and two measured attitudes toward nonwelfare programs (spending on the poor, spending on the unemployed). Higher responses indicate a more negative attitude to public assistance.               "
"17","Demographics and Controls.  Finally, four demographic variables commonly linked to race‐related attitudes were included as controls (see Federico and Sidanius 2002b): age, gender, income, and a dummy‐coded variable indicating whether the respondent lived in a Southern or non‐Southern state. The income variable also served as an index of economic self‐interest, often identified as a source of welfare opposition (Hasenfeld and Rafferty 1989). This is consistent with the approach taken by other studies of welfare attitudes (Gilens 1996, 1999). Finally, since political expertise has been identified as another potential source of constraint between related political ideas (Zaller 1992), a measure of political knowledge based on ten factual items was also included.               "
"18","Work‐Ethic Perceptions.  This was identical to the NES work‐ethic item.               "
"19","Welfare Dependency Perceptions.  In order to specifically assess stereotypes about blacks and welfare, an additional item asking about black welfare use was examined. Respondents rated blacks on a seven‐point scale anchored by “self‐supporting” on the low end and “live off welfare” on high end. Higher scores indicate a stronger perception that blacks are dependent on welfare.               "
"20","Education.  This variable was assessed and coded in the same way as its NES counterpart: (n= 888, in the no‐bachelor's‐degree group; n= 262, in the bachelor's degree group).               "
"21","Demographics.  The same demographics considered in the 1992 NES were considered in the GSS, and coded in the same fashion.               "
"22","Like traditional accounts of the effects of education, the perspective advanced here suggests that education should be associated with less negative perceptions of blacks along “welfare‐related” dimensions. In order to test this hypothesis in the 1992 NES, one‐way analyses of variance were used to compare the racial perceptions of individuals who had completed a college degree and those who had not. Respondents who had completed a bachelor's degree had lower racial resentment scores (M= .41) than those who had not (M= .53), a difference which was significant, F(1, 1718) = 129.01, p < .0001. To ensure that this pattern was not due to characteristics covarying with education, the groups were also compared using an analysis of covariance. In this analysis, the demographics and political knowledge were included as covariates. Again, however, respondents who had completed bachelors' degrees had lower resentment scores (M= .44) than those who had not (M= .52), even after adjusting for the covariates, F(1, 1643) = 37.82, p < .0001. The results for the work‐ethic perceptions measure were similar, although less pronounced. Respondents who had completed a bachelor's degree had were less likely to see blacks as lazy (M= .58), compared those who had not (M= .61), F(1, 1645) = 7.56, p < .01. However, this difference was weakened when the aforementioned covariates were considered: respondents with a degree had only slightly less negative views of blacks (estimated marginal M= .59) than those without degrees (estimated marginal M= .60), F < 1.2"
"23","These analyses reinforce the notion that education is associated with a weaker tendency to perceive blacks negatively. However, in order to demonstrate this with regard to attitudes which specifically link blacks to welfare dependence, data from the 1990 GSS were used. This survey not only asked respondents about whether blacks were hard‐working or lazy, but also explicitly asked them whether blacks were self‐supporting or dependent on welfare. The results of these analyses reinforced the NES findings. With regard to work‐ethic perceptions, an ANOVA indicated that respondents who had completed a bachelor's degree were less likely to see blacks as lazy (M= .54) compared to those without degrees (M= .59), F(1, 1092) = 10.80, p < .001. An ANCOVA including the demographics produced similar findings. Respondents with bachelors' degrees (M= .53) were less likely to see blacks as lazy compared to those without degrees (M= .58), F(1, 759) = 8.13, p < .01. More importantly, however, a second ANOVA indicated that respondents who had completed a bachelor's degree were less likely to believe that blacks “lived off welfare” (M= .56) compared to those who had not completed one (M= .66), F(1, 1094) = 41.36, p < .0001. Again, an ANCOVA produced similar results. Respondents with degrees were less likely to see blacks as welfare‐dependent (M= .56) compared to respondents without one (M= .66), F(1, 761) = 30.31, p < .0001. Thus, the results reinforce the expectation that education would covary with reduced support for negative racial perceptions commonly linked to welfare opposition among whites.            "
"24","Nevertheless, the argument advanced here also suggests that the relationship between perceptions of blacks and various public assistance attitudes should be stronger among the college‐educated. In order to examine this hypothesis, regression analyses were used to examine both the main effects of the racial‐attitude measures and their interactions with education in the 1992 NES.            "
"25","However, one assumption of both this study and prior work is that people respond differently to assistance programs associated with the “welfare” label than those not associated with it. For example, previous studies suggest that people respond distinctly and more favorably to assistance for the poor or needy than to “welfare” (Smith 1987) and that responses to income‐tested policy stimuli like “welfare” and “Food Stamps” are more heavily associated with racial attitudes (Gilens 1999). In order to confirm that the five public assistance indices measured these two distinct attitudinal dimensions, a simple two‐factor LISREL measurement model was estimated (Joreskog and Sorbom 1993). Spending on welfare, spending on Food Stamps, and feelings about people on welfare were specified as indicators of a “welfare” factor, and spending on the poor and spending on the unemployed were specified as indicators of a “nonwelfare” factor. The two factors were allowed to correlate. Maximum‐likelihood estimation indicated that this model fit the data quite well, χ2 (4) = 3.92, p= .42, AGFI = 1.00; the correlation between the factors was ϕ= .61, p < .001. In contrast, a single‐factor model fit the data poorly, χ2 (5) = 267.70, p < .0001, AGFI = .80.3 As such, the welfare, Food Stamps, and people on welfare items were averaged to form a measure of welfare attitudes (α= .71) and the poor and unemployed items were averaged to form a measure of nonwelfare attitudes (α= .70). Consistent with earlier research, examination of these means using a paired‐samples t‐test indicated that welfare programs (M= .45; SD= .18) were opposed more strongly than nonwelfare programs (M= .24; SD= .19), t (1835) = 45.24, p < .0001.            "
"26","Racial Perceptions, Education, and Welfare Attitudes.  Having made this distinction, we can look at whether the relationship between racial perceptions and welfare attitudes is stronger among the college‐educated. In order to do this, two pairs of hierarchical OLS regression models were estimated. In the first pair, the welfare scale was regressed on racial resentment, four relevant nonracial political predispositions (i.e., ideology, party identification, antiegalitarianism, and beliefs about government), and the two‐way interactions between each attitude and education. The demographics were included in each model as well. In the second pair, the work ethic variable and its interaction with education were substituted for racial resentment and its interaction with education; otherwise, the models were identical. In order to guard against possible estimation inefficiencies introduced by heteroskedasticity, HC3 robust standard errors were used in these analyses (as recommended by Long and Ervin 2000). All variables were centered prior to the analyses as well (Aiken and West 1991).               "
"27","The results using racial resentment are summarized in Table 1. Model 1 simply attempted to replicate the finding that negative perceptions of blacks strongly predict opposition to welfare. In this model, only the demographics, the four nonracial predispositions, and racial resentment were included as predictors. In this model, only two of the demographics were related to welfare attitudes: older respondents were less hostile to welfare (b=−.001, β= .06, p < .05), and consistent with earlier findings (e.g., Hasenfeld and Rafferty 1989), wealthier respondents were more hostile to welfare (b= .004, β= .14, p < .001). Moreover, four of the five attitudinal predictors were significantly and independently related to welfare attitudes (all ps at least <.05); ideology was the only exception. However, consistent with the findings of studies that have used other racial‐attitude measures (e.g., Gilens 1996), the strongest net predictor of welfare attitudes was racial resentment (b= .21, β= .23, p < .001). In fact, the only nonracial predisposition which approached racial resentment in terms of its net predictive power was beliefs about government (b= .19, β= .20, p < .001).               "
"28","In order to see if this relationship was stronger among the college‐educated, the interactions between each attitudinal predictor and education were added to the first‐order terms in Model 2. In Model 2, the interaction between racial resentment and education was positive and significant (b= .17, p < .01), as predicted. However, none of the interactions involving the four nonracial predispositions was significant (all ps > .10), contrary to the alternative hypothesis the politics‐centered model might apply more to implicitly racial policy attitudes (which can, after all, easily be framed in nonracial terms). As expected, this last finding suggests that the tendency for the relationship between predispositions and welfare attitudes to be stronger among the college‐educated may be limited to race‐related predispositions, given the greater discursive prominence of the latter (Gilens 1999).               "
"29","The results involving the work‐ethic perceptions variable (shown in Table 2) were similar. As Model 1 indicates, age (b=−.001, β=−.07, p < .01) and income (b= .004, β= .14, p < .001) were again related to welfare attitudes. Moreover, work‐ethic perceptions significantly predicted welfare opposition (b= .11, β= .12, p < .001) even after the nonracial predictors were considered, although its effect was somewhat weaker than the effect of racial resentment. Finally, as Model 2 indicates, the interaction between work‐ethic perceptions and education was significant as well (b= .13, p < .05). Again, none of the other interactions was significant (all ps > .10).               "
"30","For illustrative purposes, Table 3 provides OLS regression coefficients for the relationship between each predictor and welfare attitudes among respondents for each educational group. These coefficients are taken from models containing the indicated attitudinal predictors, plus the demographics and knowledge (not shown), estimated separately within each of the educational subgroups. Looking at these subgroups, the net relationships between each nonracial predisposition and welfare attitudes are only slightly stronger among the college‐educated, contrary to the alternative hypothesis that the politics‐centered model might apply to welfare attitudes. However, consistent with the perspective developed here, the relationship between racial perceptions and welfare was noticeably stronger among the college‐educated. The relationship between resentment and welfare doubled across groups, from b= .16, among those without a bachelor's degree; to b= .35, among those who had earned one. Similarly, the relationship between work‐ethic perceptions and welfare more than doubled across groups, from b= .08 to b= .21.               "
"31","Racial Perceptions, Education, and Nonwelfare Attitudes.  Although the findings reported above do suggest that the tendency for the relationship between various predispositions and welfare attitudes to be stronger among the college‐educated is limited to racial predispositions, they say nothing about whether the effect of education is stronger with regard to the relationship between racial perceptions and welfare attitudes, or whether it extends just as powerfully to the relationship between racial perceptions and other assistance attitudes. To address this question, the models summarized in Tables 1 and 2 were reestimated, this time using the nonwelfare scale as the dependent variable. These analyses produced a very different pattern of results. First of all, in the main effect models, the effects of racial resentment (b= .08, p < .01), and work‐ethic perceptions (b= .03, p > .10) were weaker in comparison to their effects on welfare attitudes, once the effects of the other predictors were considered.4 Moreover, in the interactive models, neither of these relationships was moderated by education (i.e., b= .08, for the interaction between resentment and education; b= .03, for the interaction between work‐ethic perceptions and education; both ps > .10).5"
"32","Subgroup models similar to those in Table 3 were also estimated for the nonwelfare index. Net of the other predictors, resentment was only weakly related to nonwelfare attitudes among both those without a bachelor's degree (b= .06, p < .05) and those with one (b= .13, p < .05), and its predictive power increased only slightly. Moreover, the net relationship between work‐ethic perceptions and nonwelfare attitudes was weak and nonsignificant in both groups (b= .02, among those without degrees; b= .05, among those with one; both ps > .10).6"
"33","The results of Study 1 thus provide a reliable pattern of support for the basic hypotheses of this study. However, the perspective developed here also has implications for the relationship between attitudes toward specific welfare recipients and generalized opposition to welfare. More precisely, if hostility to welfare is specifically rooted in perceptions of black welfare recipients, then the tendency for this relationship to be stronger among the college‐educated should be most evident when the recipients are black. Unfortunately, the conventional survey measures used in Study 1 did not allow us to test this hypothesis. In order to do so, Study 2 turned to a survey‐based experiment included in a major national study of racial attitudes conducted during the aforementioned 1990–1992 time frame.         "
"34","The data for Study 2 were taken from the 1991 National Race and Politics Study (RAP; Sniderman and Carmines 1997). This survey was conducted in two stages: a computer‐assisted telephone survey, which reached a full sample of 2,223 respondents; and a second‐wave mailback questionnaire completed by 1,198 of the original respondents. However, items needed to operationalize certain controls (individualism, egalitarianism, and beliefs about government) were included only on the mailback questionnaire. Moreover, only white respondents were used. These two restrictions resulted in a final N of 1,061. Except for age and income, all variables were recoded to run from 0 to 1. Coding details and descriptives (for the 0–1 codings) can be found in the appendix.            "
"35","Political Predispositions.  Measures of the four political predispositions considered in Study 1 were also operationalized in the RAP. Unfortunately, the RAP dataset offered a narrower selection of political items, so these variables could be measured using single indicators only. Although the wordings of these items were different from their NES counterparts, their conceptual content was similar (see the appendix). Moreover, the RAP did allow us to measure a highly relevant predisposition not assessed in the NES, i.e., individualism, based on responses to two scale items. On all scales, higher scores indicated a more right‐wing response.               "
"36","Public Assistance Attitudes.  Two measures of respondents' public‐assistance attitudes were considered. Respondents' general welfare attitudes were measured using a three‐item scale, and a separate single‐item measure of respondents' welfare spending preferences was used as a second dependent variable (see the appendix).               "
"37","Education.  This was assessed using the survey's six‐category measure of educational attainment. As in Study 1, two categories were created: those who had completed a bachelor's degree (n= 366; coded as 1) and those who had not (n= 695; coded as 0).7"
"38","Demographics.  This study used the same demographics included in Study 1; they were coded in the same fashion as well. In addition, responses to two factual items were used to create a political‐knowledge index (see the appendix).               "
"39","The main hypothesis was examined using one of the RAP's split‐ballot experiments, in which respondents were asked to think about a hypothetical woman in “her early thirties … with a ten‐year‐old child” who “has been on welfare for the past year” under one of two randomly assigned question‐wording conditions. Half of the sample was told that the recipient was a “white woman” (n = 535) while the other half was told that the recipient was a “black woman” (n = 526).8 Respondents then answered two questions about the hypothetical welfare mother: (1) how likely it was that she would “try really hard to find a job in the next year,” and (2) how likely it was that she would “have more children in order to get a bigger welfare check” (reverse‐coded) Both items used a four‐point response scale, ranging from “very likely” to “not at all likely.” In both conditions, higher scores indicate more negative perceptions of the recipient (α= .63; M= .52, SD= .26, in the “white woman” condition; α= .65, M= .54, SD= .27, in the “black woman” condition; α= .64, M= .53, SD= .26, across both conditions). A dummy variable indicating each respondent's split‐ballot group was also created (0 for the “white woman” group; 1 for the “black woman” group).            "
"40","In order to test Study 2's primary hypothesis, a series of hierarchical regression models were estimated. Scores on the welfare measures were regressed on the first‐order terms for perceptions of the welfare mother, education, and split‐ballot group, the two‐way interactions between these variables, and the critical three‐way interaction between perceptions of the welfare mother, education, and split‐ballot group. The demographics, ideology, party identification, antiegalitarianism, individualism, and beliefs about government were included as controls. All variables were again centered. Unstandardized OLS estimates for the welfare‐attitudes analysis—again with HC3 robust standard errors—are shown in Table 4. Three models were estimated: Model 1, which included only the controls and the three key first‐order terms; Model 2, which added the two‐way interactions; and Model 3, which added the three‐way interaction. Given the experimental manipulation, Model 1 provides no readily interpretable results. Similarly, Model 2 indicated that none of the two‐way interactions were significant (ps > .10).         "
"41","However, Model 3 indicated that the three‐way interaction was significant, as predicted (b= .18, p < .05). This interaction was broken down by examining the simple two‐way interactions between welfare‐mother perceptions and education within each split‐ballot group, and the simple slopes for the relationship between welfare‐mother perceptions and welfare attitudes for respondents with and without bachelor's degrees in each split‐ballot group. As predicted, this analysis indicated that the two‐way interaction between welfare‐mother perceptions and education was significant when the welfare mother was black (b= .16, p < .01), but nonsignificant when described as white (b=−.02, p > .10). The simple slope analyses reinforced this pattern of results. In the black condition, the relationship between welfare‐mother perceptions and welfare attitudes was stronger among respondents with bachelor's degrees (b= .29, p < .001) than it was among respondents without degrees (b= .13, p < .001). In contrast, in the white condition, the relationship was roughly equivalent in both groups (i.e., b= .18, p < .001, among those with degrees; b= .20, p < .001, among those without degrees).         "
"42","The results of the analyses for welfare spending were similar. Since the spending variable had only three response categories (see the appendix), OLS estimation was inappropriate. An ordered‐probit model was used instead, with Huber‐white robust standard errors (Long and Ervin 2000). These analyses are summarized in Table 5. Again, Model 1 produced no interpretable results, given the manipulation. Model 2, on the other hand, did produce a significant interaction between welfare‐mother perceptions and education (b= .71, p < .05), indicating that the relationship welfare‐mother perceptions and spending was stronger among the college‐educated, collapsing across the experimental groups. However, Model 3 produced the predicted three‐way interaction (b= 1.27, p= .05). Again, this interaction was driven by the presence of a significant simple two‐way interaction between welfare‐mother perceptions and education in the black condition (b= 1.35, p < .01) and the absence of one in the white condition (b= .09, p > .10). As before, the relationship between welfare‐mother perceptions and welfare attitudes was stronger among respondents with degrees (b= 1.23, p < .01) than among respondents without them (b=−.12, p > .10) in the black condition. In contrast, in the white condition, the relationship did not differ appreciably across groups (i.e., b= .73, p < .05, among those with degrees; b= .64, p < .05, among those without them).         "
"43","A growing body of work suggests that whites who perceive blacks to be lazy and excessively demanding of “special favors” tend to be more opposed to welfare, even after a variety of nonracial predispositions relevant to welfare attitudes are taken into account (Gilens 1999). Given the troubling implications of this finding, the question of how we might we inhibit the racialization of welfare attitudes naturally arises. In this regard, a long line of research suggests that education may be helpful, since the college‐educated are less to likely to have negative perceptions of racial outgroups. More precisely, higher education may do this by increasing people's awareness of the norm of tolerance and strengthening the cognitive skills needed to apply that norm (e.g., Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991).         "
"44","Applied to the welfare issue, these findings imply that negative perceptions of blacks may be less related to welfare attitudes among the college‐educated. Despite the plausibility of this argument, the perspective advanced here suggests that the role of education in the domain of racial attitudes may be somewhat less straightforward. More precisely, while education may generally be associated with racial tolerance, the improved ability to connect predispositions with policy attitudes provided by education may help both those with positive and negative perceptions of blacks adopt policy attitudes consistent with their racial attitudes. This leads to a more paradoxical set of predictions: while the tendency to perceive blacks negatively may be weaker among the college‐educated than among those without college degrees, the relationship between racial perceptions and attitudes toward welfare (i.e., the use of race as an implicit policy cue) may be stronger among the very same well‐educated individuals. Going beyond these basic predictions, the perspective developed here also suggests the interactive effect of education should surface only under certain conditions.         "
"45","Across datasets, the findings reported here were quite supportive of these predictions. On one hand, the data reinforced the traditional notion of a negative relationship between education and racial hostility. In this vein, a series of comparisons indicated that the educated were less likely to endorse racial perceptions thought to fuel hostility toward welfare—that is, perceptions of blacks as lazy and overly demanding. In the GSS, this effect even extended directly to perceptions that blacks are overly dependent on welfare. On the other hand, the NES data also confirmed the less‐intuitive expectation that the relationship between racial perceptions and welfare attitudes would be stronger among the college‐educated; these results indicated a stronger relationship between two types of racial perceptions and welfare attitudes among the educated, even after various nonracial factors were taken into account."
"46","Moreover, as expected, other analyses indicated that the tendency for the relationship between perceptions of blacks and welfare attitudes to be stronger among the college‐educated was not simply a function of the fact that the attitudes of the well‐educated are generally more constrained. First of all, the NES data generally indicated that the relationship between racial perceptions and welfare attitudes—but not the relationship between nonracial predispositions and welfare attitudes—was stronger among the college‐educated. Additionally, the NES data suggested that the tendency for relationship between racial perceptions and attitudes toward public assistance to be stronger among the college‐educated was weaker (and statistically insignificant) with regard to forms of assistance not associated with “welfare.”"
"47","Finally, Study 2 extended this basic analysis in a somewhat different direction. Consistent with the idea that opposition to welfare may be specifically rooted in the perception that welfare recipients are overwhelmingly black, the experimental data from this study indicated that the relationship between perceptions of particular welfare recipients and generalized opposition to welfare was stronger among the college‐educated only when the recipient was black. That is, the college‐educated respondents appeared to have an advantage in connecting evaluations of specific welfare recipients with evaluations of the policy as a whole only when they experimentally induced to think about black welfare recipients. In the context of implicitly racialized policy domains like welfare, this last result suggests that the tendency for education to be associated with closer connections between attitudes toward specific applications of a policy and global evaluations of it may depend on whether or not the group membership of the policy's apparent beneficiaries is stereotype‐consistent. Moreover, by exerting experimental control over who respondents had in mind when they thought about welfare, this analysis makes it easier to argue that racialized thinking about welfare actually has more of a causal impact on attitudes toward the policy as a whole among college‐educated whites. This finding suggests that education may strengthen the relationship between policy‐relevant cognitions and policy attitudes only when that consideration is frequently invoked in public discourse (see especially Chong 1996). Specifically, since black stereotypes are now a major covert theme in discussions of welfare (Gilens 1999; Goren 2002), those with the highest levels of cognitive ability may be more likely to represent welfare recipients in terms of the categories suggested by these discussions. More importantly, however, this finding suggests that the troubling tendency for negative evaluations of black welfare recipients—as opposed to recipients from other groups—to have a greater impact on opposition to welfare may not be weaker among the college‐educated. In other words, even among whites who might be expected to realize that blacks do not make up the majority of welfare recipients, perceptions of black welfare recipients seem to have the dominant influence on evaluations of the policy.         "
"48","At the most basic level, these results suggest that the discursively‐mediated cognitive link between welfare and stereotypes of African Americans may not be weaker among the well‐educated, despite the well‐established “main effect” relationship between education and racial tolerance. More precisely, the data reviewed here suggest that the presence of this cognitive link is not restricted to less‐educated segments of the population, or to individuals who lack the skills needed to bring abstract, race‐neutral considerations to bear on their policy reasoning. In fact, it does not even appear to be less prevalent among them. Although the college‐educated are less likely to perceive blacks negatively, their welfare attitudes appear to be even more strongly informed by racial perceptions—whether negative or positive—than the attitudes of the less educated. The implication of these results is that a college education will do little in and of itself to inhibit the racialization of policy attitudes as long as public discourse continues to implicitly link certain policies to stereotypical perceptions of certain groups. As long as this link is present, then the cognitive skills possessed by the highly educated will allow it to be more easily integrated into a person's overall system of beliefs (Chong 1996).9"
"49","More broadly, though, these results strongly suggest that the role of education in the domain of racial attitudes may be more complex than typically assumed. At the simplest level, in addition to confirming the traditional finding that college‐educated individuals are less likely to have negative perceptions of blacks, the data presented here also indicate that the relationship between racial perceptions and policy attitudes is actually stronger among these individuals. However, in demonstrating this, the studies reported here go well beyond the policy domain examined in earlier studies (e.g., Federico and Sidanius 2002a, 2002b). Previous analyses of the relationship between racial hostility and policy attitudes at different educational levels have focused almost solely on attitudes toward a single, explicitly racial policy: i.e., affirmative action. While there are a variety of nonracial factors which may lead people to oppose affirmative action (Sniderman and Piazza 1993), it is also easy to see how negative racial perceptions may fuel opposition to a policy targeted toward particular groups: there is an obvious logical connection between feelings toward a group and feelings toward policies specifically designed to benefit that group.         "
"50","Welfare, on the other hand, is only implicitly racial: it is not race‐targeted, and the tendency to cognitively link the program with racial perceptions has more of a discursive than a logical basis (Gilens 1999). Compared to affirmative action, welfare might be even easier to address within the framework of race‐neutral concerns about individual responsibility, the role of government, and so on. Moreover, one might expect this to be particularly true among the highly educated, who are generally better able to align their policy attitudes with political predispositions like ideology, partisanship, and individualism. This suggests that welfare is one context in which the expectations of the politics‐centered perspective on white policy attitudes—which predicts a weaker effect of racial perceptions among the well‐educated—may hold (Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991). Despite this possibility, the results presented here suggest that the tendency for the link between racial perceptions and policy attitudes to be stronger among the college‐educated is just as pronounced for implicitly racial policies like welfare as it is for explicitly racial policies like affirmative action. As we have seen, this finding is also consistent with recent work on the psychology of implicit racial appeals (Mendelberg 2001), which suggests that the “self‐censoring” tendency essential to the mechanics of the politics‐centered model's predictions about the role of education may actually be weaker with regard to issues like welfare.         "
"51","Thus, in coming to these conclusions, the present study speaks as much to the current “race and politics” debate (see Sears et al. 2000) as much it does to specific questions about the role of education. Contrary to the general thrust of the aforementioned politics‐centered model, these results provide further evidence for the continued role of racial perceptions in the shaping of whites' policy attitudes, and they shed further doubt on the argument that education may allow citizens to substitute race‐neutral considerations for directly racial ones in their policy reasoning (Sniderman and Piazza 1993). In contrast, the picture painted here is more consistent with arguments made by the general group‐dominance model (e.g., Federico and Sidanius 2002a, 2002b; Sidanius, Pratto, and Bobo 1996) and the various “new racism” models (e.g., Sears et al. 1997) about the origins of whites' policy attitudes, both of which suggest that race‐related attitudinal dimensions continue to have an active policy impact among the poorly educated and well‐educated alike. As noted above, though, the present study goes beyond these lines of work, suggesting that this pattern applies to implicitly racial policy attitudes as well as explicitly racial ones. However, in addition to illustrating the generality of this tendency, the analyses reported here also highlight its limits better than previous studies have. More precisely, they suggest that the relationship between racial perceptions and public‐assistance attitudes is likely to be stronger among the college‐educated only in the case of programs that have become implicitly race‐linked.         "
"52","In sum, these findings underscore the need to develop a more differentiated view of the role of education in the domain of racial attitudes. Consistent with traditional perspectives on the role of education—and the implications of the politics‐centered model of white racial attitudes—the completion of a college degree does appear to be associated with lower levels of racial hostility. On the other hand, whites' perceptions of blacks—whatever their flavor—appear to be even more strongly associated with policy attitudes among the college‐educated, at least when assistance is depicted as “welfare” and the race of the recipients is stereotype‐consistent. This means that education may indeed be associated with less hostility toward welfare among college‐educated individuals whose racial perceptions do become less negative as a result of their experiences—a positive outcome. However, it also means that education should be associated with greater hostility to welfare among those whose negative perceptions do manage to survive the process of educational socialization. Thus, while education may provide the polity with more tolerant citizens, it may not always provide it with a politics more strongly informed by tolerance."
