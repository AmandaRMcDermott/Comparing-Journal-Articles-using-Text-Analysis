"1","From the earliest days of political science, scholars have noted (and lamented) that Congressional parties lack the unity and discipline of stereotypical parliamentary parties (APSA Committee on Political Parties 1950; Wilson 1885). Scholars have attributed this disunity to the diversity of the American electorate—any national coalition is composed of legislators representing a complex array of local interests and preferences, and parties can neither build perfectly homogenous coalitions nor override legislators' fidelity to their constituents. While Congressional parties are never perfectly cohesive, they sometimes exert significant influence on the structure, behavior, and output of Congress. Some scholars credit these periods of relatively high partisanship to variation in constituency preferences (e.g., Cooper and Brady 1981). In this view, “strong” parties are the result—not the cause—of similar policy views among members of each party (Krehbiel 1999).         "
"2","John Aldrich and David Rohde propose a more active role for parties in their theory of conditional party government (Aldrich 1995; Aldrich, Berger, and Rohde 2002; Aldrich and Rohde 2000, 2001; Aldrich, Rohde, and Tofias 2007; Rohde 1991). Aldrich and Rohde stress the (dis)similarity of legislators' electoral constituencies as the source of party strength. If members of a party share similar primary and general electorates, they will have common electoral incentives and thus similar preferences. Furthermore, if there are significant policy differences between the two parties, there are significant policy costs for losing legislative battles. To the extent these two conditions are met, legislators will delegate power to their party leaders. Leaders then use their scheduling and vote‐buying powers to advance the shared policy goals of their caucuses.1"
"3","In response, Krehbiel (1993) questioned whether the efforts of parties and their leaders have a significant net effect on policy outcomes. Party labels may be correlated with members' preferences, in this view, but parties do not alter legislative behavior. Later, Krehbiel expanded this critique to the CPG model. If members already agree with each other on a given issue, Krehbiel asks, what is the marginal influence of party effort? He concludes, “When the condition for CPG is met, behavior of partisans and nonpartisans is observationally equivalent” (1999, 35).         "
"4","The first challenge provoked a torrent of research demonstrating significant “party effects” in voting (e.g., Ansolahebere, Snyder, and Stewart 2001; Cox and Poole 2002; King and Zeckhauser 2003; Sinclair 2002), agenda setting (e.g., Covington and Bargen 2004; Cox and McCubbins 1993, 2005; Marshall 2002; Sinclair 1994, 2002), and outcomes (Cox and McCubbins 2005; Lawrence, Maltzman, and Smith 2006; Snyder and Groseclose 2000). Altogether, this work suggests that parties can influence legislators' votes but party leaders minimize the extent to which members vote against their own electoral interests. Instead, House majority leaders carefully structure debates to minimize difficult choices between collective party interests and the induced preferences of party members. When difficult votes are inescapable, majority party leaders convert just enough “if you need me” votes to carry the day.2 Party leaders are thus most active when the majority party is internally divided and extra effort is necessary to overcome intraparty disagreement.         "
"5"," Cox and McCubbins (1993, 2005) provide a partial response to Krehbiel's concerns. They concur that party leaders will advance a positive agenda when their members are united and parties disagree on policy issues. They stress, however, that parties strive for electoral victory, not policy change per se. Party members share a brand name, and they cooperate and delegate to enhance the value of their common label. To that end, the majority party in the House cooperates as a procedural cartel to veto bills that divide the party or harm its reputation.         "
"6","Conditional party government and the cartel model provide a useful foundation for research on legislative parties. Rather than criticize these models, we seek to synthesize and develop their insights. One ambiguity is whether we should think of parties as policymaking machines or as reputation‐protecting electoral cartels. Both are probably correct to some degree, and there is much overlap in the behavior one can explain with either premise. We focus on the electoral goals of party organizations but recognize that parties sometimes pursue policy outcomes for their own sake."
"7","The central claim of our theory, which we label Strategic Party Government (SPG), is that legislative partisanship has a direct negative impact on a party's electoral fortunes but a positive indirect effect—through legislative victories—on electoral success. Thus, parties seek to maximize their legislative seat share by deploying the minimum amount of party effort to achieve a maximum level of legislative success relative to the opposing party. We conceptualize the two parties (i.e., party conferences guided by party leaders) as actors who strive to maximize their share of the chamber.3 Seat maximization motivates party interest in agenda setting, candidate recruitment, fundraising, and media relations to enhance party reputation. Most important here, parties strive to win legislative victories by crafting strategies, polling members, structuring debates, and buying votes. Following convention, we refer to these activities as party “effort” that yields party “influence” (relative to a baseline of no effort) on legislative choices. We use party unity in voting as a tangible metric of party influence.         "
"8","We assume legislative success (e.g., winning contested votes) is electorally beneficial. Majority parties that lose contested votes appear inept and unable to address national problems or follow through on campaign promises. Conversely, a minority party that defeats the majority enhances its reputation and may compel the majority party to try harder to win. Legislative victories may also help solidify or expand party coalitions, provide campaign resources to party members and candidates, or reshape electoral rules in the majority party's favor."
"9","Parties use several tactics to increase their chances of winning legislative contests. The most obvious is vote buying, i.e., offering party members favors to vote with their party and against their personal and political inclinations. Party leaders can also influence members' preferences by earning positive media coverage of party goals or holding party meetings to discuss issues (Sinclair 2002). More subtly, majority party leaders can screen the legislative agenda to prioritize bills that unite their party, or they can regulate the amendment process to shield party members from amendments that force politically awkward choices or splinter party coalitions (Sinclair 1995; Cox and McCubbins 2005). Recent research demonstrates that the combined influence of intraparty communication and leaders' vote buying has a significant influence on legislators' voting behavior (Burden and Frisby 2004; Cann 2004; Forgette 2004; Green 2002; Snyder and Groseclose 2000) which in turn influences policy outcomes.4"
"10","Party influence on voting behavior is constrained by electoral costs. When party leaders induce their members to side with the national party position against their personal electoral interests, they increase electoral risk for those conflicted members. Carson (2005), for example, finds a positive correlation between an incumbent's party unity in voting and the probability that a quality challenger emerges in the next election, while Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan (2002) find that incumbents' vote share and probability of reelection decline with the extent to which they vote with the ideologically extreme wing of their party. Carson, Koger, and Lebo (2006) specifically test the relationship between individual legislators' party unity and vote share, finding that higher party unity is correlated with decreased electoral vote share. Party unity is thus a double‐edged sword; while unity may increase the likelihood of party victories on key issues, it also exposes members to electoral defeat. To a lesser extent, we might expect that there are electoral costs to the extreme use of procedural advantages, e.g., preventing the minority party from speaking, since these tactics might harm a party's image.         "
"11","If party unity offers both benefits and costs, the straightforward implication is that each party chooses a level of party influence that balances the marginal costs and marginal benefits of additional party unity. The “marginal costs” are the negative impact of the nth unit of party unity on a party's share of the chamber's seats. Similarly, “marginal benefits” are the electoral gains that accrue from the increased legislative success provided by the nth unit of party unity. Party members choose a level of party influence on voting by deciding how much vote buying and agenda‐setting power to delegate to their leaders and by selecting leaders who are more or less inclined to use their powers to advance the electoral interests of party members.5"
"12","We make the weak assumption that the benefits exceed the costs up to some level of party unity, after which the costs exceed the benefits for additional increments of party unity. If this assumption were not true, we would observe either zero party influence (costs always exceed benefits) or absolute party influence (benefits always exceed costs).6 Congressional parties typically exert some influence but do not control every choice, suggesting that the equilibrium lies in between the extremes of zero and absolute influence.         "
"13","For clarity, we can state the key relationships as formulae. The Democratic party chooses Party Unity (PU) to maximize seat share: SeatsD=f(PUD (−), PUR (+), WinD (+)), where the Democratic win share formula is WinD=f(PUD (+), PUR (−), X); X is a set of variables (some listed below) that affect the translation of party voting into legislative success. The signs in the formulae indicate our expectations about the marginal relationships between each choice variable and outcome. For this presentation, we avoid unnecessary (and substantively strong) claims about the precise shape of these functions, except that we expect that they generate a single “intersection” point where the benefits of additional party unity match the costs.         "
"14","We illustrate these relationships in Figure 1. Figure 1 depicts the strategic choice faced by the Democratic party as it chooses its level of party unity (the vertical axis), resulting in a distribution of legislative success (the horizontal axis) between the Democrats (left side) and Republicans (right side); below we explain how these figures incorporate Republican strategy. The diagonal lines represent the marginal costs and benefits of each unit of party unity. The marginal electoral costs line represents the direct and negative effects of having additional party unity pull legislators away from their districts' preferences. The marginal electoral gains line represents the indirect and positive effect of having additional party unity lead to legislative victories that help the party win seats. These are portrayed as 45° lines, but they may also be concave or convex, tilted at different angles, or they may shift over time; the key feature is that their intersection represents the optimal strategy. Each choice along the vertical axis represents a marginal payoff on the cost and benefit lines. In Figure 1, the Democrats choose the equilibrium value, PU*D. By choosing the level of party unity such that the marginal costs match the marginal benefits, the Democrats maximize their net gain from the legislative game. Any level of Democratic party unity higher than PU*D costs the Democrats more than it benefits them, while party unity lower than PU*D would mean that the Democrats are settling for less than the ideal combination of party unity and winning.7"
"15","                 Strategic Party Calculus: Democrats                      "
"16","This approach provides an easy way to incorporate the classic claims of CPG and other party research. First, we would expect each party's marginal cost function to depend, in part, on the heterogeneity of its members' constituencies. The more diverse the electoral settings of a party's members, the steeper the cost curve since each increment of party unity entails a large and growing divergence between national party positions and local preferences. Furthermore, the cost line will vary with citizens' preferences. If citizens are antipartisan in general (i.e., opposed to a prominent role for parties and party leaders) then the cost curve will be steep. An increase in voter loyalty toward one party would move the cost curve to the left."
"17","The marginal gain curve will vary with each party's ability to translate partisan unity into legislative victories. First, marginal gain should vary with party size; the larger the party, the easier it is to win with lower levels of effort. In part, this is simply mathematical: larger parties have more votes, so (all else equal) increasing party unity yields more votes in large parties. Large parties also may be better able to win without buying votes by building cohesive majorities based simply on members' personal preferences and electoral interests. Second, the greater the difference in induced policy preferences between the two parties, the greater the gain from winning; this is a conventional CPG claim. Third, chamber rules may influence the slope of the line. The greater the procedural advantages of the chamber majority, the steeper (flatter) the gain curve for the majority (minority) party."
"18","Most important, we expect that the party unity of one party will affect the marginal gain function of the opposing party.8 If the Republicans are completely inactive as a party, then the Democrats (ceteris paribus) can reap large gains with small increases in party influence. One implication of this interaction is that we expect that shifts in one party's unity will be mirrored by shifts in the opposing party's unity. The logic of this claim is displayed in Figure 2.         "
"19","                 Strategic Party Calculus—Democrats Respond to a Shift in Republican Unity                      "
"20","An increase in the Republicans' optimal level of unity is portrayed as a rightward shift in the Democrats' marginal gain line from T1 to T2. If the Democrats maintained their T1 level of party unity then the win distribution would shift markedly in the Republicans' favor. If, on the other hand, Democrats sought to maintain their win share from T1, they would have to dramatically increase their party unity. Both these responses are more costly than a “partial” matching strategy, in which Democrats shift from PU1 to PU2 and allow their win share to decline from W1 to W2; this is the Democrats' new equilibrium strategy.         "
"21","We expect that the transition from one equilibrium to another is smooth and swift in theory but tentative and imprecise in practice. Party members may be slow to revise their voting patterns (since voters expect some degree of consistency), to replace party leaders, or to reform party rules as swiftly as the strategic setting requires. Also, each election provides opaque feedback on the parties' strategies while altering the parameters of the strategic setting. This constant evolution and uncertain signaling makes it difficult for each party to discern its best legislative strategy for each session. Nonetheless, parties adjust their strategies to reflect new information and context. A party that realizes it lost too many votes in the previous Congress will attempt to increase its level of unity. Simultaneously, the opposing party may remain the same or it may lament the electoral costs of its high level of unity and reduce its level of effort. Thus we expect that party strategies will partially reflect the party competition seen in previous time periods. If the parties' choices result in a significant gap in party unity, we expect the parties to correct for it the next period."
"22","This implies that we should observe two patterns of strategic interaction:"
"23","                        "
"24","Hypothesis 1 states that parties will engage in “real‐time” corrections: they observe the unity level of the opposing party and respond accordingly. We expect that interparty gaps will nonetheless occur due to incomplete information, inflexible party structures, or legislators' reluctance to change their voting patterns. If so, Hypothesis 2 suggests that parties correct gaps in party influence by moving toward the level of the opposing party in the previous time period."
"25","While our primary interest is in testing Hypotheses 1 and 2, we also test the core hypotheses of CPG: party unity increases with the homogeneity of intraparty preferences and with policy disagreement between the two major parties. We also examine whether party unity trades off with party size so larger parties can afford to allow their members greater latitude in voting. Additionally, we test our key assumptions by estimating the effects of party unity and legislative outcomes on electoral success in both the House and Senate. Testing these claims requires a broad range of data and sophisticated time‐series methods, to which we turn next."
"26","This section explains our strategy for measuring the influence of preferences and strategic interaction on party strength and the relationship between partisan legislative behavior and electoral success. We test our hypotheses with macrolevel analyses of Congressional voting and elections in the House and Senate from 1789 to 2000. The broad scope of our study reflects our interest in identifying general patterns of legislative behavior.9 Next, we describe our strategy for measuring party strength, preferences, and size and then explain the statistical techniques we use to deal with the temporal nature of our data.         "
"27","We use party unity in voting as a historically continuous measure of party influence. Specifically, the dependent variable in our first analysis is the yearly10 level of Democratic Unity, defined as the average of Democratic unity scores across all “party” votes that pit most of one party against most of the other. The key independent variable, Republican Unity, is constructed similarly. Like Krehbiel (2000), we understand party unity scores as the product of both legislators' preferences and party influence. Once we control for legislators' preferences we can meaningfully evaluate how, ceteris paribus, party influence varies with party size and the behavior of an opposing party.         "
"28","Of course, the “Democratic” and “Republican” labels were not used throughout the 1789–2000 time span. By “Democratic” we mean opponents of the Washington administration, the (Jeffersonian) Republican party, supporters of Andrew Jackson, and members labeled “Democrat” or “Independent Democrat,” all identified using Martis' (1989) party affiliation coding. By “Republican” we mean supporters of the Washington administration, Federalists, pro‐Adams and anti‐Jackson factions, Whigs, and members labeled “Republicans” and “Independent Republicans.”11 We do not imply that these labels signify two constant coalitions. Rather, we merely assume that the coalitions we identify are similar to the group of legislators with the same label in adjacent years. Basically, we are interested in explaining how parties respond to their opponent and we expect similar behavior from the modern Democrats facing the Republicans as we do from the nineteenth‐century Democrats facing the Whigs.         "
"29"," Figure 3 shows the yearly level of party unity in the U.S. House of Representatives (top panel) and U.S. Senate (third panel) for the Democrat and Republican series for the 1789 to 2000 period. The most evident patterns are the close relationship between the unity level of the parties in each chamber and the recent trend in both chambers towards higher levels of unity for both parties. In the Senate, unity levels of the parties never stray too far apart with the exception of three noticeable periods: the years prior to the 1824 election when the parties underwent unique transformations, the Civil War to Reconstruction period, and, to a lesser extent, the New Deal period of the 1930s. The second and fourth panels of Figure 3 illustrate the Unity Gap, the yearly difference between the unity levels of the two parties. While this gap deviates from zero, it is a mean reverting process—it oscillates around zero as the two series tend back towards equilibrium. This pattern is common when actors are engaged in an action‐reaction process, a relationship we describe in greater detail below.12"
"30","                 Democratic and Republican Party Voting Unity                      "
"31","To evaluate the effect of members' preferences on partisan voting patterns, we rely on DW‐NOMINATE scores on two dimensions to operationalize preference cohesion within parties and disagreement between the parties (Aldrich, Berger, and Rohde 2002; Aldrich, Rohde, and Tofias 2007). These scores are generated by treating every contested roll call as a choice between two alternatives and every vote as a choice between those alternatives; the more any two legislators vote together, the more we assume they have similar preferences. The first dimension is liberal‐conservative and predicts most Congressional voting. The second deals mostly with slavery in the nineteenth century but has “no consistent pattern” for most of the twentieth century (Poole and Rosenthal 1997). We use the standard deviation of each NOMINATE dimension for each party and the absolute difference between the scores of the median members of each major party as measures of intraparty unity and interparty differences, respectively. This leads to the creation of six time series for each chamber: Democratic Cohesion—Nominate 1st, Democratic Cohesion—Nominate 2nd, Republican Cohesion—Nominate 1st, Republican Cohesion—Nominate 2nd, Ideological Distance—Nominate 1st, and Ideological Distance—Nominate 2nd.13"
"32","One drawback of using NOMINATE scores as measures of induced preferences is that we are using variables derived from roll‐call votes to predict party unity, a measure also based on roll‐call votes. This is especially troublesome to the extent that parties directly influence members' votes and induce stable voting coalitions (Poole and Rosenthal 1997, 227). If so, our use of aggregated NOMINATE variables may overstate the role of constituency and personal preferences and understate the importance of strategic partisanship. Nonetheless, we agree with Cooper and Young (2002) that DW‐NOMINATE scores may not accurately represent party voting behavior since differences in DW‐NOMINATE party medians between Congresses are often unrelated to differences in unity over the same period. Further, the methods used to compare member behavior over time often involve using data from previous Congresses to explain behavior in current periods, “with the result that votes in a particular Congress are discounted if they do not meet certain parameters. Hence, the full impact of party in structuring voting patterns in particular Congresses may not be captured” (Schickler 2000, 272). Cooper and Young's thorough examination of measurement issues in examining party behavior supports our claim that DW‐NOMINATE scores and party unity scores measure two different phenomena and do not create any methodological dilemmas for our analysis.14 We also include a variable measuring the percentage of the chamber held by the Democrats, Democratic Size, based on opening day tallies obtained from clerk.house.gov and http://www.senate.gov.         "
"33","An additional concern is this: what if the observed variation in party unity is actually the product of significant shifts in the legislative agenda? As discussed below, we tested whether the values of our parameters fluctuate significantly over time and found that the key relationships are reasonably stable. In addition, we included a variable, Democratic Majority, for shifts in party control in each chamber. This variable is coded “1” for years in which the Democrats became the majority party, “−1” for the first year of Republican control, and zero otherwise. To be sure, this is an imprecise measure of issue variation, but it is sensitive to the historical variation in the relationship between issues and party coalitions."
"34","Our second analysis examines the linkages between legislative behavior and electoral outcomes. The SPG model claims that winning votes is electorally beneficial but party unity costs seats. To test these claims, we use Democratic size as our dependent variable.15 In each chamber, we explain the change in the percentage of seats held by the Democrats using the change in the level of Democratic unity in the previous Congress as well as the change in the Democratic “win” rate—the percentage of votes on which the position preferred by a majority of Democrats prevails.16 Thus, our first set of models estimates the causes of party unity and the second set of models estimates its effects.         "
"35","To avoid threats to inference, we must ensure that our time series are stationary (i.e., have a stable mean and variance), and if they are not, we must transform them to be so (Enders 2004; Granger and Newbold 1974). We expect our data to fall between the traditional dichotomy of stationarity and nonstationarity since our party‐level variables are created by aggregating a heterogeneous group of legislators. In fact, each legislator's voting pattern may evolve in a unique manner. Likewise, each election relies to a varying extent on the previous election, e.g., last year's election results are more informative for upcoming elections in seats held by incumbents than they are for open seats.         "
"36","More formally, series Y, made up of legislators j= 1…n each of whom exhibits unique autoregressive behavior gives us: Yj,t=αjYj,t−1+ɛt where αj ˜ β (0, 1) and ɛj,t ˜ N(0, σ2). Such series are described by Granger (1980) as fractionally integrated (FI) and can be made stationary through fractional differencing.17 Accordingly, we test for FI and use ARFIMA (autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average; see Box‐Steffensmeier and Smith 1996; Lebo, Walker, and Clarke 2000) techniques for our models.18 Testing confirms that our series are indeed FI.19 For example, Robinson's (1995) estimator gives d= 0.69 and d= 0.78 for yearly House Democratic and Republican Unity, respectively, with s.e. = 0.06 for each. Since we can reject the possibility of both strict stationarity and nonstationarity for every series with p < .001, each series is filtered by its own value of Robinson's d prior to inclusion in our models below.         "
"37","Hypothesis 2 states that parties will approximate each other's level of party unity over time by reducing past differences between the parties. This implies that party unity scores are cointegrated, i.e., the variables maintain an equilibrium relationship over time and the distance between the two is closed through error correction (Banerjee et al. 1993). The concept of cointegration has been generalized to allow for the possibility of fractional cointegration (FCI). FCI is a general approach where the original series are I (dv) and the combination of series need only have a lower level of integration, i.e., d′ such that d′ < dv for all v (Clarke and Lebo 2003).         "
"38","Fractional cointegration is an especially useful tool for studying action‐reaction processes where one actor responds with similar behavior to either hostile or cooperative behavior from another actor (Lebo and Moore 2003). Iteration between the actors produces a long‐run equilibrium and error‐correction mechanisms (ECMs) can be used to estimate the return to balance following a shift.20 This is precisely the type of relationship we expect to find between levels of Democratic and Republican unity. Not only do we expect the unity of each party to drive the other, but we also expect that parties will strive to close any difference in unity evident from the previous period. This brings us to our empirical analyses.         "
"39","We begin with our analysis of party unity in voting. Hypothesis 1 and Figures 1 and 2 assert that opposition party unity is a major determinant of party influence. Hypothesis 2 and Figure 2 imply that gaps that open in the relative unity of the two parties will be closed over later periods. We test these claims while controlling for legislators' preferences. We also test if party unity varies with the relative size of the parties, which would suggest that partisanship in voting is affected by strategic need. Since we believe that the two parties each respond to the other, we have two endogenous variables that simultaneously affect each other. Hence, for each chamber, we use three‐stage least squares to model two equations—one estimates the determinants of Democratic party unity and the other the determinants of Republican unity (Kmenta 1997).21"
"40"," Tables 1 and 2 show the results of our models explaining Democratic and Republican Unity in the House and Senate, respectively.22 Included as independent variables are opposition party unity, the fractional ECM,23 Democratic Size, a dummy for new majorities, ideological distances in the two NOMINATE dimensions, and Democratic Cohesion (Republican Cohesion in the Republican equations) in the two dimensions.24 Additionally, two of the equations include opposition party cohesion as an independent variable.25 We explain the two models together.         "
"41","Our most important finding is the strong support for Hypothesis 1—Republican behavior is a major determinant of Democratic Unity and vice versa. Figure 4 shows the substantive impact on unity. In both the House and Senate and for both Democrats and Republicans, we see clearly that opposition unity is the strongest determinant of party unity—of far greater importance than any measure of individual preferences. Indeed, as the four scenarios of Figure 4 show, if nothing else changes, when the opposition's unity level moves from its 5th percentile value to its median, House Democrats' unity jumps 18.87%, House Republicans' 22.19%, Senate Democrats' 11.61%, and Senate Republicans' 12.75%. Table 1 shows that in the House, when Republican (Democrat) Unity goes up by 1%, the Democrats (Republicans) counter with a 0.802% (0.711%) increase (p < .001). In the Senate, the effects are a bit lower, 0.534 for Democrats and 0.589 for Republicans, but are still substantial (p < .001). Hence, legislators who are confronted with a more unified opposition party will more frequently forgo their induced preferences on roll‐call votes to help their party achieve legislative victories. Of course, this works in both directions. Seeing a less unified opposition, legislators are more free to break from their party if it helps them get reelected.         "
"42","                 Effects of Independent Variables                      "
"43","As predicted by Hypothesis 2, legislators look for cues for their strategic behavior not only from this year's opposition but from the relative influence of the parties in the previous year. This action‐reaction behavior ensures that the unity levels of the parties rise and fall to meet one another in a long‐run equilibrium. This is apparent in two ways. First, tests for fractional cointegration suggest that the difference between the unity levels of the two parties naturally tends to some consistent level. For each chamber, combining Democratic Unity, Republican Unity, and Democratic Size yields a series with faster mean reversion than any of those three variables. Thus, any widening of the unity gap between the parties is quickly erased by strategic party behavior and ECMs can estimate the speed with which the gap is closed."
"44","Hypothesis 2 is supported further by the statistically significant ECM coefficients in Tables 1 and 2. While error correction is strong for both parties in both chambers, it is noticeably stronger for Senate Democrats. This is evident in two ways. First, mean reversion in the Senate's ECM is fastest (d= 0.34). Second, the ECM coefficient is more negative for Senate Democrats (−0.530) than it is for Senate Republicans (−0.240), House Democrats (−0.309), or House Republicans (−0.284). This means that, when the two parties' unity differs, 52% of the unity gap is corrected in the first year by Senate Democrats and 28% is corrected by House Democrats. Subsequently, 52% of the remaining Unity Gap in the Senate will be corrected by Democrats in each following year. The Senate's smaller size and the leeway afforded by longer terms may explain why Senate Democrats can adapt to the opposition more quickly than their House counterparts, but it is not clear why Democrats would be more active gap closers than Republicans in both chambers. Other results of these models are as expected.         "
"45","Democratic Size has a large negative impact on Democratic Unity and a large positive impact on Republican unity. This supports the claim that party unity is costly and decreases when larger party size makes it easier to win without pressuring party members. As Figure 4 shows, with one exception, Democratic Size is the second strongest independent variable in terms of effect size for both chambers (−10.29 and +11.81 for House Democrats and Republicans, respectively, and −8.14 and +6.55 for Senate Democrats and Republicans, respectively, p < .001). Only among Senate Republicans is this effect (marginally) below that of any of the preference variables (absolute value of 6.55 versus 8.89 for the effect of Republican Cohesion in the first dimension and 6.77 for Republican Cohesion in the second dimension).         "
"46","We also find support for the classic claims of the CPG model. Each of the four key CPG variables—Distance in the first and second dimensions and Cohesion in the first and second dimensions—is significant in at least one of the four equations shown in Tables 1 and 2. House Republicans significantly increase their level of unity as the parties diverge in either the first (β= 20.019, p= .024) or second (β= 12.723, p= .003) Nominate dimension. Senate Democrats likewise become more unified as interparty distance in the second dimension grows (β= 16.917, p= .009).26"
"47","There is also support for the link between Cohesion, measured by the standard deviation of members' scores in each year, and party Unity—that is, more dispersal leads to less unity. In the House, significant effects are found for Cohesion in the second dimension of NOMINATE lagged on Democratic unity (p < .001) and for Cohesion using the first dimension on Republican unity (p= .043). As Figure 4 demonstrates, these cohesion variables (the last two bars in each quartile) work best for Senate Republicans whose voting behavior is significantly more unified (p= .000) as they become more ideologically cohesive. Senate Democrats' voting unity is likewise affected by their preference cohesion with effects in both the first (lagged, p= .005) and second (p < .001) dimensions. The importance of the second dimension is consistent with Rohde's (1991) account of the growing homogeneity of the Democratic party since 1970; as southern districts realigned, the preferences of members became similar within both parties.         "
"48","Since we see the SPG model as an expansion of the CPG model, we are also interested in testing the models in their entirety. Because we can create the CPG model by setting to zero the parameters for opposition unity, Democratic size, and the ECM, the CPG model is clearly nested within the SPG model. Thus, the fact that joint tests of significance on these three variables are significant (p < .000001) in each of the four equations establishes that the SPG model empirically encompasses the CPG model (Davidson and MacKinnon 1993). In addition, the forecast Root MSE is improved in each case when we go from forecasts estimated using the CPG model to those estimated using the SPG model. For example, using the House data, the equations of Democratic and Republican unity have Root MSEs of 8.51 and 7.91, respectively, when the SPG variables are excluded. Once SPG variables are included, these errors drop to 8.03 and 7.55.         "
"49","In sum, we find strong support for the assertion that the strategic behavior of the parties complements preferences as an explanation of variation in party unity. Our analysis explains a substantial portion of the variance in our dependent variable with R2 between .38 and .47 for our four equations. Durbin‐Watson statistics indicate that the FI methods have done a good job of controlling for autocorrelation and tests of the residuals indicate they are white noise. Lastly, our Hausman specification tests all indicate a well‐specified model with no evidence of omitted variables or endogeneity. One further issue is parameter constancy. That is, with over 200 years of data, are these relationships always present? We used Tse's (2002) test of constant correlations between the unity levels of the two parties in each of the chambers, and we were unable to reject the null hypothesis that the correlations between the variables are constant over our sample period (p= .18 for the House and p= .19 for the Senate). 27"
"50","What are the electoral consequences of party influence? To judge the consequences of party unity and party success, i.e., the Democratic Win Rate, we use the change in the percentage of the House held by the Democrats from one Congress to the next as the dependent variable. There are two counterbalancing expectations here. First, as legislators vote more frequently with their party, they are being pulled away from the wishes of their constituents and thereby risk defeat in their next election. Simultaneously, however, higher unity increases the probability of winning votes,28 which, in turn, is rewarded by electoral gains for the party. Results for the House are shown in Table 3. Each additional point of Unity costs the Democrats just under 0.25% in their share of the House (roughly 1.13 seats out of 435) in the next Congress—as party influence moves legislators away from the interests of constituents to those of party, the consequences are felt at the ballot box. This effect weakens in the twentieth century as incumbency becomes a stronger buffer between performance and accountability. Further, the results support our expectation that legislative success leads to electoral success. For each additional 10% of the votes the Democrats win, they will win a 0.75% greater share (3.4 seats) in the next Congress (+/− 0.69%, p < .05).         "
"51","Other results are consistent with our expectations.29 The Democrats increase their share of the House in midterm elections with a Republican president and lose seats in midterms with a Democratic president. Coattail effects account for a slight rise in the Democratic House share when a Democrat is elected president, and the 1822 election, which marks the disintegration of the Jeffersonian coalition in our data, was a significant loss for the soon‐to‐be Democrats. Overall, the model explains 35% of the variance in Democratic House Share and tests of autocorrelation indicate white‐noise residuals.         "
"52","The story of partisan unity, legislative victory, and Congressional elections is even stronger in the modern Senate and shows interesting historical variation. We repeat our analysis for the Senate for three separate periods and the results, shown in Table 4, confirm our expectations.30 Before the adoption of direct elections in 1913, senators were selected by state legislatures and thus were only indirectly responsible to the voters of their states. During this period (which we extend to 1920) there is no link at all between party unity and electoral fortune. This link becomes evident following the onset of direct elections, 1921 to 2000, and solidifies for the 1931 to 2000 period. Indeed, party unity has an increasingly negative relationship with the Democrats' share of the chamber over these three periods. For the period 1931 to 2000, a 1% increase in party unity is associated with a .593% decrease in chamber seat share (i.e., .593 seats in a 100‐seat Senate). Voting with their party may indeed be costly for senators who must be reelected by the voters of their states. State legislators, on the other hand, were either more understanding of party behavior or were beholden to their U.S. senators prior to the 17th Amendment (Rothman 1966).         "
"53","Winning contested votes, on the other hand, is associated with gaining seat share in all three periods. For example, from 1931 to 2000, a 10% increase in the portion of party votes won by Democrats is followed by a 1.43% gain in seat share. This link is much stronger in the indirectly elected Senate, with a 10% increase in win rate associated with a 2.3% increase in seat share. Overall, it is evident that by the modern age, the effects of party behavior on Congressional elections that we identify are firmly in place."
"54","This article makes three major contributions to the study of parties. First, it links legislative behavior—specifically voting unity and success rates on “party” votes—to election outcomes. Legislative success is correlated with gaining seats while voting unity is associated with seat loss in the House and the modern Senate. We find no pattern of seat loss due to party unity in the pre‐17th Amendment Senate, suggesting that the mechanism at work is that voters punish incumbents for voting with their parties against their constituent preferences. Second, we develop a theory of strategic party competition in which seat‐maximizing parties balance their desire for legislative success against the electoral costs of the party unity required to win contested votes. This theory builds on previous models of legislative parties by adding strategic interaction between the parties; we predict that each party will respond to increases in party unity by the other party with a partial increase in its own party unity. Finally, we analyze a long stretch of historical data using sophisticated time‐series methods and find that parties do make real‐time and lagged responses to each other's behavior.         "
"55","Our work provides a partial answer to the puzzle of recent Congressional polarization. Our contribution is that we highlight the role of interaction; preferences and elections aside, one reason the Democrats are unified and competitive is because the Republicans are, and, in part, the Republicans are unified because the Democrats are. Where does it end? Our theory suggests that the unity of the two parties will wane when either the electoral costs of unity become too high or an exogenous shock reduces the unity of one party, thereby inducing the other party to follow.         "
"56","By its nature, this study invites further research on the mechanisms of strategic party government. We tested our model at the macro level to identify the major patterns of party behavior across time. Additional work is needed to apply this framework to specific periods of Congressional history. Further research is required to determine how party unity is costly for individual incumbents. Also, while we study aggregated levels of party unity, we expect that party influence is concentrated on close, important votes rather than the broad universe of “party” votes. Additional research on the agenda‐setting process and the operation of party whip systems would provide a deeper understanding of how party leaders influence outcomes. Finally, we are interested in the relationship between influencing votes (the focus of this work) and procedural manipulation to avoid tough votes. It would be helpful to measure the electoral costs of extraordinary tactics and to determine when leaders will prefer procedural mischief to a controversial vote."
"57","Our framework can also be applied to a broader range of party‐related questions. As noted, the choice of party leaders and caucus rules are key mechanisms for defining the course of each party; both choices deserve additional research. Another area for research is on party leaders' efforts to manipulate the content and importance of party reputations. Other than winning votes, how do party elites shape the image of their party and the opposing party? How malleable are party reputations and the weight that votes attach to party labels? Which legislative proposals have the most influence on party images? While there has been a fruitful outpouring of research on legislative parties in recent years, many such questions remain. We hope this article has helped by highlighting the role of electoral motivations and strategic interaction in legislative party behavior."
