"1","The paradoxes of constitutional democracy arise precisely from the conjunction of democracy and law. Following a principle of popular sovereignty that has a long history in the Western tradition, democratic lawmaking holds that people ought to be able to consent to the laws under which they live (e.g., National Assembly of France 1789, article 6). Democratic citizens encounter problems, however, when they must rely on law to constitute themselves as a lawmaking body. Democratic lawmaking becomes paradoxical when it must establish the very conditions for its own institutionalization.         "
"2","Frank Michelman has identified one such paradox, which we can call the paradox of the founding (Michelman 1996; 1997; 1998, 91; 1999, 4–11, 33–34). It shows that a legal and political order cannot be democratically founded, at least not in a procedurally legitimate sense. Imagine that a people comes together to establish a democratic constitution. For the sake of convenience, call them the founders. In order to undertake this task, the founders must first have some understanding of what it means to be a people who will form a constitution. They must constitute themselves as a group, deciding who is entitled to participate in the constitution‐forming process and who is excluded. Further, the founders must agree on the process they will use to establish laws and what form the constitution will take. Such an understanding is necessary to coordinate action, to make sure that everyone agrees about who has a say in the new constitution, what the outcome of the constitution‐forming process should look like, and so on. The founders' task, in other words, requires a set of procedures to regulate the process of becoming a people and forming laws. Since this project is a democratic one—the project of an entire people—the understanding they have of their joint undertaking must be shared and public.         "
"3","To form a public understanding of their communal project, the founders must first develop procedures that will allow them to accomplish the preliminary, ground‐clearing task of setting up an understanding about how to proceed. Their deliberations must themselves be guided by some idea about what is to be decided and who may decide it. The founders must, in other words, devise ground rules that will allow them to set up ground rules for constitution founding. Such an understanding will in turn have to be politically produced."
"4","At this point, the paradoxical nature of the founders' project becomes apparent. Any democratic attempt to create a constitution requires a previous constitution that has already established democratic procedures. There is an infinite regression of procedures presupposing procedures, each necessary to form the procedures following it. The founders will be paralyzed in the position of needing a set of procedures that explains how to go about forming procedures. Therefore the process of founding a constitution can never start."
"5","Structurally speaking, the paradox of the founding is regressive in nature. Starting in the present, we pick some arbitrary point in the future at which we would establish a legitimate system of constitutional democracy. It rapidly becomes clear that to get to that future some intermediate steps must first be traversed. None of these steps is possible without still earlier ones, however, and so on. In the end we are forced to conclude that a purely constitutional‐democratic future is not possible. The attempted project regresses back to its starting point, from which it cannot depart.         "
"6","Legitimacy is clearly central to the paradox of the founding. A first step in founding a constitution is impossible because it cannot be legitimately accomplished. A legitimate first step would need to be formed through normatively acceptable procedures. Such procedures cannot exist, however, because by definition the first step in lawmaking is not preceded by a normatively acceptable procedure. If there is no such procedure, however, lawmaking cannot be judged legitimate. Properly speaking, then, the paradox of the founding is all about legitimacy. It would not be a problem to create an illegitimate system of laws de novo. This could simply be done by force: “obey these laws or suffer the consequences.” Such laws would be formed without procedural guidance; they would depend on someone's unilateral, procedurally unregulated will (Keenan 2003, 41–54; Rousseau [1762] 1987, book 2, chapter 7). They would not, therefore, be legitimate laws.         "
"7","To find a way around the paradox of the founding, we need a bootstrapping process that can create legitimate law where none existed before. Suppose we bracket the key assumption outlined above, that legitimate laws must be preceded by normatively acceptable procedures. In this case, we are no longer assuming that illegitimate lawmaking now necessarily prevents legitimacy in the future. It would allow us to take an illegitimate first step, with hope that things could be worked out as time goes on.         "
"8","I will refer to this kind of open‐ended, evolutionary approach as dynamic constitutionalism. It tries to resolve the paradox of the founding in a gradual, stepwise fashion by promoting ever more inclusion and political equality. A dynamic constitution evolves towards the kind of end state that was taken as a preliminary condition in the paradox of the founding. As the constitution is amended and developed, more and more people are included in the political sphere, and those already included are made more equal in their participatory capabilities. Dynamic constitutions attempt to overcome the challenge of political inclusion in process, allowing the people to formulate laws that proceduralize democracy even while the very definition of “the people” is under ongoing revision.         "
"9","Jürgen Habermas elaborates such a view. He sees constitutions as unfinished projects that are constantly amended and revised (Habermas 1996a, 129, 223, 384, 444–45, 454–55, 488–89). They are part of a “self‐correcting learning process” in which a society further develops commitments made by earlier generations. In Habermas's case, these commitments are implicit within a discursive conception of democratic lawmaking. They are guarantees of autonomy for all citizens, both in the public, political realm and the private, personal one (1996a, 104–31). Autonomy is elaborated, interpreted, fleshed out, and more fully realized as time goes by. This unfolding of basic commitments takes the form, in Habermas's view, of an increasingly sophisticated system of constitutional rights.         "
"10","The revisable, process‐oriented character of dynamic constitutions allows them to get underway politically while not being completely legitimate in the sense outlined above. In particular, dynamic constitutions are characterized by political marginalization and exclusion. While they are formulated by “the people,” that entity itself can be exclusionary in two principal ways. The first form of exclusion is a formal one based on the boundaries of political rights. Like any other constitution, a dynamic one sets boundaries on political membership at any given time to specify who can participate. It thus includes some people as full citizens while reducing others to partial citizenship without political rights. The second form of exclusion is an informal one, based on the differing opportunities available to different kinds of citizens. Constitutional regimes tend to promote different political opportunities for different kinds of people. This amounts to an informal kind of marginalization operating alongside and in spite of formal mechanisms of inclusion.         "
"11","To avoid condemning such a regime categorically, we need a revised conception of legitimacy. The conception I used to characterize the paradox of the founding was a backward‐looking one: it evaluates the present state of a system of laws based on that system's political history. Problems result when we try to apply such a conception to a constitution whose normative content develops through time. Such a conception cannot take account of the senses in which an evolving constitution satisfies important normative desiderata now by attempting to achieve them in the future. Dynamic constitutionalism thus requires an equally dynamic, temporal notion of legitimacy. When we extend the constitution‐building process through time, a regime must be able to form legitimate laws now through procedures that are not now, strictly speaking, up to snuff. (Otherwise we would simply be back in the paradox of the founding again.) This implies a different conception of normative acceptability for the procedures that structure lawmaking.         "
"12","The view of normative acceptability implicit in dynamic constitutionalism must above all be a forward‐looking one. Here, judgments of legitimacy need to evaluate the constitution's current ability to produce conditions allowing full political inclusion at some point in the future. These traits are evaluated with reference to a hypothetical future state, but they are very much an assessment of the current moment (Olson 2003b, 113–16). Legitimacy is thus secured in the present by traits of present law; it need not be permanently deferred to the future (paceHonig 2001, 794). Here democratic lawmaking can qualify as legitimate even when it is not conducted under ideal circumstances. Its legitimacy consists precisely in promoting such circumstances. Legitimacy is thus a judgment that the constitution is likely to pursue an idealized standard of inclusion. Such a constitution is dynamic precisely because it pursues this standard in real time and actual history.         "
"13","When legitimacy is construed as a forward‐looking assessment of present laws, its character changes in important ways. Because the future cannot be discerned with any certainty, the future state of a constitutional regime is also unclear. When we evaluate current laws, then, we cannot know what future effects those laws will have. We cannot know, in particular, whether the conditions that would confer legitimacy on a set of laws will in fact be met. A degree of epistemological uncertainty is necessarily characteristic of future‐oriented assessments of legitimacy. Judgments of the legitimacy of current laws are provisional and revisable. They are predictions that present laws are configured in a way that is likely to promote full inclusion in the future. In this kind of regime, legitimacy is a probabilistic and fallible assessment that we make about the character of present laws as they relate to future outcomes."
"14","Although Jürgen Habermas does not articulate such insights explicitly, he seems to share their general ethos. Because he sees constitutions as unfinished projects, Habermas's view of legitimacy must implicitly be a forward‐looking one. He writes about legitimacy as a “presumption” or “expectation” that people have about the laws under which they live (1996a, 447; 2001b, 115; 2003b, 265). Describing the principle of popular sovereignty, for instance, he says that it “lays down a procedure that, because of its democratic features, justifies the presumption [Vermutung] of legitimate outcomes” (2001b, 115). Habermas never clarifies the meaning of “presumption” or “expectation” with regard to legitimacy, but it seems to frame a conception in which legitimacy is based on forward‐looking, fallibilistic, and epistemologically nuanced judgment. As Honig perceptively notes, Habermas seems to view legitimacy as a horizon rather than a ground in this sense (2001, 796; cf. Habermas 2001a, 774). This is an evocative metaphor for future‐oriented judgments of legitimacy. The sense in which legitimacy is a horizon or is based on presumptions or expectations is not clear in Habermas's work, however, so his work is an imperfect illustration of the position I am outlining.         "
"15","Dynamic constitutionalism is a promising strategy to resolve the paradox of the founding. It provides a plausible revision of the classic democratic conception of legitimacy. In this view, a legitimate constitution need not be fully satisfactory from the start. A set of procedures could be exclusionary in the beginning, but develop in the direction of full inclusion. By adopting a more process‐oriented, epistemically nuanced conception of legitimacy, dynamic constitutionalism avoids the stasis of the paradox of the founding. It takes advantage of the fact that constitutions are meant to be amended. This view adds a temporal dimension to constitutional democracy, showing that we need not focus on the first step in forming a constitution as long as subsequent steps increase its democratic inclusiveness."
"16","To see whether dynamic constitutionalism can resolve the paradox of the founding, we must subject it to the same test that Frank Michelman applied to the founders' constitution. This requires us to examine dynamic constitutions solely as democratically self‐constituting entities. We want to determine whether a “people,” constituting itself in an illegitimate, noninclusive, but evolving manner, could bootstrap its way towards legitimacy. Because we are posing this as a purely political question, the test requires us to bracket—for the moment—other factors like culture that might provide assistance in resolving the paradox. Such a test is counterfactual, but it allows us to isolate variables and see what structural tendencies the political system has. This will provide a second answer to the question whether a democratic people could democratically constitute itself. Michelman has already answered “no” for constitutions created in a single act and judged legitimate by evaluating that act; we want to answer the same question for a dynamically evolving constitution judged legitimate by forward‐looking criteria.         "
"17","To pass this test, dynamic constitutionalism must make it possible for citizens to develop a legitimate form of democracy through democratic means. The people themselves must formulate their own democratic practice “from within,” developing more inclusive procedures as they go along. If they do not, reform could equally well result in greater marginalization or random drift with no direction at all. This would fail the criteria for a future‐oriented conception of legitimacy: we cannot consider the constitution legitimate now if we have no probable basis for expecting it to pursue full inclusion in the future.         "
"18","Unfortunately, we cannot expect this kind of directionality from within a self‐amending political regime—at least, not when we define it as dynamic and open‐ended in the way I have described. Ex hypothesi, such a regime is not structured in advance to achieve any particular result, “outside” and prior to the sovereign political decisions of its own citizens. Political deliberation can produce many different kinds of results: tolerant, inclusive, and egalitarian ones as well as xenophobic, exclusionistic, and differentiating ones. In one era, the sphere of political equality may expand and new groups be included. In another era, groups may be marginalized from politics, narrowing the range of those who can participate effectively. Those who are currently full citizens may define citizenship narrowly at one time and expansively at another. Or inclusion may be an ongoing source of controversy, with no principled basis for deciding one way or another. Opinion on this topic would then drift without direction. Absent some other influence, there is no reason to suppose that the process of constitutional amendment would promote inclusion over exclusion. We cannot conclude that progressive development towards full inclusion is any more likely than the myriad other directions that constitutional development could take.         "
"19","The indeterminacy of dynamic constitutions creates problems for the citizens authoring them. If a people decided to constitute itself solely by applying a future‐oriented conception of legitimacy to a dynamic constitution, their own practice would become paradoxical. The paradox would be lodged specifically within the project of trying to constitute themselves as a legitimate political entity in a way that is at once future‐oriented and dynamically evolving. Such citizens would attempt to evaluate their regime's legitimacy through an assessment of its likelihood to promote inclusion in the future. However, they would apply this scrutiny to a regime that is ex hypothesi open‐ended and changeable. The dynamic political change that characterizes this kind of regime would also deprive its citizens of the ability to predict what will happen in the constitution's future. As a result, such citizens would be in the paradoxical position of applying a conception of legitimacy that is premised on making predictions about the future to a political system that by definition frustrates such predictions. Because it arises from the indeterminacy of dynamic constitutions, this problem is best referred to as the paradox of dynamic indeterminacy. It is endemic to purely political conceptions of democracy that combine future‐oriented legitimacy with a dynamic, evolving constitution.         "
"20","The paradox of dynamic indeterminacy and the paradox of the founding are structurally different manifestations of similar problems. They are created by attempting to achieve legitimacy through two different procedural strategies, each evaluated according to a conception of legitimacy appropriate to it. The paradox of the founding crops up when political regimes try to generate their own legitimacy as defined by a backward‐looking standard. It involves a regression of necessary first steps: each exercise of democracy presupposing one before it. This paradox is static. It predicts that constitutional democracy cannot begin. The paradox of dynamic indeterminacy is structurally quite different. It appears when political regimes try to generate their own legitimacy as defined by a forward‐looking standard. It provokes a potentially endless progression of steps, none of which necessarily gets it closer to the goal of full inclusion. This paradox is dynamic. It forces one to conclude that an open‐ended, dynamically evolving constitution cannot be considered legitimate now based solely on its own ability to produce some future state. Both paradoxes have a common source. They are internal to the project of democratically self‐generating legitimacy. They show us that citizens cannot refashion democratic processes to be legitimate using only the political resources within such processes. This holds for two distinct notions of legitimacy.         "
"21","A future‐oriented notion of legitimacy was the key change that allowed us to resolve the paradox of the founding. It softened the more demanding and inflexible requirement that ideal, normative standards of legitimacy must be achieved in the present. By shifting our view of legitimacy towards the future, we were able to step around the paradox that threatened to stop democratic lawmaking in its tracks. Unfortunately, the paradox of dynamic indeterminacy blocks that move. It shows that future‐oriented notions of legitimacy are also problematic. We had been willing to accept temporary departures from full inclusion when we thought it could be predicted in the future. Now, however, that project is in doubt."
"22","The paradoxes of constitutional democracy show the problems that arise when a democratic people tries to constitute itself as a legitimate, lawmaking body solely through political means. Democratic self‐constitution seems fraught with paradox in both its backward‐looking and forward‐looking varieties. To resolve these paradoxes, it might be profitable to broaden the scope of the inquiry. Purely political self‐constitution is counterfactual and abstract. Actual political processes, in contrast, are much more complex and embedded in other aspects of social life. By enriching our view of politics in this way, we might be able to identify a more wide‐ranging set of conditions, norms, or principles that would help us predict the legitimacy of a constitutional regime. If this investigation could provide a coherent account of dynamic constitutionalism, it would resolve both paradoxes."
"23","Jürgen Habermas has thoughtfully attempted to provide such an account. He does this by showing how a normatively informed political culture could promote inclusion through time. This is a culture of allegiance to democratic values that Habermas refers to as “constitutional patriotism.” Communication provides the normative core of this view. Habermas highlights the extent to which constitutional lawmaking engages people in political argumentation and justification (2001a, 776; cf. Alexy 1989). The communicative character of such practices presupposes full political inclusion for all citizens and equality among them. The practice of political justification, for instance, requires that anyone who is affected by a given proposal be allowed to argue over its merits. It would be inconsistent, Habermas says, to claim that one has justified a proposal to fellow citizens while also excluding some of them from participating (1990, 86–91). Similarly, the communicative character of political argumentation presupposes equality between citizens (Habermas 1984, 25). This ensures that speaker and hearer stand on an equal footing, so that any resulting agreement is not motivated by force. Because Habermas sees lawmaking as a communicative practice, he also sees norms of inclusion and equality as implicit in democratic lawmaking itself.         "
"24","Constitutional patriotism is a political culture built up over time from the influence of such norms. Habermas imagines this occurring through a sustained practice initiated by some founding generation. The founders would view one another as “a self‐determining association of free and equal citizens” (Habermas 2001a, 778). Each subsequent generation would in turn “have the task of actualizing the still‐untapped normative substance of the system of rights laid down in the original document of the constitution” (2001a, 774). The founding generation initiates a shared project when it establishes a democratic nation, and subsequent generations take that project on board as their own, continuing and fulfilling it.         "
"25","The result is a political culture of constitutional patriotism informed from within by communicative norms. This culture is an integral part of political life. Habermas says, for instance, that democratic citizenship “require[s] that every citizen be socialized into a common political culture” (1996b, 500). When this happens, the system of laws is “nourished by the ‘democratic Sittlichkeit’ of enfranchised citizens and a liberal political culture that meets it halfway” (Habermas 1996d, 461; cf. 1996c, 471). Because such a culture is informed by norms of inclusion and equality, it orients the decisions of actual citizens towards those norms as well. Constitutional patriotism thus influences constitutional politics. In Habermas's view, it gives us a basis for predicting increasing inclusion in the future, resolving the paradox of dynamic indeterminacy through piecemeal constitutional reform.         "
"26","This proposal is based on two crucial assumptions: (1) the idea that the founders' shared practice creates a core of inclusive norms from the beginning; and (2) the idea that this core is reproduced and realized more fully by subsequent generations of practitioners."
"27","(1) When a founding group organizes itself to create a constitution, discursive justification takes center stage. The practices of justification that founders engage in imply norms of inclusion and equality among them, just as they would for any discourse participants trying sincerely to understand one another. Since the founders really do share practices of argumentation and justification, it is not problematic to say that they must see one another as communicative equals. Some sort of inclusive and egalitarian politics could be established on the norms implicit in these practices. Therefore the first assumption is not problematic."
"28","(2) The crucial question, however, is whether these practices would likely be taken over and continued in a teleological, progressive sense by subsequent generations. For this to occur, the constitution's inheritors must continue in the footsteps of its founders. Habermas writes that “citizens must see themselves as heirs to a founding generation, carrying on with the common project” (2003a, 193). Seeing oneself as an heir, in this case, involves seeing oneself as a participant in the same project undertaken by the founders. This requires one to understand the normative principles that animated their lawmaking and see oneself as bound by those same principles (2001a, 775). Such felt allegiance to the founders' project helps bridge the gap between the founding generation and its successors. It provides an “implicit but stable point of reference” for understanding the constitution's normative content (Habermas 2003a, 193).         "
"29","Habermas claims that such a strong sense of felt identification would come from being “in the same boat” as the founding generation (Habermas 2001a, 775). The forms of argumentation and justification that go into writing a constitution reflect the fact that the founders recognize one another as cooperative equals in a shared undertaking. Their performative attitude towards one another engages norms of equality and inclusion. Habermas claims that subsequent generations would have this same kind of communicative relation among themselves. These similarities give later generations an “intuitive knowledge of what it means to frame a constitution” (2003a, 193). Such a stable point of reference makes the communicative content of the founding, including its implicit presuppositions of equality and inclusion, intuitively comprehensible to contemporary citizens.         "
"30","To gain this kind of insight, members of present generations would have to perform what Habermas calls a “reconstructive” analysis of the past political situation. Such an analysis is designed to identify the norms implicit in people's actual practices (Baynes 1990; Habermas 1979; McCarthy 1978, 272–91; 1994, 63–100; Olson 2003a). The people in question need not have a conscious grasp of such norms. Rather, the norms are discovered in retrospect as implicit presuppositions of practices that have already occurred.         "
"31","A principal contribution of reconstructive analysis is to highlight the gap between actual practices and the norms they presuppose. We aim at a certain idealized practice, but factual limitations interfere. As a result, actual practices fall short of our idealized intentions, but the latter serve as an ongoing corrective to the former. Each society institutionalizes the norms of communication in a unique and imperfect way. Those formulations are specific to social, cultural, and historical circumstances. Whatever commonality such norms exhibit between cultures or epochs, they are manifested differently in different cultures and at different times.         "
"32","In cases of constitution founding, present citizens would need to reach back into their knowledge of the past and reconstruct the implicit presuppositions of past political practices. Further, they would need to select from other, similar meanings that may be discerned in reconstructive retrospect, determining that norms of communicative inclusion and equality most centrally characterize past practices. Finally, they would have to consciously identify with such implicit norms and develop an active intention to correct their own practices in accordance with them."
"33","Accessing the intuitive meaning of the founding is clearly a difficult task. Let us suppose, though, that present citizens perform this feat of historical insight, understanding their current practices as communicative in the same way that the founders' were. Unfortunately, this understanding would not in itself motivate the kinds of practices we could characterize as an unfolding tradition of growing inclusion and equality. Such an understanding would not be sufficient to transform immediate acts of political problem solving into a longer term process of historical development. To see their actions as part of a larger developmental trajectory with a cumulative, teleological purpose, individuals would need a thicker sense of identification and belonging to a “people” and a “project” with transhistorical identity. This would require active construction of collective identities and imagined communities that persist through time. Mere reconstructive insight about the past is not sufficient for this task; it needs particular kinds of myth making, story telling, and pictorial representation (Anderson 1991). Such a shared identity might be built around communicative norms of equality and inclusion, but actually doing so is a messy and contingent process (Markell 2000, 52). The fact that present generations understand the normative content of the past does not ipso facto give them the motivation to create a historically extended collective identity around this understanding.         "
"34","Further problems arise from the complexity of culture formation itself. Habermas seems to believe that people can shape a political culture predominantly around implicit communicative norms, correcting and overriding various other influences arising from their actual practices. He writes, for instance, that “The performance of those founding acts from which self‐governing communities originate thus contains an implicit, intuitively available meaning that is the same for everybody, though it is spelled out and explicated in the wordings of so many different texts, interpretations, and implementations” (Habermas 2003a, 193). Here Habermas seems to downplay the cultural importance of practices themselves in all their complexity, focusing more narrowly on the “implicit, intuitively available meaning” that they contain.         "
"35","To see what is at stake here, consider the following example. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees freedom of political speech. That guarantee places a high value on political communication, which in Habermas's terms further presupposes equality and inclusion. At the same time, our actual political practices are quite different. We deny fellow citizens the material means to communicate as equals, citing property rights, market freedom, and moral hazard as justifications (Olson 2006, 7–13, 193–202). The question, then, is which of these should be taken to influence the ongoing development of our political culture: the presupposed norms or their highly imperfect realization?         "
"36","This is an empirical question about cultural development. It asks how political culture is formed, and in particular, what kinds of practices are reproduced over time as durable aspects of the behavior and outlook of a group of people. The answer to the question will be similarly complex. Our implicit normative commitments undoubtedly shape political culture through the practices that presuppose and partially embody them. However, many other kinds of practice shape political culture as well, pulling it in other directions. Because our deeds so often fail to match our intentions, political culture is similarly multivalent and partially self‐contradictory."
"37","This creates problems for Habermas's idea that a culture of inclusion and equality could develop over time. Differences in the actual practices of various generations disrupt this developmental logic. They introduce different cultures of communication, different structural influences, different procedures, and different practices. As a result, there may well be no steady cultural development towards greater inclusion and equality. Rather, different interpretations of inclusion and equality are institutionalized at different times, with correspondingly nonlinear influences on political culture."
"38","This is not to say that constitutional foundings must necessarily be politically and normatively discontinuous from the practices of present generations. It only shows that we cannot assume that the normative attitudes of the founders are captured in their own lawmaking and passed on to posterity. The complexities of cultural change make its future direction difficult to predict. Thus it does not provide the strong normative continuity that Habermas would like."
"39","Our conclusion about constitutional patriotism must be nuanced accordingly. We cannot assume that the communicative norms implicit in a constitution's founding will be elaborated to their full significance as time goes on. The communicative character of politics at any one time is a hopeful sign, but the complexities of cultural reproduction make it difficult to project any particular historical trajectory from that point. Communicative politics is an important resource, but not robust enough to be the sole focus of our attention."
"40","The idea of constitutional patriotism, as it has been developed so far, cannot head off the paradox of dynamic indeterminacy. It encounters problems by trying to steer the evolution of the law with normative content inherited from a founding generation. Rather than rely on normativity deposited in a constitution's past, I would like to develop a solution that can be applied even to constitutions lacking such a noble heritage. A theory of constitutional democracy would be most flexible and useful, I believe, if it could account for the incremental improvement of flawed traditions. Pursuing this idea, I will take a different tack to resolve the paradox of dynamic indeterminacy. It capitalizes on the tension between facts and norms—a Habermasian trademark—but focuses on properties inherent in the development of law itself."
"41","To resolve the paradox of dynamic indeterminacy, we must find some basis for predicting that a dynamic, evolving constitution will encode more inclusive procedures over time. The problem, then, is to identify a set of ideas or circumstances that might warrant such a prediction."
"42","As we have already seen, inclusion is undermined in two principal ways in dynamic constitutions. The first is by formal exclusion rooted in the distribution of political rights. It occurs when a definition of citizenship makes some people subject to laws that they do not have the opportunity to help formulate. The second form is more insidious. It marginalizes people from politics by giving them lesser political opportunities. In a modern, complex, institutionally differentiated political system, these problems can be corrected only through law. Law defines the component parts of citizenship, deciding who may participate in formal political processes. It allocates opportunities for participation and shapes the environment within which such opportunities are realized. It articulates the roles of political actors and determines who has political agency relative to whom and what specific qualities that agency has. Law, in this sense, is the material structure of political agency in modern societies."
"43","Because political agency is rooted in the law, the forms and quantities of agency that various people have are largely a matter of law as well. Agency is distributed by laws lying at the juncture of constitutionalism and democracy, at the point where the constitution provides a procedural framework for democratic practice. Most obvious among these laws are the ones that confer political rights. Such rights give citizens formal opportunities to participate in the political domain. Equally important, however, are the less visible measures that affect a person's ability to use political rights. Social and economic standing, for instance, can be crucial in equalizing the material bases of political equality (Olson 2006, chapters 4 and 6). In order to promote greater inclusion, then, a given constitution would need to progressively eliminate political inequalities in both formal and informal senses. It would need to promote equal rights for political participation and back them up with the social and economic conditions that allow people to use such rights equally. This would promote inclusion in both senses: by extending the boundaries of political rights and equalizing the opportunities they provide.         "
"44","The laws articulating political agency are as complex and multifarious as the capabilities they distribute. There are many different ways to have political agency in a given society—discursive abilities, organizational skills, wealth (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995)—and these capabilities are complex products of a given regime of laws. For the sake of compactness, I will refer to the laws articulating political agency as elements of citizenship. They all have the function of determining a person's political status as a member of the polity. Citizenship is not an all‐or‐nothing status in this conception, but a quantitatively and qualitatively differentiated one. People can be citizens in many different ways in a given society, depending on their various capabilities to participate. Some people benefit from the rights of citizenship more than others. Some benefit from some aspects of these rights more than others. Being an equal citizen in Marshall's sense (1963), then, is only one idealized form of citizenship.         "
"45","To figure out how well a given regime is doing with regard to inclusion, it is important to have some yardstick for defining and measuring progress. This requires us to investigate the relation between law and political agency in greater detail. As we have seen, the subtleties of agency's distribution are to a large extent determined by the fine, qualitative character of a given system of laws. The legal measures promoting political agency have unique structural properties not shared with other laws, however. When they constitute political agency, such measures also confer the ability to formulate the laws themselves. They give citizens limited, legally defined capabilities to determine the meaning and benefits of their own status. In this sense citizenship is reflexive (Olson 2006, chapter 6). It provides people with the bases of political agency, allowing them in turn to define and rearticulate the very bases of that agency. The political activity of citizens thus reflects back on itself, formulating the laws that constitute the bases of that activity in the first place.         "
"46","Reflexive citizenship is a property of political procedures and the other measures that support political agency. It is the prosaic, positive, material tendency of a body of laws to give citizens certain kinds of control over the lawmaking process. The more equally that marginalized citizens determine the benefits of their own citizenship, the more they can act to enhance their own agency. Reflexivity describes the extent to which such people have the ability to control the bases of their own agency within any given regime of citizenship. It is not an all‐or‐nothing status, but a matter of degree. The greater a citizen's reflexivity, the more control she has over the legal measures that specify her own agency. Reflexivity is thus an important index of political inclusion. It describes both a person's political agency and the extent to which she can modify, refine, and enhance that agency."
"47","Reflexive political agency gives a regime of citizenship unusual properties. The more reflexive a given regime is, the more its members can control the laws that establish their rights as citizens. The more control people have over their own rights, the more able they are to protect those rights. In such circumstances, people are much more difficult to marginalize or exclude. Political attack, changing economic circumstance, or cultural bias are all less likely to undermine a person's political agency when they can be actively opposed. As various groups of citizens acquire greater agency, they correspondingly acquire the ability to defend the bases of that agency against backsliding. This ability helps prevent retrograde motion in the kinds of agency a conception of citizenship provides. Reflexive agency thus provides its beneficiaries with the means to resist marginalization and exclusion."
"48","To see how the idea of reflexive agency is useful for resolving the paradoxes of constitutional democracy, we can use this idea as a lens for surveying our own constitutional tradition. If we look at the history of Anglo‐American constitutionalism since the 1640s, we find a gradual expansion of political agency for marginalized groups. In the American constitution's early years, for instance, its “Framers” enjoy a highly reflexive status because they have full political agency. Each of them, as a founder of the Constitution, can participate as an equal in determining the benefits of citizenship. Many others, however, are subject to the law without being able to author it. They only enjoy partial forms of citizenship. Their status thus exhibits little reflexivity—they have little ability to challenge the laws limiting their own agency. Later, many participatory limitations along lines of wealth, occupation, sex, and race are removed. Small property owners, craftsmen, laborers, and finally women enter the political sphere and become influential political actors alongside the landed aristocrats who had previously monopolized politics. This is an important but incomplete transformation: the franchise has expanded, but there are still substantial inequalities in political participation. Racial minorities, for instance, have a complex relation to this story as their political agency is alternately enhanced and diminished over the course of a century (Smith 1997).         "
"49","In this history, constitutional reform has tended to bring more and more people into a reflexive relation with the bases of their own political agency. They have better means to affect the laws structuring their agency, even though these means are incomplete and mediated by many other forces. As a result, such people are better able to specify the kinds of rights appropriate for them, and later to defend those rights against diminution. As this change occurs, it reshapes the political landscape. Issues of labor, gender equity, and racial equality become integral parts of the agenda. Newly enfranchised groups remake politics to an extent, establishing themselves firmly within it and entrenching their own status as rights‐bearing individuals who are entitled to participate as equals in at least some, often controversial sense."
"50","These examples illustrate an important point about the dynamics of agency and inclusion. The greater a marginalized group's degree of reflexive agency, the more likely they will be to preserve gains in inclusion. Reflexivity does this by introducing an asymmetry between gaining and losing agency. Once a group gains political agency—however that may occur—they are less likely to lose it. This asymmetry arises precisely because reflexive agency allows its possessors the means to defend it. We can refer to this as a legal‐political ratcheting effect. A ratchet is a mechanical device that allows motion in one direction while preventing it in another. It is an apt metaphor for the function of reflexive agency. By creating a differential likelihood of inclusion versus exclusion, reflexive agency discourages backsliding and preserves gains made in the political process. To be sure, reflexive agency does not ratchet with hard mechanical precision. A leaky valve may be a more exact comparison in this sense: reflexive agency maintains a directional flow in spite of various countercurrents and other tendencies.         "
"51","Political agency exhibits a ratcheting effect, I believe, because its institutionalization is a path‐dependent process. Path dependence characterizes sequences of events in which earlier ones establish the conditions of possibility for later ones, narrowing the scope of what can happen at a later stage (Arthur 1994; Mahoney 2000, 2004; Pierson 2000a, 2000b, 2004). Early occurrences in the path exercise causal or limiting influence on later ones. In path‐dependent processes, the sequence of events is important, an event's place in the sequence matters a great deal, and events early in a sequence have disproportionate importance in determining later ones. Further, path dependence sometimes creates a dynamic in which early events make ones similar to themselves more likely in the future. The early events may occur for relatively arbitrary and improbable reasons, but they establish conditions that make their reproduction increasingly likely. These cases set up a self‐reinforcing process that makes a particular outcome increasingly probable. One could not predict from the start what the outcome would be, but it grows clearer and more likely as time goes on. As this happens, it also becomes increasingly difficult to change the direction of the developmental path.         "
"52","The development of law is path dependent in many ways (Hathaway 2001; Orren 1991, 112; Suchman 2003, 121–23). The doctrine of stare decisis, for instance, obliges judges to articulate present decisions in light of past ones. Legal precedent thus exercises a strong influence on present decisions, narrowing the scope of judicial discretion and giving past decisions authority over present ones. Judges, as a result, do not have a free hand to decide interpretive questions as they see fit. They are expected to follow the path already laid out, or if not, they must draw on principles implicit in the path sequence to justify their departures (Dworkin 1977, chapter 4). Past decisions thus define a path‐dependent process of legal development that increases the impact of earlier principles, ideas, and cases on the jurisprudence that follows them.         "
"53","Constitutional development is similarly path dependent. Decisions made early in a polity's formation can be entrenched as constitutional essentials. This status makes them relatively difficult to amend and gives them trump authority over subsequent lawmaking. A constitution's earlier forms thus exercise particular importance, simply because of their pioneering status in processes of legal formation. They establish political ground rules, institutional mechanisms, and terms of discourse for what comes after, increasing the likelihood of some later events and decreasing the likelihood of others. Because of their temporal and legal priority, early forms of a constitution have a disproportionate impact on what will develop at later times. Constitutional development thus has a strongly path‐dependent character."
"54","Many aspects of political agency are similarly path dependent. Political agency now gives people greater say in future lawmaking processes, allowing them to increase their political agency in the future. Legal measures promoting inclusion can thus have a path‐dependent ratcheting effect early in a constitution's history. They may establish conditions of equality that will prevent any group or groups from dominating. In such a case, a regime's tendency towards equality will reproduce itself through time. Conversely, a regime of rights creating inequalities in political agency can have a similarly path‐dependent ratcheting effect. It would allow politically advantaged people to entrench and sustain their advantage. In either case, the distribution of political agency tends to develop in a self‐augmenting, path‐dependent manner.         "
"55","Path dependence is usually applied retrospectively to explain the past causes of present events. It could also be employed prospectively, however, to make predictions about the likelihood of certain future events. Such predictions would be based on the way present events change the probabilities of future ones, forming a basis for the kinds of fallibilistic judgments needed to evaluate a dynamic constitution.         "
"56","Consider, for instance, the bifurcated path of development I have just predicted for the distribution of political agency. One possible path increasingly reinforces inclusion and equality. In this scenario, a constitutional regime's present characteristics tend to promote the agency of those who are excluded and marginalized. It creates a tendency towards equality in which previously marginalized people gain political voice and use it to sustain their own agency. Agency becomes reflexive for more and more people. When laws promote more equal distribution of reflexive agency, the political sphere becomes more inclusive. In this scenario, the present distribution of political agency has a path‐dependent effect on its future distribution. As the political agency of previously marginalized citizens increases, they acquire more control over the legal bases of their own agency. They are thus more able to promote and defend that agency by participating in the political process itself. Their reflexivity as citizens increases. Reflexivity in turn has the felicitous property of helping to sustain itself. It gives marginalized citizens greater capabilities to retain the gains they have made against exclusion. The constitution thus makes slow, unsystematic, but overall progress towards full inclusion.         "
"57","The other path moves in the opposite direction. This darker scenario reinforces exclusion and inequality. Here the present conditions in a constitutional regime create inequalities in agency that are reproduced and magnified in time. Path dependence in this case results in substantial political inequalities, entrenched elites who dominate the political system, and a perverse ratcheting phenomenon that strips marginalized people of the scraps of agency they have while augmenting that of the already powerful. This is a path of exclusion and marginalization."
"58","These two evolutionary scenarios—the path of inclusion and the path of exclusion—provide normative grounds for evaluating the legitimacy of an evolving constitution. They give us a much clearer idea of what it might mean to talk about a fallible, probabilistic estimate of legitimacy based on a constitution's future development. When present events exercise a disproportionate, determining influence on later ones, we have normative reasons to structure procedures accordingly. If we can predict that the institutionalization of political agency is a path‐dependent process, and we predict that path dependence tends to promote either highly beneficial or highly detrimental states of affairs (rather than more mixed alternatives), we have a much clearer idea of what it means to promote inclusion and avoid exclusion. To avoid dynamics of exclusion, present procedures must promote inclusion and equal political agency on a self‐sustaining path into the future."
"59","The path dependence of political agency makes a powerful argument for creating tendencies towards equal agency as soon as possible and in a way that maximizes their self‐reinforcing character. When a constitutional regime is configured to promote path‐dependent inclusion now, we have reason to suppose that inclusion will continue to increase. Future iterations of the constitution will be more likely to promote inclusion and sustain it. We can thus be satisfied that the criteria for a future‐oriented notion of legitimacy are met. A dynamically evolving constitution, amended by the political acts of actual citizens, takes on a kind of directionality when it adopts the right features. Those are the features promoting path‐dependent evolution towards reflexive citizenship for everyone.         "
"60","The constitutional features required to promote and sustain reflexive agency become vitally important in this picture. They could be more precisely described and developed by a theoretically informed empirical research program, designed to figure out how reflexive agency can best be institutionalized in a path‐dependent manner. Most minimally, this would have to include measures promoting formal inclusion, so that all people subject to the law are politically able to participate in its formation. Such measures would govern the “spread” of political agency to make sure no one is left out. Further, it would have to include measures equalizing political opportunities. Any structural asymmetry towards inclusion and against exclusion would contribute to this kind of path‐dependent dynamic. For instance, a constitution including new voices in the political process while making marginalization more difficult exhibits this kind of asymmetry (Young 2000). Similarly, one restraining gains in agency by political elites would prevent them from outdistancing less able compatriots and entering a self‐reinforcing path of exclusion (McCormick 2006). Certain kinds of constitutional entrenchment mechanisms would fall under this rubric as well (cf. Schwartzberg 2004). A constitution entrenching equal political agency and shielding it from erosion would privilege inclusion over exclusion. In so doing, it would promote the kinds of conditions inclining us to a favorable judgment of its legitimacy.         "
"61","Such devices, when implemented to promote a path‐dependent spread and equalization of reflexive agency, would provide the means to avoid the paradoxes of constitutional democracy. To resolve Frank Michelman's paradox of the founding, I have followed Jürgen Habermas in proposing a dynamic view of constitutionalism. This in turn requires us to evaluate legitimacy differently. Our view must be more epistemically nuanced, because it is now based on a forward‐looking assessment of the constitution's ability to promote inclusion in the future. The problem with this view, however, is its vulnerability to its own open‐endedness. The paradox of dynamic indeterminacy besets any political system trying to combine a future‐oriented conception of legitimacy with a dynamic constitution. To avoid this paradox, we needed a more sophisticated conception of legitimacy for evolving constitutions. The criteria I have identified—reflexive political agency and path dependence—provide such a conception. They describe more specific criteria of future‐oriented legitimacy that can be observed now, within the shifting sands of a dynamically changing constitution. They allow us to differentiate between constitutional regimes that are likely to promote inclusion in the future and those that are not. By identifying regimes that are likely to promote inclusion, these criteria allow us to assess the legitimacy of dynamically evolving constitutions. In so doing, they provide a coherent account of legitimacy for dynamic, future‐oriented constitutions. The ability to predict the future conditions of legitimacy allows us to avoid the paradox of dynamic indeterminacy. At the same time, the dynamism of this conception allows us to avoid the paradox of the founding."
"62","Before concluding this discussion, it is worth considering some finer points of the view I have proposed. This view has a vital connection to the concrete political struggles of real citizens. Path dependence, as I have used it, is merely a projection that certain outcomes are likely. It does not guarantee those outcomes, nor does it claim that legal development is an inexorable force immune to human will or action. Quite the opposite is true. This view gives primacy to the open play of politics, social movements, and even moments of “aconstitutionalism” like those described by Honig (2001, 800–801). Predictions of path dependence only background the complexities of real politics, highlighting structural features of constitutional democracy that give us hope for future inclusion. Such predictions depend, in the end, on the concrete actions of people and groups in the political arena. The view I have framed predicts, for instance, that when people are given the ability to control the legal bases of their own agency, they will be in a better position to defend, sustain, and elaborate that agency. It does not bring about that result, but only tries to discern its likelihood within a given constellation of laws, social forces, and political interactions."
"63","This might seem like an unsettlingly haphazard solution at first glance. Predictions of path dependence are probabilistic and fallible. Even though economists and historical sociologists like to characterize such processes as “locked in,” this is only an assessment of their likelihood to follow one path rather than another. Similarly, the changeability of laws would seem to undercut any prediction of constitutional progress. Gains in political inclusion would be unstable and potentially reversible in this picture. Rapid economic change, for instance, could swiftly undercut the bases of political agency and marginalize vulnerable groups. Outright mischief could also be a problem. A group could be outmaneuvered or outvoted by others in the political arena, stripping them of agency and casting them into political silence. All of this makes it seemingly difficult to claim that we could make reliable predictions about path dependence or reflexive citizenship."
"64","Such worries merely illustrate an important point about the case at hand, however. All that is necessary to resolve the paradox of dynamic indeterminacy is overall directionality on a self‐reinforcing path, not unswerving, beeline progress. To call political processes legitimate, we must be able to claim that they are likely to become steadily more inclusive over time. Overall directionality is sufficient to meet this standard. When reflexive citizenship is established in a path‐dependent manner, it adopts such a direction. Reflexivity, institutionalized in this way, generates an overall, aggregate, probable tendency towards gains in political agency. Within the chaos of political change and constitutional amendment, it allows us to predict that on the whole, over time, there will be a general tendency for political agency to become more equally distributed. This tendency is sufficient to produce an expectation of slow, incremental progress towards full inclusion. It is likely nonlinear, in the sense that episodes of progress will be punctuated by occasional backsliding. It additionally depends on the right kinds of procedures being established to start things off in the right direction. When such normative requirements are met, however, a kind of dumb, mundane teleology is created by the interaction between actual politics and concrete characteristics of the law. This tendency puts properly formulated constitutions on an indirect but steady path towards inclusion. Observing such features in action allows us to conclude that the constitution warrants a judgment of legitimacy.         "
"65","One of the greatest benefits of this solution is its philosophical minimalism. This proposal does not take on large burdens of justification, nor does it make adventurous assumptions about moral norms or political culture. The path‐dependent, ratcheting effect of reflexive citizenship is normatively indiscriminate. It does not matter, on these terms, why gains in political agency occur. They could come about because citizens recognize one another as communicative equals. They could occur because of a culture of egalitarianism and inclusion. They could even arise from unrelated social changes, say a change in a group's economic fortunes that correspondingly increases their political agency. All that matters is the actual fact of change and its accompanying tendency to allow people a self‐referential ability to defend their new status. Development towards greater reflexivity and inclusion is thus a factual, positive characteristic of certain systems of laws. It does not rely on particular ethical norms, cultures, or cross‐generational commitments to promote a constitution's legitimacy, though in the end it is consistent with them.         "
"66","In spite of its minimalism, this view still packs a strong normative punch. It declares illegitimate any constitution that does not exhibit signs of pursuing full political inclusion. If applied today, this conception would delegitimate most of the world's democracies. After all, most of them lack serious attention to eradicating political inequality. The view I have sketched requires us to abolish such inequalities in a progressive and predictable manner, evolving towards a point at which disadvantaged people would be able to protest the injustice of their own condition."
"67","The two paradoxes I have outlined form a Scylla and Charybdis for constitutional democracy. Any democratic constitution must find some course between them. I have tried to chart such a course here. Because it has been a convoluted one, it is worth retracing some of our steps. My argument shows that it is possible to get a legitimate democratic constitution off the ground. The solution I have outlined is an evolutionary one. It emphasizes dynamic reform, the political functions of citizenship, and structural properties of the law.         "
"68","The cornerstone of this view is the idea of adopting a forward‐looking conception of legitimacy. This shifts our focus from guaranteeing that conditions of legitimacy have already been fulfilled, to investigating the conditions under which they are likely to be fulfilled. Dynamic constitutionalism and reflexive citizenship are constitutional features that can render such conditions likely. When they are institutionalized in a path‐dependent manner, they can promote piecemeal progress towards political inclusion. They are constitutional features that would successfully match a future‐oriented conception of legitimacy. Among constitutions of this type, there need be no intentional sense of a shared project or overall normative continuity across a constitution's history. The changing normative intentions of political actors are sedimented in the law and refined over time. This solution is not based on any single normative core or shared insight, but on a long history of legal development that could be quite discontinuous and heterogeneous. It is a materialist, proceduralist, and positivist solution, one that capitalizes on the law's own abilities to foster a self‐reinforcing spiral of political inclusion.         "
"69","This argument makes a very particular point about constitutional democracy. A democratic constitution that is going to measure up to demanding standards of popular sovereignty—standards that many in the West take for granted—can do so as a result of its internal legal structure. That constitution must be dynamic, which means that it must contain procedures for its own amendment. Such a constitution must also provide political agency to its citizens—participatory rights of various kinds but also auxiliary measures like education and welfare that promote political equality. Those measures must support political agency to the point at which citizenship becomes reflexive in a path‐dependent manner. This path dependence must be sufficient to provide a probabilistic assurance of full inclusion. Reflexive citizenship functions as a ratchet of inclusion within a developing constitution. It provides groups struggling for inclusion with constitutional resources to sustain the gains they achieve. Such episodes of social change spur the expansion of citizenship and provide new levels of agency for the ratchet to sustain. Taken together, these features make possible an upward spiral of reflexivity—the growing self‐determination of all citizens."
"70","This list suggests that a constitution with particular, carefully chosen features can resolve the paradoxes of constitutional democracy. Resources internal to democracy and positive law support political change if they are started off in the right direction. Minimalism is the ultimate payoff of this argument, then. It lightens the normative burden borne by theories like Habermas's, showing that we need not resort to a complex theory of cultural progress to resolve the paradoxes. Positive, procedural characteristics of the law take us quite far in this task at a fairly low cost."
"71","Beyond its lessons for political theorists, this argument has heuristic value for politics in a broader sense. Insofar as actual democracies seek to implement something like the liberal‐democratic notion of popular sovereignty, this essay serves as a warning of the challenges that lie ahead. Any society relying on its own democratic resources to institutionalize democracy plays a dangerous game. It is important to acknowledge the pitfalls that such a project will encounter. Measures promoting dynamic constitutionalism and path‐dependent development of reflexive citizenship would help to avoid these problems. In this regard, the paradoxes themselves furnish a compelling argument for inclusion and political equality. If citizens want to organize their social and political lives in a noncontradictory way, the burden is placed on them to choose their laws accordingly. Paradox thus furnishes a powerful argument for a particular kind of democratic constitution—one fostering inclusion through self‐reinforcing processes of dynamic reform and reflexive citizenship."
