"1","We assume that the general election involves two parties, which we label the Democrats and the Republicans, with voters' policy preferences distributed along a left‐right continuum among citizens who will vote in the general election, labeled the general electorate. This electorate has a known median voter position mG, labeled the general election median. We assume that when multiple candidates seek a party's nomination the party holds a closed primary5 to select its nominee (we will consider the cases where both parties hold competitive primaries and also where only one party holds a competitive primary), and that the medians of the policy preferences for the respective parties' primary electorates are known: the Democratic primary electorate's median voter position is mD, which we label the Democratic median, and the Republican primary electorate's median position is mR. We further assume that the Democratic median is at least as left wing—and that the Republican median is at least as right wing—as the general election median, i.e., that mD≤mG≤mR.            "
"2","The basic model incorporates the following assumptions:"
"3","                              "
"4","If a party's primary election is contested, then exactly two candidates compete in the primary. The Democratic candidates in such contested primaries are labeled D1 and D2, while the Republican candidates in contested primaries are labeled R1 and R2.                     "
"5","The candidates select a single policy position that is fixed during the primary and the general election. That is, candidates cannot readjust their policies following the primary in order to enhance their appeal to the general electorate. The Democratic candidates' positions are labeled d1 and d2 for candidates D1 and D2, respectively; the Republican candidates' positions are labeled r1 and r2 for candidates R1 and R2, respectively.                     "
"6","Each candidate selects a single position that maximizes his joint probability of winning the primary and general election, i.e., each candidate selects the position that maximizes his probability of winning office.                     "
"7","Our specification that contested primaries involve exactly two candidates simplifies the analysis and the presentation of our results; on the web site (http://course.wilkes.edu/merrill) we show that our results extend—with stronger assumptions—to multicandidate primary elections. The assumption that candidates cannot shift their positions between the primary and the general election is also a simplification, but one that is intuitively plausible: for while real‐world candidates do at times attempt to “tack towards the center” following their primary nomination, they are hampered by the policy promises they have made during the primary. Furthermore, candidates' postprimary attempts to dramatically shift their policy images leave them open to the charge of political opportunism or “flip‐flopping” that can damage their general election prospects.6"
"8","The voting model—which is similar to the one developed in Adams and Merrill (n.d.)—specifies that voters evaluate candidates based on their policy positions plus a valence component. Specifically, for each voter i with policy preference xi, the policy distance component of i's evaluation of candidate j is given as g(j, xi), where g(j, xi) represents i's policy utility for j's position j. Probably the two best‐known special cases for the policy distance component are those in which voters have either linear policy losses, i.e., where policy utilities are given as g(j, xi) =−a|j−xi |, or quadratic policy losses for which policy utilities are given as g(j, xi) =−a(j−xi)2, where in either case a is a strictly positive parameter that represents the salience of the policy dimension relative to the valence dimension. There is no abstention.            "
"9","The valence component of voters' candidate evaluations captures dimensions “on which parties or leaders are differentiated not by what they advocate, but by the degree to which they are linked in the public's mind with conditions, goals, or symbols which almost everyone approves or disapproves” (Stokes 1992, 143), such as competence, integrity, leadership ability, and charisma. We assume that the valence component of voter i's evaluation of candidate j is identical for all voters and has two subcomponents: the candidate's measured valence characteristics, Vj, which the candidates know at the time they select their policy strategies, and which we label the candidate's precampaign valence image; and unmeasured characteristics ɛj that capture the candidates' campaigning abilities, which determine how skillfully the candidates present themselves to the public during the election campaign, and which the candidates do not know at the time they choose their policy positions.7 These unmeasured characteristics are labeled campaign valence images. Thus we have               "
"10","Our distinction between the measured and unmeasured components of valence plausibly captures the information environment candidates confront. At the time the candidates commit to their policies they are likely to have formed general impressions about their own—and their opponents'—valence images, based upon the candidates' public reputations for competence, integrity, and leadership ability (the candidates form such estimates via their contacts with constituents, public opinion polls and private polling, by studying media coverage, and so on). Furthermore, candidates possess additional information about each competitor's fund‐raising success, the qualities of their campaign organizations, and (in some cases) their past performances as campaigners, factors that are crucial for projecting how effectively each candidate will campaign in the current election. Such information forms the basis for the candidate's precampaign valence image Vj. However, one factor that cannot be easily projected in advance is how skillfully each candidate will prove to be at campaigning—a factor that may be crucial to the public's evaluation of the candidate's valence characteristics. At the level of presidential primaries, for instance, candidates such as Howard Dean, John Glenn, Edmund Muskie, and Ted Kennedy were widely projected—in advance of the campaign—to be formidable candidates, yet none of them lived up to their press clippings, i.e., each ran an unexpectedly poor campaign and proved less attractive to voters than most analysts had projected. By contrast, candidates such as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan proved more adept campaigners than many observers anticipated. Note that in these cases the unexpected success or failure of the candidate turned primarily on factors relating to the candidate's campaigning skills—which in turn influenced perceptions of his charisma, leadership ability, and competence—rather than on the candidate's policy positions.9 In addition, we emphasize that the uncertainty that candidates experience with respect to their relative campaigning skills applies even in situations where the candidates are well known to each other; indeed, most of the presidential candidates mentioned above had well‐established reputations as campaigners (in some cases these reputations were positive, in other cases negative), yet in all of these examples the candidate's previous “track record” proved a poor indicator of his ability to present himself as an attractive candidate in the current campaign. The unmeasured valence component ɛj captures this uncertainty.            "
"11","In addition, we assume that all primary voters vote sincerely, a strong assumption that is contradicted by empirical studies suggesting that some primary voters and party activists consider the candidates' prospective appeal in the general election (Abramowitz 1989; Stone and Abramowitz 1983). As indicated above, we demonstrate elsewhere (see the reference in footnote 4) that our central conclusions extend to such strategic primary voting scenarios, provided that the candidates' campaigning skills are sufficiently salient to the voters, relative to the candidates' policy strategies. Here we simply note that if political parties benefit from holding primaries even in the extreme case where all primary voters ignore the candidates' appeal to the general electorate, then this conclusion surely applies to situations where primary voters strategically account for this factor.            "
"12","Given the assumptions of sincere voting in the primary and full voter turnout, the following remarks immediately follow:"
"13","                              "
"14"," Remark 1. In a two‐candidate primary election, the winning candidate is the one who is preferred by the party's median primary election voter.                  "
"15","                              "
"16"," Remark 2. In the two‐candidate general election, the winning candidate is the one who is preferred by the median general election voter.                  "
"17","Finally, we assume that for each candidate j the unknown component ɛj, which represents the candidate's campaign valence image, is selected independently over candidates from a type 1 extreme value distribution. This assumption, which has been employed extensively both in empirical studies of voting behavior (Schofield and Sened 2005, 2006; Whitten and Palmer 1996) and in spatial models of elections (Merrill and Adams 2001; Schofield and Sened 2005, 2006), implies that voters' choice probabilities can be represented via a logit function.10"
"18","We now analyze candidates' policy strategies in two‐stage elections. We consider the following questions: How do office‐seeking candidates balance the conflicting strategic imperatives of appealing to their primary and their general election constituencies? How does holding a competitive primary election affect the party nominee's general election prospects?"
"19","We begin with the case where only one party holds a competitive primary election. This scenario occurs in American elections when a candidate from one of the two parties runs unopposed (or faces only token opposition) in his party's primary—a common situation for incumbent members of Congress. This scenario simplifies the primary candidates' strategic calculations, since they know their general election opponent's identity in advance.11 In the appendix we show that when the candidates D1 and D2 contest the Democratic primary while R1 runs unopposed in the Republican primary, the probability P(D1) =P(D1; d1, d2, r1) that candidate D1 wins both the primary and the general election while D1, D2, and R1 adopt the strategies d1, d2 and r1, respectively—i.e., the probability that D1 wins office—is               "
"20","We now present illustrative examples that convey intuitions about how competitive primary elections influence office‐seeking candidates' policy strategies and also about the circumstances in which political parties benefit from competitive primaries. For these examples we assume a voter distribution on a 1–7 left‐right scale where the median general election voter is located at mG= 4, while the median Democratic primary voter is located at mD= 2 and the median Republican primary voter at mR= 6.12 In our initial examples the candidate R1 runs unopposed in the Republican primary and locates at the position of the median general election voter, i.e., r1=mG= 4, a position that maximizes her probability of winning office.13 For the illustrations we assume that voters have quadratic policy loss functions and that the policy salience coefficient is a= 1, i.e., g(j, xi) =−(j−xi)2, although the equilibrium theory is not limited to this specific case. Finally, we initially assume that the candidates in our examples are “evenly matched” in terms of their precampaign valence images V.            "
"21"," The Democratic candidates' policy strategies when there is a competitive primary. When neither party has a competitive primary, each candidate—by Downsian logic—locates at the position of the overall median voter and each has an equal chance of winning the general election (see Figure 1). We now introduce a second Democratic candidate, D2, who competes with D1 for the party nomination. Intuitively, we expect the strategic imperative of winning the primary to draw the candidates D1 and D2 away from the general median position mG= 4, and, furthermore, that this centrifugal pressure will depress the Democratic Party's chances of winning the general election. In fact, only the former intuition is correct. Figure 2 illustrates the resulting equilibrium configuration in candidates' office‐seeking strategies: the Democratic candidates now pair at the position d*1=d*2= 3.26, i.e., the candidates' equilibrium positions are shaded away from the general median mG= 4 in the direction of the Democratic median mD= 2. Also shown is candidate D1's probability of winning the primary election and his probability P(D1) of winning office (i.e., P(D1) represents D1's probability of winning both the primary and general elections) as a function of his policy strategy, with the candidates D2 and R1 fixed at their equilibrium positions.14 This figure reveals that while D1 maximizes his primary election probability by locating at mD= 2, his optimal office‐seeking position is d*1= 3.26, for which P(D1) is approximately 0.27. Since D2's equilibrium probability P(D2) of winning office is also about 0.27, it follows that the probability that one of these two Democratic candidates wins office is approximately 0.54.15 This exceeds the 0.50 probability that the Democrats win office in the event that D1 runs unopposed in the primary and locates at the general election median mG= 4.            "

Voters were assigned quadratic policy loss functions with the policy salience parameter set to a= 1.                        "
"24","How, in this example, can the competitive primary pull the Democratic candidates away from the center of the general electorate, yet simultaneously increase the probability that a Democratic candidate wins the general election? The central intuition is that having two Democratic candidates contest the primary increases the probability that the Democrats will nominate a high‐quality candidate—i.e., one with high valence attributes. Because the precampaign components of valence are identical for both Democratic candidates (as well as for the Republican candidate), the Democrat who demonstrates higher valence in the primary campaign—by campaigning more skillfully—will be nominated, so that in turn this candidate's overall valence will have a higher expected value than that of the Republican. We label this effect, which we support theoretically below, the competitive primary advantage effect.            "
"25"," Primary elections and the strategic advantage of the weaker party. Next, we examine the situation where the Democratic Party is “weak,” in the sense that the Republican candidate R1's precampaign valence image is superior to those of both Democratic candidates. For this example we specify that candidate R1's precampaign valence advantage is VR1= (VD1+ 2) = (VD2+ 2); substantively, the magnitude of this measured advantage is such that if candidate D1 ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and paired with R1 at the general median position mG= 4, the probability P(D1) that D1 would defeat R1 in the general election would be only about 0.12.            "
"26"," Figure 3 illustrates the resulting equilibrium configuration in candidates' office‐seeking strategies: the Democratic candidates now pair at d*1=d*2= 3.77, i.e., their positions are shaded only slightly away from the median general electorate position mG= 4. In equilibrium the candidates D1 and D2 each have 0.102 probabilities of winning office, so that the probability that one of these Democratic candidates is elected is approximately 0.20. This 0.20 probability of a Democratic victory exceeds the 0.12 probability that the Democrats would win the election in the event that D1 (or D2) ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and located at the center of the general electorate.            "
"27","                 Illustrative Examples of Candidate Strategies in Primary Elections. D1 and D2 Contest the Primary, and VR1= (VD1+2) = (VD2+2)                         "
"28","Why, in this example, do D1 and D2 locate closer to the center of the general electorate than they did in the earlier scenario, in which the Democratic candidates' precampaign valence images were equal to that of the Republican? The logic that motivates the Democrats' policy moderation in this “weaker party” example is that they recognize that the primary election winner will confront a formidable general election opponent, i.e., one who possesses a superior precampaign valence image. Since winning office requires winning both the primary and general elections, the stronger the general election opponent the Democratic candidates expect to face, the less willing they are to present leftist policies that depress their policy appeal to the general electorate. This strategic incentive to moderate benefits the weaker party in that the closer the primary candidates locate to the center, the more competitive the party's nominee will be in the general election. We label this effect, which we support theoretically below, the weaker party's competitive primary advantage."
"29","Next, we consider the situation in which both political parties hold competitive primary elections. In this scenario the candidates' strategic calculations are complicated by uncertainty over the identity of the rival party's nominee. In a web supplement posted at http://course.wilkes.edu/merrill we present closed‐form representations of the candidates' probabilities of winning office in these situations for which each primary involves two candidates. Here, we present a two‐party primary election scenario which illustrates the candidates' strategic calculations and which moreover suggests that “weaker” parties are more likely to benefit from competitive primary elections than are strong parties. For this exercise we analyze the scenario discussed in the previous example, except that we now introduce a second Republican candidate, R2, whose measured valence characteristics VR2 match those of candidate R1. This captures situations in which one party is dominant in the election constituency and both parties hold competitive primary elections.            "
"30"," Figure 4 illustrates the resulting equilibrium configuration in candidates' strategies. Due to the competitive primary election the Republican candidates locate at r*1=r*2= 5.10, i.e., the primary pulls them sharply away from the center of the general electorate, toward the Republican primary median position mR= 6; meanwhile the Democratic candidates' equilibrium positions are relatively moderate at d*1=d*2= 3.66. In equilibrium the Democratic candidates' probabilities of winning office are 0.144 each, and thus the probability that one of these Democratic candidates is elected is approximately 0.29. Note that this 0.29 probability exceeds the 0.20 probability that the Democrats would win the election in the scenario outlined earlier in Figure 3, in which the Republicans did not hold a primary and candidate R1 located at the general election median position. Thus in this two‐primary example the weaker Democratic Party again benefits from holding a primary, while the stronger Republican Party does not.            "
"31","                 Illustrative Examples of Candidate Strategies in Primary Elections. Both Parties Hold Contested Primaries, and VR1=VR2= (VD1+2) = (VD2+2)                            Notes: For these computations the median voter positions were set to mD= 2, mG= 4, and mR= 6. Voters were assigned quadratic policy loss functions with the policy salience parameter set to a= 1.                        "
"32","The strategic logic that drives the stronger party's primary election candidates—in this case the Republicans—far from the center of the general electorate is that they project that the primary is the highest hurdle to winning office, because they recognize that the rival party's candidates possess inferior precampaign valence images. Such noncentrist positioning entails substantial costs in the general election—costs that are likely to outweigh the valence benefit the primary confers by allowing the strong party's primary voters to select the superior campaigner. Thus, as each of the strong party's candidates pursues his or her personal objective of winning, these candidates undermine the likelihood that a member of their party wins office. This is illustrated in Figure 4, where the positioning of the strong Republican Party's candidates is more radical than is that of the weak Democrats.            "
"33","We now demonstrate that the strategic logic suggested by the preceding examples generalizes to a large class of two‐stage elections. We begin by stating and proving an existence and uniqueness theorem for a Nash equilibrium in office‐seeking candidates' policy strategies, for the situation where one party holds a competitive primary election while a single candidate runs unopposed in the rival party's primary. The proof of this theorem, along with those of Theorems 2–4 below, are given in the web supplement (http://course.wilkes.edu/merrill); this web supplement also presents extensions of the theoretical results to scenarios involving multicandidate primaries, i.e., primary elections that feature at least three candidates.16"
"34","                        "
"35"," Theorem 1. If there are two Democratic candidates D1 and D2 and one Republican candidate R1, and if the policy distance component of the voter's utility is concave and peaks at the voter's ideal point,17 then               "
"36","                        "
"37","there exists a Nash equilibrium in candidates' office‐seeking strategies, and"
"38","if VD1=VD2, then there is exactly one paired Nash equilibrium, i.e., for which d*1=d*2.                  "
"39","                        "
"40"," Outline of Proof. We show that P(D1; d1, d2, r1) (for fixed d2 and r1) and P(D2; d1, d2, r1) (for fixed d1 and r1) are strictly quasi‐concave on the (convex and compact) interval [mD, mG] and that they peak in this interval. It then follows from Theorem 5.3 in McCarty and Meirowitz (2007, 108) that there exists a set of party strategies that constitute a Nash equilibrium.               "
"41","The concavity condition of Theorem 1 is satisfied by both the linear and quadratic policy loss metrics. In words, the theorem states that if exactly one of the two parties (here the Democrats) holds a primary, a Nash equilibrium in office‐seeking candidates' strategies exists. The theorem further states that if the two Democratic candidates have equal precampaign valence images, then exactly one paired equilibrium configuration exists.18 This is consistent with the examples presented in Figures 2–3, in which the two Democratic candidates had equal precampaign valence images and their equilibrium positions were identical.         "
"42","Our second theorem relates to the examples on strong and weak parties presented above:"
"43","                        "
"44"," Theorem 2. Suppose there is one Republican candidate R1 and two Democratic candidates D1 and D2, whose equilibrium positions d*1 and d*2 lie strictly between mD and mG. Then a unilateral increase (decrease) in VR1 gives both Democratic candidates incentives to shift unilaterally toward (away from) mG.               "
"45","In words, the theorem states that if exactly one of the two parties (here the Democrats) holds a competitive primary, then when the Republican candidate's precampaign valence image improves, the Democratic candidates have office‐seeking incentives to moderate their policy positions relative to the median general election voter's position (the weaker party's competitive primary advantage effect); and, when the Republican candidate's precampaign valence image deteriorates, the Democratic candidates are motivated to shift to more radical positions. This theoretical result is consistent with the illustrative example presented in Figure 3 above.         "
"46","Finally, we present two additional results that extend Theorems 1–2 to the case where both parties hold primaries. Both theorems concern the special case where the candidates' precampaign valence images are equal within parties but may differ across parties (i.e., where VD1=VD2 and VR1=VR2, but not necessarily VD1=VR1).         "
"47","                        "
"48"," Theorem 3. If both parties hold primaries and if VD1=VD2 and VR1=VR2, there exists a paired equilibrium in candidates' office‐seeking strategies, i.e., one such that d*1=d*2 and r*1=r*2.               "
"49"," Theorem 4. Suppose both parties hold primaries, that VD1=VD2 and VR1=VR2, and that the parties are located at a paired equilibrium configuration, with the equilibrium positions d*1=d*2 located strictly between mD and mG. Then a unilateral increase (decrease) in VR1 and/or VR2 gives both Democratic candidates incentives to shift unilaterally toward (away from) mG.               "
"50","Theorem 3, which proves existence of a paired equilibrium provided that the candidates' preelection valence images are equal within parties, extends Theorem 1 from the one‐primary to the two‐primary scenario. Although we have not proved uniqueness of the equilibrium guaranteed by Theorem 3 for the case in which there are two candidates in each party, our numerical results (see below) suggest that the equilibrium is typically unique. The theorem is illustrated by the example presented earlier in Figure 4, in which both parties' candidates paired with each other in equilibrium. Theorem 4 similarly extends the results in Theorem 2, on weak and strong parties, to the two‐primary scenario.         "
"51"," Tables 1–2 report equilibrium configurations for two‐stage election contests beginning with a primary, for scenarios where one party holds a competitive primary (Table 1) and when both parties hold competitive primaries (Table 2). The tables also report each candidate's equilibrium probability of winning office. For these computations we again set the median positions of the Democratic, Republican, and general electorates at mD= 2, mR= 6, and mG= 4, respectively. The top row of results in Table 1, for instance, reports the equilibrium configuration for the example illustrated earlier in Figure 3, in which only the Democrats hold a primary, the policy salience coefficient is set at a= 1 (see column 1), and the Democratic candidates are “weak” in that VR1=VD1+ 2 =VD2+ 2 (column 2). For this scenario, columns 3–4 report that at equilibrium the Republican candidate R1 locates at r*1= 4.00 while the Democratic candidates pair at d*1=d*2= 3.77, and that the Democratic candidates' equilibrium probabilities of winning office are P*(D1) =P*(D2) = .102. Finally, the RHS column in Table 1 reports whether the Democratic party benefits from holding a competitive primary election: this is based on a comparison of the equilibrium probability that the Democrats win office when they hold a competitive primary, compared to the probability they win office if a single Democrat—running unopposed in his party's primary—located at the median general election position mG= 4. Generally, the Democrats are more likely to benefit from holding a competitive primary if the uncertainty about campaign skill is not too low relative to the salience of policy, i.e., when the policy‐salience parameter a is not too high.            "
"52","We located an equilibrium for every scenario that we investigated, and, consistent with Theorems 1 and 3, these equilibrium configurations invariably find the primary election candidates paired with each other. Second, consistent with Theorems 2 and 4, we compute that as the Republican candidates' precampaign valence images improve relative to Democrats' images, the Democratic candidates' equilibrium positions become more moderate. Finally, consistent with our illustrative arguments, note that in all the scenarios for which the Democrats were specified as the “weak” party, holding a primary election benefits the Democrats."
"53","In our model of two‐stage electoral competition, the strategic trade‐off candidates confront is how to balance the imperatives of appealing to their primary and general election constituencies. And, the strategic question party elites confront is whether the benefits primaries confer by identifying skilled, charismatic campaigners offsets the fact that elites thereby cede control over the candidate selection process to the voters (see Serra 2006a). We believe these trade‐offs are indeed critical considerations for real‐world candidates and party elites. At the same time, our model omits additional strategic factors that other scholars have identified,19 and thus we do not provide a comprehensive accounting of politicians' primary‐related considerations. In particular, we do not claim that our model explains why American parties adopted primaries,20 and so in the context of American politics we see our central contribution as delineating office‐seeking candidates' strategic incentives in two‐stage elections.         "
"54","By contrast, in Latin America primary elections are by no means established as the preferred candidate‐selection mechanism, and there is an ongoing, often heated debate about their effect on candidate viability (see Beer 2003; Carey and Polga‐Hecimovich 2006, n.d.; Colomer 2003; Scarrow 2005; Serra 2006a). We must be cautious in extrapolating our model to these political contexts, because most Latin American countries feature multiparty systems. Nevertheless, some Latin American countries—notably Venezuela, Uruguay, Argentina, and arguably Costa Rica—have featured two dominant parties during periods in the twentieth century ranging from one to several decades, and, furthermore, there are additional countries—notably Mexico21—where subnational political competition frequently revolves around two dominant parties. Our results are plausibly relevant to these scenarios.         "
"55","In this regard, recent empirical studies report findings that suggestively support our theoretical results, particularly those on the weaker party's primary advantage effect. In an analysis of all elections to the Chamber of Deputies in Argentina held during the period 1983–2001—as noted by Serra (2006a)—De Luca, Jones, and Tula (2002) report that opposition parties (defined as parties that did not run the province to which the district belonged) were significantly more likely to hold primaries than were governing parties, a finding that squares with our argument that parties have added incentives to hold primaries when they expect to face a general election opponent who enjoys incumbency‐related advantages. Furthermore, our arguments also plausibly illuminate empirical findings on election outcomes reported by Carey and Polga‐Hecimovich (n.d.). In a study of every democratic presidential election in Latin America from the late 1970s to 2004, Carey and Polga‐Hecimovich conclude that, among candidates from opposition parties, candidates selected via primaries substantially outperformed those selected via alternative procedures: specifically, the authors estimate that, other factors being equal, opposition party candidates selected in primaries achieved a general election “bonus” of nine percentage points in the popular vote relative to the support for other opposition party candidates, a statistically significant effect. These results, again, are consistent with our arguments that parties have added incentives to hold primaries when they expect to face a general election opponent who enjoys incumbency‐related advantages. By contrast, the authors estimate that candidates from the incumbent party who were selected in primaries gained no significant electoral bonus, compared to incumbent‐party candidates selected via alternative methods.22"
"56","Finally, although Carey and Polga‐Hecimovich do not attempt to parse out the reasons why opposition party candidates selected via presidential primaries outperformed their general election opponents, the authors' discussion of the 1988 Argentinean presidential election highlights a case where a primary election identified a high‐quality candidate from an opposition party, who would probably not have been nominated via an alternative selection procedure:"
"57","                        "
"58","Primaries may simply be more effective than elite‐driven search processes in identifying candidates with broad popular appeal … Carlos Menem's emergence in the 1988 Partido Justicialista (PJ) primary in Argentina is an example. As governor of tiny La Rioja Province in Western Argentina, relative unknown Menem faced Buenos Aires governor Antonio Francisco Cafiero in the race for the PJ nomination. Menem's flamboyant and hard‐nosed style of campaigning proved effective. His upset victory over Cafiero attracted wide‐spread media attention to his personal charisma and political canniness, and he went on to win the general election by 15% of the vote. (n.d., 12)               "
"59","This real‐world example exactly mirrors our theoretical arguments about the expected “valence benefit” that primary elections confer, by helping parties identify strong campaigners who will prove attractive to the general electorate."
"60","The weak party's primary advantage result also bears an interesting relationship to remarkable work by Schofield and Sened (2005, 2006), which analyzes the strategic implications of valence issues in multiparty elections—i.e., elections involving three or more parties—without primaries. The authors report theoretical and empirical results that in such elections, valence‐advantaged parties have electoral incentives to locate near the center of the voter distribution, while valence‐disadvantaged parties are motivated to present policies that diverge from the center of the general electorate—a pattern the authors demonstrate captures the patterns of multiparty competition in Israel and various European polities.23 However, our theoretical results demonstrate that in the presence of party‐sponsored primaries, this strategic policy incentive is reversed. And the reason for this surprising distinction is that the intraparty competition we have modeled gives candidates from strong parties particularly compelling strategic incentives to appeal to the center of their primary electorates, at the expense of the general electorate. Thus our results suggest that in party systems that feature significant amounts of intraparty competition, valence dimensions can have fundamentally different implications for policy strategies than they do when political competition is primarily between parties, not within them.         "
"61","Finally, although we have focused here on office‐seeking candidates and parties, our theoretical results are also relevant to policy‐seeking parties, i.e., parties that seek office in order to implement their preferred policies as opposed to proposing policies in single‐minded pursuit of office (see Greene 2007; Groseclose 2001; Londregan and Romer 1993; Wittman 1983). To the extent that our model captures strategic features of real‐world politics, it suggests that by holding primary elections, political parties can have the best of both worlds: namely, primaries create strategic incentives for office‐seeking candidates to present policies that are shaded in the direction of the primary electorate's sincere policy preferences, thus conferring a “policy benefit” to policy‐oriented party members; and, holding a primary may simultaneously enhance the likelihood that the party wins office, an outcome that is valued both by office‐seeking elites (who value holding office per se) and by policy‐seeking elites (who value holding office because it allows the office holder to implement his preelection policy promises).         "
"62","Despite the widespread use of primary elections in the United States and (increasingly) outside the United States, there is little theoretical work on the policy strategies of office‐seeking candidates who confront a two‐stage election. We have developed a spatial model in which candidates compete in a primary followed by a general election, and where moreover the candidates' electoral appeal is based on a combination of their policy positions, their valence‐related reputations with respect to factors such as competence, charisma, and integrity, and the candidates' campaigning skills; these latter abilities may prove critical to electoral success, but the candidates cannot project them with certainty at the time they announce their policy positions."
"63","We have shown that our two‐stage election model supports an equilibrium in office‐seeking candidates' strategies, under quite general conditions. Furthermore, we have presented theoretical results and numerical calculations that suggest a paradoxical conclusion: namely, that although primary elections draw candidates away from the center of the general electorate, political parties can nevertheless benefit from holding primaries. This is because primary elections allow parties to identify high‐quality candidates who will prove to be effective campaigners in the general election. Furthermore, we have shown that “weak” parties have additional incentives to hold primaries, because weak parties' candidates have strategic motivations to locate closer to the center of the general electorate than do strong parties' candidates. Empirical work on Latin American politics by Carey and Polga‐Hecimovich (2006, n.d.), De Luca, Jones, and Tula (2002), Poire (2002), and others supports our theoretical arguments.         "
"64","Our results on the potential electoral benefits of primaries are especially striking given that our theoretical setup appears, at first glance, to entail bleak prospects for parties holding primaries. In our model the candidates cannot moderate their policies between the primary and the general election; primary voters vote myopically for their preferred candidate, without regard to whether he or she will prove competitive in the general election; and, our numerical examples involve scenarios where the primary electorates' policy preferences differ dramatically from those of the general electorate. These assumptions capture considerations that have prompted many prominent scholars to argue that primary elections impose a handicap on a party's pursuit of office: namely, that a radical primary electorate composed of hardcore partisans may shortsightedly select a candidate of limited general electoral appeal (see Colomer 2003; Key 1947; Polsby 1983). Our demonstration, that parties may benefit from holding primaries even in a strategic environment that constitutes a “worst‐case scenario” for primary election candidates, strongly suggests that our conclusions extend to alternative settings that relax the strong assumptions in our model. Other aspects that relate to primaries have been left for later work, such as uncertainty over the distribution of voters' policy preferences; multiple policy dimensions; scenarios where candidates have some leeway to modify their positions between the primary and general elections; scenarios where the candidates intrinsically value winning the primary, because this enhances their reputation and thereby benefits them in future elections; the threat of entry of additional primary candidates (a prospect that constrains the positioning of candidates already in the race); and analysis of the sequential primaries that are used in the American presidential nomination process. In addition, we hope to extend our theoretical results to a more general model that relaxes our assumption of extreme value random utility.         "
"65","The above caveats notwithstanding, we believe we have provided a theoretical rationale for the increasingly widespread use of primary elections throughout the world. We have shown how primary elections can enhance political parties' prospects in the general election, and, furthermore, that weak parties in particular are likely to benefit from holding primaries. Finally, our results suggest that primary elections may enhance parties' abilities to achieve both their office‐seeking and their policy‐seeking objectives: namely, primaries create strategic incentives for office‐seeking candidates to present policies that are shaded in the direction of the party members' sincere policy preferences, and, simultaneously, holding a primary can enhance the likelihood that the party wins office."
