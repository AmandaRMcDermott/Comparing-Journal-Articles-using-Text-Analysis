"1","Returns from Friendship An important problem encountered by voters and consumers alike is obtaining dependable information cheaply (Downs 1957, 207–14). Nelson's succinct characterization of the dilemma facing consumers could easily be extended to voters: “Consumers are continually making choices among products, the consequence of which they are dimly aware” (1970, 311). In such circumstances, consumers often turn to their friends for advice (Nelson 1974). Voters face analogous problems, in the sense that it is often difficult for them to fathom the implications of political issues. In the same way that friends dispense advice with regard to market decisions, friendship networks serve this purpose in politics—namely, providing “cheap,”reliable information about matters that reach beyond voters' awareness, experience, and perhaps, comprehension. The efficiency gains derived from friendship networks can be traced to two economic forces: free riding and bonding.            "
"2","Information about politics is of relatively little interest to most citizens and has to compete with other far more pertinent concerns, such as careers, employment, schooling, and child rearing. Therefore, investments in information are likely to be small, thereby exacerbating the rational ignorance of citizens over a whole range of political issues and questions. This state of affairs can be alleviated somewhat when individuals free ride on the information gathered by others. Taking opinion cues “short‐cuts” the acquisition of information in an area where individuals are generally uninformed and have few incentives to be otherwise. In essence, friendship networks reduce the costs of acquiring information about politics by dispensing opinions, thereby allowing individuals to free ride on the information search and analysis of their friends (Olson 1965).1"
"3","If friends1 were to give specious information and opinions, they would risk straining the existing friendship bond. “Bonds,” in the economic sense, are said to exist when something of value must be forfeited for failure to execute an obligation or responsibility (Ippolito 1990). Since both parties are aware that the information or opinion is bonded to their friendship (or put more bluntly, the strength of their friendship could be on the line), the recipient can be confident of the accuracy and value of the opinion. Opinion givers would not actively disseminate opinions that might jeopardize their friendship. Likewise, because friendship ties could be at risk, friends would likely be careful to avoid cavalier proselytizing. In short, the friendship bond serves as collateral in disseminating gossip. This can enhance the reliability of the advice provided, at least from the perspective of the opinion taker.            "
"4","The Communication of Political Information Everyday communication within friendship networks typically includes some amount of “political gossip.”“Gossip” travels under a variety of names, such as unsolicited advice/opinion, impromptu interpersonal communication, “loose talk,” and the like. The term gossip is used in lieu of these other variants because of its conventional usage in economics to describe the spread of information among consumers in warning others about poor business practices and faulty products (see, for example, Fombrun and Shanley 1990; Shapiro 1983; see also Merry 1997). Information dissemination within friendship circles provides the same type of warning system.            "
"5","For present purposes, the analysis focuses on the flow of information from one friend to another. This allows the effects of communication to be traced systematically, though in principle there is no reason to believe that friends would not inform each other on different issues and events in a reciprocal manner. Gossip is most useful to individuals where facts are uncertain or difficult to unearth; hence, the effects of gossiping should be strongest where there is less awareness of a particular issue, and individuals are therefore more dependent upon their friends for information. These are the social‐communication effects modeled in the experiments."
"6","Elevating the Significance of Issues Politics would seem to be a good place for the practice of gossiping since the political process is complex and issues are normally difficult to fathom. Given this environment of ambiguity and uncertainty, it is important for citizens to know what to worry about in politics and what can safely be ignored. Gossip operates to shape judgments of the significance of issues by stimulating perceptions of risk. We might consider “risk” and “danger” as comprising selection principles (Downs 1957, 211) used by citizens to alert them to matters in the morass of politics that they should be concerned about, rational ignorance notwithstanding. Indeed, one of the recurring themes in the experimental literature on risk assessment and decision making is that potential “losses loom larger than corresponding gains” (Kahneman 2003; Slovic 2000; Tversky and Kahneman 1991, 1039). By tipping off individuals about attendant hazards and menaces associated with political issues, gossiping may serve as a “divining rod” for identifying relevant political concerns. In short, gossip should be most effective in enhancing the relevance of political issues when alerting friends to negative repercussions. Thus, we expect asymmetrical effects to arise from gossip: individuals' judgments of the significance of problems are more receptive to messages conveying harbingers of peril.            "
"7","Issue Saliency and Awareness If gossip is most effective when facts are uncertain or difficult to unearth, then friends who gossip are at a disadvantage in bringing about attitude change when issues are well publicized and highly visible. Salient issues fall into this category since they generate a larger measure of “free information,” accidental data derived as by‐products of the nonpolitical activities of citizens (Downs 1957, 223–25). Once informed, an individual's resistance to persuasive messages mounts, whether the information comes from the mass media, opinion leaders, candidates running for office, or gossiping friends. Issue saliency therefore increases the amount of knowledge available to citizens, thereby reducing reliance upon information supplied by friends. As a result, where political issues are salient, attitude change is more likely to occur among those less informed about the issue. These are precisely the people who are uncertain about the facts involved and would gladly free ride on their friends' opinions rather than gather information themselves; although they are relatively uninformed, the saliency of the issue provides them with just enough awareness to respond to advice from friends.            "
"8","With respect to obscure issues, individuals who are less aware of politics would likely be immune to the effects of gossip. Many issues in government are obscure and by their very nature escape the notice of most citizens. The more remote the issue, the greater the difficulties people face in forming an opinion, or even adopting one intact from their friends. A minimum threshold of issue awareness is necessary simply to establish frames of reference for individuals to grasp the meaning of the messages they are receiving and for any sort of attitude change to transpire (Zaller 1992). Consequently, attitude change pertaining to little‐known political issues is likely to be limited to those who have somehow attained a basic awareness of these quasi‐invisible issues. In sum, if political gossip thrives when facts are difficult to ascertain, it should be an effective source of opinion taking for the uninformed, but only when the saliency of the policy provides some issue visibility, and for the better informed, but only when issue information is difficult to acquire (i.e., when the issue lacks saliency).            "
"9","Summary Gossip flourishes in closely knit, highly connected social networks, like friendship groups (Merry 1997, 52). When uncertainty and ambiguity prevail, gossip supplies information about politicians, events, and issues that heightens the significance (or alarm) associated with them. For both salient (solvency of the Social Security fund) and obscure (health risks of tuna consumption) political issues, gossip should produce changes in opinion that remain intact for several weeks, but only when accompanied by feelings of worry and uneasiness. Gossip that minimizes the significance of a problem is not expected to have any effect, since it fails to give individuals a reason even to care about the issue.            "
"10","The experiments were conducted in the fall semesters of 2004 and 2005. Students in the experiments were enrolled in two political sciences courses in public opinion polling. Students were instructed to select and interview five of their friends about political issues; each student was required to complete five pretest and five posttest interviews as a course requirement. Pre‐ and posttest interviews took no more than 15 minutes to complete. The pretest questionnaires were administered in the fourth week of the semester after all the students received training about conducting in‐person interviews.2 The posttests were conducted six weeks later in person, although a handful of the postsurvey interviews were conducted by telephone, due to difficulty in reaching respondents in a timely manner. The pretests consisted of a questionnaire that asked about various political topics, and included two questions, and a statement, about the specific policy being tested. The first item asked how much the respondent knew about the policy. A brief neutral statement about the thrust of the policy then followed the initial question, and the second item asked the respondent to evaluate the policy.         "
"11","Two issue areas were selected for study to maximize the variation in ambient information available to subjects. At the time of the Social Security experiments, President Bush had been working hard for months to push the issue onto the national policymaking agenda. It would have been nearly impossible for the students interviewed in our surveys to be completely unaware of this controversy. In contrast, it is quite unlikely that study participants would have had much expertise regarding the benefits and risks of tuna consumption. This subject was not prominent in local, state, or national news reports; only the most dedicated followers of current events would have been informed about the health and policy issues surrounding it."
"12","Each interviewer was randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. At the end of the interview, the interviewer‐friend made a positive (treatment 1) or negative (treatment 2) statement about the severity of the problem underlying the political issue, specifically, the extent to which the political issue actually constituted a problem, with some accompanying rationale. The “planted” statements by the interviewer‐friend either minimized the threat the issue posed or implied that the menace was in no way being exaggerated. These statements by the interviewer‐friends are the experimental treatments. Members of the control group did not receive any comment by the interviewer‐friend at the end of the interview."
"13","Approximately six weeks later, friends of the interviewer were reinterviewed, and asked once again about their evaluation of the targeted policy. These posttest interviews were conducted by someone other than the original interviewer, so as not to force compliance in any way with the original interviewer's opinion. The “friends” were randomly assigned to another person in the class for the follow‐up interviews. This step guarantees that respondents would not feel any pressure to conform to the original interviewer's expressed opinion (the treatment)."
"14","The pretest interview contained several questions that were initially used in analyzing the data, along with attitudes toward the political object. These included questions completed by the interviewer about (1) how long he or she had known the friend; (2) how close a friend the person was; (3) how frequently he or she saw the friend; and (4) how frequently the two discussed issues or politics. In addition, the subjects were asked about their major sources of political information and their partisan and ideological beliefs. Admittedly, these are important factors in interpersonal influence of many sorts; however, instituting controls for these variables in the analysis did nothing to alter the observed relationships."
"15","To determine the degree of attitude change, we employed standard regression techniques, the dependent variables being posttest attitude measures. Our two distinct panel survey experiments explored the impact of political gossip on beliefs toward salient and esoteric policy matters. In each case, the dependent variable was the subjects' (i.e., interviewer's friends') impression of the extent to which a political issue constituted a major problem, or the hazard posed was somehow exaggerated. Information about question wording for the survey items, the interviewer response protocols, and the sample sizes for each experimental group is given in the appendix."
"16","In the first wave of each experiment, subjects reported their level of awareness for the issue, based on a simple dichotomous coding (aware/not aware). The proportion of students claiming to be aware of these issues is presented in Table 1, along with descriptive statistics for two additional measures of political attentiveness (frequency of newspaper reading and watching news on television). As anticipated, fewer than three of ten subjects claimed to be aware of the “tuna consumption” issue. At best, these “more aware” individuals would likely be just moderately knowledgeable, and therefore potentially more sensitive to the effects of gossip. Alternatively, three of four students in the Social Security experiments stated that they were aware of the issue, a figure that is hardly surprising given the issue's much greater salience. In all likelihood those claiming to be unaware would have been modestly acquainted with the debate. Those who were more aware would be more resistant to the remarks coming from friends in the first survey interview. In each survey sample, the typical subject tended to read a newspaper and watch news broadcasts between “once a week” and “ several times a week” (M = 2.68 and 2.90 for newspaper reading and 2.10 and 1.88 for broadcasts).         "
"17","As shown in Table 1, the greater awareness of the Social Security issue brought with it higher average levels of concern. In the first wave of the experiment, the mean of 3.46 indicates that participants tended to perceive Social Security as more than a “moderate” but not yet a “major” problem. The much lower mean for the tuna consumption item in the first wave (1.93) implies that respondents tended to see this as only “a little” threat. In the aggregate, the statistics in Table 1 show precious little change in average opinions over the six‐week period. Of course, attitudes may be far more dynamic when explored at the individual level, a subject that is covered in Table 2.         "
"18","The findings presented in this table were calculated by modeling the policy salience measures in the second wave as a function of first‐wave responses plus the experimental treatments, the subjects' level of political awareness (a factor score based on the “awareness” measure, newspaper reading, and tendency to follow the news on television), and, in a second specification, interaction effects.3 In formal terms, this latter model takes the following form in both issue areas:            "
"19","The regression coefficients linking first‐ and second‐wave responses demonstrate a significant degree of continuity in policy judgments, with attitudes toward the Social Security debate being particularly stable. In both samples, the main effects of the “Big Problem”/“No Problem” treatments and self‐described awareness are rather small and statistically insignificant, but when the interaction terms are introduced into the equations, significant effects emerge. In the tuna consumption experiment, subjects who had reported being aware of the issue were more inclined to upgrade their level of risk following the alarming talk from a friend. Given that the interviewer in this second wave was not the friend who had originally planted the gossip, we can rule out social desirability as a cause of this change in attitudes. For the less‐aware group, students who presumably knew little or nothing about any health hazards associated with tuna consumption, gossip had no such effect. Nor did positive gossip significantly change the subjects' beliefs. In keeping with studies on risk assessments, the more alarming comments left much deeper impressions. With respect to the Social Security experiments, the “awareness X big problem” interaction effect is similarly significant; as expected, the negative sign implies that individuals claiming to be less attentive were more responsive to gossip. This issue was undoubtedly far more approachable for subjects than the matter of tuna consumption. As expected, the more attentive subjects showed more resistance to the comments of friends with respect to this issue.4"
"20","In an effort to clarify the complex relationship between negative communication, positive communication, and preexisting political awareness, Table 3 presents the expected values for treatment effects, which largely mirror the coefficients in Table 2, and 95% confidence intervals. Compared to the control group that received no friendly gossip, subjects in the “tuna” experiment who were at the higher end of the “engagement” continuum scored over seven‐tenths of one point higher on average on the attitude scale—a rather large interval given that the full measurement spanned just four units—and the confidence interval around this forecast suggests that the effect of negative information could be much greater. Nearly as striking is the effect in the Social Security experiment for those who had less background knowledge. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that these attitude changes transpired several weeks after the treatments were administered; such long‐term effects testify to the importance of gossip within friendship groups in changing attitudes and instilling a measure of durability to those effects.         "
"21","Our ability to identify opinion changes stemming from communications with friends, and to demonstrate that these effects persist for a considerable period of time, provides ample evidence that friendship networks are a prominent force in opinion formation. Indeed, the experimental intervention was minimal, and in the case of one issue—Social Security—there was so much information and “noise” in the airspace that it is rather striking that any opinion change occurred at all. “Gossip,” as characterized here, was effective in altering opinions on less salient issues—tuna fish consumption—where friends were aware of the issue, and in changing opinions of those less aware on more salient issues—Social Security. In addition, the advice of friends appears to be most influential in alerting individuals to hazards that could potentially, even remotely, affect their lives, rather than soothing their worries. The significant and durable effects arising from opinion taking within friendship circles attest to the relevance of these networks in alleviating a measure of citizen ignorance about politics."
"22","Our analysis also illuminates some of the key causal mechanisms underlying the influence of friendship networks and social communication: bad comments outweigh good ones; and the potential for heterogeneity may be quite large. Huckfeldt and Sprague (1995, 180) suggested that a survey respondent's level of political engagement may moderate the effects of political discussion, but their design prevented them from probing this important issue more deeply. Fortunately, this experimental survey design is not so restricted, and this question can be addressed.5 The experiments suggest that for issues for which there is a modest amount of background information available—not too much, but, then again, not too little—the interpersonal transmission of information, especially alarmist messages, might be a critical determinant of whether topics reach the national agenda for public discussion.
