"1","Theoretically, the likelihood for strategic interaction increases when collaborating actors pursue different interests, have incomplete information, and take decisions over more than one procedural stage. Under these circumstances, actors attempt to anticipate the reactions and decisions of other actors in subsequent stages in order to optimize their own decision in the present stage. Member states have to implement EU directives within their own legal system in a correct and timely manner, before the Commission scrutinizes their lawmaking activities and decides whether or not to enforce compliance by starting infringement proceedings. Because member states are only required to report their activities without indicating whether they have correctly completed the implementation process, the Commission has established an infringement procedure to reduce the information deficit. This consists of: first, a formal letter requesting clarification, and second, the formulation and delivery of a reasoned opinion which includes the legal justification for enforcement actions and also a deadline after which the central monitoring agency may refer the case to the European Court of Justice. The European Court of Justice may then decide on the case and can impose financial sanctions on a noncompliant member state."
"2","Even though this procedure establishes several interdependent implementation and enforcement decisions, the literature has investigated the implementation of directives separately from their enforcement stage. Studies on enforcement conventionally refer to the number of infringement proceedings, which indicate when and to what extent the Commission has reached enforcement decisions against member states. Using the notified lawmaking activities of the member states, implementation scholars investigate when and how member states report their activities to transpose directives into domestic law.7 A good example is the recent analysis of Thomson, Torenvlied, and Arregui (2007), which points to the relationship between the prior negotiation of directives and the subsequent implementation stage by separately evaluating the factors which influence implementation delays and infringement proceedings. Because the decision to implement a directive can also be influenced by the anticipated decision of the Commission to enforce compliance, we integrate the decisions of these two stages into a single model. The model postulates a strategic interaction between the member states and the central monitoring agency, contingent on the potential costs of sanctioning and the probability for enforcement success in the event of a compliance conflict.         "
"3","Following McLean and Whang (2010), we model the strategic interaction between the member states and the agency as a stylized two‐actor game. Figure 1 displays the structure of this game, which starts with a member state's decision whether to correctly implement a directive into domestic law or to defect by late or incorrect implementation (Comp, ∼Comp). If a member state correctly implements the directive within the prescribed time period, there is no potential conflict with the Commission. While the central monitoring agency receives the highest payoff with a value of 1 in this case, the complying member state accepts the directive's outcome, which has been adopted at the prior negotiation stage. Consequently, the member state does not gain additional benefits but avoids any sanctioning costs from the Commission, meaning that its utility losses are set to 0. If the member state decides not to implement the directive in a timely and correct manner, the threat of the central monitoring agency to enforce compliance has failed, and the Commission needs to decide whether or not to take action.         "
"4","This first stage of the game is equivalent to the design of existing studies, which investigate the implementation activities of the member states by the directives’ transposition records (König and Luetgert 2009; Thomson, Torenvlied, and Arregui 2007). Our model further includes a second stage in which the Commission decides whether to begin infringement proceedings against a noncomplying member state by means of a reasoned opinion (RO, ∼RO). If the Commission as the central monitoring agency takes action by filing a reasoned opinion, it decides to litigate a noncomplying member state in order to enforce the goals of a directive. This leads to a compliance conflict between the Commission and the noncomplying member state, in which the member state succeeds with the probability of p and the central monitoring agency with . In this conflict, the Commission's payoff for enforced compliance is  where  is the central monitoring agency's probability of success and  the costs of sanctioning. When the Commission decides to proceed against a member state, the latter can succeed with probability of p, but it may have to bear the sanctioning costs from the Commission . Hence, the noncomplying member state's payoff for enforced compliance is . However, if the Commission decides not to initiate an infringement proceeding, a compliance deficit exists, and the noncomplying member state remains without sanctions. In this case, the noncomplying member state receives additional benefits with the highest payoff having a value of 1 and the Commission's utility losses a value of 0 (no sanctioning costs). Table 1 summarizes the actors’ actions and compliance outcomes.         "
"5","This game, which controls for a selection process by the monitoring central agency, has four actions (Comp, ∼Comp, RO, ∼RO) and three compliance outcomes: (1) compliance by timely and correct implementation of a directive (Compliance), (2) enforced compliance through litigation by the Commission (Enforced Compliance), and (3) compliance deficit by not proceeding against a noncomplying member state (Compliance Deficit). The actions of each member state and of the Commission depend on the evaluation of their probability of enforcement success (p, ) and the sanctioning costs for each type of actor (, ). Hence, we expect only to observe activity by the central monitoring agency when  and , i.e., when the potential costs of sanctions are sufficiently low relative to the expected success of the noncomplying member state in the event of a conflict with the Commission. But when the respective costs are high, we expect that either the member state will comply and implement the directive in light of the high probability for the agency's enforcement success, or the Commission will avoid a conflict with the noncomplying member state.         "
"6","In order to test the empirical implications of this model, we need to gather information on the member states’ implementation and the Commission's enforcement activities, together with measures of our two main explanatory variables, the potential costs of sanctioning (c) and the probability of enforcement success (p). Furthermore, our dependent variables need to distinguish between correct and timely implementation of the goals of a directive: the incorrect or late but subsequently enforced compliance by infringement and the incorrect or late implementation without proceedings.         "
"7","Although member states are formally obliged to implement the commonly adopted policy goals of directives within their own legal system in a correct and timely manner, it remains an empirical challenge to identify the level of compliance in the centralized monitoring system of the EU. A major reason for this difficulty is that member states only have to notify the Commission of their lawmaking activities without indicating whether they have completed the implementation process in a correct and timely manner. Furthermore, the extensive paperwork that member states usually produce when reporting on multiple activities complicates the evaluation of compliance (Hartlapp and Falkner 2009). The notifications of these activities may span over a long time period, are written in different languages, and include various types of legal acts reflecting national lawmaking systems. Hence, the evaluation of compliance with the goals of the directives is like looking for a needle in a growing haystack to which member states constantly add hay by notifying further activities.            "
"8","To evaluate compliance with the goals of the directives, we therefore propose to focus only on the implementation of issues that proved controversial during the negotiations of the policy goals during the EU decision‐making process. This information is available for 37 contested issues in 21 directives included in the dataset of the research project “Decision Making in the European Union” (DEU) (Thomson et al. 2006). The original aim of the DEU project was to compare the explanatory power of different decision‐making theories by a set of contested cases, whereby experts were asked to rate the positions of the member states, Commission, and adopted outcomes on issue‐specific scales ranging from 0 to 100. Using the description of these issues and their adopted outcomes, we ran a computer‐based content analysis, which tagged each sentence in each notified document that includes a reference to the implementation of the adopted outcome of the respective issues. All tagged sentences were then evaluated through cross‐validated legal expertise by asking law school graduate students to fill in a standardized questionnaire.8 The students assessed whether and to what level the content of these tagged sentences correctly implemented the goal of each outcome of the 37 contested issues included in the 21 directives of our sample. Finally, we aggregated the issue‐specific evaluation on the level of each directive. We classified the implementation process as correct if the goals of all issues of a directive were transposed into domestic law or as incorrect if implementation failed for at least one issue.            "
"9","In addition to the evaluation of compliance, we also collected and added the respective enforcement activities by the Commission for our sample of 21 directives. This generates our final dataset, including 299 compliance cases with all implementation and enforcement activities of the actors involved.9 The member states implemented 195 cases correctly and in a timely manner, while they failed to comply in the remaining 104 cases. Among these, the Commission, as the central monitoring agency, filed infringement proceedings against noncomplying member states in 85 cases. Compared to the overall positive evaluation of the effectiveness of this central monitoring system, this dataset provides a more complex picture of compliance with directives.            "
"10","In brief, only two directives were implemented correctly and in a timely manner by all member states. We also found that all member states failed to comply at least three times by either incorrect or delayed implementation. With 12 defections Portugal has the poorest record, failing to comply in 12 cases, followed by Belgium, France, Ireland, and Luxembourg, all with compliance failures for nine directives. In contrast to this group, Denmark and Finland have a much better record, with only three noncompliances. On closer inspection, there is also considerable variation for the Commission's enforcement decisions across the member states."
"11","A typical example concerns the implementation of directive 2001/55/EC, which defines temporary protection for asylum seekers for a mandatory period of two years with a possible extension of one extra year for refugees from armed conflicts. The proposed directive caused considerable controversies during the decision‐making process at the EU level. Some member states, such as Austria and the Netherlands, favored a relatively short period of only 18 months, others preferred much longer periods, and Ireland and Denmark even declared that they would not be bound by the directive's goals nor would they be subject to its application.10 The spread of interests across the member states already indicated potential compliance difficulties. Austria, which strongly disagreed with the directive's adopted goal on temporary protection for asylum seekers, notified timely implementation through the 2002 amendment to its 1997 immigration law (BGBl. 126/2002). However, this incorrectly implemented the directive's goals because it delegated the definition of the period of protection to an Austrian parliamentary committee instead of implementing the mandatory period with a possible extension. In spite of this incorrect implementation, the Commission did not commence infringement proceedings against Austria.            "
"12","For measuring the potential costs of sanctioning (c) and the probability of enforcement success (p), we also use the data from the DEU project on the member states’ and the Commission's issue‐specific preferences, which proved very robust in terms of cross‐validity (König and Proksch 2006; Thomson and Torenvlied 2011). Regarding sanctioning costs (c), we argue that even though member states may support the adoption of a directive when they agree on a compromise solution across the goals of multiple issues, they can still pursue issue‐wise individual interests in the implementation process. We accordingly assume that a member state is more willing to bear the costs of sanctions when its level of disagreement with the goals of a directive is high. In other words, a member state with a high level of disagreement will regard sanctioning costs as sufficiently low relative to the expected gains from a conflict with the central monitoring agency. For the Commission, this perspective suggests that the monitoring central agency is more likely to enforce a directive against a noncomplying member state when its own distance to the directive's goals is small. The gains from its enforcement decision should increase and the costs of sanctions decrease with the Commission's level of agreement.            "
"13","In essence, we suppose a positive relationship between both the level of a member state's disagreement and the central monitoring agency's agreement on the probability of the enforcement outcome. We measure the level of the member state's disagreement by the preference distance between its most preferred policy goals and those finally adopted in a directive. For the Commission's agreement, we subtract its absolute distance from 100 in order to express the agency's benefit. Because several directives contain more than one issue‐specific policy goal, we calculate the directive‐specific level of (dis)agreement as the sum of the issue‐specific (dis)agreement levels (Thomson 2007; Thomson, Torenvlied, and Arregui 2007; Zhelyazkova and Torenvlied 2009). We coded the few missing values on the level of disagreement for a member state as zero and the Commission's agreement as 100, expressing their indifference with the outcomes. We further consider the saliencies that both types of actors attach to a directive. We assume that the relative costs of sanctioning decrease with their saliency and therefore expect a negative relationship between member states’ and the Commission's saliency and the probability of enforcement.11"
"14","Regarding the probability of success (p) in the enforcement stage, we follow Carrubba, Gabel, and Hankla (2008) and argue that the European Court of Justice is constrained by the defendant member state's response to a ruling since member states have the possibility to circumvent undesirable rulings through noncompliance (Garrett, Kelemen, and Schulz 1998). The credibility of such a noncompliance threat, however, depends on pressures against the violating member state from other member states and/or from their own domestic audiences. Compared to voters, interest groups have more resources to generate information on the implementation process and to exert pressure on their own member state by bringing a case to court (Dai 2005). If the European Court of Justice values compliance with its ruling, the likelihood of a ruling against a violating member state and the enforcement success of the central monitoring agency should increase with the likelihood of third‐party intervention (i.e., either by other member states and/or by domestic interest groups). When almost all member states pursue the same interests in a directive, we expect that the likelihood for an overwhelming enforcement coalition against a single violating member state will increase. This should also increase the likelihood of a court ruling against a noncomplying member state and thus promote the (expected) success of the central monitoring agency.12 Conversely, we expect that the size of the enforcement coalition and the likelihood of a favorable ruling decrease when the interests of the member states differ or are in opposition to one another.13"
"15","In addition to other member states, domestic actors such as interest groups can bring a case to court, which will be determined by the distribution of the groups’ interests too. To measure this distribution, we use Lijphart's index of interest group pluralism, with high values indicating countries with diverse and pluralistic interest group patterns (Lijphart 1999). Corporatist interest group patterns with low values indicate high intragovernmental collaboration and coordination with interest groups in a member state. This suggests that a member state's decision to comply with a directive is more likely to already reflect the interest groups’ preferences in a corporatist system. Even if an interest group is against this decision in a corporatist system, it is more likely to refrain from bringing a case to court in view of the group's risk for exclusion from future intragovernmental collaboration and coordination. In a pluralistic system with diverse and competing interest groups, it is therefore more likely that an interest group protests against the compliance decision of a member state and even brings a case to court. Thus, we expect that a pluralistic interest group pattern positively influences the Commission's enforcement utilities, while it should reduce the enforcement utilities of the member states.            "
"16","In addition to these variables, which specify the two main terms of our strategic game, we include three control variables. Regarding the member states’ enforcement utility, we control for the number of controversial issues contained in each directive. This controls for possible compensation, which is more likely for cases with multiple issues. In situations with two or more issues, the utility loss of a member state on one issue may be compensated for by a gain on another issue. We expect that the compensation likelihood increases with the number of issues and therefore positively influences the compliance utility of a member state. We also use a dummy variable in the Commission's enforcement utility when the directive contains an issue concerned with the deadline for implementation. Since noncompliance cases of late implementation are much easier to detect than cases of incorrect implementation, we assume that an explicit reference to the deadline increases the enforcement utility of the Commission (Börzel 2001). Furthermore, we also expect that the type of directive affects compliance. Directives that are adopted by the Council and the European Parliament have a higher likelihood for compromise than those that are decided by the Council alone (Ciavarini Azzi 2000; Mastenbroek 2003). Thus, this type of directive should increase a member state's utility for enforcement, while with a broader legitimization of directives, the Commission's enforcement utility increases.            "
"17","For the outcome of compliance by correct and timely implementation in our strategic game, we fix the utilities of the member states at 0 and of the Commission at 1, in accordance with our theoretical discussion. Hence, we expect that only directive‐specific and state characteristics matter for this outcome (cf. Falkner et al. 2005; Mastenbroek 2003). In our strategic game, however, directive‐specific characteristics such as complexity can affect the two types of actors in different ways: the central monitoring agency may have more difficulties to scrutinize complex directives, while a member state may have more leeway for interpretation. Furthermore, Franchino (2004) reports that directives typically delegate more power to member states in those areas where implementation uncertainty is high (see also Epstein and O'Halloran 1999). Thus, the level of the delegated authority should be associated with a higher risk of noncompliance (Thomson, Torenvlied, and Arregui 2007; Zhelyazkova and Torenvlied 2009). For scholars from the management school of thought, member states with high administrative capacity face lower implementation constraints (Falkner et al. 2005; Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2006; Mbaye 2001; Pridham 1994; Thomson, Torenvlied, and Arregui 2007). Because they have more administrative resources for coping with the implementation requirements, the likelihood for noncompliance is lower. Table 2 provides a detailed summary of our main explanatory and control variables with some explorative statistics.            "
"18","The game‐theoretical model assigns probabilities to the three outcomes (compliance, enforced compliance, and compliance deficit) that result from the two types of actors’ expectations for the costs and benefits of their interdependent strategic decisions in the implementation process. To evaluate the empirical implications of their strategic interaction, we follow Signorino (1999, 2003) and apply a structural estimation model based on the probabilities of the compliance game (for specification of payoffs and utilities, please see the appendix). The equilibrium probabilities represent the strategic interaction with uncertainties between member states and monitoring Commission in the extended form game depicted in Figure 2.            "
"19","From the structure of the game, which assumes utility‐maximizing behavior of the two types of actors and independence between outcome probabilities, we can predict the equilibrium choices of an actor where the probability for each outcome is directly determined by the action probabilities along the game path. Thus, the probabilities are defined as:               "
"20","Figure 3 illustrates the general specification of the actor's utilities in terms of regressors, i.e., their utilities with our explanatory variables. We estimate a member state's utility for compliance as a linear function , where β11 is a vector of coefficients to be estimated. The observed utility of the member states for a conflict with the monitoring Commission  is estimated as a linear function  and the observed utility of a member state for the central monitoring agency's inaction  as a constant β14. The Commission's utility for nonenforcement is normalized to zero, and its utility for enforced compliance is defined as a linear function  of explanatory variables. Following Signorino and Tarar (2006), we use the equilibrium‐outcome probabilities of , , and  as a basis for the maximum‐likelihood estimation. The log‐likelihood to be maximized with explanatory variables (β) is defined as:               "
"21","We test the empirical implications of our theoretical expectations on the outcomes that we derived from the strategic game between the monitoring Commission and the member states. In order to provide a unified analysis of compliance with directives and to capture strategic interaction, we adopt the strategic estimation approach of Signorino (1999, 2003). In spite of a skewed distribution of outcomes with about 65% compliance, 29% enforced compliance, and 6% compliance‐deficit cases, our strategic model has a relatively high fit with over 71% correctly predicted outcomes. On closer inspection, we correctly predict more than 86% of the 195 compliance cases, while we overestimate their correct and timely implementation behavior vis‐à‐vis enforced compliance (48% correctly predicted) and compliance deficit (21% correctly predicted).14 A reasonable explanation for our lower predictive power of the compliance deficit, which results from the decision of the central monitoring agency to refrain from litigation, is that the Commission is less able to detect incorrect implementation than we were with our data‐generation strategy. For the enforcement decision, however, the effective response of the central monitoring agency to delayed implementation is underestimated by the noncomplying member states (for a similar finding, see Rosendorff 2005). Table 3 reports the estimates of the four utility functions as specified in Figure 3. These coefficients are simultaneously estimated as part of a unified model of strategic interaction between the member states and the Commission.15"
"22","According to the estimates of our strategic model, we find that the member states’ implementation decisions are mainly influenced by (dis)agreement and directive‐specific features such as complexity, delegation ratio, level of discretion, and type of directive. We also find that the diversity of member states’ interests, the Commission's saliency, and the influence of domestic interest groups significantly affect the enforcement decision of the central monitoring agency. Our estimates of the member states’ compliance utility confirm existing findings. Member states are more likely to defect when they disagree with a directive. The results further reveal that the member states’ utilities are higher for Council and EP directives than for directives decided solely by the Council. Furthermore, a member state's utility for conflict with the Commission significantly decreases with the number of controversial issues included. All other variables, such as the diversity of the member states’ preferences and saliency for the directive, have no statistically significant effect on the member states’ compliance utility."
"23","The results of our analysis reveal that the central monitoring agency acts strategically in the compliance game. Confirming our expectation, the Commission's decision to litigate a noncomplying member state is also significantly influenced by the probability of success and the associated costs of sanctioning. In the event of preference diversity among the member states and a corporatist interest group pattern in the noncomplying member state, the Commission has difficulty finding enough support for successful enforcement. This decreases the central monitoring agency's enforcement utility and hence decreases the probability of filing a reasoned opinion to a noncomplying member state. Likewise, the Commission is only willing to bear the costs of sanctioning when its saliency for the respective directive is high."
"24","The compliance utility of the member states is significantly affected by two directive‐specific factors: (1) the complexity of the directive and (2) the delegation ratio of implementation authority of the directive. This utility decreases with complexity and level‐of‐delegation ratio. Hence, member states are less likely to comply with very long and complex directives, which involve substantial implementation duties within their own legal system and government. However, the results suggest that the efficiency level of their administration has no significant effect on their decision. At first sight, this appears to contradict the management school of thought, but the coefficient indicates that the compliance utility of the member states still increases with the efficiency of their administration.16"
"25","For a more substantial interpretation of our findings, we take a closer look at the marginal effects of our independent variables, i.e., the change in the estimated probabilities of the outcomes with the change in the values of the explanatory variables. According to our findings, the member states’ decision to comply with directives not only depends on their own compliance utility but also on the Commission's utility to enforce compliance. Member states comply if and only if their true expected utility for noncompliance is greater than their true expected utility for compliance, which means that . It is important to note that this is a function of the explanatory variables in the Commission's enforcement utility because these variables affect not only the Commission's decision but also indirectly the compliance decision of the member states. Compared to the variables that only reflect the central monitoring agency's utility, and therefore only have an indirect effect on the member states’ decisions, the variables that enter in both the member states and Commission's utilities have a direct and an indirect effect.         "
"26","For the substantial interpretation of our main theoretical arguments, we plot the probability of enforced compliance and compliance deficit as a function of the diversity of member states’ preferences, their disagreement, and the level of the Commission's saliency, while holding the other independent variables fixed at their low (dashed lines), mean (solid lines), and moderate (dotted lines) values."
"27","Figure 4a displays the effect of the diversity of member states’ preferences on the probability of enforced compliance, where an increase in diversity is associated with a decrease in the utility of the Commission, making it less likely to enforce compliance, and with an increase in the member state's utility for enforced compliance, making it them more likely not to comply and to risk an enforcement decision by the central monitoring agency. Accordingly, the diversity of interests has a nonmonotonic effect on the probability of enforced compliance. Considering the moderate scenario (dotted line), an increase in the diversity of member states’ preferences only for average to high values leads to a decrease in the probability of enforced compliance. In other words, in cases of a homogeneous preference constellation, where a large group of member states supports a directive, the noncompliance of only a few member states with the adopted policy goals increases the likelihood of enforced compliance. In such cases, the Commission still perceives itself as having considerable support for its enforcement decision among the other member states and will not hesitate to take action. However, the more member states do not comply with common policy goals, the less support will the Commission find for its enforcement decision, so that the likelihood of enforced compliance decreases.         "
"28","In contrast to Figure 4a, Figure 4b shows a strict monotonic relationship between the diversity of member states’ preferences and the probability of a compliance deficit. Here, an increase in the diversity is always associated with an increase in the probability of a deficit. This is to be expected because an increase in diversity always favors the likelihood for noncompliance and always decreases the chance of strict enforcement by the Commission, even in cases where noncomplying behavior is detected. However, the point at which this effect becomes visible mainly depends on the values at which the other variables are held constant. This effect is largest when we hold all other values at their moderate value (dotted lines), while an increase in the probability of a compliance deficit is visible earlier for the low‐value line (dashed line), followed by the mean‐value line (solid line), and the moderate line (dashed line).17"
"29","Figures 4c and 4d show the relationship between a member state's disagreement and the probability of enforced compliance and compliance deficit. Here, an increase in the level of disagreement is always associated with an increase in the probability of enforced compliance or compliance deficit. According to Figure 4d, however, the level of disagreement has only a weak effect on the probability of compliance deficit for low and mean values of the other variables, while it is absent for moderate values. This confirms the results of other studies which have pointed to the negative effect of a member state's disagreement for compliance (Falkner, Hartlapp, and Treib 2004; Thomson, Torenvlied, and Arregui 2007; Zhelyazkova and Torenvlied 2009).         "
"30","Finally, we consider the combined effect of our two main explanatory variables, i.e., the probability of conflict success, operationalized by the diversity of member states’ interests, and the costs of sanctioning, operationalized by disagreement of the member states. Figure 5 plots the probability of enforcement as a function of these two variables while holding the other variables at their mean value. It is clear that the likelihood of an enforced compliance increases substantially with a member state's disagreement and its willingness to bear the costs of an enforcement conflict with the Commission. This effect, however, is only relevant in cases where the probability of successful enforcement by the Commission is high, i.e., when the diversity of member states’ interests is low. When the central monitoring agency faces member states with diverse interests, the probability of enforced compliance is low regardless of the member states’ incentive for compliance.         "
"31","How does the strategic interaction between a central monitoring agency and implementing actors affect compliance? Do low‐level implementing actors consider and anticipate the decisions of the central monitoring agency to act against noncompliance? And is the central monitoring agency responsive to the chances of enforcement success and sanctioning costs by noncomplying actors? This study attempted to answer these questions by introducing a unified theory and test of the compliance game between a central monitoring agency and implementing actors. Using the centralized monitoring system of the EU as an example, we evaluated the empirical implications of our model, which considers the Commission as the central monitoring agency that decides about starting proceedings against noncomplying member states. Our strategic analysis reveals that the compliance outcome significantly depends on the probability of enforcement success and the potential sanctioning costs. We show that the Commission refrains from enforcement against a noncomplying member state in situations where the probability of success is low and/or the potential sanctioning costs are very high."
"32","Although the central monitoring system of the EU offers some discretion for implementing the goals of directives, ranging from using country‐specific legal acts to exempting some member states from implementing a directive within its own legal system, we believe that our analysis characterizes a mechanism with the probability of enforcement success and the potential sanctioning costs that also exists in other multilevel systems, such as the strictly mandatory U.S. implementation of federal law or the voluntary implementation of international agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol. A typical example is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is responsible for scrutinizing implementation and enforcing compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Compared to the Commission, the EPA gathers data through on‐site visits by qualified inspectors and also reviews information which has to be submitted. However, when the probability of enforcement success is low, e.g., due to large and powerful support of a defendant in U.S. Congress, or if the potential sanctioning costs are very high, e.g., due to long court procedures, our model will also predict a compliance deficit. Similarly, our model suggests that the compliance committee of the Kyoto Protocol considers enforcement success with respect to coalition size of supporters and the potential sanctioning costs of the defendant, e.g., for exiting from the protocol."
"33","Our identification of a compliance deficit by a strategic analysis of the compliance game between the central monitoring agency and the decentralized implementing actors might also explain a well‐known puzzle in compliance research, according to which the central monitoring agency is almost always successful when it brings a noncomplying member state to court—independent of the power relationship between the two types of actors. Because the central monitoring agency knows the distribution of the power and preferences of the member states, it can easily anticipate the probability of enforcement success and the potential sanctioning costs. We have shown that the central monitoring agency is prevented from taking action from taking action in less favorable situations where the enforcement success is low respectively and sanctioning costs are very high. This means that official compliance statistics may only provide a partial picture of the effectiveness of a central monitoring agency when these statistics ignore the level of compliance deficit resulting from the unwillingness or inability of the central monitoring agency to enforce compliance in less favorable situations."
"34","We found that the central monitoring agency pre‐selects noncompliance cases to take to court, which suggests a “conditionality” of the compliance‐enhancing role of courts in those systems. According to the literature, courts can facilitate compliance with the adopted policy goals at the federal and international level because they act as a fire alarm by providing a venue where the actors can bring cases and signal possible violations (Carrubba 2005, 2009; Staton 2006; Vanberg 2004). However, courts cannot enforce compliance without a litigator, who needs to generate information on the compliance behavior of the collaborating actors. Since enforcement success may not only depend on the compliance behavior of one but of all collaborating actors, acquiring information to enforce compliance is costly in multilevel systems. Our findings show that a central monitoring agency cannot detect or is unwilling to do so and act in all cases of noncompliance. Whether each collaborating actor in horizontal monitoring systems or the voters, interest groups, or other domestic audiences in the monitoring system from below are able to bear these costs and can thus provide for a higher level of compliance by bringing more cases to court remains a topic for future research.
