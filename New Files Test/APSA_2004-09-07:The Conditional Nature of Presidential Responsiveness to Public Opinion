"1","The data focus on presidents' proposals and public opinion for a set of eleven budgetary issues on which annual legislative negotiations occurred during calendar years 1972–1999. In particular, we have annual observations on the president's proposed budgetary authority and the previous year's enacted budgetary authority for each issue.4 Also for each issue, the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) and Roper Organization regularly conducted surveys that asked respondents the following question: “We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I'm going to name some of the problems, and for each one I'd like you to tell me whether you think we're spending too much money, too little money, or about the right amount on [the particular problem].” The data thus include observations on the relationship between presidential proposals and citizens' policy preferences regarding a set of individual issues across time. The specific issues include crime, defense, education, the environment, foreign aid, ground transportation, health, the national park service, social security, space, and welfare.5"
"2","These data have several advantages. First, previous work suggests that the survey responses indeed reflect citizens' dispositions about the issues. Wlezien (1995) demonstrates that the responses vary predictably with external events, while Jacoby (1994) finds that citizens evaluate the various programs differently. A second benefit derives from the fact that the president must annually submit a budget to Congress and thus must publicly state his policy positions. On roll‐call votes, and other types of policy decisions, in contrast, the president has the option of not taking a public position. Because a president has an incentive to avoid revealing his position when it likely to be unpopular (Covington 1987), data on noncompulsory positions may be inclined toward a finding of responsiveness. Our data lack any such bias.         "
"3","A third asset is that these data encompass many of the significant policy matters of the past thirty years. For example, military spending, the protection of the environment, health care, and welfare are all included. Finally, the panel format facilitates comparisons within and across policy issues as a function of political conditions such as the president's popularity and the imminence of the next election."
"4","The key variable in the analysis is Policy Congruence, which is a function of the relationship between the survey data and the president's proposed budgetary authority for a given issue and year.6 The variable is coded dichotomously. It equals one, representing policy congruence, when the president proposes an increase in budgetary authority from the previous year and more respondents prefer an increase than prefer a decrease in spending. Similarly, the variable equals one when the president proposes a decrease and more respondents prefer a decrease than prefer an increase. In all other circumstances, the variable equals zero. Table A3 presents the values of this variable by issue and year.         "
"5","Because neither Roper nor the National Opinion Research Center conducted the recurring survey for every issue in every year, we lack observations of policy congruence for some budgetary observations. For instance, until 1984 respondents were not asked their views about spending on social security, and in 1995 neither organization conducted the survey. In total there are 235 observations, 160 for first‐term presidents and 75 for second‐term ones."
"6","These 235 observations contain substantial variation in whether the president and mass opinion favored higher spending. Notably, it is the not the case that mass opinion invariably favored more funding; for 85 of the cases, which constitutes over one‐third of the data, the public desired less funding. The president supported this position in 28% of these cases. Among the remaining 150 cases, for which the public favored higher spending, the president supported the public's position 63% of the time."
"7","The data also vary considerably by policy issue. Table 1 summarizes this variation, describing by issue the percentage of observations for which policy congruence equals one. The table shows that the overall level of congruence, 51%, masks substantial variation across the domains. For three of the issues—crime, health, and social security—the percentage of congruent observations is greater than 90%. Meanwhile, less than 20% of the observations on parks and space are ones in which the president's proposal corresponds to mass opinion. Policy congruence is relatively rare on foreign policy issues; for defense spending and foreign aid congruence occurs for only 32% of the observations.         "
"8","This variation suggests that presidents are more likely to take popular positions on the issues that voters are likely to encounter in their daily lives. On these matters, which Zaller and Feldman (1992) label “doorstep” issues, citizens are likely to be well informed and have stable preferences (e.g., Canes‐Wrone and de Marchi 2002; Iyengar 1989; Zaller and Feldman 1992). In comparison, on those matters on which citizens are less likely to be informed or have stable preferences, like foreign policy, presidents are much more willing to be out of step with public opinion.         "
"9","It is also worth noting that many of the 11 policy issues are ones that Jacoby (1994) suggests do not correspond to the standard liberal‐conservative ideological spectrum. Specifically, Jacoby finds that dispositions about spending on defense, crime, and science are often inconsistent with beliefs about the overall size of government, whereas dispositions about social welfare spending tend to be strongly consistent with these beliefs. In keeping with this distinction, Table 1 presents the level of congruence for the social welfare issues of health and welfare. Following Jacoby, the observations are labeled “ideological observations.” The table shows that congruence is relatively high for these cases; specifically, congruence occurs for 71% of them. Thus although the overall level of responsiveness in the data is low, the level of responsiveness is substantially higher on the issues that are most compatible with the traditional liberal‐conservative continuum. This finding reconciles the basic patterns with Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson (2002a, 2002b), since it is ideological issues that these authors examine when they find that presidents are highly responsive to public opinion.         "
"10","Turning now to another type of variation, Table 2 examines how policy congruence has differed by president. The table presents the rates of congruence for the full set of observations as well as for the ideological ones. Perhaps the most striking result is that although there is no clear time trend in overall responsiveness, there is a clear decrease in responsiveness for the ideological observations. In particular, presidents since the Ford administration have become less likely to endorse popular social welfare policies. The rate of congruence on these issues was 100% for Ford, 71% for Carter, 88% for Reagan, 63% for G.H.W. Bush, and 50% for Clinton. Thus although presidential responsiveness on ideological issues has traditionally been quite high, it has declined substantially in recent administrations. This trend is consistent Jacobs and Shapiro (2000, 2002), who argue that responsiveness has declined since the 1970s.         "
"11","The full set of observations does not exhibit such a trend, although the rate of congruence does vary by president. Nixon and Reagan are the least likely to take popular positions, and Carter the most likely. As discussed in the introductory section, some research suggests that this variation may be a function of whether the presidents served a second term (and thus did not face reelection for at least some of their time in office) as well as their public approval ratings. The following sections examine the impact of such factors, controlling for the effects of the individual issues and presidents as well as a variety of other potential determinants of executive policy decisions."
"12","Various studies suggest that the electoral cycle and presidential popularity influence the likelihood that a president responds to public opinion. In terms of the first factor, most research indicates that responsiveness is more likely the sooner the president is running for reelection. For instance, Canes‐Wrone, Herron, and Shotts (2001) and Zaller (2003) reach this conclusion via the argument that voters care more about policy outcomes than initial policy choices once the outcomes become known. Since voters are unlikely to observe the outcome of a policy choice made shortly before an election, the president is more likely to cater to current opinion as the next election approaches. Jacobs and Shapiro (2000, 2002) predict the same pattern via different lines of argument. They contend that as an election becomes imminent, a president has less opportunity to change voters' positions. Furthermore, Jacobs and Shapiro note that voters are most likely to hold politicians accountable for the political actions taken immediately before an election.         "
"13","The prediction of a positive correlation between responsiveness and electoral proximity is also shared by work on legislators' voting patterns (e.g., Elling 1982; Kuklinski 1978; Thomas 1985; Wright and Berkman 1986). Indeed, so much support for the hypothesized relationship exists that it may hardly seem worth testing. Yet the only study that actually tests this prediction on presidential policy decisions suggests that it is not correct. In particular, Cohen (1997) finds that presidential responsiveness does not vary over the course of the electoral cycle. We therefore analyze the following hypothesis.         "
"14"," Policy congruence between presidential positions and public opinion is more likely the sooner is the next election.             "
"15","The basic patterns in the data are quite consistent with this hypothesis. In the initial two years of a president's term, the rate of policy congruence is 45%, whereas in the last half of a term the rate of congruence is 57%. In fact, the rate of congruence is even higher, 66%, in the final year of the term. However, it remains possible that the Electoral Proximity Hypothesis will not hold when controlling for other factors that may affect responsiveness."
"16","The second key explanatory variable, presidential popularity, offers an opportunity to distinguish between competing theoretical perspectives. Some work predicts a null impact of the factor on the likelihood of responsiveness. For instance, Cohen (1997) finds that presidential popularity has no effect on policy congruence between presidents' statements in State of the Union addresses and mass opinion. Likewise, in research on the Senate, Elling (1982) shows that a senator's voting is not related to the likelihood that the electorate supports her for reelection.            "
"17","Other work suggests that a president's responsiveness to public opinion will be negatively correlated with his popularity. For instance, Manza and Cook (2002) cite the fiscal analysis of Hicks (1984) and macroeconomic analysis of Hibbs (1987) to advance the hypothesis that responsiveness becomes more likely as a president's approval ratings decrease. This hypothesis is also consistent with research that argues presidents will attempt to capitalize on high public approval by pursuing more aggressive policy agendas (e.g., Brace and Hinckley 1992; Rivers and Rose 1985).7 Following this logic, a very popular president may feel that he has the latitude to take unpopular positions while a president with low popularity, in contrast, may feel he needs to pursue policies that are congruent with public opinion in order to boost his chances of reelection.8 We accordingly examine the following hypothesis, which Figure 1 depicts.            "
"18","                 Monotonic Popularity Hypothesis                         "
"19"," The likelihood of the president choosing a popular policy decreases as the president's approval increases.             "
"20","The final hypothesis concerns the Canes‐Wrone, Herron, and Shotts (2001, hereafter CHS) prediction about presidential popularity, which is more complicated than the Monotonic Popularity Hypothesis. The relationship predicted by CHS differs in two major ways. 9 First, whereas the Monotonic Popularity Hypothesis suggests that the relationship between popularity and policy congruence is the same throughout a president's term, CHS hypothesize that the president's popularity only affects his responsiveness to public opinion as the next election draws near. Second, CHS predict a nonmonotonic relationship in which the likelihood of congruence is highest when the president's public standing is average.            "
"21","                              "
"22","                   When the next election is distant, the likelihood that the president chooses a popular policy is unrelated to his public approval.                      "
"23","                   When the next election is soon and the president's popularity is below average, the likelihood of the president choosing a popular policy increases as the president's approval increases.                      "
"24","                   When the next election is soon and the president's popularity is above average, the likelihood of the president choosing a popular policy decreases as the president's approval increases.                      "
"25","This hypothesis derives from variation in the president's incentives to follow public opinion when he believes voters misperceive how their interests will be affected by the policy choice. In the CHS theory, a president with policy expertise must choose a policy that is either in step with public opinion or out of step with it.10 If the president believes that a popular policy is likely to harm citizens' interests, then he sometimes “panders” to public opinion by supporting this policy but at other times goes against public opinion by exercising “policy leadership.” If instead the president believes that a popular policy is in citizens' interests, then he always chooses that policy. The conditions that explain variation in pandering are thus sufficient to characterize variation in policy congruence.            "
"26","Part (i) of the CHS Popularity Hypothesis stems from the fact that when the next election is distant, voters are likely to learn whether a policy choice produced a good outcome before they cast their ballots. Consequently, regardless of the president's popularity, he has an incentive to pursue the policy option he believes is in the public interest. The dashed line in Figure 2 displays the CHS prediction that early in a president's term policy congruence is unaffected by his popular approval.            "
"27","                 CHS Popularity Hypothesis                         "
"28","When the next election is soon, one might think that the president always has an electoral incentive to take the action favored by voters. However, in the CHS theory, if the president's public standing is sufficiently high the only way he can lose is by pursuing a policy that produces a bad outcome. Choosing an unpopular policy hurts his popularity a bit, but not enough to cost him the election. Therefore, he will choose the option he believes is likely to produce a good outcome, even if voters prefer a different policy. Likewise, if his public standing is sufficiently low, the only way he can win reelection is by achieving a major policy success. He therefore has an electoral incentive to choose the policy he believes is correct, even if it is unpopular."
"29","When the president's public standing is neither high nor low, he may enact the policy that voters want even if he believes it is not in their interests. Given that the election is soon, voters are unlikely to observe the policy's success or failure before they cast their ballots. By choosing the policy that voters prefer, the president can give himself a small boost in the polls and thereby increase his chances of winning."
"30","We thus expect the president to become more likely to pursue a popular policy when his approval ratings increase from low to average levels, but less likely when his approval ratings increase from average to high levels. The solid line in Figure 2 displays the nonmonotonic pattern predicted by the CHS theory when the next election is soon, i.e., late in a president's term.            "
"31","Two specifications are employed to analyze the various hypotheses. The first tests the CHS Popularity and Electoral Proximity predictions, and the second tests the Monotonic Popularity and Electoral Proximity predictions. Because many of the motivations for the hypotheses pertain to presidents' electoral incentives, we focus on the behavior of first‐term presidents. After presenting these results, we discuss how the findings differ for second‐term presidents."
"32","The CHS Popularity Hypothesis predicts a nonmonotonic relationship between a reelection‐seeking president's popularity and the likelihood of congruence between his proposals and public opinion. An important component of this nonmonotonicity is whether the president's popularity is above or below average. Thus analyzing the hypothesis requires an empirical specification that allows for the possibility that the relationship between popularity and policy congruence depends upon the initial level of popularity. However, the specification should not force the estimated relationship to depend upon this factor."
"33","In addition, because the CHS Popularity Hypothesis predicts that the relationship between policy congruence and popularity depends on the temporal proximity of the next election, the specification must make it possible to estimate this relationship separately according to whether the next election will occur soon. To operationalize the definition of “soon” we use the two halves of a president's term. This classification follows the literature on the U.S. Senate, which shows that senators modify their roll‐call voting toward their constituency in the final two years in office.11 The same separation of the term is employed to analyze the Electoral Proximity Hypothesis, which suggests that policy congruence will be more likely in general when the president soon faces a race for reelection.         "
"34","The following specification incorporates these features and controls for the effects of the individual policy issues, individual presidents, and several other factors. In the equation, the abbreviation Pop represents the president's popularity, Mean Pop is the mean of popularity across all observations, and Above Avg Pop is an indicator for whether the president's popularity is above this mean:            "
"35","The coefficient β1 addresses the Electoral Proximity Hypothesis by capturing the variation in the mean levels of policy congruence between the first and second halves of the president's term. The relevant parameters for the CHS Popularity Hypothesis are β2, β3, β4, and β5. The coefficient β2 estimates the impact of an increase in presidential popularity when the initial level is below the mean and the president is in the second half of the term. The difference (Pop − Mean Pop) captures the increase in presidential popularity relative to the mean, and the dummy variable (1 −Above Avg Pop) indicates that the initial level is below the mean. Similarly, β3 estimates the impact of an increase in presidential popularity when the initial level is above the mean during the second half of the term, β4 estimates the impact of an increase when the initial level is below the mean during the first half of the term, and β5 estimates the impact of an increase when the initial level is above the mean during the first half.         "
"36","A set of control variables (President's Ideological Congruence, Congress' Ideological Congruence, and Public Concern) is also separated by the half of the term. From a theoretical standpoint, it is reasonable to expect, for example, that the effect of presidents' preferences and public concern may change over the course of a president's term. Specification analysis confirms this expectation.12 The president indicators are not analyzed separately by the half of the term because testing the Electoral Proximity Hypothesis requires estimating a single temporal effect for all presidents rather than different temporal effects for different presidents. Estimating the model with the president dummies separated by the half of the term yields results otherwise substantively similar to those presented.13"
"37","The empirical model for the Monotonic Popularity Hypothesis is comparable to the first specification. The key exception is that the probability of policy congruence is assumed to be a monotonic function of the president's popularity. In addition, because this hypothesis does not suggest that the impact of popularity will differ between the halves of the term, the model estimates a single effect for the entire term. Formally, the specification is:             "
"38","Policy Congruence As described above in the section on patterns of responsiveness, this variable equals one when the president's budgetary proposal on a given issue is in the direction preferred by the mass public and zero otherwise.               "
"39","Popularity The three variables involving presidential popularity are based on the Gallup poll question “Do you approve or disapprove of the way [the current president] is handling his job as president?” Each variable is constructed using the poll that was conducted most immediately prior to the submission of the president's budgetary proposal. Popularity simply equals the percentage of respondents that approve of the president's performance. Mean Popularity equals the mean of this approval for the dataset, 54.6%.14Above Average Popularity therefore equals one if the president's approval is at least 55% and zero otherwise.               "
"40","It is worth noting that the basic patterns of policy congruence provide some support for the CHS Popularity Hypothesis and little support for the Monotonic Popularity Hypothesis. In particular, we divide the data into the categories of the first and second halves of the term, as well as by whether the president's popularity was below 50%, in the “average” category of 50–60%, or above 60%. With these categories, the percentage of congruent observations is highest for presidents in the average range of popularity serving late in the term. Congruence occurs in 77% of these cases. In comparison, and as predicted by CHS, the percentages of congruent observations for presidents in the highest and lowest ranges of popularity serving late in the term are substantially lower, equaling 53 and 55%, respectively. Also as predicted, the percentages of congruent observations early in the term are consistently lower than those for the latter half and do not present the same nonmonotonic pattern with respect to presidential popularity. Specifically, the percentages are 33%, 47%, and 45% for the lowest, middle, and highest ranges.15"
"41","President's Ideological Congruence We expect the president to be more likely to enact a policy congruent with public opinion when the policy is also consistent with his ideology (see, e.g., Cohen 1997; Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995; Wlezien 1996). To measure this factor, we use Poole's (1998) common space (CS) scores, which are based on presidents' roll‐call positions.16 CS scores range from −1 to +1, with lower scores representing more liberal ideological leanings. We code the scores in opposite directions for domestic and defense spending, since liberal presidents generally want more domestic spending and less defense spending, whereas conservatives want the opposite. For example, when the public supports an increase in spending on a domestic issue, President's Ideological Congruence is higher the more liberal the president. In contrast, for foreign issues on which the public supports an increase in spending, the variable is higher the more conservative the president.               "
"42","Specifically, President's Ideological Congruence equals −1 × (CSScore) for domestic issues on which more respondents prefer an increase than prefer a decrease in spending, CS Score for domestic issues on which more respondents prefer a spending decrease, CS Score for foreign or defense issues on which more respondents prefer a spending increase, and −1 × (CS Score) for foreign or defense issues on which more respondents prefer a spending decrease.               "
"43","Congress' Ideological Congruence The analysis controls for the possibility that congruence between congressional ideology and public opinion may affect the president's policy choice. For instance, a president might be more apt to propose a popular policy when Congress is likely to support it. Alternatively, research on “blame‐game” politics (e.g., Groseclose and McCarty 2001) suggests that a president can increase his popularity by signaling that his preferences are more in line with public opinion than are those of Congress. A president may therefore be more likely to propose a popular policy when congressional preferences are not aligned with public opinion.               "
"44"," Congress' Ideological Congruence is measured analogously to President's Ideological Congruence. Specifically, for domestic spending the variable equals the median CS score of the House if more survey respondents prefer to decrease than increase spending, and −1 multiplied by this median score if more respondents prefer to augment spending.17 Defense and foreign spending are coded similarly except that a member is presumed to prefer more spending the more conservative he is.               "
"45","Public Concern This variable is based on the recurring Gallup Organization Most Important Problem survey, which asks respondents “What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?” Specifically, the variable equals the percentage of respondents that cited the policy issue in the poll conducted most immediately prior to the president's submission of his budgetary proposal. Public concern over an issue could affect the congruence between the president's proposal and public opinion if, for instance, presidents were more likely to respond to public opinion on currently salient issues. Cohen (1997)'s examination of State of the Union addresses finds no evidence of such a relationship in presidents' substantive policy statements. However, in our raw data congruence occurred substantially more often when at least some of the Gallup respondents cited the issue as the most important problem facing the country (in 57% of 88 observations) than when no respondents did so (in 44% of 72 observations). Thus we include Public Concern as a control variable.               "
"46","President and Issue Indicators The descriptive statistics in the previous section suggested that policy congruence may vary by president and issue. Accordingly, we include a set of presidential indicators to control for the possibility that presidents may differ in their general propensity to cater to the public's wishes. Also, we include a set of issue indicators to account for variation in responsiveness that is inherent to the 11 policy domains.               "
"47","Because the dependent variable Policy Congruence is dichotomous, a logit specification is employed to analyze Equations (1) and (2).18 For the first‐term presidents, three of the policy issues (with a total of 29 observations among them) perfectly predict the dependent variable. Thus the model can be estimated for only 131 of the 160 total observations.19Table 3 presents the findings.         "
"48","The Electoral Proximity Hypothesis receives some verification in both equations. The coefficient for the second half of the term is positive and at least marginally significant in each case (p≤ 0.1, two‐tailed, in each equation).20 This evidence provides support for the basic pattern identified earlier. In particular, responsiveness appears to be higher when the next election is imminent.         "
"49","Turning now to the relationship between popularity and policy congruence, the results for Equation (1) provide strong support for the CHS Popularity Hypothesis. Consider a president who is in the second half of his term, when the CHS theory predicts that presidents with average popularity are more likely to exhibit policy congruence than are those with high or low levels of popularity. The coefficient on (Popularity – Mean Popularity) × (1 −Above Average Popularity) in the second column of results suggests that as popularity decreases from an average level, the probability of policy congruence decreases significantly. Also as expected, the coefficient on (Popularity – Mean Popularity) × (Above Average Popularity) indicates that when a president is relatively popular, the probability of policy congruence decreases as his popularity increases.         "
"50","Interpreting the magnitudes of these effects is even more complicated than for a basic logit model because the analysis involves four mutually exclusive contexts that depend upon the half of the term and whether the president's popularity is below or above average. To deal with this situation, we set 2nd Half at one when the observation concerns the latter half of the president's term and zero for the first two years. We also set Above Average Popularity at one if the president's approval ratings are higher than average and zero if they are below average. As is standard in interpreting logit models, the control variables are assumed to be at their means. At these values, if a president's initial popularity is five points below average in the second half of his term, a 10‐point decline reduces the likelihood of policy congruence by 20%. Given the analogous parameter values with initial popularity that is five points above average, a 10‐point increase in approval decreases the likelihood of policy congruence by 16%. In each scenario, the marginal effect of electoral proximity is 55%.         "
"51","Now consider a president in the first half of his term. Here, the CHS Popularity Hypothesis predicts that there will be no relationship between presidential popularity and policy congruence. As shown in the first column of Table 3, the coefficients on the variables concerning popularity, i.e., (Popularity – Mean Popularity) × (1 −Above Average Popularity), and (Popularity – Mean Popularity) × (Above Average Popularity) are clearly insignificant in the first half of the president's term. Thus overall, the data provide strong support for the CHS Popularity Hypothesis.21"
"52","One potential concern about the strength of this finding is that thus far, we have not explicitly addressed the possibility that presidential popularity may be endogenous to policy congruence. Such endogeneity is unlikely since our data for Popularity are from surveys conducted prior to the president's submission of his budgetary proposal. Even so, we have tested for a statistically endogenous relationship between policy congruence and presidential popularity. In particular, we conducted a Rivers and Vuong (1988) test, which is designed for contexts like ours in which one of the hypothesized endogenous variables is binary.22 These results suggest that a president's popularity prior to a proposal is not statistically endogenous to the likelihood that the subsequent budget proposal is in accordance with public opinion.23 One final issue about the potential endogeneity worth noting is that no theory of which we are aware, including the CHS theory, predicts that a president's position taking should influence his short‐term popularity in the same way that the CHS theory predicts his popularity should influence his position taking. In all theories, even in those in which the longer‐term impact of a president's policy decision depends upon the resulting policy outcome, a president's popularity increases immediately after taking a popular position. Thus even if popularity were endogenous to policy congruence, the relationship would not bias the results in favor of supporting the nonmonotonic CHS Popularity hypothesis.         "
"53","We now focus on the last column of Table 3, which provides evidence on the Monotonic Popularity Hypothesis.24 Specifically, the data do not support the hypothesis, since the coefficient on popularity in the rightmost column of Table 3 is small and statistically insignificant. This result is consistent with Cohen's (1997) null finding in his test for a monotonic relationship between popularity and macrolevel policy congruence. In other words, the data do not contradict Cohen's result that a president's popularity and responsiveness lack a significant monotonic relationship. Rather, the data indicate that popularity influences responsiveness in the nonmonotonic manner proposed by the CHS Popularity Hypothesis.         "
"54","The analysis also has a broader implication: namely, that presidential responsiveness to public opinion is mediated by political conditions. In particular, a reelection‐seeking president has the greatest incentive to be responsive when the election will occur within the next two years and his popularity is average, so that the electoral race is likely to be tight. To some extent, this result is consistent with findings of responsiveness (e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002a, 2002b; Geer 1996) in that it indicates public opinion is a relevant factor in presidents' substantive policy decisions. However, the findings also identify conditions under which a president is unlikely to be responsive to public opinion. When the election is distant or when the president is either highly popular or highly unpopular, he is less inclined to cater to public opinion. In this way, the analysis partially comports with studies that find presidents are nonresponsive in their substantive policy positions (e.g., Cohen 1997; Jacobs and Shapiro 2000).         "
"55","The results for the control variables also indicate that presidential responsiveness depends upon political conditions. While the findings are relatively consistent across the two specifications, we focus on Equation (1) since it received more support from the data. The estimates for the first control variable, President's Ideological Congruence, provide further evidence that presidential responsiveness depends upon the time to the election. Specifically, the results indicate that the president's ideology significantly influences his likelihood of choosing a popular policy in the first half but not the second half of the term. These findings are consistent with the argument that first‐term presidents are concerned with pursuing an ideological agenda in their first two years in office but then concerned with reelection in the last two years. It is worth noting that when only one coefficient for presidential ideology is estimated for the entire term, as in Equation (2), this one effect significant. This result is consistent with earlier analyses (e.g., Cohen 1997; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002a, 2002b), which do not separate the impact of presidential ideology by the half of the term.         "
"56","The coefficient on the second control variable, Congress' Ideological Congruence, is insignificant for both halves of the president's term. As discussed previously, this result is not surprising given that there are different factors, i.e., blame game politics and the need for support from Congress, which would reasonably be expected to have opposite effects on the parameter estimate. Also insignificant according to the analysis is the effect of public concern, a result that is consistent with Cohen's (1997) findings on presidents' positions in State of the Union addresses.         "
"57","The parameter estimates on the indicators for the individual presidents suggest that most of these men did not significantly differ from one another in their responsiveness to public opinion. Thus although the descriptive statistics indicated that the presidents might differ substantially, most of the interpersonal variation is explained once structural factors are accounted for. A few of the personal differences are significant however. Specifically, the results suggest that Nixon was less responsive to public opinion than was Ford or G. H. W. Bush, and that Clinton was less responsive than G. H. W. Bush. This last finding is consistent with Jacobs and Shapiro's (2000) claim that Clinton often tried to induce the citizenry to support executive proposals that were initially unpopular.         "
"58","The estimates for the issue indicators in Table 4 indicate that independent of these personal differences, all presidents are more likely to take popular positions on certain types of issues. As with the descriptive statistics in the earlier section, policy congruence is highest for the issues that are highly familiar to voters in their everyday lives. The effects that exhibit the highest rates of congruence are crime, health, education, and social security (which had to be dropped from the econometric analysis because of perfect congruence). In contrast, less familiar issues such as defense, foreign aid, and space are associated with lower rates of congruence (indeed, the issue of space had to be dropped from the econometric analysis because the president's proposal was never congruent with public opinion).         "
"59","Finally, while the predictions focus on reelection‐seeking presidents, it is worth describing briefly the patterns for second term presidents. For interested readers, Table A2 presents these results in detail. They suggest, as expected, that presidential behavior varies substantially across the terms. For example, consistent with the fact that the Electoral Proximity Hypothesis is based on theories about reelection‐seeking presidents, there is no evidence of an electoral cycle of responsiveness. Likewise, the results on popularity indicate that second term presidents face different incentives regarding responsiveness to public opinion; the findings do not comport with either of the popularity hypotheses. Again, this is consistent with the CHS theory (the one theory of popularity that received support in our analysis of first term presidents) since that theory's predictions pertain to reelection‐seeking presidents.         "
"60","Given that these political circumstances do not matter, what factors do affect policy congruence for second term presidents? The strongest result is that President's Ideological Congruence drives policy congruence. That is, the analysis suggests that a second term president's policy proposals will be more likely to comport with public opinion when the public agrees with his ideological leanings.         "
"61","This article has analyzed the question of presidential responsiveness with previously untested theory and new data. The data, which revolved around a panel of 11 budgetary issues over three decades, had the advantage of comparing presidential proposals and public opinion at the level of individual policies. We first examined broad patterns of policy congruence by issue and president. This analysis suggested that a president's likelihood of supporting a popular policy varies substantially by issue, being highest for issues that citizens are likely to consider routinely. The analysis also suggested that congruence is substantially higher for the policy domains that correspond to the traditional liberal‐conservative continuum. The variation in congruence among individual presidents was less substantial but still noticeable, particularly for the observations concerning the ideological issues. For these cases, congruence between presidents' positions and public opinion has declined substantially since the 1970s."
"62","After reviewing these broad patterns, the article proceeded to test hypotheses about ways in which the electoral cycle and presidential popularity influence the likelihood of policy congruence, holding constant the issue, president, and other factors. Consistent with a range of prior theoretical work, we found that reelection‐seeking presidents are more likely to endorse popular policies in the second half of the term. With regards to presidential popularity, we found no evidence of a monotonic relationship, which would have been expected under some previous theories. However, the analysis did support the nonmonotonic relationship predicted by Canes‐Wrone, Herron, and Shotts (2001). In particular, the results demonstrated that when the next election is soon the probability of policy congruence increases as the president's popularity shifts from low to average, but decreases as popularity shifts from average to high. It is worth noting that even after accounting for this relationship and the impact of the electoral cycle, policy congruence was found to vary significantly by policy issue, with “doorstep” issues exhibiting significantly higher levels of congruence.         "
"63","What are the normative implications of these findings? For issues on which the president possesses little private information about how best to promote the public interest, policy congruence has desirable features because it indicates that the political system is responding to voter preferences. However, often the president possesses expertise that grants him better information than voters have regarding the expected effects of policies. The Canes‐Wrone, Herron, and Shotts (2001) theory concerns such circumstances. In that theory policy congruence can be normatively undesirable if it implies that a president “panders” to the public by disregarding information that suggests a popular policy is not in the long‐term interest of the country. The fact that the data are consistent with this theory suggests that presidents sometimes engage in such pandering. Fortunately, however, the results also indicate that the president will not engage in this behavior when he is sufficiently popular, when he is sufficiently unpopular, or when it is early in his term.         "
"64","What factors, then, drive some presidents to pander to public opinion and others to provide policy leadership by promoting the policy they believe is optimal even if it is unpopular? Conventional wisdom suggests that this decision is primarily a function of the quality of the man in office (e.g., Kennedy 1956). Our analysis, while providing some evidence that personal differences matter, suggests that contextual factors are critical. In particular, the significant effects of presidential popularity and electoral proximity indicate that many sources of policy leadership are institutional.         "
