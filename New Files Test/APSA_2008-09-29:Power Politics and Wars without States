"1","My first power politics hypothesis is about nonstate war and is drawn from power transition theory (Organski 1958; Organski and Kugler 1980). I begin with this theory since it enjoys such strong support (DiCicco and Levy 1999; Kugler and Lemke 2000). Power transition theory's understanding of the international system differentiates actors by their relative capabilities and by their evaluations of the status quo. Atop the international power hierarchy is the dominant state, the strongest actor in the system. Being this actor is desirable, because with dominance comes the privilege of structuring patterns of interaction according to one's preferences. These patterns of interaction are labeled the status quo. Power transition theory differentiates actors according to whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with the dominant power's status quo. The theory's main hypothesis is that when a dissatisfied actor rises in capabilities such that it reaches power parity with the dominant actor, war is likely. Parity between satisfied states is not expected to be associated with war, because the actors have little or nothing in disagreement between them. Great differences in power among actors who disagree about the status quo are also expected to coincide with peace, since the far weaker side anticipates losing any conflict it has with the much stronger side. Thus, power transition theory specifically hypothesizes that the interaction of parity and dissatisfaction increases the probability of war. This interaction of parity and dissatisfaction should greatly increase the probability of war among nonstate actors as well. But testing this hypothesized link between parity, dissatisfaction, and war among nonstate actors poses some empirical challenges: specifically, measuring the power of nonstate actors, gauging their evaluations of the status quo, and determining when they have fought wars and when they have remained at peace. I address these empirical questions at length below.         "
"2","Even more widely recognized than power transition theory's strong empirical track record is neorealism's pride of place as the dominant paradigm or conventional wisdom in IR. But, since significant challenges to neorealist claims about balancing have gained prominence (Vasquez 1997), I focus here on system‐level neorealist arguments about polarity and stability. Systemic analysis of stability cannot indicate whether “new” wars are really new, but does permit analysis of the similarity of state and nonstate behavior at a different level of analysis and with a different dependent variable.         "
"3","Neorealists ask whether variation in the numbers of poles or concentrations of power affects war and system stability. This question rose to prominence with a pair of simultaneously published, diametrically opposed claims about polarity and system stability. Deutsch and Singer (1964) argued that multipolarity's large number of poles creates greater stability by permitting more flexibility, reducing tensions, and preventing any pole from specializing in opposing a specific foe. In contrast, Waltz (1964) argued that bipolarity is more stable because the smaller number of power centers forces both sides to remain vigilant and attentive.         "
"4","Drawing directly from Waltz's neorealist work, and recalling his claim about when his neorealist theory applies, I anticipate that when the distribution of power across a system of nonstate actors is bipolar, those nonstate actors will experience greater stability than when the system is multipolar. As with my power transition hypothesis, testing this expectation requires defining the nonstate actor system, measuring the distribution of power within it, and measuring stability therein too."
"5"," Schweller (1998) offers a more recent argument about the systemic distribution of power and the stability of international systems. Using relational logic, he generates hypotheses about stability in different types of tripolar systems. He deduces that in situations where the power relationship can be described as A > B = C but A < B + C and in which B and C have revisionist goals, the two weaker revisionist poles are likely to combine against the satisfied strongest state. He refers to this as a “paradox of power” system and argues that such systems are likely to be unstable and to be characterized by militarized struggles pitting A against a BC coalition (1998; chap. 2). In addition, Schweller deduces that an “unbalanced tripolar system” in which A > B > C is also likely to be dangerous. He demonstrates that this distribution of power existed among great powers at the onset of World War II and provides detailed investigation of how this distribution of power and each pole's preferences for revisionism or for the status quo influenced alignment decisions and thus contributed to the actual onset of that war.         "
"6","Thus, my third hypothesis about the distribution of power and interests among nonstate actors is that when a “paradox of power” or “unbalanced tripolar system” exists among nonstate actors, stability will be less likely among them. Schweller anticipates an extension like this to analysis of other actors, writing: “the system‐wide effects predicted by my theory should also be felt within regional systems and specific sets of countries” (1998, 12)."
"7","In sum, I offer three hypotheses about the distribution of power and interests and the behavior of nonstate actors. My power transition hypothesis anticipates that when nonstate actors are at parity with each other and have disparate evaluations of the status quo, war is likely. My two polarity hypotheses anticipate, alternatively, that a bipolar distribution of power among nonstate actors will be associated with greater stability than will be the case under multipolarity and that two specific tripolar distributions of power will correspond with instability. I test these three hypotheses against the historical record of 20 autonomous political entities, including 18 nonstate actors and two official states, in the Rio de la Plata region of South America in the first half of the nineteenth century. The next section offers a brief historical description of this obscure international subsystem, followed by detailed explanation of how that history has been rendered into a dataset sufficient to the task of testing the three hypotheses."
"8","Tests of my hypotheses necessitate information about nonstate actors that interacted under anarchy, wanted to survive, varied in their capabilities, and alternated between war and peace, stability and instability. As indicated in the introduction, to test power politics arguments, I might use any number of types of actors. For simplicity's sake, I restrict myself to territorial state and nonstate actors, which I refer to as Autonomous Political Entities (APEs). An APE controls territory by asserting claims to it, and then either by having those claims respected by competitors or by defending the claim when competitors challenge it. In constructing the datasets analyzed below, I combed through many historical monographs, scholarly articles, and preexisting datasets for indications of the existence of APEs in the Rio de la Plata region of South America during the nineteenth century.2"
"9","More specifically, I code an actor as an APE when it achieves independent control of some territory. This is accomplished by successfully asserting independent control of a territory either with a formal declaration or by constructing an independent military capability to defend the territory. If other actors recognize the APE's independence (for example, by signing a treaty with it), I include it in my dataset. If other actors challenge the APE's assertion militarily, but are unable to defeat it, I include it in my dataset. If its assertion of independence goes unchallenged, I treat that as tacit recognition of its independence and include it in my dataset."
"10","Employing this definition and these coding rules, I determined that the Rio de la Plata region was populated by 20 APEs between 1810 and 1862. The number in existence at any one time varied from a low of 4 to a high of 17. The APEs and years of existence are listed in Table 1. A very few of these APEs qualify as official states. For example, the Correlates of War project includes “Argentina” as an official member of the international system from 1841 on. This recognition was of Buenos Aires from 1841 to 1851, of Entre Rios from 1851 to 1861, and of a unified Argentina after 1862. None of the other APEs satisfied coding rules to qualify as states in standard datasets (Uruguay did not meet COW's population threshold until 1882).         "
"11","The Rio de la Plata region constitutes modern‐day Argentina and Uruguay. Its early history offers an intrinsically interesting, unstudied subsystem of the international system against which to test my hypotheses. As indicated in the short historical summary here, and elaborated on at the end of this article, these actors resemble modern nonstate actors like warlords in central Asia and Africa. Their wars certainly bear many similarities to the “new wars” described in the introduction."
"12","From the revolt against Spain in 1810 until Buenos Aires' defeat of the Argentine Confederation at the Battle of Pavon in 1861, the Rio de la Plata was best characterized as an international subsystem. Within that subsystem, the actors formed alliances, signed treaties, and fought wars against each other. In short, the many APEs of what are now Argentina and Uruguay interacted like independent states.3"
"13","Throughout this period the Rio de la Plata's APEs considered themselves independent states. Criscenti writes that each “adopted a flag and emblem as symbols of its own cultural unity…and if the process had continued uninterrupted, the provinces would have grown into nations” (1961, 386). He adds: “Functionally, the provinces viewed themselves as independent states…” (400). Other historians regard the provinces as autonomous statelike entities as well. Rock refers to the region as a “profusion of microstates” (1985, 116) and to Buenos Aires as “an independent state” (2002, 7). Lynch asserts that even at the height of Buenos Aires' relative power, “The thirteen provinces governed themselves independently…” (1993, 30). The outside world viewed the Rio de la Plata APEs as functionally independent too, as seen in the claim that “the term ‘Argentina’ generally denoted during the first half of the nineteenth century a geographical area that was broken up into several quasi‐independent provinces or states, each struggling to wrest power and wealth from its neighbors” (Criscenti 1961, 367).         "
"14","There was a great deal of violent interaction among these actors. I classify their violence as wars whenever the historical record indicates at least 1,000 soldiers lost their lives in combat (Best [1960] is the most comprehensive source of Rio de la Plata conflict data). This is consistent with the standard COW definition of an interstate war. Much of this conflict was provoked by disagreement about altering political relations within the region. Preferences ranged from preserving the existing autonomy of the APEs, to uniting within some federal or unitary political system. Buenos Aires, in particular, favored a much closer union under its domination, but the interior APEs resisted. In 1819–20 a coalition of several of them defeated Buenos Aires in the region's first war, stalling the unification movement.         "
"15","Additional conflicts began in 1829 and 1831 among several interior APEs. Between 1838 and 1847 conflict within today's Uruguay spun off into three region‐wide wars. By the end of these wars a unified and independent Uruguay had taken shape. In 1851 Entre Rios and her allies again defeated the hegemonic aspirations of Buenos Aires, but in 1859–61 a resurgent Buenos Aires defeated the combined forces of the other APEs. After this victory the region adopted a single constitution, Buenos Aires was recognized as the national capital, and a coherent “Argentina” was born. Two additional wars (in 1833–34 and 1854–57), pitting Buenos Aires against the indigenous Pampas Tribes, fill the roster of wars in the Rio de la Plata. A list of the wars, including their dates, participants, and fatality levels, is presented in Table 2.         "
"16","All 10 of these wars are excluded from quantitative analyses of COW interstate wars because there was never more than one COW system member in the region during the period. However, COW records two intra‐ and two extrastate wars in the region during this period. COW's intrastate war in “Argentina” in 1841 is the end of the war I record as extending from 1839–41. The earlier part of that war is necessarily excluded because COW does not recognize “Argentina” as a member of the international system until 1841. COW's intrastate war in “Argentina” in 1861 corresponds to the end of the 1859–61 war listed in Table 2. COW records extrastate wars in Argentina in 1845–52, and in 1859. The first of these combines the end of the 1841–47 war listed in Table 2 with the 1851 war that followed it. The second of these is the beginning of the final war pitting Buenos Aires against the Argentine Confederation.         "
"17","Six of the wars listed in Table 2 are entirely excluded from COW datasets, and the remaining four are represented very differently by COW than they are in the historical sources I consulted. These differences are due entirely to different notions of which actors to study. COW data makers understandably have restricted their focus to conflicts involving official state system members, identified by population and formal diplomatic recognition. My contrasting representation of the Rio de la Plata international system clearly indicates the sorts of omissions mentioned in the introduction. I draw out these differences not to indict COW data makers for omissions, but rather to make clear how a small change in focus, from official states to APEs, can lead to substantial changes in the makeup of the data against which we test our hypotheses.         "
"18","In addition to information allowing me to code when APEs existed and fought wars, I was able to uncover considerable information about alliances among these actors. They appear to have viewed alliances as worthwhile defense commitments, or otherwise saw them as valuable enough to have constructed 11 of them.4 I have also uncovered sufficient information to construct a measure of the power or capabilities of each APE. Traditional measures of power such as GDP or COW's CINC score are, understandably, not readily available for nineteenth‐century South American APEs. But there is a very strong association between GDP or CINC score and population. For the 185 current UN member states, or for the 180 current members of the COW interstate system, bivariate OLS regressions of GDP or CINC on population generate r2 values around 0.9. The association between GDP and population is similarly strong for the 37 states Angus Maddison (2003) provides data about for 1820. Given this strong, enduring statistical association between population and traditional measures of national power, I represent each APE's capabilities as its aggregate demographic endowment. Larger population represents greater capabilities. I have found detailed population data for the actors in the region during this time period in Maeder (1969) and Nin y Silva (1930).         "
"19","I combined all of this information about the existence of APEs, their war and peace behavior, their populations, their alliances, and various other characteristics explained in the actual analyses below, into dyad‐year and system‐year datasets. I use these datasets to test my hypotheses about war and stability among autonomous political entities."
"20","The dyadic version of the dataset indicates the power ratio within each dyad, which APEs shared evaluations of the Rio de la Plata status quo, and when they waged wars against each other. In addition, the dyadic dataset also indicates the proximity of each pair of APEs, whether each pair was allied, and whether they shared a history of previous unification. These latter variables are included as controls.5"
"21","My codings of each APE's status quo evaluations represent each actor's attitude toward Buenos Aires' efforts to establish political and commercial domination. Historians describe this divide as one between Unitarians (who preferred unification under a strong central government) and Federalists (whose preferences ranged from a federal system to total independence of each APE). Katra (1996), de la Fuente (2000), and Gibson and Falleti (2004) chronicle variations in Unitarianism and Federalism within and across APEs. Based on such accounts, it is possible to categorize each APE leader's reactions to Buenos Aires' efforts to dominate the others by monopolizing trade through the port of Buenos Aires and controlling its lucrative customs revenues. By controlling access to the international economy, the dominant Buenos Aires was able to choose which APEs to reward, which to exclude. Thus, status quo evaluations in the Rio de la Plata reflected whether each APE favored Buenos Aires' efforts to control foreign trade and/or supported greater control by Buenos Aires over Rio de la Plata politics.6"
"22","The historical sources indicate which APEs approved of Buenos Aires' efforts to write the “rules” and which did not. They record variation not only across APEs, but also over time within some APEs. In addition, there are examples of APEs opposing the Buenos Aires–imposed status quo even though they benefited materially from collaboration. For example, Rock writes:"
"23","                        "
"24","Rosas (Buenos Aires' leader) had alienated the province of Entre Rios, whose river links had been cut…Entre Rios…was now rapidly gaining economic and political significance…The province was firmly united under its caudillo, Justo Jose de Urquiza…After 1848, when Rosas refused to reopen the Paraná, Urquiza grew increasingly restless…At length, his demands unsatisfied, Urquiza turned to rebellion. (1985, 112)               "
"25","As the passage indicates, Entre Rios was growing rapidly, but Urquiza and his supporters perceived that growth would be even greater under a different status quo, one in which Entre Rios did not have to accept Buenos Aires' control of the Paraná River and consequent commercial penalties. The “rebellion” Rock refers to was an “international” war, pitting Buenos Aires against the unified forces of Entre Rios, Corrientes, and Uruguay. In the conflict Buenos Aires was defeated, and Rosas went into exile. Urquiza became leader of an Argentine Confederation, and, not surprisingly, freed trade for upriver actors. This example illuminates how questions about who would control the region and how trade would be organized mirror power transition theory's conceptualization of the international status quo. Importantly, power transition theory views the status quo as a series of implicit or explicit rules which the dominant power creates. Other actors evaluate the status quo not only in terms of whether they currently benefit, but also by considering whether they would benefit more from alternate rules. Clearly, Urquiza's Entre Rios was doing well but thought it could do better. Its dissatisfaction was, in Rock's account, directly connected to its decision for war."
"26","I code each dyad as being in agreement or disagreement about the status quo based on whether the actors shared preferences about Buenos Aires' role in the region and specifically about Buenos Aires' control of trade. I carefully read historical accounts paying particular attention to these attitudes. The resulting variable, Status Quo Dissatisfaction, is a dichotomous indicator, equal to 1 when the dyad members had disparate evaluations of the status quo. Parity is the ratio of the weaker to the stronger dyad member, using the demographic power variable described above.         "
"27","Power transition theory's war onset hypothesis is that the interactive effect of Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction on war onset will be positive and statistically significant. The dataset features over 5,000 annual dyadic observations. Since many empirical relationships are not robust across different model specifications (Bennett and Stam 2000), I ran the analyses in a variety of ways. First, since the decisions to start a war and to continue it may differ, I undertook analyses in which the dependent variable is coded 1 only for those years in which a war begins within a dyad and alternately coded the dependent variable as equal to 1 for any year in which a war starts or is ongoing. Power transition theory's war hypothesis has traditionally been treated as pertaining to war onset, and thus I present only war onset analyses below. But analyses with “ongoing war” as the dependent variable generate similar results. Since specification is a second source of variation in results, I have rerun the analyses reported in Table 3 omitting all control variables and generate nearly identical results for the main variables. A final source of variation arises when different sets of cases are analyzed. Consequently, I analyze three sets of cases.         "
"28"," Lemke (2002, 112) argues that power transition theory is most appropriately analyzed against dyads including the system's dominant state. Since power transition theory suggests wars are fought for control of the systemic status quo, it seems plausible that war and peace relations pertinent to evaluation of the theory must include the dominant state. If so, then the results in Table 3's first column are the most appropriate for analysis of power transition theory's applicability in the Rio de la Plata region, because Buenos Aires was always the most powerful APE. All of the dyads analyzed in Table 3 column 1 include Buenos Aires. In this analysis the interactive effect of Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction is positive and statistically significant, and the positive multiplicative term is larger than the absolute value of the sum of the two constituent elements.         "
"29","Of specific interest are the marginal effects of Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction. The interactive specification complicates calculation of these marginal effects, but Brambor, Clark, and Golder (2006) clarify proper calculation of interactive marginal effects. Across varying values of Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction, the expected probabilities of war are presented in Table 4 (based on the first column of Table 3, assuming an allied dyad with one year of peace).         "
"30","The predicted probability of war is zero for dyads including Buenos Aires when Status Quo Dissatisfaction is absent. It is higher, 11%, when Status Quo Dissatisfaction is present but Parity is at its minimum observed value. However, when Status Quo Dissatisfaction is present and Parity rises to its maximum observed value, the predicted probability of war also rises, dramatically, to 57%. This suggests that, like “official” states in the international system, APEs in the Rio de la Plata were more likely to wage war when they were roughly equal and in strong disagreement about their relations. The power transition hypothesis is supported."
"31","The second column of Table 3 reports the results of an analysis of relevant dyads. “Relevance” here refers to all contiguous Rio de la Plata dyads and all dyads involving Buenos Aires. Even though the Relevant Dyad analyses include roughly three times as many cases as in column 1, I again find that the interaction of Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction increases the probability of war onset. The interaction is statistically significant, and substantively positive. The positive coefficient for the multiplicative term is greater than the combined negative effect of the constituent terms. The third column in Table 3 reports results in which the cases analyzed are all dyads within the Rio de la Plata. As in the other two models, here too the interaction of Parity and Dissatisfaction increases the probability of war. The multiplicative term is again positive and significant. Its positive effect is substantially larger than the negative effect of the Parity constituent term. Again I find that rough equality of power and disparate evaluations of the status quo are associated with a higher probability of war when they are jointly present. Analysis of this largest set of cases dilutes the theoretically relevant relationship. Whereas the joint presence of Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction increased the probability of war among Buenos Aires Dyads to 57%, here the impact is only to increase it to 7.4%. Diluted or not, even in this largest set of cases, the joint presence of Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction increases the expected probability of war onset.         "
"32","While the Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction variables perform as expected, none of the control variables manifest consistent relationships with war onset. It is particularly surprising that Contiguity and Distance prove unrelated to war onset among Rio de la Plata APEs. These are two of the more robustly established control variables in analysis of conflict among official states. I suspect they fail to perform as expected here because so many of the wars listed in Table 2 pit Buenos Aires against both proximate and distant APEs. This would‐be hegemon flexed its muscles throughout the region in its efforts to establish a unified state. Clearly, it was not significantly constrained by the tyranny of distance, perhaps because absolute distances are not particularly large in this region. It will prove interesting in extensions of this work to more distant nonstate dyads to see if the nonrelationship between proximity and war persists and whether other dissimilarities emerge.         "
"33","In all three power transition analyses reported here, and across variation in dependent variable coding, case inclusion, and model specification, the interaction of Parity and Status Quo Dissatisfaction increases the probability of war. Wars among these nonstate actors were more likely to occur under the same dyadic conditions favoring the occurrence of wars among official states. This suggests that power transition theory may be as useful for anticipating wars among APEs as it has been shown to be in accounting for international wars among official states."
"34","Among the many empirical analyses of polarity and stability, Wayman (1984) stands out for his comprehensiveness. Recognizing that polarity theorists rarely provide explicit definitions of “poles” (Waltz describes poles as equivalent to great powers, but Deutsch and Singer describe poles as blocs of allies), Wayman accommodates both views by measuring “power polarity” (each great power is a pole) and “cluster polarity” (each allied bloc of great powers is a pole). He finds that the two types of polarity do not correlate with each other (1984, 70). It is no surprise then that other researchers fail to find consistent relationships between the systemic distribution of power and the stability of the system. Further, it becomes unsurprising that Wayman's exhaustive series of tests uncovers no consistent patterns between polarity and his measures of system stability. He finds different types of polarity related to the number of wars begun, the length of wars, or the number of states participating in wars. But neither bipolarity nor multipolarity is consistently more stable than the other within the system of great powers. The conclusion most reasonably drawn is that the systemic distribution of power among existing states does not affect system stability.         "
"35","As described above, I have annual data about the demographic capabilities of all members of the Rio de la Plata system and also information about alliances formed therein. These two components allow me to calculate how many poles there were as defined by “power polarity” or “cluster polarity.” In defining poles I adopt Schweller's definition: “(t)o qualify as a pole, a state must possess at least half the resources of the most powerful state in the system” (1998, 46). Since Buenos Aires was always the most powerful actor in the system, it always qualifies as a pole when I define poles as individually powerful APEs (called “power polarity” below). Any other actor with one‐half or more of Buenos Aires' demographic capabilities also qualifies as a pole. In calculating the number of poles existing under “cluster polarity,” I define as poles any actor or cluster that has at least one‐half the power of the strongest actor or cluster. Clusters are identified by the existence of alliances, and each cluster's capabilities are the sum of demographic capabilities of all members of that alliance."
"36","I use four measures of system stability. Stable systems should last longer, have fewer wars, fewer fatalities, and fewer changes of system membership. “Duration” represents the average number of years each type of polarity persisted. “Wars” indicates the average number of wars underway per year for each type of polarity, and “Fatalities” represents the average number of battle fatalities per year for each type of polarity. Finally, “Membership Changes” indicates the average number of additions to or subtractions from the list of APEs per year for each type of polarity. Average values of these indicators for each type of polarity are reported in Table 5.         "
"37","The cell entries in Table 5 indicate no consistent relationship between either measure of the two types of polarity and any measure of systemic stability. Like Wayman, I find that my two types of polarity are uncorrelated with each other (the correlation between “power” and “cluster” polarity is −0.03 and is insignificant). Turning to specific interpretations from Table 5, advocates of multipolar stability might be pleased to see that, using the power polarity definition, multipolar periods in the Rio de la Plata appear to have lasted longer and to have experienced fewer wars than did periods of bipolarity. But bipolar stability enthusiasts would be equally justified in pointing out that bipolarity, again using the power polarity definition, is associated with lower severity wars and fewer changes of system membership. That these differences tend to cancel each other out and that only one of them is statistically significant suggests the safest conclusion to draw is that there is no general relationship between polarity and stability regardless of how I measure these concepts. This absence of any systematic relationship is entirely consistent with “official state” scholarship on polarity and stability. Even though the bipolarity hypothesis is not supported, this APE finding exactly resembles the outcome of polarity analyses for official states.         "
"38","I turn now to the hypothesis about tripolarity. In contrast to the quantitative assessment of no consistent relationship between bi‐ or multipolarity and stability, anecdotal consideration of tripolar periods in the Rio de la Plata system offers some support for Schweller's (1998) arguments about the perils of tripolar “paradox of power” and “unbalanced tripolar” systems. Statistical analysis of the stability of different types of tripolarity is not possible, because some of Schweller's other tripolar types never occurred in the Rio de la Plata.7"
"39","There were three “paradox of power” tripolar periods in the Rio de la Plata system. In 1810–11 Buenos Aires enjoyed superiority over Salta and Cordoba, with the latter two APEs roughly equal to each other in power. Both Salta and Cordoba desired a Rio de la Plata in which Buenos Aires would dominate neither politically nor commercially, and thus were revisionist. Although they did not wage war directly against Buenos Aires, both abetted secessionist groups within Buenos Aires' territory, and both formed the main political opposition to union under Buenos Aires' control. If we permit a common equating of war with instability, the absence of war may be unanticipated by Schweller's logic, but certainly the alignment of the two weaker actors against the stronger is consistent with his expectations."
"40","Similarly, from 1814 to 1818 Buenos Aires was superior to Cordoba and Tucuman, with the latter two roughly equal to each other. As in the earlier period, neither Cordoba nor Tucuman was content with Buenos Aires' political and commercial influence, and thus both sought changes to the system. They aligned against Buenos Aires, and as Salta and Cordoba had done earlier, actively encouraged secessionist groups within Buenos Aires' territory. The lesser two were so successful in encouraging and abetting actors to assert independence from Buenos Aires that the system was transformed into a larger multipolar one, and in 1819–20 an alliance of many of these revisionist actors defeated Buenos Aires in the first war within the system. Abetting secessionists such that the system is transformed from tri‐ to multipolarity certainly indicates instability. Technically, the war that ensued occurred after the “paradox of power” tripolar system was replaced, but clearly it was caused by the system instability and thus the historical account is consistent with the general thrust of Schweller's argument."
"41","A final tripolar “paradox of power” arrangement existed in 1853–54. Buenos Aires was again superior, this time to Uruguay and Cordoba. Both of these lesser poles were roughly equal in power to each other and aggrieved by Buenos Aires' continued influence on commercial relations between the Rio de la Plata system and outside markets. In spite of these disagreements with Buenos Aires, and despite the incentive the distribution of power gave Uruguay and Cordoba to unite against Buenos Aires, no such collaboration, and no observable instability, occurred. Even with this contrary case, two of the three tripolar “paradox of power” historical instances in the Rio de la Plata generally conform with Schweller's expectations."
"42"," Schweller (1998) demonstrates that another type of tripolarity, “unbalanced tripolarity,” existed among great powers at the onset of World War II. His book provides a detailed discussion of how this distribution of power and each pole's preferences for revisionism or for the status quo directed alignment decisions and thus contributed to system instability and the actual onset of World War II. Interestingly, an unbalanced tripolar distribution of power (with Buenos Aires > Cordoba > Uruguay, and with a revisionist Uruguay) existed in the Rio de la Plata system from 1837 to 1842. That this period corresponds with the onset of the system's bloodiest period of war, and that Buenos Aires and Cordoba fought together against Uruguay, suggests that this distribution of power may be as dangerous among APEs as among official states in the great power system. Adding this case to those already discussed, three of four instances of dangerous tripolar periods in the Rio de la Plata system were unstable, consistent with the third hypothesis.         "
"43","These anecdotes are generally supportive of the hypothesis about the negative consequences for APEs of specific tripolar distributions of power. I failed to support the second hypothesis, that bipolarity reduces instability among APEs. Cumulatively these findings, and particularly the strong support for the power transition hypothesis, suggest that power politics arguments are as useful for understanding wars and instability among APEs as they are for understanding them among official states. While it is true that the bipolarity hypothesis was not supported, it is important to note that bipolarity has never been conclusively shown to coincide with stability among official states. Thus, those power politics arguments that successfully account for the behavior of official states also enjoy empirical support when analyzing APEs, and similarly those power politics arguments that fail to account for the behavior of official states also fail to account for behaviors of APEs. The empirical patterns of war and stability are quite similar among APEs and official states."
"44","The strong support uncovered for the power transition hypothesis suggests that existing scholarly reactions to wars involving nonstate actors are inappropriate. Scholars who ignore conflicts among or involving nonstate actors, like the Rio de la Plata's APEs, are systematically excluding from analysis cases not only relevant to testing of their theories, but also supportive of their arguments. Conversely, claims that efforts to account for wars featuring nonstate actors will require new theories are challenged by these findings. Either the evidence presented here suggests existing theories do account for nonstate actor wars or those advocating new theories for “new wars” must provide evidence that their allegedly “new wars” differ from wars in the nineteenth‐century Rio de la Plata."
"45","Demonstrating that Rio de la Plata wars and “new wars” differed fundamentally is made difficult by the fact that “new war” scholars have not provided explicit coding rules for identifying “new wars.”Holsti (1996, 20) describes “new wars” as lacking declarations of war and formal peace treaties, lacking disciplined and uniformed armies, and as involving terror, attrition, and violence against civilians. Kaldor (1999, 90) claims “new wars” involve low participation relative to population, and their war efforts are heavily dependent on local predation. Mueller claims that in new war “many of the paramilitary warlord and mercenary forces are doing quite well in their individual criminal fiefdoms, and some are even seeking respectability” (2004, 115).         "
"46","The Rio de la Plata's wars were very similar to modern “new wars.” Formal declarations of hostilities or of cessation of hostilities in the wars listed in Table 2 were exceptions rather than the rule. Caudillos were warlords (Haigh 1964; Lynch 2002) and warlords are caudillos (Callaghy 1984, 27–31). Caudillo leadership involved despotic stationary banditry (Duncan Baretta and Markoff 1978; Salvatore 2000). The caudillos' armies were not uniformed, disciplined soldiery. After encountering Buenos Aires' forces in Patagonia (during the 1833–34 war listed in Table 2), noted data collector Charles Darwin claimed, “I should think such a villainous, banditti‐like army was never before collected together” ([1839] 2004, 73). The commercialized and globalized aspect of violence Kaldor identifies as a unique aspect of “new wars” was present in the Rio de la Plata, as indicated by the prominent role of mercenaries (for example, Giuseppe Garibaldi relocated to the Rio de la Plata and commanded forces during the wars of the 1840s; see McLean 1998).         "
"47","Although unsystematic, this recitation indicates that the defining features “new war” scholars see as distinct to their wars characterized conflicts fought long ago. My findings thus suggest that if we were to construct datasets about warlords and insurgents in more recent times, we would find them waging wars at parity, and similarly that when unstable tripolarity exists among states and nonstate actors in regional subsystems, the odds of violence and instability rise accordingly. This study of the Rio de la Plata system's wars suggests a timelessness both of nonstate‐actor wars, and of power politics' applicability thereto. Unless there is some other, as yet unidentified, distinguishing characteristic of “new wars,” the analyses above suggest it is premature to rule out the possibility that existing IR theories can help us understand conflicts currently omitted from study."
"48","The Rio de la Plata evidence provided here may suggest reason for optimism about the long‐term consequences of “new wars.” Specifically, the turmoil and conflict in the Rio de la Plata was a contributing factor to the coherent and prosperous Argentina that emerged subsequently. Rock claims:"

"50","Politically, the country ceased to be a segmented imbroglio of caudillo chieftainships, and it gradually surmounted its interregional conflicts to form a national state that gained undisputed authority throughout the republic. Economic expansion occurred on unprecedented scale. The frontiers advanced rapidly as the Indians were driven away and the free gauchos at last suppressed. (1985, 118)"
"51","The growth spurred by centralization and subsequent infrastructure development was so impressive that “(b)y 1913 the country's per capita income slightly exceeded that of France, Germany, and the Netherlands, while far outpacing that of Italy, Spain, and other parts of southern and eastern Europe” (Maclachlan 2006, 33).         "
"52","In the Rio de la Plata, 20 APEs fought a series of wars about whether and how to build a state. Those favoring a centralized and unified state won and created a successful political system. The history of the Rio de la Plata in the nineteenth century can be seen as broadly consistent with Tilly's (1992) framework linking war and state making. If wars among these APEs resemble wars among nonstate actors today, then victory by warlords trying to create competent national governments could similarly succeed. Mueller recognizes this potential when he reminds us that “the creation of essentially disciplined forces from bands of people who are, or act like, criminals and thugs has been at the center of much state building” (2004, 23).         "
"53","How significant is a finding that power politics theories help anticipate wars among nonstate actors in a peripheral region of the international system long ago? How significant is it that systemic polarity hypotheses are as successful at anticipating stability in systems of nonstate actors as they are in systems of official states? Quite significant. Although obscure, this is unbiased and novel evidence that the empirical domain of IR theories is considerably larger than its traditional near‐exclusive application to analysis of official states. My findings hint that the interactions of all APEs will offer evidence against which to judge the empirical accuracy of IR theories. A further benefit of having studied obscure actors from long ago is that I have been able to gather plentiful and useful data about them at all. This generates confidence that similar data about APEs in more salient regions and current time periods can be gathered. Hopefully the evidence provided above will help motivate the collection of those data. Once assembled, they will permit analyses to determine if power politics arguments explain “new wars” too.8"
"54","In this article I have used two IR schools of thought about power politics to analyze patterns of war and stability among nonstate actors in the nineteenth‐century Rio de la Plata region. Since standard IR datasets largely exclude these actors, and their wars, no one has ever investigated whether their conflicts occurred under conditions similar to those prevailing when official states make wars. Importantly, power transition theory's hypothesis about parity and status quo dissatisfaction is consistently, strongly supported. My analyses also suggest that Schweller's arguments about tripolarity and stability conform with a historical narrative of nineteenth‐century Rio de la Plata politics. Thus, both power transition theory and tripolarity arguments offer considerable empirical purchase on anticipating when wars and instability among these autonomous political entities occurred. In contrast, the presence of bipolarity in the Rio de la Plata system is not consistently related to any measures of stability there. But in this regard too, the Rio de la Plata subsystem appears very similar to the international system writ large, because the absence of a consistent relationship between bipolarity and stability obtains among official states as well. The general conclusion is that power politics theories are useful for understanding the behaviors of nonstate actors."
