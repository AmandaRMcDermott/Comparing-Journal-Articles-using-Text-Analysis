"1","This section provides descriptive evidence that for a broad sample of countries, low‐earning, less–skilled intensive industries receive relatively high levels of trade protection. This pattern holds across countries with very different patterns of trade and comparative advantage and is not well accounted for by existing explanations of the determinants of trade policy."
"2","Figure 1 plots trade‐weighted tariffs in manufacturing industries in 2000 against normalized average wages in those sectors for the United States and China.3 The first panel of the graph shows a pattern familiar to students of trade policymaking in the United States. Tariffs are relatively low in the United States, but those industries that use lower‐skilled, lower‐paid workers more intensively receive higher levels of trade protection.         "

"5","The most common explanation for this pattern of trade protection in the United States is that comparative disadvantage sectors—losers from expanding trade—get more protection. A large empirical literature has documented the tendency of governments to provide greater trade protection to declining industries. In the United States and Europe, for example, heavily protected industries include textiles, footwear, clothing, and agriculture, which have been contracting for decades.4"
"6","One implication of the idea that governments tend to support declining sectors is that we should expect significant differences across countries in the distribution of trade protection across different sectors of the economy. While some losing sectors may be common across all countries due to changes in technology or consumer tastes, many changes in the fortunes of industries will reflect differences in comparative advantage across countries. To the extent that winning and losing sectors are in part determined by comparative advantage, we would expect that patterns of trade protection vary across countries and that this variation might be explained in turn by the sources of a country's comparative advantage, such as differences in technology or factor endowments."
"7","To investigate this question further, the second panel of Figure 1 plots trade‐weighted tariffs in Chinese manufacturing industries in 2000 against normalized average wages in those sectors. While the level of tariffs in China is higher than the United States, what is striking about this graph is how similar the distribution of protection by factor intensity is compared to the United States. Those sectors which employ less‐skilled, lower‐paid workers more intensively have higher levels of trade protection. Under the common empirical claim that China has a comparative advantage in sectors such as textiles and toys, which use less‐skilled workers more intensively, the pattern of protection observed in this graph is not easily explained by describing these sectors as losing sectors as in the U.S. case. Importantly, this pattern of trade protection in which lower‐paying and less‐skilled intensive sectors are more likely to get greater trade protection in countries generally thought to have a comparative advantage in those sectors has also been noted for several other developing countries in previous research.5"
"8","To investigate systematically the possibility that protection is generally higher in lower‐paying and less‐skilled intensive sectors, we examine the correlation of trade protection and skill intensity in a large cross‐section of countries. Our data for this analysis are from the Trade, Production and Protection (1976‐2004) World Bank dataset arranged by Alessandro Nicita and Marcelo Olarreaga.6 This dataset contains variables on trade, production, and protection in 28 manufacturing sectors (three‐digit ISIC, revision 2). For each country, we picked a year close to 2001 for which data were available to calculate trade‐weighted tariffs and average industry wages. We then calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for the tariff and wage data. A negative Spearman's rank correlation coefficient here indicates that the industry ranks for tariffs and average wages are negatively correlated with lower‐wage industries receiving relatively greater tariff protection. We report these results for trade‐weighted tariffs; the results look quite similar for simple average tariffs.7"
"9","Figure 2 plots the Spearman rank correlation between weighted tariffs and average wages in three‐digit ISIC, revision 2 manufacturing industries in each country against GDP per capita.8 The figure reveals two significant patterns in the data. First, for all but two of the countries, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is negative, indicating that in almost every country, industries with lower wages receive greater protection. Second, the magnitude of this correlation does not vary across countries by GDP per capita, which is a rough measure of human/physical capital endowments and thus one likely source of comparative advantage. This suggests that there is little evidence in this data that comparative advantage is driving the distribution of trade protection across sectors.         "
"10","                Correlation of Protection and Wages by Endowment"
"11","Note: This figure plots the Spearman rank correlation between weighted tariffs and average wages in three‐digit, ISIC, revision 2 manufacturing industries in each country against GDP per capita. See text for sources.                     "
"12","The data reviewed in the previous section show that sectors that employ lower‐paid, less‐skilled workers more intensively receive greater trade protection across countries with very different economic and political characteristics. There are a number of alternative explanations for this pattern of protection. For example, it may be that tariffs are constrained by GATT and WTO commitments, and these policies are dominated by the domestic political interests of relatively wealthy countries for which losing sectors certainly do include industries that employ less‐skilled workers more intensively. Another alternative might be that lower‐paid sectors lobby harder because their opportunity costs for lobbying are lower. The explanation that we explore in this article is that individual citizens care not only about how trade policy influences their real incomes but also how it affects their incomes relative to others, with a preference for policies that promote equality. As a result, policies that support the incomes of low earners are favored in the policymaking process."
"13","In this section, we develop a theoretical model of trade policy preferences which closely follows standard political economy trade models except for the key difference that individuals in our model care about both their own incomes and their incomes relative to others—they are motivated by inequity aversion.9 The model focuses on identifying how inequity aversion influences preferences about trade protection in a standard setting, and then we discuss how such preferences may influence policymaking outcomes in diverse institutional settings.10"
"14","In a perfectly competitive economy with the size of the population normalized to one and  sectors, individuals maximize the utility function given by:11"
"15","This utility function has two components: utility from consumption () and disutility from inequity aversion (). Goods/sectors and types of individuals—as all individuals within a sector are identical—are indexed by , .  is the consumption of the numeraire good 0, and  is the consumption of nonnumeraire good . The utility functions  are increasing functions which are differentiable, separable, and strictly concave.         "
"16","To account for inequity aversion, we incorporate a social preference term into the individual's utility function. The term for inequity aversion is equivalent to the specification in equation (1) in Fehr and Schmidt (1999, 822).  is income of individual  and  indicates the fraction of the population working in sector . As in Fehr and Schmidt, the parameter  measures utility loss from advantageous inequality when  and the parameter  measures the utility loss from disadvantageous inequality when .12"
"17","We assume that workers in sector  all earn identical incomes, which are a function of their labor and the return to a sector‐specific input owned only by individuals working in each respective sector. Note that an individual owns at most one type of sector‐specific input, and we assume the sector‐specific factor input is indivisible and nontradable. The technologies to produce these goods have constant returns to scale, and the specific factor inputs have inelastic supplies. The numeraire good 0 is produced with labor alone and sets the economy‐wide return to labor. The nonnumeraire good  is produced with labor and the sector‐specific factor input. We normalize the wage to 1, and the aggregate reward to the specific factor depends on the domestic price of the good, that is,  where  is the domestic price. We index each sector's return such that . The total income () to an individual in sector  is equal to his or her wage of 1 plus . Individual consumption must meet the budget constraint such that . We also denote the exogenous world price of the good to be . The policy choice under consideration is a specific tariff or subsidy  on the good produced in sector , such that .         "
"18","The net revenue per capita from trade policies (tariffs or subsidies) is expressed as , where  is the demand function of good  by an individual, and  equals the inverse of , and  is the domestic output of good  and  is a vector of domestic prices of the nonnumeraire goods. Each individual receives an equal net transfer of . The consumer surplus derived from these goods is . Given these assumptions, we can derive individuals' indirect utility in sector  as follows:            "
"19","To determine individual preferences about trade policy in sector  (), we derive an expression for optimal tariffs by maximizing this function with respect to , which is simply the sum of the exogenous world price and the tariff, and then solving for . We are looking for the domestic prices (and implied tariffs) in sector  that maximize welfare for an individual in sector .         "
"20","This yields the following optimum tariffs preferred by individual  for sector :            "
"21","Similarly, we can evaluate the impact of advantageous inequality. For sectors with incomes lower than a given individual  ( & ), an increase in  results in a higher preferred tariff. This means that the greater an individual's utility loss from “advantageous inequality,” the higher will be the preferred tariff for that individual in all sectors with lower incomes. Because tariffs raise returns to specific factors, the more individuals do not like it when others make less than they do, the higher they will want the tariff for these sectors to be.         "
"22","This model identifies how self‐centered inequity aversion influences policy preferences about trade protection in a standard setting, and it provides clear empirical predictions that we will evaluate in the next section of the article. It is straightforward to see that the preferences described in our model would tend to push policy outcomes in a direction for which lower‐earning industries tend to receive higher levels of protection under a number of alternative assumptions about the policymaking process. Thus, inequity aversion constitutes one possible answer to the empirical puzzle that we have documented."
"23","For example, suppose policy is chosen by a single individual in the society with the preferences described above. This policy maker could be a citizen from the median industry, or an individual elected to office for reasons unrelated to trade policy, or a leader in a non‐democratic political regime. The exact policy selected for each industry by such a leader will depend on the individual's position in the income distribution and the relative magnitude of the parameters in the model. That said, lower‐paying industries are more likely to benefit from the policy maker's dislike of advantageous inequality and less likely to be punished by his or her aversion to disadvantageous inequality, yielding a pattern of greater protection for lower‐paying industries."
"24","Another relatively simple way to think about the policy implications of our model of preferences is to consider the case of a social welfare maximizing planner. In this setting, aggregate utility losses from disadvantageous inequality toward workers in a sector will tend to lower that sector's protection while aggregate utility losses from advantageous inequality toward workers in a sector will tend to raise that sector's protection. Lower‐earning sectors will have lower levels of aggregate utility losses from disadvantageous inequality and higher levels of aggregate utility losses from advantageous inequality, and thus will be more likely to be protected than higher‐earning sectors.13 Many political economy models of trade are, in effect, models for which a policy maker weighs aggregate welfare against some other gain, such as lobbying contributions. To the extent that aggregate welfare is influential at all in the policymaking process, inequity aversion is likely to push policy toward greater protection for lower‐earning sectors and less for higher‐earning sectors.         "
"25","In this section we use national samples of citizens in China and the United States to provide two critical empirical tests in support of our model. First, we show that preferences aggregated across all respondents in each country vary systematically with the treatment income of industry workers: industries with lower‐income workers receive broader support for trade protection. Second, we derive from our model and estimate an equation of policy preferences, and we find that individuals exhibit inequity aversion. Econometrically identifying these preferences lends considerable support to our explanation of the trade‐policy puzzle documented above."
"26","To estimate the effect of inequity aversion—both from advantageous and disadvantageous inequality—on support for sector‐specific trade protection, we designed a survey experiment that randomly assigned respondents to consider trade protection for industries with different wage levels and recorded their support for sector‐specific trade protection. In China, the experiment was conducted in face‐to‐face interviews for a national sample of the Chinese adult population living in major cities and county‐level cities.14 In the United States, the experiment was conducted over the Internet for a nationally representative sample of the U.S. adult population.1 These two countries were selected as a starting point for evaluating the importance of inequity aversion in opinion formation because their observed comparative advantage is in very different sectors and because of their importance in the world economy.            "
"27","The English translation of the question that we asked to elicit support for sector‐specific trade protection in China was as follows:"
"28","                              "
"29","There is an industry in China in which the average worker makes X yuan per month. To increase the wages of workers in this industry, some people want the government to limit imports of foreign products in this industry. Others oppose these limits because such limits would raise prices that consumers pay and hurt other industries. Do you favor or oppose limiting the import of foreign products in this industry?"
"30","IF FAVOR: Do you strongly favor or only somewhat favor limiting the import of foreign products in this industry?"
"31","IF OPPOSE: Do you strongly oppose or only somewhat oppose limiting the import of foreign products in this industry?"
"32","An analogous question was posed to our U.S. sample.17 The value of X was assigned randomly across respondents to be equal to 800, 2,000, or 4,000 yuan per month in China and 18,000, 40,000, or 80,000 dollars per year in the United States.18 These values were chosen so that respondents were considering trade protection for low‐, average‐, and high‐wage industries. For example, in the United States, the low value of $18,000 corresponds to an income a bit higher than the total money income in 2007 for an adult who worked full‐time, year‐round at the 10th percentile in the income distribution.19 Alternatively, one can think about this low income amount as the wage earned by a worker who worked full‐time, year‐round at about $9.00 per hour or a bit higher than the minimum wage. The average value was selected as a round value close to the median total money income in 2007 for an adult who worked full‐time, year‐round of $41,245. Similarly, the high wage of $80,000 falls at about the 84th percentile in the total money income distribution in 2007. The values for China correspond to points in the 2007 monthly Chinese wage distribution similar to those used for the United States.1"
"33","It is important to compare the wording of our survey question to other questions examined in the literature on the determinants of trade policy opinions. This question asks respondents whether they favor new trade barriers for a single industry and consequently is more narrowly focused than typical question formats which elicit opinions about general trade policy across an entire economy. Moreover, although not stated explicitly, our wording implies that the industry in question is not the industry in which the respondent works. We chose our question wording to correspond with the empirical puzzle of this article, which is focused on the distribution of protection across industries and with our theoretical model, which assumes that income to workers and policy setting are both determined by industry."
"34","The marginal responses to this question are consistent with the intention to elicit support for sector‐specific trade policies. Specifically, respondents are much less likely to give a protectionist response when considering a single industry than when answering a question about general trade policy. This is most clearly the case for the United States, for which there is a long record of polling public opinion about trade policy. In our U.S. survey, just 30.9% of respondents favor new trade barriers while nearly 70% of respondents are opposed (44% favor limiting imports with 56% opposed in the Chinese data).22 This ratio of two‐to‐one against new sector‐specific trade barriers contrasts with responses to more general trade policy questions which, depending on question wording, tend to elicit anywhere from two‐to‐one support for further trade barriers to equal support and opposition to new barriers (see Scheve and Slaughter 2001b, chap. 2).            "
"35","Our first set of empirical results reports the basic findings from the experiment—that is, the effect of variation in the assumed average wage of the industry under consideration for trade protection on support for sector‐specific trade protection."
"36","We constructed two measures of support for new trade barriers based on responses to our question. Trade Opinion 1 is set equal to one for respondents who favor new trade barriers and is equal to zero for those opposed. Trade Opinion 2 is set equal to one for respondents who oppose new trade barriers strongly, two for respondents who oppose new trade barriers somewhat, three for respondents who favor new trade barriers somewhat, and four for those who favor new trade barriers strongly. Each of the measures is increasing in support for a protectionist policy.            "
"37","Table 1 reports the mean estimates for each treatment category and difference‐in‐means estimates for each combination of treatments. These results provide substantial evidence that support for sector‐specific trade barriers is influenced by the average wage of workers in the industry.            "
"38","For China, support for limiting the import of foreign products is 7 percentage points higher (a 16% increase) for respondents who considered protection for an industry with a low wage versus respondents who considered protection for an industry with an average wage. This difference was of a similar magnitude for respondents who considered protection for an industry with a low wage versus respondents who considered protection for an industry with a high wage. The results thus suggest for China a significant difference between respondents receiving the low‐wage treatment and both the middle‐ and high‐wage treatments, but no difference between the middle and high treatments."
"39","In the United States, the results are even more striking. Support for new trade barriers is 8 percentage points higher (a 26% increase) for respondents who considered protection for an industry with a low wage versus respondents who considered protection for an industry with an average wage. This difference was nearly 19 percentage points (an over 90% increase) for respondents who considered protection for an industry with a low wage versus respondents who considered protection for an industry with a high wage. The differences between the middle‐ and high‐wage treatments are also substantively and statistically significant. It is clear that support for sectoral trade protection is decreasing in the average wages of the sector under consideration."
"40","Table 2 reports estimates of the differences across our treatment categories controlling for various demographic characteristics of respondents and fixed effects for geographical location, industry of employment, and interviewer. This framework allows identification of the treatment effects within geographical location, industry, and other respondent characteristics. We estimate the following ordinary least squares regressions:               "
"41","The estimates reported in Table 2 closely mirror those discussed for Table 1 without control variables. For both countries, Model 1 excludes industry fixed effects and Model 2 includes them. For China, exposure to the Middle‐Wage Treatment decreased the probability of giving a protectionist response by about 7 percentage points compared to exposure to the Low‐Wage Treatment. This estimate is quite similar across Models 1 and 2. The estimated difference for the High‐Wage Treatment is between 5 and 6 percentage points across the two specifications. This again suggests that there is no difference between the middle‐ and high‐wage treatments. It is worth noting the stability of these estimates despite the fact that the specifications with industry fixed effects have many fewer observations because individuals not in the labor market cannot be coded for this variable. For the United States, the differences across the treatments are statistically and substantively significant across all combinations, and the magnitudes are quite close to those reported in Table 1.            "
"42","These experimental results in Tables 1 and 2 provide strong evidence that increasing the average wage of the industry under consideration for trade protection reduces support for new trade barriers in that industry. The random assignment of the treatments in the experiment makes us confident that these differences are not attributable to other characteristics of the respondents or other selection effects. The result further provides evidence for one possible explanation why low‐earning, less‐skilled industries tend to be more heavily protected across countries with different factor endowments and political institutions: citizens prefer to support the incomes of low‐wage sectors more than high‐wage sectors, and this preference is influential in the policy making process. More generally, this finding is consistent with our specific explanation why low‐earning, less‐skilled industries tend to be more heavily protected across lots of different countries: inequity‐averse citizens prefer to support the incomes of low‐wage sectors more than high‐wage sectors.            "
"43","This interpretation, however, should be made with some caution. First, these estimates do not provide direct evidence of inequity aversion as defined in our model, but rather are consistent with these mechanisms. Second, there may be alternative reasons why trade opinions vary with the average wage of the industry under consideration for protection. Some alternatives, while logically possible, seem unlikely. For example, one possibility is that respondents may be more concerned about the potential fiscal costs of job loss from import competition in terms of unemployment insurance, welfare, or other trade‐adjustment assistance in low‐wage sectors than in high‐wage sectors. This mechanism is, however, somewhat at odds with the fact that the relationship is observed in a country like China, which does not have generous unemployment compensation or trade‐adjustment assistance programs. Other alternative mechanisms, however, may be more difficult to rule out. For example, other forms of other‐regarding preferences distinct from inequity aversion might lead respondents to prefer lower‐paying sectors. Consequently, our interpretation of Tables 1 and 2 is that they report evidence consistent with our argument though there could be other related factors driving preferences in a similar direction. They do, nonetheless, constitute strong evidence that preferences may be important in accounting for the puzzle of low‐earning industries receiving more trade protection across many countries. We now turn to more direct evidence of inequity aversion in policy opinions about sectoral trade protection.            "
"44","To derive our statistical model for estimating the effect of inequity aversion on support for sector‐specific trade protection, we start with the individual indirect‐utility function in our model, equation (2), introduce an error term, , and specify its distribution. The error term should be thought to be composed primarily of those factors influencing opinion about sector‐specific trade protection not included in our model. We assume that  is normally distributed and that it enters the function additively.            "
"45","We further simplify our model in four ways. First, we omit the term  which represents per capita tariff revenues. This argument does not vary across individuals and so will be captured by the constant in our estimating equation. Second, the survey question forces respondents to focus on one industry at a time, and so we consider only income differences between the individual and the average worker in this industry. Consistent with the model, this assumes that changes in trade policy in one industry do not affect income in other industries. The focus on a single industry also allows us to drop the industry‐size parameter . Third, we omit the consumer surplus term, , as it is a function of individual utility from consumption and not directly measurable. This factor is moved to the error term, and we will use our experimental design to consistently estimate the model parameters despite its omission. Fourth, the term  is equal to the portion of individual 's income that varies across individuals/sectors and is denoted as  (and analogously for individual/sector ). The addition of the error term and these simplications yield:               "
"46","Let  be the utility to individual  from introducing new trade barriers and  be the utility to individual  from the status quo policy with no new trade barriers. We assume that our survey respondents answer our question favoring or opposing new trade barriers by selecting the policy option that yields the highest utility. Let . If , the individual favors new trade barriers and otherwise will be opposed. Further, let  if  and  otherwise.  is the difference between two normally distributed variables and is itself normally distributed. As such, the probability that an individual favors  or opposes  new trade barriers can be derived from the standard normal CDF. This yields:               "
"47","The variable Trade Opinion 1 described above is defined to follow this estimation framework and is set equal to one if the respondent favors new trade barriers and is set equal to zero if he or she is opposed. In both our surveys, we also measured annual personal income. In China, the survey instrument places individuals into one of 16 monthly personal income categories. We then defined the actual magnitude of each respondent's income as equal to the midpoint of the income range in which they placed themselves. This variable, Personal Income, serves as our measure of . For the United States, our survey assigned respondents to one of 19 annual personal‐income categories, and we constructed the variable Personal Income in the same way as for the China data. The variable Other Income is equal to treatments in our survey questions and takes on the three randomly assigned values of 800, 2,000, or 4,000 yuan in China and 18,000, 40,000, or 80,000 dollars in the United States. This variable serves as our measure of . We define the variable Disadvantageous Inequality equal to Other Income minus Personal Income if Other Income is greater than Personal Income and equal to zero if not. We define the variable Advantageous Inequality equal to Personal Income minus Other Income if Personal Income is greater than Other Income and equal to zero if not.28 Thus, we have measures of each argument in equation (6) and our initial estimating equation is:               "
"48","We estimate this equation as a probit model and report heteroskedastic‐consistent standard errors.29 The first key hypothesis from our model is that  because sector‐specific trade protection will raise the income of workers in that industry, reducing the utility of individuals who have lower incomes than the industry under consideration for trade protection. The second main hypothesis from our model is that  because sector‐specific trade protection will raise the income of workers in that industry, increasing the utility of individuals who have higher incomes than the industry under consideration for trade protection. In short, new trade barriers increase or decrease inequality depending on own income and thus the sign of our advantageous and disadvantageous inequality parameters, although both indicating a form of inequity aversion, are in opposite directions.30"
"49","Our initial specification follows directly from our theoretical framework. Given that our substantive interest is in estimating the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality parameters, it is important to note that this specification makes the usual strong identification assumptions of a cross‐sectional analysis. These assumptions would be violated if the model was incomplete and the omitted factors were correlated with Disadvantageous Inequality or Advantageous Inequality. Because Personal Income is a component of the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality variables, and because personal income and its correlates such as education have been shown to be associated with trade opinions, there is little doubt that the estimates in this baseline specification are biased.            "
"50","In a second, preferred specification, we add three additional controls. The first is Personal Income; the second is an indicator variable, Personal Income Greater, equal to one if the individual's Personal Income is greater than the Other Income treatment which he or she received; and the third is an interaction term between Personal Income Greater and Personal Income. This specification recognizes that the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality variables are a function of Personal Income, Other Income, and which one is greater than the other. The experimental treatments ensure that Other Income is randomly assigned across respondents, but Personal Income is not. However, once we control for Personal Income, Personal Income Greater, and their interaction, variation in the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality variables is driven exclusively by the random assignment of the Other Income treatments from the survey experiment. This specification has the substantial advantage of fully employing the experiment to identify our estimates of the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality parameters, and it yields consistent estimates of the parameters even if the model is incomplete.31 For this reason, although we report results for the initial specification, we focus attention on the models that include Personal Income, Personal Income Greater, and their interaction as controls.32 We also present additional results which add control variables to this second specification.            "
"51","Table 3 reports our main results for China. The estimates for Model 3 are for our initial specification, equation (7). The estimates for both inequity aversion parameters are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant. As discussed above, this specification follows from the theoretical model but is likely biased because although the Other Income component of Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality is randomly assigned, the Personal Income component is not. The Model 4 specification in Table 3 addresses this issue by adding the variables Personal Income, Personal Income Greater, and their interaction. Once we add these controls, variation in the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality variables is driven only by the random assignment of the Other Income treatments from the survey experiment, and so we can be confident our estimates are not biased by omitted unobserved factors influencing trade opinions.            "
"52","The estimates for Model 4 indicate that the estimates for both the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality parameters are correctly signed but that only the estimate for Advantageous Inequality is statistically and substantively significant (the probit coefficient estimate for  is 0.159 with a standard error of 0.055). This indicates that, all else equal, individuals with incomes greater than the income of the average worker in the industry under consideration for protection are more supportive of sector‐specific trade barriers, the greater their income is relative to the income of workers in the industry which may be protected. To get a sense of the magnitude of this effect, the impact of increasing the Advantageous Inequality measure from 0—the value assigned to the variable when the respondent has an income less than or equal to the average income in the industry under consideration for protection—to 2.68—a two standard deviation increase, equivalent to an income difference of 2,680 yuan—on the probability of supporting new trade barriers, holding all other variables at their means, is 0.165 (standard error of 0.057). This means that the probability of favoring new trade barriers increases 16.5 percentage points, which is over a 37% increase from the overall mean of the Trade Opinion 1 measure.33"
"53","Table 3 also reports two additional specifications which add various control variables to Model 4. The Model 5 specification adds the variables College Grad, Female, and Age defined above and fixed effects for geographical location and interviewer, while the Model 6 specification also adds fixed effects for industry of employment. Not surprisingly, given the design of the experiment, our estimates of the parameters  and  in Models 5 and 6 are quite similar to those reported for Model 4. Overall, the estimates in Table 3 provide robust evidence that in China, aversion to Advantageous Inequality has a positive effect on support for trade protection.34"
"54","Table 4 reports our main results for the United States. The estimates for Model 3 indicate negative and statistically significant coefficients for both the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality variables. The Disadvantageous Inequality result is consistent with our theoretical expectations, whereas the Advantageous Inequality estimate is not. However, as discussed in the results for China, this specification follows from the theoretical model but is likely biased given what we know about determinants of trade policy opinions and the assignment of the Personal Income component of the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality variables. The Model 4 specification in Table 4 addresses this potentional problem by adding the variables Personal Income, Personal Income Greater, and their interaction.            "
"55","The results for Model 4 indicate that the estimates for both the Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality parameters are correctly signed and statistically and substantively significant. The estimated probit coefficient, , for the variable Disadvantageous Inequality is equal to −0.010 with a standard error of 0.002. This indicates that, all else equal, individuals are less supportive of sector‐specific trade barriers, the greater the income of the average worker in the industry under consideration for protection relative to the survey respondent. The magnitude of this effect is substantial. To get a sense of the substantive magnitude of this estimate, the effect of increasing the Disadvantageous Inequality measure from 0—the value assigned to the variable when the respondent has an income greater than or equal to the average income in the industry under consideration for trade protection—to 48.8—a two standard deviation increase, equivalent to an income difference of $48,800—on the probability of supporting new trade barriers, holding all other variables at their means, is −0.163 (standard error of 0.025). This means that the probability of favoring new trade barriers falls 16.3 percentage points, which is almost a 53% decrease from the overall mean of the Trade Opinion 1 measure.            "
"56","The estimated probit coefficient, , for the variable Advantageous Inequality is equal to 0.010 with a standard error of 0.004. The magnitude of this effect is also substantively significant. The effect of increasing the Advantageous Inequality measure from 0—the value assigned to the variable when the respondent has an income less than or equal to the average income in the industry under consideration for trade protection—to 48.4—a two standard deviation increase, equivalent to an income difference of $48,400—on the probability of supporting new trade barriers, holding all other variables at their means, is 0.182 (standard error of 0.065). This means that the probability of favoring new trade barriers increases 18.2 percentage points, which is about a 59% increase from the overall mean of the Trade Opinion 1 measure.            "
"57","Table 4 also reports two additional specifications which add various control variables to Model 4. The Model 5 specification adds the variables College Grad, Female, and Age defined above and fixed effects for the state of the respondent. The Model 6 specification also adds fixed effects for industry of employment.35 Our estimates of the parameters  and  are quite similar to those reported for Model 4. So although education and sex influence trade opinions, their inclusion makes little difference for our estimates because conditional on Personal Income, Personal Income Greater, and their interaction, variation in Disadvantageous Inequality and Advantageous Inequality is randomly assigned and thus uncorrelated with our measures of education, sex, or any other determinants of trade opinion. Overall, the estimates in Table 4 provide robust evidence that aversion to advantageous and disadvantageous inequality has an important effect on support for trade protection in our U.S. data.36"
"58","Taken together, the results in both China and the United States strongly support the overall argument of this article. One reason that lower‐earning sectors receive more trade protection around the world may be that citizens support trade protection more for low‐earning sectors. This support could obviously be influential in a democratic setting, but it could also be influential in an environment in which special interests dominate—whether it be in a democratic or nondemocratic regime. Furthermore, when we combine our model with our experiment, our empirical results are consistent with inequity aversion, accounting for why individuals are more supportive of protection for lower‐earning sectors."
"59","Trade and economic policy making more generally foment so much political activity and theatre because of the significant distributional consequences at stake. One important class of explanations for why governments adopt policies that support the incomes of some citizens but not others is that these policies reflect the preferences of particular actors—voters, industry lobbies, politicians, etc.—in the policy making process. An essential element of any explanation of policy outcomes is what accounts for the preferences of the relevant actors. In trade and virtually all areas of economic policy making, self‐interest—how policy affects an individual's economic welfare—is a compelling place to start in explaining support for policy alternatives."
"60","Nonetheless, this does not preclude the possibility that economic policy preferences are also influenced by other‐regarding preferences. Our article investigates the possibility that social concerns influence policy opinions in trade, an important area of economic policy making, and that these preferences may help explain outcomes not easily accounted for by existing theories."
"61","Specifically, we address the question of why in so many countries lower‐earning, less‐skilled intensive industries receive relatively high levels of trade protection. What is especially puzzling is that this pattern of protection holds even in low‐income countries, for which lower‐earning and less‐skilled intensive industries are likely to be comparative advantage industries and therefore would be expected in many standard political‐economy frameworks to receive relatively low, not high, levels of protection."
"62","We offer an explanation of this puzzle: individual preferences that display inequity aversion. Under a variety of models of the policy making process, inequity aversion on the part of individual citizens would make it more likely that governments favor lower‐earning, less‐skilled intensive industries in setting trade policy. To provide evidence in support of our explanation, we analyze policy preferences in national samples of citizens in China and the United States. First, we show that preferences aggregated across all respondents in each country vary systematically with the treatment income of industry workers: industries with lower‐income workers receive broader support for trade protection. Second, we derive from our model and estimate an equation for policy preferences, and we find that individuals exhibit aversion to advantageous and disadvantageous inequality. Econometrically identifying these preferences lends considerable support to our explanation of the trade policy puzzle and suggests that social concerns as well as self‐interest influence opinion formation about trade policy. It will be important in future research to extend the empirical analysis to test more directly the influence that the social preferences that we document in this article have on the policymaking process generally and on the distribution of trade protection across sectors specifically."
"63","In addition to contributing to the trade policy literature, our article provides a new methodology for investigating the role of inequity aversion in determining policy preferences. This general strategy could be applied to many other areas of economic policymaking for which inequity aversion may be influential in opinion formation. Our findings for trade policy recommend greater attention to social concerns across many areas of economic policymaking."
