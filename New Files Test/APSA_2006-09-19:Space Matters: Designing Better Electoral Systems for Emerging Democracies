"1","This article addresses two related problems posed by these examples. The first is how to consider the impact of the spatial concentration or dispersion of the vote—because space matters. Three factors or groups of variables determine the outcomes for most legislative elections: (1) the voting decision—who voted for whom and the variables driving that decision including (but not limited to) considerations of strategic coordination; (2) the electoral system—the rules and procedures for translating votes into seats; and (3) the spatial distribution of individual voting preferences by party and the geographic locations of the boundaries of such electoral districts that constitute the system. The political science literature has focused overwhelmingly on the impact of the first and second of these factors as well as the interactive effects of the two. However, little attention has been given to the interactive effects between the first and the third and between the second and the third as determinants of electoral outcomes. With the exceptions of Altman (1998) and Altman, MacDonald, and MacDonald (2005, 2006) and practitioners working on redistricting plans within the United States, this is still new territory for political scientists, especially political scientists concerned with issues of electoral system design in emerging democracies.         "
"2","Conversely, although the literature on political geography has long addressed the spatial distribution of the vote and its relationship to the voting decision (Gudgin and Taylor 1979; Johnston, Shelley, and Taylor 1990; O'Loughlin 1982; Taylor and Johnston 1979), it has also largely failed to systematically examine the interactive effects between the spatial distribution of the vote and the type of electoral system. A few political geographers (Agnew 1996; Johnston, Rossiter, and Pattie 2005) have begun to address this relationship, but here too the analysis has not been focused on the choice of electoral systems in new democratizers.         "
"3","The second and related problem is how to facilitate the participation by political leaders and concerned citizens in the design of their electoral system by enabling these actors to compare the likely outcomes and impact of alternative methods for translating votes into seats. Different systems may or may not lead to significantly different outcomes in terms of the number of seats won by each party, but they do have different outcomes with respect to the way individual voters relate to their elected representatives.         "
"4","This article seeks to explore these relationships by modeling the outcomes from alternative forms of potential electoral systems using electoral data coded to account for the geographic location—and thus the spatial concentration or dispersion—of the vote at the micro (e.g., precinct/voting area) level. In modeling these outcomes, we present a methodology, known as a spatial decision support system or SDSS, that could facilitate electoral system design by key elites and an informed public. We then apply the SDSS to model alternative electoral systems for Kenya and South Africa, two emerging democracies where electoral outcomes are significantly affected by the geographic distribution of the vote by party and where there is dissatisfaction with the existing electoral system. By considering the significance of the spatial distribution of the vote, the SDSS both addresses a neglected area of inquiry and informs the political process. The SDSS has both analytic (i.e., explanatory) and practical significance.         "
"5","While key actors in most democratizing polities outside Eastern Europe and southern Africa have been seemingly indifferent to the choice of electoral system, those who have written on the subject have largely ignored the distinctive features of these polities. As noted above, the literature, with few exceptions, is not addressed to or based on the electoral experience of contemporary democratizers, over half of which are plural and agrarian societies. Lijphart's landmark analysis (1994) is particularly wanting in this regard. Only two of the 27 democracies considered by Lijphart are developing countries; none are Third Wave democratizers.         "
"6","Nor, with few exceptions (Birch 2003; Grofman, Handley, and Neimi 1992; Moser 1999; Rae 1971), does the literature consider the interactive effects between alternative forms of electoral systems and the spatial distribution of the vote for different political parties.3 Moreover, none of these studies employ an SDSS to capture the geographic location of voter preferences at the micro level.         "
"7","Lijphart's analysis is also wanting on this consideration. His analysis of the determinants of proportionality and the number of effective legislative parties generated by different electoral systems is limited mainly to the impact of four variables: the electoral formula, district magnitude, legal threshold, and assembly size (Lijphart 1994, 13). No mention is made of the geographic properties of the vote, although the degree to which the vote for each political party is concentrated or dispersed greatly affects the level of disproportionality in district‐based electoral systems.         "
"8","Similarly, Cox (1997), in his study of the interaction between electoral institutions and strategic coordination by voters and party leaders, does not consider the interactions between strategic coordination, institutions, and the spatial distribution of the vote. But this important variable reflects the identities and political interests of voters that shape their voting decisions.         "
"9"," Mozaffar, Scarritt, and Galaich (2003) hint at the significance of the spatial distribution of the vote in their exploration of the joint impact of ethnic concentration, ethnic fragmentation, and district magnitude on the number of effective electoral and legislative parties across Africa. Their study captures both the impact of mobilized as distinct from nonmobilized ethnic groups and whether these groups are present across small to large geographic areas, but it does not directly assess the impact of the spatial distribution of voter preferences.         "
"10","Consideration of the spatial distribution of the vote is especially important for (but not limited to) the design of electoral systems for plural and agrarian societies. Geography matters more in these societies, because voters are rooted to the land and the local communities to which they belong. They develop primordial ties and identify strongly with their place of residence and the characteristics shared with fellow community members (e.g., ethnicity, language, race, religion, etc.). Not surprisingly, candidates and parties seek to mobilize the electorate on the basis of these affinities with the result that different parties draw their support from different areas."
"11","Voters and parties in developing countries are thus more likely to differentiate themselves on the basis of geographic location than voters in industrial and post‐industrial societies where considerations of place, ethnicity, and language are less important.4 In this context, or in industrial societies where there is a significant spatial concentration of the vote, considerations of strategic coordination are not greatly affected by the type of electoral system voters face—voters support the local party or national coalition of such parties that best reflects their local interests regardless of whether they vote in a majoritarian or PR system. In such situations, both voters and parties act “strategically” (i.e., in their interests), but Duverger's “law” does not apply.         "
"12","We now model the outcomes from the interactions between alternative electoral systems and the spatial distribution of the vote by presenting the computational method that is the SDSS (Rushton 2001). We first discuss the methodology that constitutes the SDSS and then apply the method to Kenya and South Africa—two emerging democracies where the interaction between the electoral system and the spatial distribution of the vote has resulted in considerable dissatisfaction and thus demands modifying or redesigning the current system.         "
"13","The SDSS method joins Geographic Information System (GIS) technology with a location‐allocation model. The SDSS permits the user to create and visually display the outcomes of any form of district‐based electoral system with the exception of the single transferable vote according to one or more specified criteria. In this formulation, we present an SDSS that creates a system of n districts by maximizing for the equality of populations across all districts while minimizing the loss of geographic compactness weighted for population density. We maximize for the equality of populations to best realize the democratic principle that all citizens should have equal representation in the national legislature. We minimize for the loss of geographic compactness on the assumption that the more compact an electoral district, the more likely its inhabitants will share common attributes and interests that will be reflected by their elected representatives."
"14","When the SDSS is applied to a dataset consisting of a large number of very small areas (e.g., voting areas or census enumeration areas) for which the geographic location (longitude and latitude) and population are known, the SDSS configures and reconfigures subsets of contiguous (i.e., adjacent) areas into the specified number of electoral districts that maximizes for the equality of populations. When the dataset is augmented by the results from a recent election, including the number of votes obtained by each party in each voting area, it is also possible to total the votes by party for each new electoral district configured by the SDSS and thus estimate the likely electoral outcome for each district and for the system (i.e., country, state, or province) as a whole. By changing the number of districts to be configured by the SDSS, the district magnitude, and the extent to which seats ascribed to districts are supplemented by some number of seats allocated on the basis of PR, it is possible to model and compare the outcomes of almost any form of district‐based system of representation. Alternative approaches to modeling the spatial patterns of electoral districts are reviewed in Macmillan and Pierce (1994), Williams (1995), George, Lamar, and Wallace (1997), and Altman (1998).         "
"15","Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) are computer systems for simultaneously exploring the spatial (i.e., geographic) characteristics and the attribute characteristics of possible solutions to a defined problem. In this case the electoral districts and their boundaries are the spatial characteristics of interest and their attribute characteristics are their populations and voting preferences. The theory behind the SDSS is that decision makers often want to explore alternative solutions and to reach a decision about the “best” or most acceptable solution only after extensive examination of the characteristics of the spatial and the attribute characteristics of alternative solutions. It is well‐known that a decision maker's preferences for a particular solution to a problem may be influenced by its characteristics in a particular context. Decision support systems are designed to facilitate the exploration of these alternatives using GIS in real geographical contexts and thus to assist decision makers in their search for the best solutions to their problems. Users of an SDSS decide which criteria are to be maximized and make decisions about any constraints that should apply to any solution. Even after making these decisions, however, they may choose not to accept the results over concerns about whether the solution is acceptable to themselves or to others.         "
"16","In an SDSS for electoral districting, typical criteria are the number of districts to be formed, the average number of people in each district—the target population— and the variability of these totals among districts. Typical constraints concern political boundaries (e.g., state or provincial boundaries) or natural features that the districts formed should not straddle. As with any constraint, the ability to optimize any criteria may be adversely affected by the given constraint. The cost of the constraint is typically measured by the SDSS as the difference in criteria values after solving the problem with and without the given constraint."
"17","The electoral districting problem is represented in the SDSS as a location‐allocation model. Such models developed mainly in the field of operations research and management sciences are generally used to find optimal locations and surrounding catchment areas for various types of facilities (e.g., hospitals, schools, shopping centers, etc.). They have, however, evolved to become the model of choice for a very wide range of location and regionalization (i.e., districting) problems (Brandeau and Chiu 1989; Densham and Rushton 1996).         "
"18","The model presented in this article differs from conventional mathematical optimization algorithms in that it is designed to create diferent but good solutions as the parameters in the model are changed and to allow its user to force or forbid particular combinations of small areas to be joined in any given solution. For many practical redisticting applications, these features are important. Often there are topographical features (e.g., mountains, lakes, rivers) or political boundaries that need to be respected—electoral districts should not traverse them as illustrated later in Figures 6, 7, and 8. The ability to produce good but different regionalizations gives choice to the user. Most redistricting algorithms produce unique solutions and do not permit the user to control the resulting districts to accommodate these circumstances.         "

"22","A location‐allocation model selects locations and spatial allocations (regions) to optimize a defined function (Ghosh and Rushton 1987). The name “location‐allocation” for this model captures the traditional method for optimizing the chosen function, which consists of the application of two technical methods. The first finds the optimal locations of centers to serve a defined number of surrounding regions or districts. The second optimizes the specification of boundaries to define the allocation of adjacent areas to each center and thus establish each surrounding district. In the electoral districting problem the location of centers is an implicit objective since its solution guarantees contiguity and compactness to the districts formed—both necessary characteristics of most acceptable districting solutions. The key components of a location‐allocation problem are         "

"29","An important development in location‐allocation modeling was the recognition that many different functions could be optimized using the same algorithm, providing the new problem could be expressed as a special case of the unified linear model or ULM (Church 1999; Church and ReVelle 1976; Hillsman 1984).         "
"30","The ULM is defined as minimize "
"31","i = 1, 2, . . n (i is the identification of the small areas included in the regions where n is the total number of small areas)"
"32","j = 1, 2, . . p (j is drawn from n and where p = number of regions, i.e., districts)."
"33","In the ULM, the variable “cij” is defined to accomplish the objectives of the model. In this case, we define cij to ensure that the districts established by the model are as close to population equality as possible while minimizing for the loss of spatial compactness. These conditions are met when the value of z is least. cij is thus the cost (in the objective function) of serving the ith area from the jth regional center. xij is the decision variable: xij= 1, when the ith area is assigned to the jth regional center, otherwise xij= 0. In every solution each ith area belongs to one and only one region. We define cij for any ith area as a function of its contribution to meeting the target population value in the jth spatial allocation region, i.e., the constituency or electoral district to be established with this population. This definition of cij is our novel contribution to solving this problem. We define this more formally below, but, intuitively, we begin the explanation by noting that if the addition of the population of the ith area to the region served by the jth regional center brings the population of the region closer to its target population value, cij is small. However, when adding the same area to the region brings the region to exceed its target, cij is large. Since allocations are made by the algorithm to minimize the function z, it will attempt to form regions from cij values that are small. Consequently, these regions will be geographically compact and their populations should be close to the target population.         "
"34","To ensure that the cij values result in districts with the desired characteristics, we define eight parameters of a function g (popj) as presented in Figure 1. popj is the cumulative population of a region centered on the jth area that includes the population of all i areas in order of their distance from the jth location; thus cij= g (popj). The parameter g (measured along the vertical axis of Figure 1), g > 0, is a scalar that weights the population of any ith area relative to the expectation that it should belong to the jth region if the jth area is the base for an electoral region centered on it. It follows that the contribution of any ith area to the objective function is different depending on whether it makes the jth electoral district meet the target population or exceed it. In circumstances where adding the ith area to the jth electoral district leads to the jth region exceeding the target value, the contribution to the objective function is large. The values of g (popj)—shown on the vertical axis of Figure 1—are calculated using the four formulae shown in Figure 1. The lower three formulae constrain the values of g(popj) to the ranges of 0 < g(popj) <= a, a < g(popj) <= b, and b < g(popj) <= c, respectively. These increasing levels of “cost” are designed to force the algorithm to establish regions that meet the desired conditions of equality of populations while minimizing for the loss of compactness in shape. The fourth formula, however, provides only a lower bound for the value of g(popj), and the value of g(popj) continues to increase as additions of population to the jth district move its cumulative population further above the target population. Values of g(popj) > b in Figure 1 are clearly penalties the algorithm incurs for producing electoral regions that exceed the target electoral population size.         "
"35","                 Definition of cij in the Unified Linear Model.                                                   cij= g(popj)                                                 "
"36","The computer program we used to implement this algorithm is in two parts. The first algorithm computes cij values as a function of the parameters that define g. In determining the function g(popj), eight parameters are needed (Figure 1): the target population of each constituency (s); three inflection points on the function g (p, q and r), and four values of the electoral population size (a, b, c, and d) at which the slope of the function g(popj) changes. The eight parameters must be selected carefully if the electoral regions are to achieve their target populations.         "
"37","The second part is a location‐allocation algorithm that operates on the cij values discussed above, the GRIA algorithm (Global‐Regional‐Interchange Algorithm) (Densham and Rushton 1992a, 1992b), which has the same properties at termination as the well‐known heuristic algorithm by Teitz and Bart (1968). The GRIA algorithm is implemented in the Network module of ArcINFO (ESRI 2005) and the PC software suite LADSS by Densham (1992, 1994). We used both software programs in this study. The implementation of area‐specific constraints is accomplished in the SDSS by editing the “distance strings” in the spatial data matrix (Densham and Rushton 1992a, 292, 297). Examples of the use of this feature might be to force selected boundaries between districts for topographical or political reasons or to require particular areas to be included in the same district.         "
"38","In Kenya, the problem is with an electoral system of 210 single‐member districts that vary greatly in population from 3,600 to nearly 301,600 around a mean population of 102,300. The present system violates the democratic principle of one person one vote and systematically overrepresents the most sparsely populated areas of the country where the population per district is far below the mean population of 102,300—across the north, in the eastern third of the country, in the Rift Valley, and in the south along Kenya's border with Tanzania."
"39","This pattern of overrepresentation dates back to the period immediately prior to independence when the British colonial government demarcated parliamentary constituencies for the first time and purposely drew the boundaries to represent “communities of interest” in these areas rather than collectivities of equal populations. The residents of these constituencies constitute the ethnic homelands of those groups that long supported the Kenya Africa National Union (KANU), the ruling party of Kenya from independence in 1963 through 2002. Conversely, the most populous areas of the country are the homelands of groups that have voted for one of six opposition parties. Not surprisingly, opposition leaders regarded the continuation of the present system as unfair."
"40","In 1992, Kenya held its first multiparty elections in 26 years and reverted, without debate, to the electoral system inherited at independence. Multiparty elections were held again in 1997 using the same system albeit for an additional 22 seats. Kenya is currently conducting a comprehensive review of its constitution, including its electoral system. For the first time the choice of electoral system is the subject of debate. Many now call for a new reapportionment and/or a switch to some form of PR or mixed‐member proportional system.5"
"41"," Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the boundaries of the present electoral districts, the extent to which their populations are over‐ or underrepresented, and the party that won each constituency in the 1997 election.

"45","Although Kenya's current districts greatly over‐ and underrepresent the people of different areas, the system receives a moderately low score on the Gallagher Index of Disproportionality of 6.9 (Gallagher 1991). This is because of the high spatial concentration of the vote for each party and reflects an overall pattern of different parties representing different ethnic groups or ethnic coalitions and the geographic areas in which these groups reside. In the 1997 elections, the average percentage of the vote obtained by winning candidates was 65% even though there was an average of 4.4 candidates in each constituency. The margin of victory for winning candidates also exceeded 10% of the vote in 96% of the races.         "
"46","The SDSS models alternative electoral systems for Kenya by evaluating population data and voting returns by party for 3,715 sublocations, the smallest administrative area. The population data for this analysis are from the 1989 census, the only data published at the time the dataset was assembled.6 Voting data are from the 1997 parliamentary elections.7Figure 5 indicates the boundaries of the sublocations.         "

"48","We first apply the SDSS to model a new set of 210 constituencies that maximize for equal populations in all districts. The result is presented in Figure 6 and can be compared with the present constituencies in Figure 2. This solution substantially reduces the problem of districts with unequal populations as depicted in Figure 7.8 It also reduces the number of seats won by the ruling party to 103 as shown in Figure 8—though not by as large a number as one might expect. While the opposition parties gain six seats in the most populous regions, they lose two in northeastern and eastern Kenya where the populations of all districts are increased. The index of disproportionality is also reduced, albeit marginally, to 6.2. The result, however, suggests that in countries where the spatial concentration of the vote is high, the more equal the districts in terms of population, the more proportional the electoral system.         "
"49","As stated above, the SDSS can be used to model any district‐based electoral system of any number of constituencies. Suppose, therefore, that Kenya's political leaders wish to consider enlarging the National Assembly to 350 seats by increasing the number of constituencies while maximizing for equality of population. Such an option would obviously reduce the size and population of each district and better address the criterion of representing “communities of interest,” including those in sparsely populated areas. It would also confirm Rae's original finding (Rae 1967)—albeit in the context of an agrarian society—that an increase in assembly size also increases the level of proportionality in district‐based systems as the index of disproportionality drops to 3.2."
"50","Other options discussed in Kenya have been the election of the National Assembly by a “parallel” system or a “mixed‐member proportional” (MMP) system. One version of a parallel system would be to keep the membership of the legislature at its current size of 222 MPs with half being elected from 111 single‐member districts and half, i.e., 111, being elected by PR. One version of an MMP system would be also to maintain the current size of the legislature, but allocate the 111 seats in a compensatory manner to ensure proportional results overall as in the German system. A second MMP proposal would be to keep the present 210 constituencies, but achieve proportionality by supplementing the results with 90 or 100 seats allocated on a compensatory basis to achieve the results that would be obtained through PR.9"
"51","Yet another option would be to create an upper house of 75 members where the district would be drawn to maximize geographical compactness rather than equality of populations—two options that dramatically increase the level of disproportionality to 19.2 and further confirm Rae's thesis. Space does not permit us to present the maps of these alternatives. However, the likely results for all these options as generated by the SDSS in comparison are summarized in Table 1. Maps for these options (in color) are also available at http://www.uiowa.edu/spacematters.         "
"52","The “spatial problem” in South Africa is different yet also addressed by the SDSS. As noted above, South Africa adopted a form of closed‐list PR that critics view as problematic, because citizens residing in a given area are unable to hold a specific MP accountable to their community. The severity of this problem is detailed in a recent survey of South African adults where only .2% of all respondents stated that they had ever met with a member of parliament or attended a meeting that featured MPs, a figure much lower than in African countries with single‐member district systems of representation (Mattes 2002; http://www.afrobarometer.org).         "
"53","South Africa is an example of an emerging democracy that held its founding election in 1994 and its second and third national elections in 1999 and 2004 using PR, but which eventually may change its electoral system. The leaders of the present parties like PR, but acknowledge that PR undermines the level of direct communication between MPs and senior members of the government and the electorate. Indeed, as early as 1994, the major parties agreed that their MPs should be assigned to “informal constituencies” consisting of geographic areas that they would then “represent” and that all MPs would henceforth receive a monthly stipend from the National Assembly to offset travel costs to these areas. South Africa has thus sought to overcome one of the major downsides of PR by supplementing the existing system with a postelection “shadow” form of district representation."
"54","South Africa employs a “two‐tier” system of PR and the Droop formula to allocate seats in the National Assembly. Of the 400 seats in the Assembly, 200 are allocated to parties on the basis of their proportions of the total national vote, and 200 are allocated on the basis of their proportions of the vote in each of South Africa's nine provinces. Apart from the provinces, there are no electoral districts."
"55","We apply the SDSS to population and electoral data for the most populous province, Gauteng, to demonstrate again the range of outcomes arising from the interaction between the form of electoral system and the spatial distribution of the vote.10 Gauteng Province is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and includes both Johannesburg, the country's most populous city and its commercial capital, and Pretoria, the seat of government. Both cities are divided and surrounded by a mixture of suburbs and townships created during the apartheid era, and thus still largely populated by a single racial and/or ethnic group (i.e., Africans, coloureds, white English speakers, white Afrikans speakers). The result is high spatial concentrations of people with similar characteristics and a high spatial concentration of the vote for contesting parties—the African townships voting over 90% for the African National Congress, the white suburbs voting for the Democratic Party (now the Democratic Alliance) and the former National Party.         "
"56","The province elects 92 members of the National Assembly—46 at the provincial level, and the equivalent of 46 as a function of its share of the national vote. In the 1999 election the African National Congress (ANC) won 68.2% of the vote in the province, the Democratic Party (DP) won 17.2%, the former National Party (NP) won 3.8%, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) 3.5%, and the Freedom Front (FF) 1.1%. All other parties obtained .6% or less of the vote."
"57","As in Kenya, our data consist of population figures and voting returns for a large number of small spatial units for which the geographical location is known—in this instance the 1,837 voting districts within the province. Space does not permit the presentation of a series of maps similar to those for Kenya, and we therefore move directly to a comparison of the outcomes from the current system of list PR with those of seven alternatives as presented in Table 2. We thus used the SDSS to model the election of 92 members to the National Assembly from (1) a single‐member district system consisting of 92 constituencies, (2) a parallel system of 46 single‐member districts and 46 seats allocated by PR, (3) a mixed‐member proportional system of 46 single‐member districts and 46 seats allocated by PR to achieve proportionality overall, (4) a system of 12 multimember districts each with seven or eight seats depending on its population, (5) a system of 18 multimember districts of five or six seats, (6) a system of 23 multimember districts of three to five seats each, (7) a multimixed‐member proportional system consisting of 23 multimember districts of two to four seats each and 23 seats allocated to achieve proportionality overall. Because the Droop method is used under the current system, the same method was used to allocate seats for each multimember district defined by the SDSS. Each of these systems, regardless of number of districts, was modeled to maximize for the equality of populations across districts. The accompanying maps for each of these alternative systems are also available at http://www.uiowa.edu/spacematters.         "
"58","As indicated by the table, only two parties, the ANC and the DP, are able to win a plurality or majority of the vote in a system consisting only of single‐member districts—even when there are as many as 92 districts, the largest number permissible given the present size of the National Assembly. Without a parallel or supplementary application of PR, smaller parties do not gain representation. Not surprisingly, the Index of Disproportionality score is moderately high at 10.2. A multimember system of 23 districts would have provided seats to two additional parties, the NP and the IFP, and lowered the index of disproportionality significantly to 6.4. South Africa's constitution, however, requires the adherence to the principle of proportional representation. The current electoral system succeeds in meeting this criteria with a disproportionality score of .8.11 Were South Africa to adopt a district‐based system it would have to adopt one of two subtypes of a mixed‐member proportional (MMP) system—one that combines some number of seats elected from single‐member districts with some number of seats allocated to achieve PR overall or one that combines multimember districts with supplemental PR. This second option was recently recommended by an Electoral Task Team appointed by the South African Ministry of Home Affairs (Mattes and Southall 2004; Slabbert 2003).         "
"59","The interactive effects arising from the choice of electoral system and the spatial distribution of the vote have profound implications for the sustainability of many Third Wave democracies, yet the literature has largely ignored the fact that “space matters” in these polities. The extent to which the vote by party is spatially concentrated or dispersed greatly affects electoral outcomes and the level of disproportionality in systems with low‐district magnitude. This in turn impacts on the nature of strategic coordination by both voters and party leaders prior to the election. The spatial distribution of the vote also impacts on the relationship between citizens and their elected representatives following elections where district magnitude is high, as it is under PR. These considerations are particularly important in recent democratizers, many of which are agrarian and plural societies where most voters define their political identities in terms of their place of residence. The stakes are high in these fragile democracies, and the failure to design and adopt electoral systems that account for these realities lowers the prospects for democracy over the long term."
"60","The choice of electoral systems for these countries, however, has rarely been informed by the systematic review of the likely outcomes of alternative systems, including the impact of the interactive effects between the choice of system and the spatial distribution of the vote. The development of an SDSS, such as the one presented in this article, addresses these shortcomings, and is superior to other computational models used for regionalization problems for the reasons discussed. At an analytic level, the SDSS facilitates a comparison of different types of electoral systems while controlling for the spatial distribution of the vote. At an operational level, the SDSS can facilitate negotiations among key elites to arrive at a choice of system that is deemed appropriate for any country. The SDSS can also inform and facilitate citizen input, and perhaps raise the level of legitimacy for this basic component of the democratic process."
