"1","We first consider the question: should we actually expect citizens to update their perceptions of parties’ Left‐Right positions in response to political elites’ policy statements? More specifically, given that our empirical measure of the Left‐Right tone of party policy statements is based on content analyses of their election manifestos,4 we ask: should we expect voters’ perceptions of parties’ ideologies to vary with the Left‐Right tone of the statements in these manifestos? We believe this is an interesting question, because there are considerations that point in conflicting directions. The two considerations that suggest that voters will indeed react to parties’ election manifestos are as follows. First, parties typically publish their manifestos in the run‐up to the national election campaign, and previous studies find that voters display heightened interest in (and awareness of) political information that appears around the time of a national election. In particular, Andersen, Tilley, and Heath (2005) report analyses of the British electorate over the period 1992–2002 that demonstrate that citizens’ information about the parties’ policy positions peaked around the times of the national elections held during this period (1992, 1997, 2002).5 Andersen, Tilley, and Heath's findings support the arguments presented by Gelman and King (1993), that citizens become more enlightened during the course of national election campaigns due to the intensity of political media coverage during these periods, and also because citizens are especially motivated to seek out political information during election campaigns. Thus, while only a fraction of rank‐and‐file voters presumably read the parties’ election manifestos, we might expect citizens to be especially attentive to media coverage of these manifestos because they are published near the time of national elections (see Topf 1994).         "
"2","Second, although there is no extant study that analyzes whether the policy statements in parties’ election manifestos match their statements in other campaign forums (i.e., political advertisements, candidates’ speeches, etc.), we conducted interviews with 26 party elites from Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria during the summer of 2008, in which these elites stated that their parties make determined efforts to campaign based on their policy manifestos.6 This is important because it suggests that parties’ manifesto‐based policy statements roughly reflect the policies they communicate to the public via other avenues, such as campaign advertisements, party elites’ campaign speeches, and media interviews. Typical were the following exchanges:         "
"3","                        "
"4","Q: Does the election campaign usually follow what the election manifesto says?"
"5","A: It is very important to have, within the party, and also with the local members … to have a view and an awareness of issues which are important for us and for our voters. And they have to be in everything we do. So, they have to be central points in our election programs and in our materials and in speeches on television and things like that.7"
"6","Q: And how much do you think the election manifesto and the issues in the election manifesto stay the same for the CDA during the electoral campaign? Is it the basis for the campaign or does it change a lot?"
"7","A: No, no, it is [the basis for the campaign]. We have some essential, very important parts of the party program which are fundamental for the image of the CDA. … So, the issues in the party program are image‐building issues. So, there is a lot in the manifestos and there are some things which are fundamental for our image.8"
"8","Q: So, how much do you think the election program is reflected in the electoral campaign? Because, nobody in the public really reads the election program, so do you think that the party closely follows the election program?"
"9","A: It's not true that nobody reads the manifesto. We’ve had, sometimes we’ve had more than 100,000 copies of the manifesto that were distributed. … And of course the party activists read it. The manifesto basically is an outline of the kinds of arguments that we do share so it basically harmonizes the message of the party.9"
"10","While the considerations discussed above suggest reasons why citizens’ perceptions of party ideologies may track the statements in parties’ election manifestos, other considerations cast doubt on parties’ abilities to shape their policy images via their campaign‐based policy statements. First, there is extensive empirical research that argues that large segments of the mass public are inattentive to and uninformed about political issues (e.g., Converse 1964; Zaller 1992), so that even if the electorate is relatively more politically informed around the time of national elections—as the studies discussed earlier suggest—significant segments of the electorate may nevertheless be inattentive to campaign‐based media coverage of parties’ policy statements. Second, a separate strand of research suggests reasons why even those voters who register the parties’ shifting policy statements may resist updating their perceptions of parties’ positions: specifically, this research documents assimilation/contrast effects whereby voters align their current perceptions of the parties’ positions with their preexisting political loyalties (see, e.g., Achen and Bartels 2006; Gerber and Green 1999).         "
"11","There are additional reasons why political parties may face difficulties in shaping their policy images via their campaign‐based policy statements. Parties’ new policy pronouncements often provoke rival party elites to publicly deride the focal party's new initiatives as being “opportunistic,”“pandering,”“insincere,”“unrealistic,” and so on, and these characterizations may confuse voters about the focal party's actual policy intentions. Furthermore, members of the news media may weigh in with commentary about whether the focal party's new policy initiatives represent a “tactical” change in strategy as opposed to a fundamental change in policy direction; whether the policy shift is permanent or whether it merely represents a temporary victory for one of the party's factions; and whether, in the event the party enters the government, the party's leaders will have the resolve to actually push through the policy reforms they have advocated while in opposition (see, e.g., Stokes 2001). In addition, during national election campaigns both the media and opposing parties may emphasize aspects of the focal party's policy program that differ from the planks that the party itself prefers to emphasize, i.e., parties cannot unilaterally set the “terms of the debate” for the election campaign via their policy statements.         "
"12","We require longitudinal measurements of the Left‐Right tone of party policy statements along with voters’ perceptions of the parties’ positions in order to analyze whether parties’ policy images shift along with their policy statements. Our measures of the Left‐Right tone of parties’ policy statements are based on the Comparative Manifesto Project's (CMP) Left‐Right codings of the parties’ election manifestos (Budge et al. 2001). These manifestos are typically published in the run‐up to the national election, and, as discussed above, our elite interviews suggest that parties use these manifestos as the basis for their subsequent election campaigns. The procedures used to map parties’ policy positions from their election programs are described in detail in several of the CMP‐related publications, so that we only briefly review the process here.10 The coders match up quasi‐sentences in the policy program with a category of policy (e.g., welfare, defense, law and order, etc.) and take the percentages of each category as a measure of the party's priorities. Based on the mixture of policy priorities, the authors develop an index that measures the overall ideology for the program of each party in each election year. The ideological scores range from −100 to +100, with higher scores denoting a more right‐wing emphasis. We have rescaled the CMP party scores to a 1–10 Left‐Right scale, so that the range of these scores matches that of the voters’ perceptions of the parties’ Left‐Right positions (described below). We label the CMP‐based codings of party manifestos as the party's stated position.11"
"13","Our measures of parties’ policy images, i.e., of voters’ subjective perceptions of the parties’ Left‐Right positions, are derived from National Election Study (NES) data from Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden—the five Western European democracies for which NES data are available for protracted periods.12 In each of these national election studies, respondents were asked to locate all of the major parties on an ideological scale typically ranging from 1 (extreme left) to 10 (extreme right).13 We used these survey responses to compute the perceived party position for each party in each election.         "
"14","We specify a multivariate regression model in order to evaluate whether parties’ policy images shift in tandem with the CMP codings of the Left‐Right tone of the statements in the parties’ election manifestos. The dependent variable is the change in the party's policy image at the current election compared to its image at the previous election, as measured by NES respondents’ mean Left‐Right placements of the party. We label this variable [Party j's perceived Left‐Right shift (t)], to denote the shift in the focal party j's perceived position between the current election t and the previous election t−1. Our key independent variables are [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t)], which denotes the shift in the CMP's Left‐Right coding of party j's election manifesto between the current and the previous election, and [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t−1)], which denotes the shift in the CMP's coding of party j's manifesto between the previous election and the election before that. We include this latter variable to control for the possibility that significant time lags intervene before citizens process parties’ policy statements (see, e.g., Adams and Somer‐Topcu 2009; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimpson 2002). We also include a lagged version of the dependent variable in order to control for autocorrelation issues.14"
"15","Our specification for the relationship between voters’ perceptions of the parties’ Left‐Right positions and the Left‐Right tone of the party's election manifesto is as follows:                "
"16","Party j’s perceived Left‐Right shift (t) = the change in party j's perceived Left‐Right position at the current election t compared with its position at the previous election t−1, based on NES respondents’ party placements. The variable [Party j's perceived Left‐Right shift (t−1)] is similarly defined.            "
"17","Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t) = the change in party j's Left‐Right position at the current election t compared with its position at the previous election t−1, based on the CMP's Left‐Right codings of the policy statements in the party's election manifestos. The variable [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t−1)] is similarly defined.            "
"18","Our analysis encompassed 97 stated Left‐Right shifts by parties and their supporters in five European party systems—Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden—for which NES data were available over lengthy time periods. The complete set of parties and elections included in the analyses are reported in the appendix. Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations of the observed values of the variables in our data set.            "
"19","Our analyses encompassed 25 parties, each observed over an average of six elections, and should thus be regarded as time‐series cross‐sectional data. Estimating a simple regression on the pooled data can lead to erroneous conclusions if there are unobserved differences between partisan constituencies (Hsiao 2003); fortunately, tests for party‐specific effects indicate that this is not a concern for the model we estimate. However, there are other methodological concerns to address. The lagged dependent variable included in our specification helps to address the concern of serially correlated errors (Beck and Katz 1995), and a Lagrange multiplier test fails to reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation. Another concern is that there may be unobserved, election‐specific factors that influence the positions of parties’ partisan constituencies in a particular election. We address these concerns through the use of robust standard errors clustered by election (Rogers 1993).            "
"20","The parameter estimates for the alternative models that we investigated are reported in Table 2. Column 1 in the table reports parameter estimates for a model where the dependent variable, [Party j's perceived Left‐Right shift (t)], represents the change in the mean Left‐Right position ascribed to the focal party along the 1–10 Left‐Right scale by NES respondents at the current election, compared to the mean position that all NES respondents ascribed to the party at the previous election. To the extent that voters’ perceptions of parties’ Left‐Right positions respond to the actual policy statements the parties publish in their policy manifestos, we would expect positive and statistically significant coefficient estimates on the [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t)] variable—which would indicate that voters adjust their perceptions contemporaneously with parties’ stated Left‐Right shifts—and possibly on the [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t−1)] variable, which would denote time lags before voters update their perceptions of party positions. However, the coefficient estimates reported in column 1 of Table 2 are small and statistically insignificant, and thus they do not support these expectations. These estimates imply that, ceteris paribus, a one‐unit shift in the CMP codings of a party's Left‐Right position at the current election (compared to the previous election) is associated with a Left‐Right shift in voters’ perceptions of the party's Left‐Right position of less than one‐twentieth of one unit, where both the CMP codings and voters’ party placements are calibrated along the same 1–10 scale. And, the coefficient estimate on the lagged variable, [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t−1)], is also near zero and statistically insignificant. Furthermore, when we reestimate the parameters of the model while including country‐specific intercepts to control for unobserved, country‐specific factors that influence voters’ perceptions, the parameter estimates (reported in column 2 of Table 2) support the same substantive conclusions.15 Thus, we find no evidence that voters systematically update their perceptions of parties’ Left‐Right positions in response to the actual policy statements that parties present in their manifestos. Given that previous research documents that citizens acquire disproportionate amounts of political information during national election campaigns, and our interviews that suggest that parties campaign based on their manifestos, these results cast doubt on parties’ abilities to shape their policy images via their campaign‐based policy statements.            "
"21","The empirical analyses reported above cast serious doubts on the proposition that European voters engage in systematic partisan adjustments in response to parties’ campaign‐based policy statements. For if citizens do not even update their perceptions of parties’ Left‐Right positions when parties’ policy statements shift, then it seems unlikely that citizens adjust their partisan loyalties or their own Left‐Right positions in response to parties’ policy statements. However, this logic is not necessarily sound because parties may move citizens indirectly via their policy statements: specifically, parties may communicate their Left‐Right shifts to organizations and political interest groups (i.e., trade unions, business organizations, etc.), and these organizations may in turn provide cues that prompt rank‐and‐file voters to make partisan adjustments. Suppose, for instance, that trade union members hold generally left‐wing policy views, and that these members also take political cues from their union's leadership. Then to the extent that union leaders provide more enthusiastic endorsements to socialist, labor, and communist parties when these parties’ policy statements shift farther to the left, we might expect that cue‐taking union members will more reliably support these parties when the parties advocate more leftist policies—even if the union members themselves do not directly perceive the shift in the focal party's policy statements. The possibility of this type of cue‐based partisan switching is supported by extensive research documenting the informational short‐cuts that citizens employ to make political decisions (e.g., Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991).         "
"22","In analyses based on panel data, we might parse out the extent to which voters’ partisan adjustments to parties’ stated policy positions reflect partisan switching as opposed to party persuasion. However, because the data we analyze are time‐series cross‐sectional, we instead assay the simpler task of estimating the extent to which either of these processes is taking place, i.e., we will search for any evidence of voters’ partisan adjustments to European parties’ stated Left‐Right shifts. Our logic is simple: to the extent that parties’ campaign‐based policy communications motivate partisan adjustments in the electorate due to partisan switching and/or party persuasion (and, regardless of whether these effects are direct or occur indirectly via cues from political organizations/interest groups), we expect that when a party shifts its policy statements, the mean Left‐Right position of the party's supporters will shift in the same direction. This test is very simple, and as discussed below it is incomplete in that even if we find evidence that party shifts correlate with shifts by their supporters, we cannot necessarily conclude that these associations reflect a causal process of partisan adjustment.16 However, if we find that the positions of parties’ supporters do not shift in the same direction as their preferred parties’ policy shifts, then we have strong reasons to doubt that partisan adjustments of any kind have taken place. On this basis we proceed.            "
"23","Our longitudinal measure of voters’ Left‐Right positions and their partisan loyalties is derived from the national election studies described above, from Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. In these surveys the respondents were asked to place themselves on the 1–10 Left‐Right scales, and they were also asked to indicate which party (if any) they supported. Our measure of the Left‐Right position of each party's partisan constituency in the focal election is the mean Left‐Right self‐placement of all respondents in that election who reported support for the party.17"
"24","We specify a multivariate regression model to search for evidence of voters’ partisan adjustments to parties’ Left‐Right shifts. As we are interested in how the mean positions of the parties’ supporters shift in response to parties’ stated Left‐Right shifts, we specify a model in which the dependent variable is the change in the party supporters’ mean Left‐Right position in the current election compared to party supporters’ positions in the previous election, as measured by NES respondents’ Left‐Right self‐placements and reported party support. We label this variable [Party j supporters’ Left‐Right shift (t)]. Our key independent variables are again the [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t)] variable, which denotes the shift in party j's stated Left‐Right position between the current and the previous election, based on the CMP codings, and the lagged version of this variable. We include this latter variable because of the possibility of lagged partisan adjustments to parties’ Left‐Right shifts. We also include a lagged version of the dependent variable in order to control for possible autocorrelation issues.18 We label this the partisan adjustment specification—CMP codings:               "
"25","Column 1 in Table 3, which reports the parameter estimates for the partisan adjustment specification—CMP codings (equation 2), does not support the hypothesis that voters engage in partisan adjustments in response to shifts in parties’ campaign‐based policy statements.19 The estimate on the [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t)] variable implies that, ceteris paribus, a one‐unit shift in the CMP codings of a party's Left‐Right position at the current election (compared to the previous election) is associated with a Left‐Right shift in the mean position of the party's supporters of just 0.07 units, along the same 1–10 scale. Thus, we observe no evidence of statistically or substantively significant contemporaneous partisan adjustments by voters in response to shifts in the Left‐Right tone of parties’ campaign‐based policy statements. With respect to lagged effects, the coefficient estimate +.140 on the [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t −1)] variable indicates that when parties shifted their stated Left‐Right positions by one unit at the previous interelection period, then, ceteris paribus, the mean positions of their supporters shift in the same direction by less than one‐seventh of one unit at the current interelection period. However, this lagged estimate is not statistically significant.20"
"26","As discussed above, the absence of strongly positive statistical associations between shifts in the Left‐Right tone of parties’ policy statements and the mean Left‐Right positions of their supporters provides strong evidence that voters do not react to shifts in parties’ campaign‐based policy statements, to any substantively significant degree: for to the extent that voters shift either their Left‐Right positions (the party persuasion process) or their party support (the partisan switching process) in response to parties’ Left‐Right shifts, this should create positive statistical associations between Left‐Right shifts by parties and shifts by their partisan constituencies. Furthermore, these positive statistical associations should obtain regardless of whether voters respond directly to parties’ policy statements, or indirectly via cues from the political organizations and interest groups that monitor these policy statements. Finally, we note that to the extent that our analyses do not control for the reciprocal causal process whereby parties react to voters’ policy shifts, this factor should inflate the positive statistical associations between our dependent and independent variables. Thus, the fact that we do not observe positive and statistically significant associations between party supporters’ Left‐Right shifts and shifts in parties’ policy statements is striking."
"27","Our finding that citizens do not systematically adjust their Left‐Right positions or their partisanship in response to parties’ policy statements raises the question: to what policy‐based attributes of parties, if any, do voters respond? An obvious candidate is parties’ policy images, i.e., citizens’ perceptions of the parties’ positions. Given our finding that parties’ policy images do not track their campaign‐based policy statements, it seems plausible that citizens react to these images in lieu of reacting to the parties’ actual policy statements. To evaluate this hypothesis, we estimated the parameters of a model that was identical to equation (2) except that we included two additional independent variables that we introduced above, [Party j's perceived Left‐Right shift (t)] and [Party j's perceived Left‐Right shift (t−1)], which represent the current and lagged shifts in the parties’ policy images, i.e., the shifts in voters’ perceptions of the parties’ positions. By incorporating these perceptual variables into a model that also includes the parties’ shifts as coded from their actual campaign statements, we can evaluate the extent to which citizens’ partisan adjustments reflect their reactions to their perceptions of the parties’ positions, as opposed to voters’ reactions to objective measures based on the actual statements in the parties’ election manifestos.21"
"28","The parameter estimates for this CMP Codings + Voter Perceptions specification, which we report in column 2 of Table 3, strongly support the hypothesis that citizens react to their perceptions of the parties’ Left‐Right shifts, but not to shifts in the Left‐Right tone of the parties’ actual campaign statements. These estimates reflect strong and positive relationships between Left‐Right shifts in the mean positions of party supporters and shifts in voters’ perceptions of the parties’ left‐Right positions: the coefficient estimate +0.635 on the [Party j's perceived Left‐Right shift (t)] variable indicates that, ceteris paribus, a one‐unit shift in a party's perceived position on the 1–10 Left‐Right scale is associated with a 0.635‐unit shift in the mean position of the party's partisan constituency on the same 1–10 scale, during the same interelection period. And, the estimate +0.326 on the [Party j's perceived Left‐Right shift (t−1)] variable indicates that a one‐unit shift in a party's perceived Left‐Right position is associated with an approximate 0.3‐unit shift in the mean position of the party's partisan constituency during the subsequent interelection period. Both of these estimates are statistically significant (p < .01), and they support the hypothesis that voters adjust their Left‐Right positions and/or their party support in response to their perceptions of parties’ Left‐Right shifts—particularly the lagged relationships we identify, which cannot be ascribed to the reciprocal causal process whereby parties react to their supporters’ Left‐Right shifts. Finally, the parameter estimate on the [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t)] variable, and on the lagged version of this variable, are both near zero and are statistically insignificant, which again supports the conclusion that parties’ campaign‐based policy statements exert little effect on voters.            "
"29","Next, we estimated the parameters of a model that was identical to the CMP Codings + Voter Perceptions specification, except that we controlled for additional factors that plausibly influence citizens’ Left‐Right shifts. To control for national economic conditions (which may motivate citizens to shift their Left‐Right policy orientations independently of the parties’ policy positions), we included the variables [inflation rate change (t)], defined as the change in the inflation rate since the last election, and [unemployment rate change (t)], defined as the change in the unemployment rate since the last election. And, to control for unmeasured, country‐specific factors that influence citizens’ Left‐Right positions, we included country‐specific intercepts. The parameter estimates for this model, which we report in column 3 of Table 3, again support the hypothesis that citizens react to their perceptions of the parties’ Left‐Right shifts, but not to shifts in the Left‐Right tone of the parties’ actual campaign statements.22"
"30","While we have so far uncovered no evidence that voters adjust their partisanship or their Left‐Right positions in response to parties’ campaign‐based policy statements, our analyses encompass only five European electorates, namely Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway (the five European countries for which NES data are available over long time periods). In order to evaluate whether our conclusions generalize to other European electorates, we reestimated the parameters of the partisan adjustment specification (equation 2) using alternative measures of partisan constituencies’ Left‐Right shifts that were derived from Eurobarometer surveys. These surveys have been administered in the following Western European democracies beginning in the early 1970s: Britain, Italy, Denmark, France, Portugal, Greece, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, and Germany.23 These surveys contain the same item in each year in each country, asking approximately 1,000 respondents per country to place themselves on a scale running from 1 (extreme left) to 10 (extreme right), and also to indicate the party (if any) that they support.24 We used these Eurobarometer items to construct the variables [Party j supporters’ Left‐Right shift (t)] and [Party j supporters’ Left‐Right shift (t−1)] that we used as our dependent variables in the NES‐based analyses described above. (We note that we cannot use these data to construct measures of voters’ perceptions of party shifts because the Eurobarometer surveys do not ask respondents to locate the parties’ Left‐Right positions.) We then reestimated the parameters of equation (2) on all partisan constituency Left‐Right shifts that are covered in the Eurobarometer surveys—296 party constituency shifts in 12 European democracies, roughly triple the number of party shifts in our NES‐based analyses.25 Column 4 in Table 3 presents the parameter estimates, which display the same patterns as the estimates based on the NES data: the coefficient estimates on the key independent variables, [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t)] and [Party j's stated Left‐Right shift (t−1)], are almost exactly zero, so that there is no evidence of statistically or substantively significant partisan adjustments by voters in response to shifts in parties’ policy statements.26"
"31","In summary, we find no evidence that citizens react to shifts in European parties’ campaign‐based policy statements by significantly shifting either their own Left‐Right positions or their partisan loyalties. This conclusion holds regardless of whether we measure party supporters’ Left‐Right shifts using national election study data from five countries (Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway) or Eurobarometer data from 12 European democracies. Simply put, we find no evidence that the mean Left‐Right positions of party supporters move in tandem with the Left‐Right policy statements that parties publish in their election manifestos. By contrast, we find a strong and positive relationship between citizens’ perceptions of parties’ Left‐Right shifts, and the Left‐Right shifts of these parties’ supporters.            "
"32","Our finding, that voters react strongly to their perceptions of parties’ Left‐Right shifts but not to parties’ actual shifts as coded by the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), raises troubling questions about the nature of mass‐elite policy linkages. In situations where parties shift the Left‐Right orientations of the policy statements that they publish in their election manifestos, we find no evidence that voters respond by adjusting their own Left‐Right positions, their partisan loyalties, or even their perceptions of the parties’ Left‐Right positions. These findings are striking given that previous research concludes that citizens display heightened levels of political attention around the time of election campaigns, and that our elite interviews suggest that parties campaign on the basis of their manifestos.         "
"33","While our findings may appear surprising, we have noted considerations that cast doubt on parties’ abilities to shape their policy images during political campaigns, including the fact that many citizens are inattentive to politics; that rival parties and media elites may challenge the sincerity of the focal party's policy promises; that citizens tend to assimilate new political information into their preexisting schemas; and that citizens must balance the policy statements that parties issue during election campaigns against parties’ statements (and behavior) during the precampaign period. It is this balance of conflicting considerations that prompted us to undertake this research project. We have diligently searched for evidence that citizens react to the policy statements that parties communicate during election campaigns. We have found no such evidence, and we believe this is an interesting result.27"
"34","At the same time, we emphasize that while our findings suggest that parties do not significantly move voters via the manifestos that underpin their election campaigns, our findings do not support the sweeping conclusion that European political parties cannot make successful policy‐based appeals to voters. In this regard, we note that European elites, in particular those from governing parties, have an additional, policy‐based tool at their disposal: namely, elites may move rank‐and‐file voters via their legislative policy behavior as opposed to their policy rhetoric. We note that the influential work of Carmines and Stimson (1989) and Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson (2002) on American politics concludes that when politicians change their legislative policy behavior, then at least some segments of the public assimilate these changes and react by shifting their partisan loyalties and/or their policy positions (see also Gerber and Jackson 1993; Hetherington 2001). Although there is little research to date that traces how European party elites’ actual policy behavior—as reflected in their legislative voting patterns—moves the public (but see Bartle, Dellepiane, and Stimson forthcoming), there are theoretical reasons to expect these effects to be at least as strong in Europe as they are in the United States. In particular, the disciplined party‐line voting that we observe in European parties’ parliamentary delegations may send a more easily detectable “signal” to the electorate than does the more heterogeneous policy behavior of American political elites (see, e.g., Adams, Green, and Milazzo forthcoming).         "
"35","An immediate direction for future study is to consider whether there are (unusual) situations where party elites can in fact issue policy statements that dramatically transform their party's policy image. One promising case study is the British Labour Party during the 1992–97 period, when the party's policy image shifted dramatically toward the center under the leadership of John Smith and then Tony Blair—a shift that is captured by the CMP codings, which document a sharp rightward shift in Labour's policy statements between 1992 and 1997.28 With respect to this point, we suspect that two crucial variables that mediate the public's response to parties’ shifting policy statements are, first, the political skills of the elites who attempt to shift their party's policy image, and, second, the political circumstances these elites confront, which can either enhance or diminish their abilities to communicate their policy message to the general public. “New Labour” under Tony Blair, for instance, was the rare case of a preternaturally talented political leader who, by virtue of his ability to unify a traditionally fractious party, to portray a decisive, competent, and trustworthy image to the British electorate, to focus media attention upon the party's policy initiatives, and to devise arresting and persuasive language to frame these initiatives, was able to convince voters that the party had truly changed (see, e.g., Seyd 1998). Blair, moreover, benefited from a set of propitious political circumstances, chiefly that the rival Conservative Party was largely discredited in the eyes of the public during this period by a series of highly publicized political scandals and internal divisions, so that the Conservatives were unable to effectively raise questions about the sincerity (or permanence) of Labour's new policy direction (see Norton 1998). We suspect that this “perfect storm” of variables—namely, the advent of an extremely talented, telegenic, and articulate Labour Party leader at a time when the party's chief rival was at a politically low ebb—accounts for Blair's success in dramatically shifting Labour's policy image.         "
"36","While the above discussion suggests interesting hypotheses about the factors that mediate mass‐elite policy linkages, we defer consideration of possible explanations of our findings for future research. In particular, in future research we hope to reestimate our models using alternative measures of parties’ Left‐Right positions (provided that these become available) to assess whether these estimates support the same substantive conclusions as the analyses we have reported here, which rely on the CMP codings of party manifestos. However, our primary goal in this article has been to evaluate whether citizens react to the Left‐Right tone of parties’ campaign‐based policy statements, not why citizens react—or, as we find, do not react—to these statements."
