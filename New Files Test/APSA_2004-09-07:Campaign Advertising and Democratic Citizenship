"1","Political science has long wrestled with the gulf between the ideals of democratic citizenship and the reality of the American citizen. In a classic, oft‐cited formulation, Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee explained that, “The democratic citizen is expected to be interested and … to be well informed about political affairs. He is supposed to know what the issues are, what their history is, what the relevant facts are, what alternatives are proposed, what the party stands for, what the likely consequences are. By such standards the voter falls short” (1954, 308)."
"2","Indeed, in the half century since Berelson and his associates delivered their dismal verdict on the American citizen, the weight of the supporting evidence has been definitive: when it comes to politics and political information, most Americans are severely malnourished. We are inattentive to most things political; we care little, know less, and participate in politics only when absolutely necessary (and often not even then). Our political views are peripatetic, hastily assembled, unconstrained by ideology, and unencumbered by data (Bartels 1986; Campbell et al. 1960; Converse 1964; Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Kinder 1983; Zaller 1992). Americans, in short, fail to meet the dictates of even the most charitable versions of democratic theory.         "
"3","Still, in spite of this anemic citizenry, American democracy has managed to endure: leaders are chosen, public policy is made, and popular preferences, such as they are, are often translated into political outcomes. How is it that democracy can survive—some might claim thrive—when citizens are so disengaged, so preoccupied with interests and anxieties distant from the world of politics?"
"4","Scholars have provided a number of answers, all of which are predicated upon the availability of at least some politically relevant information from which citizens can draw. Whether one puts faith in miracles of aggregation (Converse 1990; Page and Shapiro 1992), looks to the discourse of competing elites (Zaller 1992), or falls back on cognitive shortcuts (Lau and Redlawsk 2001; Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991), someone, somewhere, must be in possession of some supply of information. Where does such information come from? What is the source of the raw informational ingredients that make democracy possible?         "
"5","One common answer is that elites provide relevant information through election campaigns. Campaigns are often seen as capturing the attention of citizens, activating their political predispositions and, at least potentially, shedding some light on the political choice at hand (Alvarez 1997; Coleman and Manna 2000; Finkel 1993; Gelman and King 1993; Simon 2002). Candidates and parties help subsidize the costs of information, and their interest group allies do their part as well, distributing voting guides, candidate scorecards, and primers designed to make a given set of electoral choices more comprehensible. Organizations such as the National Rifle Association, the Sierra Club, and NARAL Pro‐Choice America all attempt to subsidize the costs of acquiring politically relevant information in an easily digestible form.         "
"6","And yet, when it comes to campaigns as vehicles for the transmission of political information, an important distinction is often drawn between “good” and “bad” information flows. Put simply, speeches, debates, and policy papers are seen as normatively valued and substantively valuable sources of information, with the potential to enlighten citizens. In contrast, campaign advertising is viewed with a skeptical eye at best; at worst it is seen as a cynical, self‐serving effort to obfuscate or mislead. This distinction is even enshrined in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), the most recent effort to reform the federal campaign finance system. A central component of the legislation (upheld in 2003 by the Supreme Court) focuses explicitly on television advertising, considering such communications a suspect class of campaign discourse that is by implication misleading, duplicitous, and potentially harmful to democratic decision making. According to BCRA, political groups are permitted to communicate messages over the phone and in the mail that they are not allowed to convey through television advertisements."
"7","Even Madison Avenue pioneer David Ogilvy has referred to political ads as “the most deceptive, misleading, unfair and untruthful of all advertising” (cited by Zhao and Chaffee 1995, 42), and the chorus of criticism of television advertising is a predictable staple of media coverage in election after election. Typically, we are told that campaign ads are ruining democracy, that the rough and tumble of political advertising repulses average Americans. Such claims are not new: writing in 1980 about the presidential contest between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, veteran New York Times reporter Adam Clymer quoted Lois Haines of Goshen, Ohio, “People are being turned off by dirty politics, our country did not start out that way,” said second‐grade teacher Patricia Williams, who complained that, “there's an awful lot of mudslinging” (Clymer 1980, 5). In 1992, writing about the race between Bill Clinton and George Bush, chief New York Times political writer Richard Berke grumbled, “the view from America's living rooms is not a pretty one” and “the campaigns are leaving unmistakably depressing images” (Berke 1992, 7). And in 2002, David Broder opined, “These ads are killing our Democracy” (Broder 2002, B07).         "
"8","These examples are typical of the scores of articles that appear each year—often by the same reporters. The argument is usually the same: campaign advertising has a detrimental impact on American democracy. The theme is echoed by scholars claiming that negative advertising in particular has a demobilizing effect on voters (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Ansolabehere, Iyengar, and Simon 1999). And while much of the scholarly debate has focused on negative ads in particular, discussion of campaign advertising tends to assume that most ads are negative (although they are not), and that in any case advertising has little to offer when it comes to creating an engaged, informed electorate.         "
"9","We disagree with this conventional wisdom. Campaign ads tend to be rich in informational content, and advertising conveys information in an efficient, easily digestible way. Like product advertising, political commercials are carefully tested and skillfully produced. Text, image, and music work to complement and reinforce each other. And an ad's basic message—its bottom line—is usually simple to identify (it is often the first and the last line of the ad). Exposure to advertising can help citizens to learn about the candidates and issues and is thus an efficient means for campaigns to communicate with potential voters. Ultimately, if the political diet of most Americans is lacking in crucial information, campaign ads represent the multivitamins of American politics."
"10","Equally important, this informational content is contained in an easy‐to‐swallow emotional coating. Campaign ads are rarely presented in dispassionate, emotionally neutral terms. Rather, ads tend to be emotionally rich; they provoke diverse responses including fear, pride, and sympathy, either directly, through the script of the ad, or indirectly, through the use of images and music. As a result, ad exposure can facilitate use of the likeability heuristic, by which people make informational inferences on the basis of their likes and dislikes (Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991). Ads can also produce demonstrable change in viewers' levels of anxiety about the election and enthusiasm for the candidates, which in turn can increase political awareness and interest (Marcus and MacKuen 1993; Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000). In short, due to the cognitive and emotional content of campaign advertising, there is good reason to expect ad exposure to produce citizens who are both more informed about the candidates, more interested in the race, and in general more engaged by the campaign.         "
"11","Prior work provides some measure of support for these proposed effects, particularly for the idea that campaign ads can help inform citizens. Most famously, Patterson and McClure found campaign advertising during the 1972 presidential election to be rife with issue content, leading them to conclude that “presidential advertising contributes to an informed electorate” (1976, 117). Indeed, according to Patterson and McClure television advertising led to a greater degree of issue learning than did television news (at least among the voters of Onondaga County), and a number of other studies have shown—or at least hinted—that citizens can learn from ads (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Atkin and Heald 1976; Brians and Wattenberg 1996; Coleman 2001; Coleman and Manna 2000; Dalager 1996; Just, Crigler, and Wallach, 1990; Kahn and Kenney 2000; Valentino, Hutchings, and Williams 2002; Zhao and Chaffee 1995; Zukin and Snyder 1984). However, prior work on the informational impact of campaign advertising has necessarily relied on relatively indirect measures of ad exposure to campaign advertising. Inferring exposure to ads outside of the laboratory (where such inference is unnecessary) has been a tenuous project at best. In some cases scholars have relied on contextual measures of campaign spending or advertising activity. More commonly, studies have used survey measures of self‐reported ad exposure to demonstrate that advertising can boost knowledge and increase campaign interest (e.g., Zhao and Chaffee 1995). There are, however, important methodological problems with using self‐reported exposure to campaign advertising; concerns about endogeneity when relying on self‐reports are especially pronounced in models of political learning (Ansolabehere, Iyengar, and Simon 1999; Goldstein and Freedman 2002).         "
"12","Nevertheless, on the basis of prior work as well as the arguments set out above, we believe there is good reason to propose a number of possible effects from campaign ad exposure: First, the information hypothesis holds that citizens exposed to campaign advertising will actually learn something about the candidates and their messages. Second, the engagement hypothesis suggests that, due in part to its information‐enhancing function and in part to the emotional content of much campaign advertising, ad exposure will cause people to be more interested in a particular election, more cognitively and affectively involved with the campaigns, and ultimately more likely to participate by turning out on Election Day.         "
"13","Finally, we propose a differential effects hypothesis, suggesting that these effects will be greatest among those who need the information most: citizens who have lower levels of political information to begin with. This expectation is grounded in common sense: those who know least obviously have the most to learn. Moreover, past research provides some support for the hypothesis.1 However, it rubs against assumptions underlying existing models of media effects.         "
"14","Theories of media effects usually differentiate among three components of the communications process: exposure, reception, and acceptance of new information (Hovland et al. 1953; Price and Zaller 1993; Zaller 1992, 1996). Exposure involves the physical encounter with a media message, while reception refers to the process of “taking in” or comprehending a message, and acceptance involves “yielding” to a message that has been received (leading to, under certain conditions, attitude change). Our focus is on reception. We are concerned primarily with whether information conveyed by advertising “gets through” to viewers, rather than whether or not it has a persuasive impact (a question of acceptance). To the extent that advertising leads to increases in political information or campaign interest, we will consider messages as having been received. Importantly, unlike most work conducted outside of the laboratory, we employ independent estimates of advertising exposure that allow us to untangle patterns of exposure from effects on reception. Thus, we ask what information people receive given our estimates of what messages—specifically, patterns of advertising—they have been exposed to.         "
"15","It is most often assumed that reception of political messages rises with cognitive sophistication and political engagement. In part, this reflects the fact that exposure to political messages increases with sophistication, and exposure and reception are usually conflated in nonexperimental studies.2 In the present study, however, we have independent estimates of exposure, and need not rely on measures of reception to infer exposure.         "
"16","In addition to differences in patterns of exposure, past work has usually assumed that less‐informed citizens will fail to receive messages they encounter because they lack the cognitive skills needed to make sense of new communications. Zaller's “reception axiom,” for example, holds that, “the greater a person's level of cognitive engagement with an issue, the more likely he or she is to be exposed to and comprehend—in a word, to receive—political messages concerning that issue” (1992, 42). More generally, the assumption in much of the literature is that as media messages are encountered, “the informationally rich get richer,” while those with fewer informational resources get left behind (Price and Zaller 1993, 138).3"
"17","Our differential effects hypothesis therefore runs counter to Zaller's reception axiom and the expectation that information gains will be concentrated among those who already possess an appreciable store of political information. Given exposure to advertising (which, again, we measure separately), we hypothesize that the least sophisticated (as measured by general political information) are the most likely to take in new information from political advertising. The difference reflects the nature of the information conveyed by political ads versus other sources of political information like newspapers or television news. The informational content of most political ads is relatively straightforward, requiring little in the way of cognitive processing, and is usually accompanied by simple emotional cues. Ads are, we have argued, information subsidies are akin to multivitamins: attractively (and expertly) packaged, simple to comprehend, easy to digest. The cognitive resources necessary to receive information from advertising are thus much less than might be assumed for other types of political messages. Reception therefore is easier; those who have the most to learn, we hypothesize, will experience the greatest gains. Furthermore, these multivitamins can be accessed from viewing a wide variety of shows. While much campaign advertising is aired on news programs, ads appear on a wide variety of other broadcasts as well. Compared to information conveyed by newspapers and television news, ads present more readily digestible information, to which viewers can be exposed without purposively seeking it out.         "
"18","To test these hypotheses, we use Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG) data from the 2000 election, made available by the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, to construct an estimate of campaign ad exposure. These data provide a comprehensive record of every ad broadcast on the national broadcast and cable television networks, and more importantly for the study of political advertising (which is bought primarily at the local market level), in each of the nation's top 75 media markets. The unit of analysis in the dataset is the broadcast of a single advertisement, with information on where it aired (what media market and television station) and when it aired (what time of day and during what television show), and the coded content of the ad (what issues it dealt with, for example). Thus, we can aggregate the data in a variety of ways to yield a range of descriptive inferences—determining, for example, the number of ads that aired during a particular show in a particular media market or the volume of advertising for a particular candidate in a given market."
"19","Overall in the 2000 election, almost one million (970,410) political television advertisements were aired in the country's top 75 markets. Of these, about 94% (908,068) had a specific electoral objective, the rest (62,342), were genuine “issue ads,” designed to shape opinion or spur activity on some policy issue. Electoral spots included 302,000 presidential ads and almost half‐a‐million commercials for House and Senate candidates (the rest were spots for state and local candidates as well as ballot propositions). Included in these figures are not only the hard‐money ads aired by the campaign committees themselves, but coordinated expenditures with parties and soft‐money party ads, along with issue advocacy campaigns by interest groups."
"20","One important advantage of the CMAG system is that it not only tracks ads from all sources (campaign, party, and interest group), it also tracks ads in all races in a given election. Lacking such comprehensive data, prior work has focused on ads from a single race at a time, ignoring the fundamental fact that election campaigns in the United States are rarely isolated events. Ballots are often crowded, with many offices typically up for grabs simultaneously. More important, although crowded ballots are common to many states, election contests can vary in competitiveness from state to state (and even within states), thus drawing more or less advertising, as the volume of campaign advertising is correlated with the competitiveness of the race (Goldstein and Freedman 2002a). As a result, a market that is uncompetitive in one contest might be extremely competitive in another, and focusing on a single race in that market will tend to understate the total volume (as well as the composition) of the advertising broadcast. Understanding advertising effects demands that one take into consideration the full range of electoral contests that voters face. Doing otherwise—looking only at presidential advertising, for example—means risking significant measurement error when it comes to making descriptive and causal inferences.         "
"21","Yet, this simple fact has been consistently overlooked in the extensive literature on advertising effects, particularly the debate over advertising tone and voter turnout (see Goldstein and Freedman 2002 and Lau et al. 1999 for reviews). To date, most empirical work on the impact of campaign advertising on turnout has considered ads from only a single type of race—even a single electoral contest—at a time. Some have considered ads aired in presidential—and only presidential—races (e.g., Finkel and Geer 1998; Goldstein and Freedman 2002); others have focused on ads aired in Senate races during election years when there were hundreds of thousands of ads broadcast for other candidates (Kahn and Kenney 2000). These studies are unable to consider the cumulative effects of multiple ads from multiple races. This strategy may make sense when looking at the persuasive effects of ads in a particular race, but is problematic when the focus is on turnout or learning. Although citizens may be drawn to the polls to vote one or two particular races, and although some races may have a bigger influence on turnout than others, citizens often vote all races on the ballot and all races contribute to the full campaign environment. In short, no citizen can avoid being bombarded with advertisements from the full range of races, regardless of whether he or she plans to vote in a given contest, and the CMAG data enable us to capture more of this information environment than possible in the past.         "
"22","What, then, is the potential informational content of campaign advertising in the 2000 elections? More, perhaps, than critics might expect. Campaign advertising is rich in informational content. The majority of campaign ads broadcast in the general election—including more than two‐thirds of all presidential advertising—focused primarily on policy issues such as heath care, education, social security, and taxes (see Table 1). And even among ads that focus on the personal attributes of candidates (such as questions of character), there is usually some mention of issue stands. All told, nearly 95% of presidential spots and 90% of all general election ads contain some issue‐related content. Moreover, advertising claims are widely supported by references to specific sources. Almost 70% of all general election ads (and 73% of presidential spots) include at least one claim backed up with a cited source.4"
"23","Although the CMAG data provide detailed information about what was aired, they contain no information about exposure at the individual level. They are thus a necessary but insufficient first step in building a measure of exposure to television advertising and in making inferences about the impact of this exposure. To construct a valid measure, one needs information about two factors: the frequency with which an advertisement is broadcast in a particular media market and the quantity of television viewing by a particular respondent (Freedman and Goldstein 1999). Even the most faithful television watcher is unlikely to see a campaign ad that has not been broadcast in his or her media market. Similarly, living in a media market that is saturated with campaign advertisements will mean little to an individual who never watches television. Thus, one needs estimates of what was aired and what was watched to estimate accurately levels of advertising exposure. CMAG provides the former. For the latter, we turn to the 2000 National Election Study.         "
"24","As Table 2 indicates, 10 shows drew about 64% of campaign advertising during the 2000 general election season. Almost half (44%) of all political advertising in 2000 was aired on local news. Morning news shows attracted another 11% of ads, and two game shows, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! each hosted 2% of general election political spots in 2000. In all, only 14 shows drew more than 1% of political advertising. Since political advertising is so heavily concentrated, NES targeted its media exposure questions accordingly, asking questions about local news viewership (both early and late), morning news viewership, daytime talk shows, and Wheel of Fortune‐ and Jeopardy‐watching. We then created a measure of ad exposure, weighting the number of ads broadcast on each show in a given market by each respondent's viewing pattern for that particular show (see Appendix B for details).         "
"25","Our estimate of exposure is, of course, only an estimate; and because ultimately we don't know whether a respondent was actually watching a given commercial (as opposed to, say, muting the volume or leaving the room), it is most likely an overestimate of how many ads a respondent has seen. It is best, therefore, to think of our measure as an upper bound on the number of spots that respondents were likely to have seen and as a measure of relative exposure among respondents in our sample. This makes it possible to compare different respondents in different markets in terms of their relative exposure to different types of campaign ads.         "
"26","Two additional points bear emphasizing with respect to our measure of exposure: First, the measure relies in part on respondents' own reports of exposure to television programming, which are clearly subject to measurement error (as are all survey self‐reports). However, prior work has found such measures to be valid indicators of exposure to news and entertainment programming (e.g., Bartels 1996). In general, we expect recall of television program exposure (which is usually deliberate and often regular, if not habitual) to be a more valid and reliable measure of actual exposure than recall of television advertising (which is neither deliberately chosen nor subject to regular viewing patterns). Put simply, people should more accurately recall television‐watching behavior that they seek out and that they engage in regularly, as opposed to recalling advertising stimuli that they neither deliberately choose nor encounter on a predictable basis. Moreover, it is important to note that we rely on recall measures to help differentiate among respondent exposure within a given media market; we rely on the CMAG data to draw distinctions across markets.         "
"27","Second, to the extent that heavy viewers of certain television shows (local news in particular) are more likely to be well‐informed, highly educated, or especially interested in politics, if we were to find that exposure to advertising leads to increased political information or engagement it could be an artifact of the measure itself. That is, people might appear to be more informed or interested not because of the impact of political advertising, but because informed people are more likely to be exposed to advertising by virtue of the shows they watch."
"28","Fortunately, this is not the case. For the six sets of television shows that comprise our exposure measure, frequency of watching is positively correlated with a measure of general political information in only one case: evening television news. In three other cases there is no relationship between political information and viewership, and watching Wheel of Fortune and daytime talk shows is negatively correlated with information. Similarly, only news viewership (morning, evening, and late night) is associated with campaign interest (and here only moderately, with correlations in the .15 to .20 range); watching the other shows has no relationship to interest whatsoever. The weak association between local news viewing and campaign interest is not surprising, given why most people watch television news: for information about crime, health, sports, weather, and community information (Pew Research Center 2002). Nevertheless, to be safe, we include local news viewing in our multivariate models in order to control for any remaining association. Finally, in every case, viewership declines with education. Thus, we are on firm footing in using these measures to estimate the impact of ad exposure on information and political engagement, unencumbered by concerns about selection effects.         "
"29","We use pre‐ and post‐election questions from the 2000 National Election Study to test our main hypotheses. To test our information hypothesis, we look at whether respondents were able to recall the name of one of the House candidates running in their district, as well as the accuracy of their reports, along with relative issue placements for the presidential candidates. To test the engagement hypothesis—that exposure to advertising leads people to become more involved with the candidates, more attentive to the election, and more likely to participate—we explore pre‐ and post‐election measures of campaign interest, the number of likes and dislikes respondents were able to offer for each of the major party presidential and House candidates, and voter turnout. Finally, we investigate the differential effects hypothesis by looking at the effects on our dependent variables separately for respondents both high and low in pre‐existing political information."
"30","Each of our models includes a measure of campaign ad exposure as the primary explanatory variable. Ad exposure is operationalized in a number of ways, depending on the dependent variable. For questions that were asked on the NES post‐election survey (such as voter turnout) we use our estimate of exposure to advertising from June 1, 2000 through Election Day. For questions asked on the pre‐election survey (such as House‐candidate recall), we use our measure of exposure to ads from June 1 up to the date of the respondent's pre‐election interview (thus the end‐date varies by respondent). Table A1 in Appendix C shows the relevant exposure measure or measures for each model.         "
"31","Additionally, depending on the model, we use exposure to advertising of one of three types: presidential ads, congressional ads, and total ads (which includes presidential, congressional, and all other electoral ads). In each model we control for variables that could plausibly affect our outcome measures, including education, age, race, income, education, strength of partisanship, newspaper reading, and general political information. Following the logic laid out by Zaller (1992), we measure information with a familiar battery of questions asking respondents to identify the “job or office” held by William Rehnquist, Trent Lott, Tony Blair, and Janet Reno, along with questions about partisan control of the House and Senate. (Descriptions of all variables appear in Appendix A.) We also include measures of the competitiveness of the House, Senate, and presidential races for each respondent, to account for the possibility that electoral competition leads to higher levels of information and engagement for reasons other than increased advertising (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Jacobson 1997). The full models appear in Appendix C.         "
"32","Each model includes two additional measures of the level of general campaign activity that could affect citizens' level of information and degree of campaign engagement. First, we include the logged number of total spots broadcast in each respondent's media market (one of the constituents of our exposure measure) to ensure that any observed effects are due to ad exposure and not another form of activity targeted at the market level. Second, we include an individual‐level measure of campaign mobilization—a dummy variable set at one if a respondent reports having been contacted by a political party or having received campaign mail—to ensure that it is ad exposure doing the explanatory work and not another form of mobilization that high‐exposure citizens might also be subject to."
"33","Finally, notwithstanding the assurances discussed earlier, we include the respondent's mean level of television news viewing. Together, these controls should allay any concern about endogeneity in our models; that is, they allow us to capture the impact of campaign ad exposure on our measures of information and engagement, without undue concern that those who are already engaged and informed will find themselves more exposed to campaign ads."
"34","We first examined the effect of exposure on respondents' ability to recall the candidates running for the U.S. House of Representatives in their district. We estimated two models, one for citizens' claims about knowing the names of the candidates, and one for the accuracy of their reports. Not surprisingly, given the social desirability of being politically informed, a higher percentage of citizens say they know who was running (26.6%) than can accurately identify at least one of the candidates by name (14.8%). Importantly, as Table 4 illustrates, both reported knowledge and recall accuracy increase with exposure to congressional campaign advertising. Increasing exposure from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above the mean raises the probability of claiming to know who is running by .093 for a hypothetical “average” respondent.5 When this baseline respondent is exposed to a relatively small amount of advertising, there is a .123 probability that she will claim to know who is running for the House of Representatives, at higher levels of ad exposure, this probability rises to .216. When it comes to the ability to recall a candidate's name accurately (as opposed to simply claiming to know), the probability rises from .034 when ad exposure is one standard deviation below the mean, to .068 at exposure a standard deviation above.6 Thus, exposure to congressional advertising leads people to feel more informed (and therefore more likely to claim to know the candidates running), and to actually be more informed about their House candidates.         "
"35","Importantly, these effects are evident for exposure to congressional advertising, but not for exposure to presidential spots. As Table 3 reveals, exposure to presidential ads has no effect at all either on assertions of knowledge or on recall accuracy. We take these nonfindings as strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that people are learning from relevant information contained in the ads themselves.         "
"36","Over and above the effect of ad exposure, other variables in our model affect levels of information (see Appendix C for the full model). Reported recall and accuracy both rise with education, newspaper reading, and general political information, but are unaffected by the total volume of advertising in the media market or, once congressional ad‐exposure has been controlled for, by watching the local news.7 Mobilization is strongly related to recall: those who were contacted during the campaign by parties and campaigns are significantly more likely to recall a candidate (and do so accurately) than their unmobilized counterparts, which may say as much about the kinds of people who get contacted as about the informational impact of mobilization itself (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993).         "
"37","Finally, as the full model reported in Appendix C indicates, campaign context—specifically electoral competition—matters for House‐candidate recall. Even controlling for all the other variables in our model, people are more likely to recall the name of at least one candidate—and much more likely to do so accurately—when they live in a district with a competitive House race. Holding ad exposure constant at its mean across types of House races (clearly an unrealistic assumption but a conservative one), our hypothetical “average” respondent would have a .164 probability of saying she remembered the name of a House candidate if she lived in an uncompetitive district, and a probability of .273 if she lived in a competitive one. Similarly, the probability of an accurate recall more than triples from .048 in an uncompetitive district to .136 in a competitive one. Importantly, living in a state with a competitive Senate or Presidential race has no impact on House‐candidate recall. The effect of electoral competitiveness is thus confined to the context of the House race itself.         "
"38","We estimated an additional set of information models, using respondents' ability to situate correctly the presidential candidates on eight issue questions. The candidates were evaluated separately, and respondents were coded as having provided a “correct” answer each time they placed the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, to the left of the Republican candidate, George Bush.8 Correct placements varied widely by issue: Only 13% of respondents, for example, were able to correctly order the candidates on the question of defense spending, 62% could identify Gore as being more amenable to restrictions on gun sales, and almost two‐thirds could identify Bush as more pro‐life than Gore.         "
"39","We regressed (using ordered probit) the number of correct placements for each respondent on the independent variables in the models reported above.9 We found that in general, presidential candidate issue knowledge rises with general political information, education, strength of partisanship, and party and campaign mobilization (see Appendix C). More to the point, exposure to presidential election ads raises slightly but significantly the number of issues for which respondents can place the candidates. At the lowest level of exposure, our hypothetical average respondent would have only a .083 probability of correctly ordering the candidates on six or more out of the eight issues At a standard deviation above the mean level of exposure, this rises slightly to .107. Consistent with our findings at the congressional level, the impact of ad exposure is domain specific: Only presidential ads contribute to respondents' issue knowledge; congressional ads have no effect.         "
"40","We tested the hypothesis that campaign advertising boosts engagement with the candidates and campaigns in several ways. First, we looked at general campaign interest. Both before and after the election, NES asks respondents whether they were “very much interested, somewhat interested, or not much interested in following the political campaign.” As Table 4 reveals, exposure to campaign ads increases the pre‐election measure of interest, but has no effect on post‐election interest. For our hypothetical average respondent, the probability of being in the “very interested” category before the election is almost five points higher at the highest level ad exposure (.226) than when exposure is a standard deviation below the mean (.181). Both measures of interest rise with newspaper reading, local news viewing, education, political information, mobilization, and strength of partisanship. And controlling for the other variables in the model, interest is higher among African Americans than among nonblack respondents. Total ad volume in the respondent's media market and electoral competitiveness, in contrast, have no impact on campaign interest (Appendix C, Table A3).         "
"41","Our second measure of electoral engagement involved perceptions of the candidates themselves. Specifically, we looked at the ability to articulate likes and dislikes about the major party presidential and House candidates. Past research has established the importance of candidate affect for understanding vote choice as well as turnout, and the NES “likes” and “dislikes” battery taps into cognitive as well affective engagement with the candidates (Holbrook et al. 2001; Jacobson 1997; Kelley 1983; Marcus and MacKuen 1993). NES asks respondents whether there was anything in particular that they liked about each of the major party presidential candidates; up to five mentions are accepted for each candidate, including everything from past experience and leadership ability, to physical appearance and other personal qualities. Respondents are also asked whether there are reasons to dislike each of the candidates. Again, up to five responses—ranging from comments about the candidate's character to criticisms of his policy positions—are accepted.         "
"42","On average, NES respondents in 2000 were able offer slightly more than one reason for liking each of the presidential candidates, for a combined mean of 2.2 mentions (out of a maximum 10). They could provide slightly fewer reasons for disliking the candidates (an average of 2.0 out of 10). When it comes to candidates in House races, Americans are at an even greater loss, providing on average only one reason for liking either the Republican or Democratic candidate in their district, and only 0.38 reasons for disliking them (again, out of a possible 10)."
"43","As with interest, likes and dislikes increase with education and political information. Strong partisans are somewhat more likely to mention something that they like (but not dislike) about the presidential candidates. More important for our purposes, presidential‐candidate likes and dislikes rise with exposure to campaign advertising, as Table 4 reveals. Increasing exposure to presidential ads from a standard deviation below to a standard deviation above the mean increases the number of likes offered ever so slightly, by around a quarter of a mention for our average respondent. The effect on dislikes is slightly more pronounced, rising by four‐tenths of a mention. And in the aggregate, there are no significant effects of ad‐exposure on House‐candidate mentions.         "
"44","Our final measure of campaign engagement is voter turnout. There is, of course, a considerable literature on the impact of campaign advertising—in particular, negative campaign advertising—on turnout. Here we are concerned with a simpler hypothesis: does exposure to advertising in the aggregate (holding aside questions of tone) mobilize, demobilize, or have no effect on citizens when it comes to the simple act of voting? The answer is unambiguous: in the aggregate, exposure to campaign advertising stimulates turnout, increasing the probability that our hypothetical citizen will vote by as much as 10 percentage points (Table 4). To some extent, of course, this effect is due to the impact of advertising on each of the variables discussed above: information, interest, and the ability to articulate likes and dislikes are all associated with a increased probability of voting, and as we have seen, they are all affected by campaign advertising. However, even in an expanded model in which we control for all of these additional variables, advertising continues to exert an independent and significant effect on turnout. When it comes to voting, therefore, exposure to campaign ads has both direct and indirect stimulation effects.         "
"45","Our final hypothesis is that the effects of campaign ad exposure are not uniform. Rather, some people, specifically those who are less politically sophisticated, stand to gain more in terms of information and campaign engagement. As our multivariate analysis demonstrated, and consistent with a vast literature on political sophistication, citizens with higher levels of general political information were more interested, more likely to participate, and more knowledgeable about the candidates than their less‐informed counterparts. To test for heterogeneity in the effects of exposure based on political sophistication, we split our general political information index at the median (two questions correct out of six), and reestimated each of our models with interaction terms for high‐ vs. low‐information respondents.10"
"46","The results, although inconsistent, provide a clear measure of support for the differential effects hypothesis. The impact of ad exposure does not vary by political sophistication (measured by information) when it comes to turnout, presidential candidate likes, or knowledge of presidential issue positions. However, for both measures of campaign interest, the impact of exposure is indeed more pronounced among the relatively uninformed. As Figure 1 illustrates, increasing ad exposure from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviate above raises the probability of being “very interested” in the election (as measured during the campaign) by six points for those with low levels of political information, and but only one point among those who are more informed. Particularly noteworthy is the post‐election measure of interest: Although ad exposure had no significant effects in the aggregate, it turns out that there are indeed engagement effects, but they are confined to low‐information respondents. As in the pre‐election wave, these respondents are six points more likely to report having been “very interested” in the campaign, while ad exposure actually lowers interest slightly among the more informed.         "
"47","                 Effects of Media Exposure on High‐ and Low‐Information Respondents                      "
"48"," Source: Appendix C, Table A4.Note: Effects on House‐candidate recall refer to the change in probability of recalling the name of a candidate; effects on interest refer to the change in probability of being “very interested” in the election; effects on candidate likes and dislikes refer to the probability of offering more than two mentions (for presidential candidates) or more than one mention (for House candidates).                     "
"49","A similar pattern holds for presidential candidate dislikes, and both positive and negative House‐candidate mentions: in each case, low‐information respondents articulate more things they like or dislike as their exposure to advertising increases. In the case of House‐candidate mentions, like the post‐election interest measure, these ad exposure effects are masked in the aggregate. Had one not been paying attention to differential effects by sophistication, in other words, one would have missed the impact of ad exposure on these measures."
"50","It is only in the case of House‐candidate recall (both self‐reported recall ability as well as the accuracy of the report) that the impact of ad exposure seems to matter more for more informed respondents. Moving from a standard deviation below the mean level of exposure to a standard deviation above increases the probability of claiming to know the name of at least one House candidate by 10 points for high‐information respondents, but only nine points for those with less information, and increases the probability of correctly identifying at least one candidate by five and three points, respectively. It is worth noting, however, that these differences are smaller than in the other cases; moreover, because the levels of candidate recall are so very low to begin with, especially for low‐information respondents, the impact is significantly higher in percentage terms: Ad exposure leads to a 46% gain in the probability or reported House‐candidate recall for high‐information respondents, but a full 132% increase for low‐information respondents (see Table A4 in Appendix C). When it comes to the accuracy of recall, the gains are 72% and 194%, respectively. Thus even when it comes to candidate recall, although the absolute differences in effects are modest, less‐informed citizens get a bigger percentage boost simply because they start off at such low levels.         "
"51","In sum, we found little evidence to support the notion that the politically sophisticated are more likely to learn from and be affected by campaign ad messages. To the contrary, where differential effects exist they are consistent with an alternative hypothesis: that information gains and increases in engagement are concentrated among those more in need of a political supplement: the informationally undernourished sector of the citizenry."
"52","Hand wringing over the state of American democracy is a longstanding tradition. Pundits and scholars alike worry that citizen participation and knowledge are disturbingly low and that ubiquitous political advertising contributes to the problem. To be sure, campaign advertising is often petty, sometimes offensive, and infrequently uplifting or inspiring. Nevertheless, we have argued that there are good theoretical reasons to suspect that campaign ads—rich in information and laden with emotional content—have the potential to bring about a more attentive, more informed, and more participatory citizenry. Television advertisements can help increase the aggregate store of politically relevant information that voters have at their disposal, which in turn can help activate the heuristics that voters use in making decisions and making sense of the political world."
"53","Using comprehensive data from the 2000 elections on the content, timing, and targeting of all political advertising in the country's top 75 media markets, in combination with National Election Study survey data, we have provided strong empirical evidence to support the notion that advertising can inform and mobilize the citizenry. Specifically, our findings show that exposure to campaign advertising produces citizens who are more interested in the election, have more to say about the candidates, are more familiar with who is running, and ultimately, are more likely to vote. To be sure, these effects are relatively modest, particularly when compared with the impact of factors such as education, strength of partisanship, and mobilization, but they remain significant. And importantly, these effects are mostly concentrated among those citizens who have the greatest need: those with relatively low levels of political information to begin with. In short, people can and do learn from television ads, and campaign advertising can thereby fulfill a vital democratic function."
"54","We are not, however, completely sanguine about the role of advertising in American politics. While we have shown that there are positive effects from political advertising, there may be other ways in which the content and sheer volume of political advertising may adversely affect the political process. Three important caveats should serve to temper undue enthusiasm regarding the salutary effects of campaign advertising."
"55","First, it is important to point out that we have focused on the effects of ad exposure on measures of information and engagement. We have said nothing whatsoever about advertising as a strategic tool. Although advertising expenditures in relatively evenly matched campaigns may tend to balance one another out, such parity is not always the case. When there are uneven flows of campaign messages—when one side has even a relatively small advantage—there may be important persuasive effects on the electorate. To be sure, such persuasion may be marginal, but of course it is on the margins that most presidential elections are decided. In any case, these types of competitive dynamics constitute an important next step in the study of advertising."
"56","Second, advertisements obviously cost money, and a lot of it. Although instances of flat‐out vote buying are difficult to document in contemporary elections, political scientists have demonstrated that money can buy access and can mobilize legislators to be more active on particular pieces of legislation (Hall 1996). Moreover, even in the absence of clear quid pro quo behavior, critics have raised concerns that the appearance of substantial impropriety undermines the integrity of the democratic system. Additionally, potentially strong leaders may be deterred from running for office because of the burden of raising large amounts of money to pay for advertising and other campaign activities. In recruiting candidates, parties clearly have an affinity for wealthy individuals who can finance their own campaigns. But even putting aside considerations about distortions in the candidate recruitment process, the time that it takes any candidate to raise the money necessary to mount an effective media campaign clearly detracts from other duties.         "
"57","Our final caveat involves the larger informational diet of American citizens. We have referred to advertisements as political vitamins, adding to the store of information that voters have at their disposal (and helping them access additional information shortcuts). Still, like all vitamins, political advertisements are most effective when they are supplementing, rather than supplanting, more substantial sources of nutrition. Just as people require a balanced diet and cannot survive on vitamins alone, citizens cannot and should not rely on campaign advertising as their only source of political information. Ideally, campaign ads would simply serve as accompaniments to a more substantial informational diet. However, with declining news coverage of conventions and other political events, diminishing newspaper readership, and a din of heated opinion dominating the news media, campaign ads may be playing a larger and more important role than might otherwise be the case. And like any new nutritional supplement, the long‐term effects of ad exposure are unknown. In the short‐term, however, campaign advertising can help contribute to a healthy democracy."
"58","To create our measure of advertising exposure we first assigned every 2000 NES respondent to his or her correct media market. In order to do so, we received permission to use the confidential county‐of‐residence information from the National Election Studies, which enabled us to map counties to media markets. We then created from the CMAG data a file that contained the total number of ads aired in each market during each of the specific programs that NES asked viewership questions about (along with those aired on all other shows). This file was then merged with the NES dataset, so that for every NES respondent there was information on the total number of ads seen on each show in that respondent's media market. We rescaled the viewership questions to a 0–1 interval and multiplied each by the number of ads of particular types aired during the corresponding show. To account for the fact that most viewers do not watch all three major networks at once, we divided the number of ads aired on the morning, evening, and late evening news show categories by three. (Without this adjustment, the substantive results reported here would be largely the same.) For those shows with no specific NES exposure question (comprising about a third of all spots broadcast in 2000) we used mean viewership as an indicator of general television watching and multiplied this by ads aired on other shows. We then summed results of individual estimates. For example:                  "
"59","This procedure reduces the number of NES respondents for whom we can estimate an exposure measure. The total number of NES pre‐election respondents is 1,807. Some of these respondents were not in CMAG‐covered markets for 2000, and we therefore have no aggregate information on advertising totals for these respondents. This reduces the number of available respondents to 1,434. We conducted extensive analysis to see whether respondents living in top 75 markets differed systematically from other NES respondents. There are no significant differences with respect to political information, campaign interest, voter turnout, and a range of other variables. What differences we could detect were substantively small and did not systematically benefit respondents living in CMAG markets. Although the vast majority of these 1,434 respondents were interviewed in both the pre‐ and post election surveys, 213 were only interviewed in the pre‐election survey. Because the television viewing questions were only asked in the post‐election survey, we do not have an exposure estimate for these 213 respondents (who nevertheless live in markets covered by CMAG). Thus, we are left with a potential sample of 1,221 respondents for analysis."
