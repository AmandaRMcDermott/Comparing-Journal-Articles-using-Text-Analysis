"1","An organization (e.g., legislature, board, council, commission) is composed of an odd number of members,  where n is a positive integer. Its members make both procedural and policy choices. First, members choose a procedure  that governs policymaking. Second, members choose a policy p using a previously adopted procedure. A procedure is an allocation of proposal rights among the members. This is modeled as a vector of recognition probabilities ρ . A policy is simply a real number in the interval "
"2","Let  index the different members. A member's policy preferences are represented by the utility function  where v is differentiable, strictly decreasing, and strictly concave in the distance between policy and index. That means each member (1) has a single ideal point in the policy space, given by his index; (2) treats deviations from his or her ideal point symmetrically; and (3) is risk‐averse. We also assume that preferences over policy lotteries on  are order‐restricted, according to the index order: Given any two policy lotteries  for any  with i strictly prefers k indifferent, and j strictly prefers  then either  or .9"
"3","During the course of the game, members bargain sequentially over three variables: a standing procedure , an ad hoc procedure , and a policy p (see Table 1). A standing procedure can potentially govern all policy issues, whereas an ad hoc procedure is crafted specifically for one policy issue. Each of these choices is made through majority voting on alternatives generated through a standard bargaining protocol: (a) A member i is recognized according to the procedure  in effect. That is, member i is selected with probability  (b) The recognized legislator makes a proposal  (which generically denotes either a procedure  or a policy ). (c) If a majority approves, bargaining stops and the proposal  goes into effect; if the proposal  is rejected, then with continuation probability , bargaining continues according to steps (a)–(c); and with probability , bargaining stops and the default option  goes into effect.10"
"4","A bargaining protocol is thus defined by the triple  of procedure, continuation probability, and default option. Note that bargaining stops either because a majority has passed a proposal y or because bargaining had to stop with the default option . Let  denote the (endogenous) probability that the period‐t proposal  is accepted by a majority. Member i's payoff at the start of bargaining is               "
"5","The game starts in a “procedural state of nature” where members have equal proposal rights. This is represented by the equal‐recognition procedure  At the organizational stage, members bargain over a standing procedure  that can in principle govern all future policy choices, unless it is revoked on some issue. This choice is made under uncertainty about the continuation probability γ specific to future policy issues; γ has binary support  with . At the procedural/policy stage, a policy issue arises (γ is realized) and members choose a policy using either the standing procedure  if there is one, or an ad hoc procedure , or the equal‐recognition procedure .            "
"6","Organizational Stage (γ is uncertain):               "
"7","Procedural/Policy Stage (after a policy issue has come up, γ is realized):               "
"8","We highlight several features of the model. First, procedural choices ( and ) are made using the equal‐recognition procedure , the “procedural state of nature.” Equal recognition captures the intuition of informal parliamentary deliberation (e.g., Banks 1999). For instance, in the U.S. House of Representatives prior to the adoption of formal rules, the House operates under general parliamentary rules, namely, equal recognition and simple majority voting. The flip side of this principle is that revocation of the standing rules would thrust the House back to operating under general parliamentary rules unless and until a replacement procedure (standing or ad hoc) is adopted (Krehbiel 2013).            "
"9","Second, if a majority cannot agree on the current proposal, next‐period bargaining may stop leaving the default option in place. A natural interpretation is that members face opportunity costs from delaying a majority decision or, equivalently, that they are impatient. A high‐γ bargaining environment can be associated with a “major” policy issue, where patience and prolonged bargaining are justified by the importance of the final outcome.13"
"10","Third, patience at the organizational stage is captured by the parameter δ, the probability of a new round of bargaining over standing procedures. This can be large in presidential legislatures that have a fixed term, but it should be smaller in parliamentary legislatures where the legislature may be dissolved early. Note also that there are no costs of transitioning between the different bargaining games. For instance, when a standing procedure is in place, it is costless to switch to an ad hoc procedure. Thus, the persistence of a standing procedure in our model cannot be due to exogenous switching costs."
"11","Fourth, if members have adopted a standing procedure , there is no external commitment device to force them to later use it on a given policy issue (i.e., no binding procedural commitment). Once a policy issue arises (γ is realized), the standing procedure may be revoked in favor of an ad hoc or equal‐recognition procedure. Yet commitment may arise endogenously, namely, if the majority chooses to uphold the standing procedure ex post. The model can thus identify the conditions under which a standing procedure chosen ex ante is also preferred by a majority ex post.            "
"12","The game consists of a finite sequence of bargaining games. A full strategy for member i thus consists of (1) a voting strategy that chooses among bargaining games and (2) a bargaining strategy in each bargaining game. A bargaining game is a sequence of proposals and votes. A bargaining strategy is a mapping from the set of histories to the set of available actions. A history of length t is a collection of variables describing the identity of the recognized proposers, the policy each one proposed, and how each member voted. We restrict attention to stationary strategies, namely, strategies that are independent of the history of play up to the current period.            "
"13","Formally, a bargaining strategy for member i is a pair , where  is member i's proposal in any bargaining period when he or she is recognized and  is the set of proposals member i votes for in each period. The majority acceptance set is defined as the set of proposals for which a majority coalition L votes in favor: , where .            "
"14","We use the standard equilibrium concept for legislative bargaining games, namely, stationary undominated subgame perfect equilibrium.14 As in distributive bargaining models, we restrict attention to pure, symmetric strategies. A strategy profile is symmetric if any two nonmedian members i and  with identical procedural rights use proposal and voting strategies that are symmetric relative to the median. Thus, any asymmetry in equilibrium outcomes has to arise from incentives induced by the bargaining environment.15                              "
"15","Definition 1.A bargaining equilibrium is a profile of symmetric stationary strategies  that satisfy two conditions:                  "
"16","               "
"17","Our model features two types of bargaining: bargaining over procedures, followed by bargaining over policies. Despite being played over different choice spaces (i.e., simplex versus one‐dimensional interval), policy and procedural bargaining share two key features: The median is decisive and the equilibrium is no‐delay.               "
"18","Proposition 1.In stationary bargaining over policies or procedures, a proposal  passes if and only if it has the vote of the median. That is, the majority acceptance set is the median's acceptance set: "
"19","Proof.See the SI appendix. "
"20","To see this, note that any vote is in essence a binary choice between two “policy lotteries.” A policy proposal p is voted on against the wait option, which is a lottery between the status quo q and future policy proposals. A procedural proposal , which itself is a policy lottery, is voted on against the wait option, which is a (composite) policy lottery of alternative procedural proposals. Single‐peakedness over policies and order restriction over policy lotteries then ensure that given two policy lotteries, the ideal points of the first lottery's supporters lie on one side from the ideal points of the second lottery's supporters. Therefore, the winning coalition has to include the median.16"
"21","In the supporting information, we show that an equilibrium in pure strategies exists for policy, procedural, and organizational bargaining and has to be no‐delay (i.e., a majority accepts the proposal made in the first round of bargaining). The no‐delay property follows from complete information about other members' preferences and risk aversion. Intuitively, delaying is unappealing because it creates uncertainty about the final outcome, since it is uncertain which member is recognized next.17"
"22","Proposition 1 is critical for our argument because it implies that an equilibrium procedure in our game always has the consent of a majority (i.e., is “majoritarian”). In the case of a standing procedure, majoritarian consent is expressed under uncertainty about future policy issues; at that point, it only has an ex ante meaning. If the standing procedure is upheld ex post, after the issue uncertainty has dissipated, it has a majority's ex post consent as well."
"23","The median's ability to shape policy and procedure depends on his or her bargaining power, a function of the continuation probability  and the default option . As the continuation probability goes up, the median's willingness to wait for his or her turn to propose increases, restricting the proposer's viable choices. Similarly, as the value of the median's default option increases, the median is less willing to make policy concessions, reducing the proposer's ability to move policy or procedure away from the median's preferred alternative.               "
"24","Proposition 2.In a no‐delay bargaining equilibrium  over policies or procedures, the median's influence over bargaining outcomes, measured by the median's bargaining value  weakly increases when (a) the continuation probability  increases and (b) the median's default option value  increases.                  "
"25","Proof.See the SI appendix. "
"26","The median's influence over bargaining outcomes can be seen most easily in the case of policy bargaining. Here, given  the median's influence can be captured by the policy deviation, denoted by  that the median is willing to tolerate. The median's equilibrium acceptance set can be shown to be of the form , which by Proposition 1 is also the majority acceptance set. Then  and  are the sets of moderate, respectively extreme, members relative to policy deviation  that is, members inside, respectively outside, the median's acceptance set. Proposition 2 says that the majority acceptance set shrinks with patience and a more moderate default option. Note that before policy bargaining starts, according to a predetermined procedure  and patience γ, the final policy outcome is generally uncertain.18 Moderate proposers will be able to pass their ideal point by proposing  whereas extreme proposers will pass  Thus, any given procedure  is associated with a policy lottery:               "
"27","Example.A numerical example of the model is useful to build intuition for the model's mechanisms. Below we show that this intuition carries over to the general environment of our model. Consider a five‐member organization,  with quadratic policy preferences . The policy default option has  The organizational continuation probability is  The policymaking continuation probability γ has a binary distribution:  with probability m, and  with probability . The calculations supporting the following claims are in SI Appendix B.                  "
"28","Table 2 displays the equilibrium policy proposals under the equal‐recognition procedure versus ad hoc procedures, separately for major and minor policy issues. (To conserve space, we omit proposals from members −1 and −2; they are symmetric to proposals from members 1 and 2.) Notice that the median's higher patience on major issues significantly decreases the policy deviation under equal recognition, from 2 to 0.913. Under ad hoc procedures, just as with the equal‐recognition procedure, the median's higher patience on major issues reduces the size of the policy deviation. Importantly, this policy moderation is partly achieved through procedural moderation: ad hoc procedures give the median more proposal rights on major issues than on minor issues.19"
"29","In equilibrium, the median prefers an ad hoc procedure, even, for instance, the most extreme one,  = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0.667, 0.333), to the equal‐recognition procedure  (the bargaining default). The reason is that an ad hoc procedure, by restricting proposal rights to two members, reduces policy variance enough to compensate the median for policy bias. By order restriction of preferences over policy lotteries, the majority on the favored side of the median agrees. Ex ante, on each policy issue, all members prefer replacing the equal‐recognition procedure with a yet‐to‐be‐determined ad hoc procedure, since overall policy variance is lower. We call this effect “procedural efficiency.” See Proposition 3 below.            "
"30","Table 3 presents the equilibrium standing procedures and their resultant policy outcomes, for three values of the parameter m. (To conserve space, we omit proposals from members −1 and −2: they are symmetric to proposals from members 1 and 2.) Standing procedures can be either median or nonmedian, the latter being asymmetric in the sense of allocating proposal rights on one side of the median. The median always has proposal rights under a standing procedure. In contrast, it never has rights under an asymmetric ad hoc procedure on minor issues: Compare Tables 2 and 3. Because of that, the median always upholds the standing procedure on a minor issue. The question is whether that also happens on a major issue.            "
"31","On a major issue, a nonmedian standing procedure may be worse for a majority than turning to ad hoc procedures. For example, when , the standing procedure  is more extreme than the most extreme =(0, 0, 0.528, 0.418, 0). In these cases a majority revokes the standing procedure on a major issue.20 As major issues become more prevalent (larger m), the equilibrium standing procedure becomes more moderate. The reason is simple. The median's default option value is ad hoc procedures (by the procedural efficiency argument above), which yield a higher payoff on major issues (when they are more moderate). Thus, the median has a better bargaining position relative to nonmedian proposers. When , a nonmedian standing procedure is just barely upheld on a major issue (weak persistence); when m = 0.9 a nonmedian standing procedure is easily upheld on a major issue (strict persistence).21"
"32","What are the general conditions for persistence of the standing procedure, and in particular an asymmetric, restrictive one? We characterize these conditions below in Proposition 4. This example illustrates the two main results of this article: first, the procedural efficiency property of adopted procedures; and second, a majority's self‐enforcing commitment to an asymmetric (policy‐biasing) standing procedure.            "
"33","Does a majority of members have an incentive to alter the “procedural state of nature”? If so, how does the chosen ad hoc procedure compare to the symmetric and unrestricted equal‐recognition procedure? We find that ad hoc procedures are substantively different from the default equal‐recognition procedure.               "
"34","Proposition 3.An equilibrium ad hoc procedure is (a) asymmetric, unless proposed by the median, and (b) restrictive, giving “effective” proposal rights to a minority, unless "
"35","Proof.See the SI appendix. "
"36","To understand these properties, consider the proposer's problem. Let  denote the ad hoc procedures proposed in equilibrium for a given policy issue with continuation probability γ. Each of these proposals maximizes the proposing member's, say member i's, expected payoff subject to the no‐delay constraint, from Proposition 1, that the median prefers the proposal to waiting for another bargaining round:               "
"37","Because the median treats deviations from his or her ideal point symmetrically, a nonmedian proposer will have no incentive to allocate proposal rights on the opposite side of the median. Therefore, the equilibrium ad hoc procedure is asymmetric, unless proposed by the median. Moreover, the proposer and the median, being risk‐averse, have a common interest in reducing policy volatility. They both benefit from a concentration of proposal rights toward members located between the proposer and the median. Thus, in equilibrium, proposal rights are restricted to a minority of members.22"
"38","The equilibrium ad hoc procedure in fact displays a “limited power sharing” (LPS) property: At most, two members have “effective” proposal rights (i.e., proposal power) and, if two, they are adjacent to each other. A proposer is “effective” if transferring his or her proposal rights to the next more moderate member changes the equilibrium policy outcome.23                              "
"39","Definition 2.An LPS procedure is a procedure  that allocates “effective” proposal rights to at most two adjacent members:  for some member j.                  "
"40","LPS procedures are interesting because members' preferences over LPS procedures are single‐peaked with respect to the “average proposer”  Thus, LPS procedures can be ranked in terms of their degree of extremism vis‐á‐vis the median. They play an important role in our formal results below.                  "
"41","Proposition 4.(a) Policy outcomes under an asymmetric ad hoc procedure  are biased but less volatile relative to the equal‐recognition procedure .                  "
"42","(b) The median (a majority) benefits more from an asymmetric procedure when the continuation probability is larger:  with strict inequality for an ad hoc procedure proposed by an extreme member, .                  "
"43","Proof.See the SI appendix. "
"44","These features of equilibrium ad hoc procedures help answer the first question raised in this article, namely the rationale for asymmetric procedures: If ad hoc procedures are almost always asymmetric (Proposition 2), creating policy bias (Proposition 4), why does the median consent to them in the first place? The reason is a reduction in the uncertainty of the final policy outcome.24 This trade‐off is more beneficial to the median when patience is higher. The median resolves this trade‐off in favor of restrictive procedures both ex post and ex ante.               "
"45","Proposition 5.(Procedural Efficiency) When deciding under what procedure to consider a given policy issue, all members gain ex ante by voting to replace the default equal‐recognition procedure  with ad hoc procedures .                  "
"46","Proof.See the SI appendix. "
"47","This proposition formalizes a novel rationale for asymmetric procedures that does not arise in the well‐established distributive, informational, and partisan approaches mentioned in the introduction. We refer to this rationale as “procedural efficiency,” for two reasons. First, endogenous ad hoc procedures have a statistical efficiency property since they reduce policy volatility relative to the “procedural state of nature” of the equal‐recognition procedure. Second, they have a distributive efficiency property since ad hoc procedures ex ante Pareto‐dominate the equal‐recognition procedure.25"
"48","“Standing” procedures derive their name from their persistent use during the lifetime of an organization. However, in self‐governing organizations, their persistence is not de jure (based on an external commitment device, such as a constitutional or statutory requirement) but de facto (based on members' strategic calculations). Why would members adopt a standing procedure at all, given uncertainty about the policy issues that will arise in the future? Additionally, if a standing procedure is adopted, under what conditions is it persistent, that is, when will a majority of members want to continue using it ex post?"
"49","To understand the choice of standing procedures, consider a proposer's problem. Let  denote the standing procedures proposed by members in equilibrium. Each of these proposals maximizes the proposing member's, say member i's, expected payoff subject to the constraint, captured in Proposition 1, that the median prefers the proposal to waiting. The standing procedure may be replaced with an ad hoc procedure. Let  denote member i's expected bargaining payoff under an adopted standing procedure. Formally, it is defined by  if  (the median upholds the standing procedure ), and otherwise  (the median revokes the standing procedure ). Note that by the procedural efficiency argument of Proposition 5, the fallback option in organizational bargaining will be a set of ad hoc procedures, either  or  depending on whether the issue is major or minor. Then, the proposer's problem is               "
"50","To streamline the analysis of the organizational equilibrium, we impose the following regularity condition on the patience parameters  and :               "
"51","The role of this condition is twofold: First, it ensures that standing procedures are more vulnerable to revocation on major issues than on minor issues;26 second, it simplifies the characterization and comparative statics of the organizational equilibrium by reducing the dimensionality of the equilibrium standing procedures—see Lemma 3 in the SI appendix. The condition is weak in the sense that it stacks the deck against finding procedural persistence, since it makes possible very moderate ad hoc procedures on major issues that the standing procedure will be compared to.            "
"52","An equilibrium standing procedure shares the basic qualitative features of an equilibrium ad hoc procedure, namely, asymmetry and restrictiveness.               "
"53","Proposition 6.In equilibrium, a standing procedure is: (a) asymmetric, unless proposed by the median, and (b) restrictive, that is, allocates “effective” proposal rights to a minority, unless "
"54","Proof.See the SI appendix. "
"55","To pass, a proposed standing procedure must be acceptable to the median. This allows proposers to keep proposal rights on their side. Risk aversion restricts proposal rights to a few members between the proposer and the median.               "
"56","Definition 3.An equilibrium standing procedure  is said to be strictly persistent if a majority upholds it on both major () and minor () policy issues. An equilibrium standing procedure  is said to be weakly persistent if a majority weakly upholds it on one type of policy issue and (strictly or weakly) upholds it on the other type of issue. An equilibrium standing procedure  is said to be partially persistent if a majority revokes it on a major issue. 27"
"57","Definition 4.An organizational equilibrium is said to be (a) strictly persistent if all proposed standing procedures  are strictly persistent; (b) weakly persistent if the proposed standing procedures  are either strictly persistent or weakly persistent, and (c) partially persistent if at least one of the proposed standing procedures  is partially persistent.                  "
"58","The following proposition states necessary and sufficient conditions under which each type of equilibrium occurs."
"59","Proposition 7.(Procedural Persistence). There exist  and  such that the organizational equilibrium is: (a) strictly persistent if  or , (b) weakly persistent if  or , or (c) partially persistent if  or "
"60","Proof.See the SI appendix. "
"61","In a strictly persistent equilibrium, the median proposes  whereas all other (nonmedian) members j propose an LPS procedure  that includes the median, which is the maximal procedural deviation that the median tolerates, determined by a binding no‐delay condition as in condition 6. This type of equilibrium obtains for large values of δ and m, namely, those above the cutoff values  that make  barely survive on major issues:               "
"62","In a weakly persistent strategy, the proposer's standing procedure keeps the median just indifferent on major issues so as to appropriate policy rents from both major and minor issues; the cost is that proposal rights have to be more broadly spread to include the median, therefore increasing policy volatility; see the non‐LPS procedure  for  in Table 3 above. In a partially persistent strategy, the proposer's more extreme standing procedure forsakes policy rents on major issues to more efficiently extract policy rents from minor issues. The optimal choice between weakly and partially persistent strategies is thus driven by a trade‐off between procedural efficiency and policy bias, which depends on δ and m. If organizational patience is high, the median will bargain hard on the standing procedure, limiting the inefficiency cost of extracting rents from both major and minor issues. If major issues are more prevalent, the proposer prefers to make the bulk of his or her policy rents on major issues.            "
"63","The key intuition for persistence is that a standing procedure is strictly upheld ex post if it is sufficiently favorable to the median to start with. Otherwise, on a major policy issue, the median may prefer to use the relatively more moderate ad hoc procedures instead. By Proposition 1 the median's influence over the standing procedure is increasing in organizational patience (δ) and the median's default option value (higher prevalence m of major issues with moderate ad hoc procedures). The result that the standing procedure is more persistent when major issues dominate the agenda may appear counterintuitive at first. One might expect that a standing procedure should be more resilient when future policy issues are mostly minor, since these allow relatively more extreme ad hoc procedures, deterring the median from revoking the standing procedure. However, a default option of more extreme ad hoc procedures also reduces the median's initial influence over the standing procedure; thus, on a major policy issue using ad hoc procedures may be preferable.28"
"64","Regardless of who the proposer will be, the median gains by agreeing to adopt a standing procedure, since it cannot produce more policy volatility than ad hoc procedures.               "
"65","Proposition 8.A standing procedure is adopted in equilibrium. If the adopted standing procedure is asymmetric, its associated policy bias disappears if and only if ( i.e., perfect patience at the organizational stage).                  "
"66","Proof.See the SI appendix. "
"67","In this result we see again members' procedural efficiency incentives at work: Ex ante, members benefit from further reducing the procedural uncertainty of ad hoc procedures. Proposition 5 also shows that in our model, policy bias is the norm; it disappears only when the median itself proposes the standing procedure or in the the knife‐edge case of perfect bargaining patience.29"
"68","Mature self‐governing organizations almost always adopt a set of standing procedures that govern their deliberations. Jameson attributes the first mention of a standing committee to an April 1571 entry into the British House of Commons Journal, noting that “here we for the first time find a committee charged, not with a single bill or set of bills, but with a general subject, with an entire division of the business of the house” (1894, 249). In the U.S. Congress, standing committees began to take shape within the first 20 years after the Constitution established the congress. By 1825, both the House and the Senate had developed a system of standing committees that has dominated its procedures until today. Gamm and Shepsle (1989) link this development to the increased legislative activity associated with the War of 1812 against Great Britain.30 In our model, this corresponds to a higher prevalence of major issues.         "
"69","While serving as vice president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson had drafted a Manual of Parliamentary Practice for the U.S. Senate, published in 1801. It was the first such document for Congress, and it is still in use today. In it, he wrote:            "
"70","It is much more material that there should be a rule to go by, than what that rule is; that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in business, not subject to the caprice of the Speaker, or captiousness of the members. It is very material that order, decency, and regularity be preserved in a dignified public body (1801, 2)."
"71","The procedural efficiency incentives in our model resonate with the call for “uniformity” and “regularity” of proceedings that Jefferson wanted to see as president of the U.S. Senate. While ad hoc procedures perform a procedural efficiency role, standing procedures reduce procedural uncertainty even further, especially when they are persistent, benefiting all risk‐averse members.31"
"72","Our model further explains how bias‐generating asymmetric procedures can be persistent in equilibrium. Our persistence mechanism is predicated on the notion that once a standing procedure is in place, a majority would rather avoid amplifying the policy uncertainty that necessarily accompanies the adoption of a replacement ad hoc procedure. Consistent with the historical record, our model demonstrates that persistent standing procedures should be a feature of developed, full‐time organizations (high δ) or those whose agenda is dominated by major policy issues (high m). Under these conditions, the standing procedure is more moderate, reducing a majority's policy bias cost from upholding them.32"
"73","The model has several empirical implications. Across organizations and over time, we should observe greater procedural persistence as well as more procedural prerogatives delegated to moderate members when the organization's agenda is dominated by critical policy issues (e.g., economic recession, tax reform, electoral reform) or within committees whose jurisdiction is dominated by major issues (e.g., Ways and Means in the U.S. House). If δ is interpreted as reelection probability, we should observe greater procedural persistence associated with lower member turnover. 33"
"74","In conclusion, our model provides microfoundations for the common assumption of procedural commitment in the endogeneous institutions literature. It proposes a new way of thinking about the nature of policymaking procedures, as it sheds light on basic efficiency‐driven incentives to adopt persistently asymmetric procedures, commonly observed in self‐governing organizations. This suggests a more nuanced understanding of the notion of majoritarianism. In our model, both procedures and policy are majoritarian in the sense that the median is part of every procedural and policy coalition (Krehbiel 1991, 16). However, systematic policy bias can still exist in equilibrium. Thus, policy bias is not necessarily inconsistent with procedural majoritarianism. Empirical work is necessary to determine the pervasiveness of this effect, as well as the magnitude of the implied policy bias.         "
"75","Combining our procedural efficiency approach with the informational approach would introduce incentives for specialization into policy jurisdictions and may provide a new theoretical perspective and testable implications in the long‐standing debate over whether congressional committees are composed of preference outliers (see, e.g., Stewart 2001). In organizations whose members are elected through political parties, such as national or state legislatures or city councils, the majoritarian puzzle in the introduction can be restated to more precisely identify the procedurally advantaged minority: a majority of the majority party (Krehbiel 2013). One possibility is that majority party agenda control can be counteracted through competitive vote buying by the minority party (Krehbiel, Meirowitz, and Wiseman 2013), limiting policy deviations from the median. Another answer may be that procedural control provides all majority party members ex ante policy benefits (Diermeier and Vlaicu 2011b) and ex post procedural efficiency benefits that make it immune to majoritarian safeguards. More broadly, our procedural persistence logic could be applied to the study of institutional choice in self‐governing majoritarian societies (see, e.g., Acemoglu and Robinson 2008; Jeon 2012; Lagunoff 2009) where issues of democratic stability are of paramount importance.
