"1","The majority of quantitative research on interstate conflict is, at its heart, about explaining policy choice or more specifically about what makes states choose one particular and rare policy (armed conflict) over others. The literature increasingly addresses a range of choices leaders make as they guide their states in international affairs. That awareness has broadened scholarship in international relations beyond the decision to wage war to decisions to sanction (e.g., Drezner 1999; Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott 1990), to cooperate (e.g., Leeds 1999; Martin 2000), or to trade (e.g., Hiscox 2002; Mansfield and Pollins 2003; Simmons 1997), to name a few of the international outcomes of interest in the literature. While the diversity of outcomes has broadened considerably, the manner in which scholars approach these topics is surprisingly homogeneous in one crucial way. Most work isolates the outcome of interest as some discrete variable where a reference category captures all behavior other than the narrow outcome of interest. Those “other” policy alternatives are unspecified and treated as the aggregate of everything that comprises “not the outcome of interest.”         "
"2","Two largely undiscussed problems arise from this (very common) approach in models of international relations. First, by construction, the exogenous factors alleged to influence the probability of conflict (Pr(Y=1)) also very probably influence the chances states implement other sorts of coercive foreign policy short of armed conflict (Pr(Y=0)); they may also shape the chances of cooperation, which is relegated to the reference category as well. So X will have a positive or negative effect on both the chances of armed conflict, and on the chances of other coercive policies that are coded as zero, the absence of armed conflict. The likely outcome is that estimates are biased. Though this superficially appears to be a measurement or methodological problem, it really is a shortcoming of theory insofar as theories of conflict are usually aimed at explaining a very narrow range of foreign policy behavior rather than the broader class of foreign policy behavior (say, coercion) of which the resort to arms is but one type. Such a narrow theoretical conception has the consequence of implying a very narrow and rare empirical dependent variable, usually binary. And that binary variable requires the perfectly reasonable presumption that the latent variable of interest is the unobserved probability of armed conflict. This is the general pathway by which the community of conflict scholars arrives at the convention of estimating probability models of binary dependent variables in which X is correlated in the same direction with both Pr(Y=1) and Pr(Y=0).         "
"3","The discrete and narrow outcome approach common in the literature has a second important consequence. By measuring a variable like conflict as a binary outcome where other coercive foreign policies are measured in the “other” category, conflict and coercive actions short of conflict are, again by construction, mutually exclusive. Naturally, that is the point of coding the variable in this manner, but the empirical restriction is that states cannot engage in conflict and simultaneously impose economic sanctions, or form alliances, trade, or do any other thing with each other. Those behaviors are “other” and cannot occur in the same period of observation as conflict. In a strange way, this practice forces conflict and all other policies to be strict substitutes for one another in the sense that undertaking one policy precludes undertaking any other policy in the same period."
"4","Because we believe the empirical consequences we describe above are, at their root, theoretical problems, we undertake a broader conceptualization of foreign policy choice that allows us to model leaders engaged in a form of foreign policy substitution, though somewhat different from that described in much of the substitution literature (e.g., Most and Starr 1989). The foreign policy substitution literature has its beginning in work by Most and Starr (1984, 1989). A growing body of work on substitution provides evidence that leaders substitute in a range of areas, including repression (Moore 2000), intervention (Regan 2000), rivalry termination (Bennett and Nordstrom 2000), humanitarian aid (McGinnis 2000), and tradeoffs between force and economic sanctions (Clark 2001; Clark and Reed 2005) and between arming and allying (Diehl 1994; McGinnis 1990; Morgan and Palmer 1997; Palmer and Morgan 2006).1 We make the argument that rethinking the conceptual variable (e.g., conflict) as a broader foreign policy type (e.g., coercive foreign policy) implies a range of levels of foreign policy choice; states implement some level of coercion toward other states, instead of either taking armed action or not. Conceiving of foreign policy coercion further implies a different latent variable than is typical in analyses of conflict; it implies that states make choices among levels of foreign policy coercion based on some scale that we argue is centered around the costs associated with such policies. Moreover, we suggest conceiving of foreign policy cost more generally is a powerful pathway by which we can theorize about and predict the sets of foreign policies states implement. If cost is the latent variable on which leaders make foreign policy choices, we might productively employ the metaphor that leaders are, in some senses, consumers and, like consumers in the marketplace, will choose policies (goods) based on cost relative to resources. In other words, as economists suggest is true of consumers choosing goods, leaders may substitute policies or employ packages of policies as complements to one another. Finally, as economists argue in the case of consumers, increasing resources may not only increase the mean level of spending, but will increase the variability in spending as well. Some wealthy consumers will save little while others will save a great deal; the variability in their spending and consumption is far wider than the variability in poor consumers' spending, which will always be relatively low. Likewise, though states with lots of resources can “afford” more costly foreign policy packages, they will not always do so; the variability in the foreign policies of resource‐rich states will be greater than that of resource‐poor states.         "
"5","Most work in world politics on substitution searches for evidence of substitution rather than for the causes of it (though Palmer and Morgan [2006] is a notable example). Evidence of foreign policy substitution arises when apparently similar circumstances or causal factors produce different foreign policy outcomes; this mirrors Most and Starr's (1989) definition of substitution. And so one of the principle difficulties in theorizing on the sources of foreign policy substitution or searching for evidence of substitution is understanding how or why similar causes can produce different outcomes.         "
"6","The answer we propose to that question returns to two basic claims. First, leaders are sensitive to the cost of policy relative to available resources. Second, as Most and Starr suggest, the sources of the macrobehavioral phenomena like war or peace that social scientists seek to understand have microfoundations, so considering variability across individual states and their circumstances is essential to understanding the variation in their choices among foreign policies. Foreign policy substitution occurs when the cost of one policy exceeds what a leader can or will expend for it, and she seeks an alternative policy aimed at achieving the same goal. There are potentially many policy paths to any foreign policy goal, and leaders make their decisions based in large part on the costs associated with those policies. For instance, security on the Korean peninsula is a foreign policy goal American presidents have sought for more than half a century, but the policy tools they have employed at different times have varied from humanitarian aid, to diplomatic pressure, to sanctions, to war. The circumstances under which these widely varied foreign policies have been chosen have not always been so divergent as to make clear that under one circumstance, the outcome is war, and under another, the outcome is aid. Instead, apparently similar circumstances have bred quite different policy outcomes."
"7","How can similar sets of circumstances, say similar costs and resources, produce different policy outcomes? Suppose leader i generically has to make foreign policy decisions in a two‐dimensional space where she chooses policy packages that mix along the two dimensions. For convenience, label these dimensions conflictual foreign policy and cooperative foreign policy; so the leader chooses some amounts of conflict and cooperation toward another state. Leader i considers policy package xj in this space where j= (0, 1, …n) possible policy packages. For simplicity, suppose leader i has two policy packages x1 and x2 in that two‐dimensional space from which to choose on the basis of the utility of each defined in terms of the leader's spatial ideal point zi, resources Ri, and foreign policy costs ci1, ci2 and idiosyncratic shocks to preferences, εi1, εi2, that are particular to a specific foreign policy decision maker. If U(zi, x1, ci1 | Ri, εi1) > U(zi, x2, ci2 | Ri, εi2), leaders choose x1, and vice versa. The utility function for x1 rises as |x1−zi| and ci1 decrease. Likewise, the utility function for x1 increases with Ri. Aggregating across state leaders i= 1, 2, … , N there will be some mean probability of choosing x1. We can write this as a probability model by pulling out the idiosyncratic shock terms.            "
"8","If we let F be the cdf of −εi=εi2−εi1 and we simplify |x1−zi1| =di1 and |x2−zi2| =di2, we can write:            "
"9","For the purposes of simplification, we assume that V is linear. As a result we can write:            "
"10","As the ratio of the cost of policy package x1 to resources increases, the utility for x1 declines as does the probability of its selection. So, suppose that x1 is inordinately expensive, so only states with the most resources can choose policy mix x1. As ci1 climbs, the number of states with the resources to choose x1 declines, but the variance in policy choice increases because the few states that can afford x1 will not always choose it, but will sometimes choose less costly policies instead. Where leaders are indifferent between x1 and x2, and where ci2=ci1, policy choice is determined by other exogenous factors, and the variance is large. In this manner, similar circumstances (similar costs, similar resources) can produce different policy outcomes. In the former case where the variance is small, dissimilar circumstances will produce similar outcomes. In either case, substitution occurs in the variance surrounding policy choice.         "
"11","We expect that εi will vary with a state's ability to purchase more foreign policy. Specifically, we expect the difference between εi1 and εi2 to be a function of a state's capabilities. Substantively, this suggests that the variability in foreign policy choice will be a function of capabilities, or more specifically, that resources will increase states' foreign policy variance when states are indifferent between x1 and x2. Weaker states with fewer resources will choose foreign policies with less variability when they are indifferent between x1 and x2, and will be more likely to choose policies based strictly on the costs of those policies. This is because of the importance of resources to the capacity to afford foreign policies. Contrast this to strong states that can afford a variety of policies, and thus choose less on the basis of cost and more on the basis of preference, or proximity to ideal points. This is because, in equation (4) above, resource‐rich states will have (ci2−ci1)/Ri approaching zero, so costs effectively drop out of the probability function for choosing policy x1. It also points to the importance of understanding variance in behavior as a function of observable characteristics of the foreign policy decision makers. It is also consistent with our claim that it will be very difficult to understand much of the variability in foreign policy choice before first recognizing that observables can affect both the mean and variance of foreign policy decision making.         "
"12","So far, we have articulated a model that is consistent with the existing literature, though it is stated explicitly in terms of the costs associated with policies. Let us begin to lay out such a logic aimed at the goal of putting forward a research design sufficient to test the general hypothesis that substitution arises for different reasons between leaders with more resources and those with fewer. It is increasingly accepted that leaders choose from an array of foreign policies, a “toolbox” as Palmer and Morgan (2006) put it. That leaders facing apparently similar circumstances choose different foreign policies also finds support in the literature, and in fact, this is the precise definition of substitutability Most and Starr (1989) articulate. That definition explicitly recognizes variability as the key to substitution, and even suggests that such variability might arise from otherwise unapparent sources. So superficially, it appears that we are on the right track in seeking to explain foreign policy substitution in terms of variability.         "
"13","Our model suggests two particular kinds of variability. The first has to do with different behavior based on some exogenous characteristic; put another way, this variability arises from executives having different mean responses to some variable. The second has to do with the variance surrounding those mean responses; some variable not only produces different mean responses but those different means are surrounded by different variances. Substitution is usually conceived in the former terms; an increase in some factor leads some executives to choose policy package x1, while it leads others to select policy package x2. This conception, however, does not fully account for substitution—for executives to have different responses to the same circumstance, another variable must somehow affect the relationship, perhaps as a treatment effect. What that treatment might be is not apparent. The second type of variability, on the other hand, more fully accounts for the notion of substitution because it accepts that leaders may in fact have similar mean responses to a variable, but suggests they have these mean responses with different variances. So the apparently similar circumstances that surround leaders' choices produce responses that vary in their uniformity, in their consistency, not necessarily in their means.         "
"14","If we accept that Most and Starr's definition of substitution anticipates a causal process rooted in variability, or more particularly, variance, our model fits very closely with their definition and suggests a way to overcome the dual problems laid out at the beginning of this discussion. The unobservables we note above can be classified as having to do with the causes and outcomes respectively; cost relative to resources is explicitly a cause of observed foreign policy behavior, or more accurately, it determines the magnitude of a cause by either magnifying or discounting the effect of exogenous factors on policy choice. But cost relative to resources is posited to represent how individual state variability affects policy choice. So conceiving of cost relative to resources as shaping the variance in policy choice suggests costs, however measured, should not only shape executives' mean responses but should shape the variance surrounding those responses as well—in plain terms (and the irony in this will become apparent quickly), the relationship is heteroskedastic. Further, the outcome, formally the choice of either x1 or x2, arises either because a leader chose to substitute or because she had no choice at all. This too arises from the unobserved relationship between costs and resources.         "
"15","Both of these forms of variability can be thought of as general expectations of the model, each of which leads to a testable hypothesis. The first, concerning the mean level of behavior, is that as a state's resources increase, its policy choices will, on average, be more costly. States with greater resource capacity will have greater capacity to choose more costly policies or packages of policies and more of them than do poorer states. So as the costs of policies increase, greater resources are required for states to choose those policies. The concept of resources is usefully operationalized in this context as state capabilities. Thus, the logic of our general expectations translates into the notion that states with greater capabilities can and therefore will on average choose more costly (more intense) policies, while states with lesser capabilities will on average select less costly (less intense) policies—both of these pertain to cooperative or coercive policies."
"16","                        "
"17","States with greater capabilities (resources) will engage in higher (more costly) levels of cooperation and conflict than will states with lesser capabilities (resources)."
"18","Our second expectation concerns the uniformity of policy choice. It follows from the model that, in general, as a state's resources increase, so does its discretion over policy, to the point that when the ratio of costs to resources approaches zero, states choose based on individual factors based on preferences. So that state's choices will be widely variant with respect to cost, because states with greater resources will have greater latitude over policy choice and will sometimes choose “cheap” policies and sometimes will choose expensive ones. Put differently, when powerful states are indifferent between policies, so di1=di2, they choose on the basis of εi. Where resources are limited, choices are also limited by costs, and so such states have less latitude in policy choice; they are forced to select less expensive policies, and do so on the basis of costs relative to resources ((ci2−ci1)/Ri) rather than preference (di1, di2).         "
"19","                        "
"20","States with greater capabilities will be more variant in their policy choices with respect to both cooperation and conflict than will states with lesser capabilities."
"21","In addition, we anticipate a relationship between the two dimensions in the formal model, the amounts of cooperation and conflict, though we remain agnostic as to the direction of that relationship since states may substitute one for the other (in which case the relationship will be negative) or may employ both as complements to one another (in which case the relationship will be positive). Interestingly, the general practice in the literature of isolating discrete foreign policy outcomes is equivalent to assuming these dimensions are unrelated to one another. We choose, instead, explicitly to relax that assumption and allow for the likelihood choices on these dimensions are related. Put differently, by expecting conflict and cooperation to be related, we are relaxing the restriction common to the literature that cooperation and conflict are substitutes. Our formulation allows leaders to substitute between x1 and x2 along their indifference curves and allows for the possibility of choosing both x1 and x2 as complements.2"
"22","                        "
"23","Cooperation will influence the level of conflict in which a state engages."
"24","The theoretical model we have described has leaders choosing among policies on two dimensions, one conflictual, the other cooperative. Moreover, the theoretical model indicates resources will shape both the average policies states choose and the variance surrounding those averages. Empirically, the model implies two estimation equations, one for the level of conflict, one for the level of cooperation, each with a mean vector and a variance vector since we have hypotheses on the effects of X variables on both the mean and variance of Y. Moreover, the theoretical model requires these dimensions not be assumed independent since leaders may choose mixes of policies on the two dimensions. To assume independence would force substitution; leaders would have to choose one dimension at the expense of the other. Structurally, the model is as follows:            "
"25","We now need to identify an empirical domain in which we can test the hypotheses and evaluate the general claim that substitution is in the variance. To do that, we turn to a pair of fundamental policy types from which leaders select, and we hypothesize on why and when leaders will substitute between them. In a general sense, states adopt policies that are either coercive or cooperative. States may prefer one to the other or they may (and most often do) mix the two as they implement foreign policies. In any case, we can characterize states' foreign policies along these two dimensions. We think, incidentally, that these are two dimensions, not two ends of a single dimension, because of the theoretical relationship between conflict and cooperation. From the standpoint of what Most and Starr (1989) call “interaction opportunity,” states that interact more should probably experience increased levels of both cooperation and conflict (rather than one or the other), whereas states that interact less should probably experience less of both. As a result, states should pursue conflictual and cooperative policies at the same time, though depending on exogenous factors, they may sometimes substitute one for the other. We explicitly treat conflict and cooperation as separate policy dimensions because treating them as endpoints of the same policy continuum (as many studies using events data in fact do) requires the assumption that a one‐unit increase in cooperation produces a one‐unit decrease in conflict, and vice versa. In other words, treating cooperation and conflict as endpoints of a single policy dimension, scholars assume one‐to‐one substitutability between levels of conflict and cooperation. Not only is this an extremely restrictive assumption in general, but also this assumption is in many ways what our theory and hypotheses point to as a matter for empirical examination. By treating conflict and cooperation as separate dimensions, we omit this assumption and thus leave the relationship between conflict and cooperation to theory (e.g., Most and Starr's interaction opportunity) and empirical testing.         "
"26","Our decision to examine policy choices along these two continua arises from two principle beliefs. First, as many scholars note, state leaders have a wide‐ranging set of policy tools at their disposal. And as we have said above, standard treatments in the conflict literature examine a very limited domain of policies, mainly the decision to use armed force abroad, and those treatments relegate all other policies to the reference category. We believe that doing so almost certainly masks the more complex relationship between the causal factors important to world politics and foreign policy choice. Examining cooperation and conflict takes an important step toward ameliorating that problem, as does the fact that we can account for the intensity and thus the costs of conflict or cooperation as well. So in our model, leaders can substitute among levels of cooperation, among levels of conflict, or between some level of conflict and some level of cooperation."
"27","Second, and equally important in our decision to consider conflict and cooperation jointly, the substitution literature with rare exception posits policies to be substitutes for one another rather than allowing for the possibility policies might be complements to one another. Few scholars would assert leaders choose single policies in the face of some foreign policy demand, yet most empirical examinations of policy choice impose just such a restriction. As we have noted above, this has two important, but unintended, consequences. First, any model of conflict examining a binary dependent variable (one equal to conflict, zero to its absence) formally restricts the X variables either to predict ones or zeros. Suppose, however, that the zero category contains some policy that policy makers often employ jointly with the use of force; that is, the zeros and ones are actually complements (rather than substitutes) to one another. Unfortunately, the model by its structure restricts them to be substitutes, and since X is actually correlated with both zero and one on the dependent variable, the analyst probably finds no relationship, or finds a weaker one than actually exists. This circumstance occurs in a majority of empirical models of conflict onset. Moreover, this sort of design produces a circumstance similar to the one described above in which scholars treat conflict and cooperation on a single dimension.         "
"28","Our second illustration pertains explicitly to the broad empirical domain we have chosen, namely conflict and cooperation. Most work treats conflict and cooperation as a single dimension. It would, for instance, not be uncommon to find empirical work that predicts a scale like the COPDAB scale from 1 to 15, asserting that a change in X will produce a β change in that scale. Likewise, it is common for scholars to subtract a state's level of cooperation from its level of conflict in a given period. In either case, the presumption is that a unit‐increase in conflict is equivalent to a unit‐decrease in cooperation. This, again, is explicitly the restriction that conflict and cooperation are substitute policies; an increase in one necessarily means a decrease in the other. These restrictions in extant models are enormously consequential if, in fact, conflict and cooperation are two different dimensions, and if they are policy domains leaders tend to employ as complements rather than as substitutes. This is an unnecessary restriction, and an empirical matter we address in our model.         "
"29","To measure conflict and cooperation, we employ the COPDAB database, which codes states' actions along these two dimensions; each action a state takes in a year is coded on a 7‐point cooperation scale or a 7‐point conflict scale.4 On each scale, increasing values indicate increasing conflict or cooperation and, therefore, more intense or costly policies. For each state, each year, we take the sum of each scale to indicate the level of cooperation and conflict the state engaged in during that year; these two variables (sum of cooperation, sum of conflict) are our two dependent variables. States can make trade‐offs between the levels of cooperation and conflict that characterize their policies depending on the constraints they face at home.         "
"30","To implement the model, we construct a data set of dyads between 1948 and 1978, containing a measure of conflict (the sum of conflictual events A implements toward B) and a measure of cooperation (the sum of cooperative events A implements toward B).5 Because COPDAB might overrepresent major powers and underrepresent other states, we restrict our analysis to the sample of major‐power dyads, that is, dyads containing at least one major power.6 With respect to conflict, we measure resources, our principle independent variable of interest, as each state's Correlates of War CINC score, which is the percent of power in the international system it holds in a particular year. With respect to cooperation, we measure resources as iron and steel production per capita, a rough measure of economic/industrial development. In both cases, we anticipate that higher values (of capabilities or development) will produce higher levels of conflict and cooperation, and greater variances in both. We control for the effects of democracy (a variable that should influence sensitivity to policy costs) and for the natural log of distance in both equations.7 We control in the conflict equation for whether the states in the dyad are allied (based on the Correlates of War alliance data), and in the cooperation equation, we control for how long the pair of states have jointly been members of the international system (mainly to identify the system of equations). Finally, in each equation we control for State B's resources mainly to account for the possibility that conflict and cooperation arise from relative capabilities (though not doing so has no effect on the estimates). Table 1 reports the results of estimation.         "
"31","The estimates in Table 1 are consistent with our expectations. In general, states with more resources engage in higher levels of both conflict and cooperation, yet they do so less consistently than do less resource‐endowed states. Conversely, states with fewer resources uniformly engage in lower levels of cooperation and conflict. And, increased levels of cooperation are associated with higher levels of conflict, suggesting the “interaction opportunity” claim has some empirical validity, and that cooperation and conflict are indeed treated as complementary policies by policy makers.8"
"32","More specifically, the model shows that higher levels of capabilities (resources) lead the state to higher levels of conflict; higher levels of economic development (and thus economic resources) similarly lead to higher levels of cooperation. These findings are consistent with the first hypothesis, that states with greater resources will generally implement more costly policies. However, greater capabilities and greater economic resources also each increase the variance in conflict and cooperation respectively. Consistent with the second hypothesis, states for whom the costs of policies relative to resources are smaller have greater discretion over policymaking. They not only engage in more intense or costly levels of conflict and cooperation, but they do so with greater variance as a result of the discretion they have the luxury of exercising. Some states with large pools of resources engage in more costly policies while others do not; resource‐poor states, on the other hand, more uniformly engage in less costly policies both with respect to conflict and to cooperation. We illustrate the effect of resources on the variance in conflictual and cooperative foreign policy behavior in Figure 1.         "
"33","                 Estimated Variance in Levels of Conflict and Cooperation Depending on Resources                      "
"34","The panels in Figure 1 plot σ2 on the y axes and state resources on the x axes. Panel (a) illustrates the effect of capabilities on the variance surrounding the level of conflict states choose. The relationship between changes in capabilities and variance in conflict behavior is striking. As the capabilities of either state move away from their mean values toward their maximum values, there is a significant increase in the variance in the conflict equation. This effect is just as we suggest in our explanation for foreign policy decision making. Although increases in states' capabilities have a direct effect on foreign policy choices for all types of states, capabilities have an additional effect on foreign policy choices through the variance in the choices made. Powerful states, because of the flexibility resources grant them, simply have greater variability in their conflictual foreign policy choices. Panel (b) shows the same to be true in states' decisions about levels of cooperation. States with greater resources behave more diffusely than do states with fewer resources. We also note that in the model, the control variables behave approximately as the literature might predict; we take this as some measure of evidence that the structure of the model is not fundamentally yanking the empirical world askew.         "
"35","The endogenous variable (cooperation) is positively associated with conflict; this finding is recurrent no matter the specification of the model. Such a finding raises serious questions about the presumption that conflict and cooperation are strictly substitutes for one another and casts doubt on the notion that they are opposite ends of a continuum of foreign policy behavior. That states employ cooperative and coercive policies simultaneously or as packages should not be surprising to even the most casual observer of foreign affairs. Iraqi relations with the West during the 1990s were characterized by diplomacy, sanctions, aid, and war. American relations with Pakistan since the mid‐1970s have involved a combination of diplomatic and foreign aid approaches mixed with sanctions and threat, especially revolving around Pakistan's pursuit of nuclear weapons. While the Carter Administration found Pakistan in violation of the Symington Amendment (banning aid to countries developing nuclear weapons programs) and halted U.S. aid in order to coerce Pakistan to give up its nuclear program, the Soviet invasion brought a wave of cooperative policies to the U.S.‐Pakistani relationship. Policy makers routinely talk of foreign policy “portfolios,” and treating these two major types of policies as deterministically and negatively related probably flies in the face of an important part of the complexity of foreign policymaking. Leaders are rarely (never?) making single, independent foreign policy decisions, and even single foreign policy issues often merit (and receive) multipronged responses. A brief review of the history of U.S. policy toward Iraq, Cuba, or North Korea would provide ample evidence of this. In the North Korean case, for instance, the United States has routinely threatened sanctions and offered humanitarian assistance simultaneously as if U.S. policy makers think of these as parts of a larger package of complementary policies aimed at achieving North Korean compliance with U.S. or Western demands. In any case, U.S.‐North Korean relations offer an illustration of how coercive and cooperative policies are pursued jointly and probably illustrate the ubiquity with which such policies occur."
"36","It is tempting to think such a critique only applies to scholarly work that examines cooperation and conflict jointly, and that number pales in comparison to the majority that examines conflict exclusively (including these authors for the most part). But we return to our observation that when we examine conflict relative to its absence, we force all nonconflictual policies including cooperative ones into the reference category, thus imposing the empirical restriction that conflict and cooperation (or any other types of policies in the reference category) are substitutes since an increase in Pr(Y= 1) necessarily means a decrease in Pr(Y= 0). Variables (like many of those in our model, especially those representing resources) are likely correlated with conflict and cooperation and therefore are correlated with the reference category and the category(ies) of interest. Not only does this increase the chances of null findings, but it also presents the possibility of finding βs in the wrong direction. Scholars who exclude the broader range of policies from their dependent variables run these risks, whether their substantive interests involve cooperation or not. In sum, our statistical model appears well behaved, and it provides evidence supportive of the hypotheses we put forward and more broadly of the expectations of the formal model.         "
"37","Our goal in this article was to integrate claims about substitution in the world politics literature. If state leaders are sensitive to costs relative to resources, then we can expect they will behave in the shadow of those resources. What resources really provide leaders are choices, and more specifically, discretion over alternatives. State leaders with greater resources have greater discretion over the policies they choose and, on average, should as a result choose policies that are more costly, but should do so with greater variation than will resource‐poor leaders who are more constrained in their choices."
"38","It is a natural transition from the theoretical discussion of costs and resources to an empirical model that parameterizes the variance. That substitution might lie in the variance is a new way to think about modeling the sources of policy choice. Our results support this, as the variables measuring state resources increase both the mean and variance in state behavior. Importantly, the results are quite robust across different specifications—resources are positively related to the levels of conflict and cooperation leaders use, and positively related to the discretionary nature of policy—some leaders can substitute because they have the resources, and thus the discretion, to use any number of tools from the foreign policy tool‐box. Further, our model suggests cooperation and conflict are complements, not strict substitutes, so our model advances beyond those in the extant literature by relaxing the assumption they must be substitutes. The model also implies the peril of relegating foreign policy choices correlated with common X variables to the reference category of the dependent variable.         "
"39","We undertook this project motivated by the belief that the practice of using narrowly defined dependent variables like the binary presence or absence of armed conflict necessarily divides an important latent variable, coercion, between the zeros and ones. If a latent variable like coercion manifests itself in both categories of a binary dependent variable, the chances X is related to both categories seems quite high. So we have sought to construct a theoretical claim that speaks to the broader domain of foreign policy choice on the two particular, but still broad, dimensions of conflict and cooperation. That broader domain and the broader theoretical claim that implies it also suggest a research design that allows policies to be related to one another, and that ameliorates the problem where the latent variable appears in contrary or competing categories of Y.         "
"40","One important criticism of the study of foreign policy choices is that quantitative studies are quite good at predicting the choices of smaller, less engaged states; they will take limited if any foreign policy action. However, previous quantitative research offers only limited explanations of the foreign policy choices of more developed and resource‐endowed states actively engaged in international politics. We provide an answer to this critique by suggesting the foreign policy choices of both smaller and more powerful states follow similar patterns. However, the variation in choice becomes much greater as a state's ability to afford foreign policy also increases. Our empirical model takes this process into account and thus provides a more nuanced interpretation of the process of foreign policy choice and substitution. Our hope is that this first attempt at empirically differentiating between the foreign policy choices of states based on costs and resources will provoke future work improving our specification and elaborating our explanation for the process of choice and substitution of foreign policy."
