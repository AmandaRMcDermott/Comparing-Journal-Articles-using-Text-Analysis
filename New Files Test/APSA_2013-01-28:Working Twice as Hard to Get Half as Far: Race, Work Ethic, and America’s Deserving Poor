"1","We have long known that African Americans experience discrimination in ways invisible to whites. Research has shown that blacks receive different treatment in everything from applying for jobs (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004) to receiving assistance in registering to vote (Butler and Broockman 2011). Yet, if you ask the average American to identify what causes poverty, most would offer an explanation that faults the individual (Feagin 1972). Kluegel and Smith (1986) find that Americans are more likely to hold that individuals are at fault for their lot in life while those in other countries may believe in a just, fairly constructed world in which people get what they deserve (Appelbaum 2001; Appelbaum, Lennon, and Aber 2006; Smith 1985; Smith and Stone 1989). By and large, Americans tend to blame the poor for their condition.This concept of individual responsibility and hard work leading to success is perhaps uniquely American (McClosky and Zaller 1984). As many previous studies have shown, Americans believe people “ought to take care of their personal problems by themselves” without relying on the government for aid (Sniderman and Brody 1977, 501). This commitment to the principle of hard work and rugged individualism may then serve as one reason Americans disdain redistributive policies: such policies help those who should be helping themselves (Bobocel et al. 1998; Katz and Hass 1988; Sniderman and Tetlock 1986; Sniderman et al. 1996). Other research finds that this principle of individualism is only helpful in predicting attitudes on racialized policies (Federico 2006; Kinder and Mendelberg 2000; Sears and Henry 2003, 2005).         "
"2","Alongside this principle of self‐reliance, a belief in egalitarianism can lead some to object to redistributive policies on the basis of other American values (Goren 2005): as some policies favor certain groups over others, these policies are antithetical to America’s commitment to equality of opportunity and pose serious questions regarding democratic justice (Rawls 1993; Young 1990, 2002). This “principled” opposition to racialized policies like welfare and affirmative action represents a theory of opposition that is race‐neutral. Opposition to spending, according to this theory put forth by Sniderman and his colleagues, can be seen not as racism but “as the clash of competing conceptions of the proper responsibilities of government and the appropriate obligations of citizens” (Sniderman, Crosby, and Howell 2000, 238). Still, others have found evidence that such “principled objections” to affirmative action are rooted in racism (Federico and Sidanius 2002a, 2002b).         "
"3","A second significant strand in explaining whites’ opposition to racialized policies concerns racial prejudice. The myriad literature on a “new racism” centers on the idea that a modern, less explicit form of racial prejudice has replaced the traditional, biologically based racism of the past. While new forms of racism may not have completely filled the gap caused by a decline in “old‐fashioned” racism, it “has taken over the political role” traditional racism once played (Henry and Sears 2002, 254). Whereas whites used to be less reticent about biological differences between blacks and themselves (Bonilla‐Silva 2010), today a “respondents’ evaluation of blacks as lazy may simply reflect their beliefs that poor people in general tend to be lazy and that blacks tend to be poor” (Gilens 1999, 96). This shift from old to “new” racism has been measured in several ways. Kinder and Sanders (1996) looked at racial resentment, measuring how whites believed blacks lack adherence to traditional American values. In this rendering, work ethic is centrally important, insofar as racially resentful whites believe blacks violate such a norm. Kinder and Sanders (1996) separate their concept of racial resentment from a belief in limited government and economic individualism to conclude that this form of racism is the best predictor of attitudes toward such racialized policies. While the “blackness” of welfare might dampen public support, the “whiteness” of other policies (like social security) serves to bolster public opinion (Gilens 1999; Smith 1987; Winter 2006).         "
"4","The concept of symbolic racism (Henry and Sears 2002; Kinder and Kiewiet 1981) looks at whites’ beliefs regarding the presence of racial discrimination. If whites believe that racial intolerance and systemic discrimination are no longer prevalent problems, then whites may also believe that a lack of individual effort causes blacks to be disproportionately impoverished. Further, it follows that any demands for special treatment minorities place on society are unjustified and should not be tolerated. Such ideas provide the foundation for racial resentment to grow. The content used to construct a measure of symbolic racism comes from four themes: “work ethic,”“excessive demands,”“denial of continuing racial discrimination,” and finally, “undeserved advantage” (Henry and Sears 2002, 256). A final explanation for opinion on social spending is that individuals may favor smaller, more limited government and wish to decrease government spending, which is reflected by their belief that spending in such instances would be cut. For these authors, modern racism is the intersection of two important beliefs which lead whites to discriminate against blacks: traditional American values surrounding hard work and the belief that blacks are violating these norms. It is not just that higher levels of racial resentment are associated with a desire to decrease spending on welfare (usually illustrated through a linear model). While these regressions show us on average how racial resentment can alter one’s opinion of welfare, they do little to tease out the complex relationship between principled ideology and modern racism. Previous studies can only show that those who possess greater racial resentment are more likely to dislike welfare (Rabinowitz et al. 2009; Sears et al. 1997). Instead, perhaps a more interesting question is whether blacks and whites are rewarded equally when adhering to the traditional American norm of hard work. This question is precisely what this article tests.         "
"5","Methodologically, the best way to test these competing hypotheses is through an experiment in which different targets are evaluated by respondents and two key markers are randomly assigned: the race of the applicant and a measure of the applicant’s work ethic. Doing this would allow us to estimate exactly how much more deserving a “hard‐working” black person is compared to a “lazy” white person without worrying about race of interviewer effects (Berinsky 1999; Hatchett and Schuman 1975; Kinder and Sanders 1996). Similar designs have been conducted, most notably Sniderman and Piazza’s (1993)“laid‐off” experiment where the authors varied the reason, race, and work history of someone out of work and measured levels of support for their assistance. More recently, Feldman and Huddy (2005) report a study in which support for a college scholarship program varies depending on the race and socio‐economic standing of the scholarship targets. A similar experiment was conducted by Rabinowitz et al. (2009), which found racial resentment correlated with support for redistributive policies when the target of aid was African American but not when the target of aid was female. However, these findings do not help us leverage the pressing question of whether hard work is rewarded in a color‐blind manner. While the intersection of race and work ethic certainly represents a complex opinion (Alvarez and Brehm 2002), something that previous studies have in common is that support for these programs in question is essentially costless as it lacks one real‐world element: competition over finite resources.         "
"6","There is good reason to believe that removing the costless nature of previous experiments is a methodological improvement. For example, in public opinion research, we use more refined questions to get past the general affect toward a policy and thereby tease out the tension between one attitude and another. Take, for example, questions from the American National Election Studies that ask about the importance of the environment and creating jobs. Asked separately, these questions would be prone to acquiesence bias. Instead of asking if funding for the environment or for jobs should be increased, respondents are asked to reflect upon a costly alternative when expressing their views. Thus, they are asked if they support “protecting the environment, even if it costs jobs” or if they believe that jobs are more important than the environment. This type of measurement is preferable as it is analogous to real political decisions: if the government cannot do everything we want it to do, what should the government do first? More specifically, in light of the staggering rate at which some applicants for programs are being denied (over 50%), who will Americans help when the budget to do so is limited?"
"7","In order to determine where Americans think government aid to the poor should go, we should move past both regression analyses and costless experiments. If we wish to answer whether hard work is rewarded in a color‐blind manner, and in doing so sort out the tension between racism and principled conservatism, an experiment must be constructed that can capture what characteristics make an individual more or less “deserving” of social goods in the eyes of the public. In order to test how racism, race, and work ethic all shape Americans’ attitudes toward welfare, I designed an experiment in which participants were asked to budget money to different pairs of applicants for state assistance. Using hand‐redacted applications and other forms from North Carolina Work First—one state welfare agency that had particularly accessible online application forms—I manipulate the targets for assistance on all variables of interest. The key variables of interest are the targets’ race as well as their past work history and how these variables interact."
"8","The basic design of the experiment is a single budgeting task in which the respondent is asked to allocate $1,500 to two applicants for state assistance, each of whom was said to need $900. Most importantly, while the respondents were told that they had $1,500 to allocate between the two applicants, they were also given the option of allocating some (or all) of those funds to “offset the state’s budget deficit.” Thus, each respondent made allocations to three different targets: applicant 1, applicant 2, and to “reduce the deficit.” Given the budget constraint—both applicants’ full need cannot be met—I use the amount awarded to each as an estimate of an applicant’s deservingness. These allocations will become our main variables of interest.2"
"9","As everything about the applicants remains the same except for the randomly assigned race and work‐history treatments, it can be inferred that if an applicant receives a different allocation across two conditions, this difference is due to the experimental manipulation. Secondly, as the applicant pairs’ characteristics were manipulated via random assignment, any difference in the relative importance respondents place on fiscal responsibility—illustrated by giving more to offset the budget deficit—can also be traced back to the experimental treatment. This deficit option also allows for individuals to take a principled position (a socially desirable and available option) to decide that the money would be better spent in some other way."
"10","There are several aspects of this design that allow it to be of particular use to those who study attitudes toward redistributive spending. First, compared to the “laid‐off experiment” described above, these respondents were told they were evaluating real people, with real names and real needs as they were told researchers had been consulting with the state welfare agency in question. Second, respondents were given subtle psychological cues through the use of names borrowed from work on racial priming. Thirdly, the design is the first of its kind to simultaneously manipulate both the race of a target as well as his or her work history. In this way, not only should we be able to see exactly what aspects of an application make someone more likely to receive aid, but we should also be able to estimate exactly how much more or less deserving particular applicants are based on their race, their work ethic, or both."
"11","In order to test how race moderates the rewards of hard work, I employ a 4x3 factorial experimental design. To manipulate the race of the targets, respondents were first randomized to determine which pair of applicants they would see: applicants without names; Laurie and Emily; Laurie and Keisha; or Latoya and Keisha. Next, they were randomly assigned to see one of three different work‐history treatments: no work history given; applicant 1 being an “excellent” worker while applicant 2 was a “poor” worker; or the ratings were switched.3 Summaries of the assignments to these conditions are shown in Table 1 above.         "
"12","In condition 1, participants saw two applicants for North Carolina Work First, which is that state’s welfare agency. Real state forms were filled out and then redacted, photocopied, redacted a second time, and scanned for use in an online survey. Each applicant was described as needing $900, and the participant was allowed to divide $1,500 between two applicants as well as give any dollar amount to “offset the state’s budget deficit.” Each applicant had two children whose ages were counterbalanced within treatments and met all requirements for state assistance. As described above, other conditions used racialized names. Due to the high variability of the gender crossed with race effects from a pilot study, only female names (Laurie, Emily, Latoya, and Keisha) were used. These names were borrowed from Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) and were reliably shown to signal race in previous studies.4 Finally, in some treatments, a “Worker Quality Assessment” was given. An applicant could be assessed to fall into one of two categories: poor or excellent.5 In the work ethic conditions, hard workers were those who had “excellent” worker quality assessments and were always compared to “poor” workers (“Lazy”). The hard‐working and lazy dichotomy is used simply to operationalize how work ethic is rewarded and allows us to compare “Lazy Blacks,”“Lazy Whites,”“Hard‐Working Blacks,” and “Hard‐Working Whites” while keeping everything else constant. In this way, testing the differences across groups provides us with estimates of how much “hard work” is worth to each of the various groups, ceteris paribus. An example of the treatment form is shown in Figure 3.            "
"13","                Assessing Deservingness with Two Black Applicants"
"14","Again, there were three places a subject could allocate money: applicant 1, applicant 2, or to “offset the deficit.” Allocations to applicants 1 and 2 are used to estimate deservingness while allocation to the deficit will serve as a proxy for the importance of fiscal responsibility or principled conservatism. Having the option to offset the budget deficit allows us to separate the parts of racial resentment that are race‐neutral values and racial animus. If those with higher levels of racial resentment give more money to the deficit regardless of the applicants’ races, then racial resentment is primarily a principled position. However, if it is the case that those who are more racially resentful reward whites more than blacks, that would illustrate the component of the racial resentment score that is solely attributable to racial prejudice.            "
"15","Participants in this study were 1,000 adults surveyed by YouGov/Polimetrix during the fall of 2010, just before the midterm elections, as part of the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Elections Studies (CCES), which used a stratified national sample of registered and unregistered adults.6 The sample was almost evenly split by gender (50.6% female) and had an average age of 53 years (s.d. = 14.9). Within the sample, there were 751 people who identified as being white, 96 who identified as being black, and 84 who identified as being Hispanic. Along partisan lines, about 42% identified to varying degrees with the Democratic party while 46% identified more strongly as Republicans. While the key independent variables are the specific treatments, there are two dependent variables of interest. The first is the amount of money an applicant is awarded. The second is how much money is allocated to the deficit, our proxy for principled values. For example, people could oppose racialized policies because they do not like entitlement programs, but because these programs disproportionately affect minorities, they appear to have antiminority affect. If most evaluations of welfare occur in the context of work ethic (those who work hard should be rewarded, and idleness should be punished), we should expect the participants to reward hard work and punish laziness. Due to the zero‐sum nature of this allocation, we can test the differences between allocations made in the “baseline or name only” conditions compared to those crossed with a work‐ethic treatment to ascertain exactly how much “hard work” is worth in the eyes of average Americans. Thus, the first hypothesis predicts that applicants who are said to have “excellent” work histories will be rewarded compared to those who have a “poor” work ethic, who will be punished. Second, if it is the case that racial resentment is measuring something that is truly race‐neutral, as some may believe, then money allocated to the deficit should increase along with racial resentment and not be correlated with the race of applicants a respondent is evaluating. Thus, we would expect that white applicants should receive more rewards than blacks and that racial resentment should be positively correlated with allocating money to the budget deficit.         "
"16","Most importantly, however, is the test of the racial differences and the interaction term. If Americans are overtly racist, we would expect black applicants to receive significantly fewer rewards than white applicants. If Americans have race‐neutral commitments to the principle of hard work, we would expect those who have “excellent” work histories to gain relative to those who have “poor” work histories. The key test in this article, however, is whether these rewards and punishments are meted out in a color‐blind manner. The novel hypotheses for this project are that “hard‐working” blacks will be rewarded less and “lazy” blacks will be punished more than their white counterparts, all else being equal. If we see evidence for the first hypothesis and not the second hypothesis, then we have some evidence for principled conservatism. If we see evidence for the second hypothesis and not the first hypothesis, we have evidence for racial resentment. If both hypotheses are confirmed, the interaction will test exactly which set of values is driving the difference.         "
"17","The final hypothesis concerns those funds set aside to “offset the state’s budget deficit” and performs a second test between racial resentment and principled conservatism. If race no longer matters, and whites oppose such spending on principled grounds, we should see no difference between pairs of applicants in the amount of money that is allocated to the budget deficit: racial resentment should affect the budget allocation for black pairs as much as it affects the budget allocation for white pairs. On the other hand, if the theory of racial resentment is correct, several things should happen. First, not only will the more racially resentful set more funds aside to offset the budget deficit when the pair is black, but also they will be willing to spend more on white applicants. Importantly here is another interaction: if those who are racially resentful are truly taking race‐neutral, “principled” stances against welfare, then a pair of black applicants should not make the deficit more pressing than a pair of white applicants. If, however, racial resentment captures racial animus, we would expect that the racial treatments would work differently among the most racially resentful, causing those with higher levels of prejudice to be more willing to spend on white applicants."
"18","In order to test these hypotheses, I use a series of paired t‐tests to compare the differences between amounts allocated to similar applicants across the experimental conditions. The results for t‐tests are shown in Table 2. Test 1 compares the first application in condition 1 with the same applicant in condition 2, where only the applicant’s work history has been changed. On average, the applicant who had an “excellent” work history was awarded an additional $65, a difference that is significant at conventional levels. Test 2 shows that “laziness” is punished with a greater magnitude than hard work is rewarded, as applicant 2 loses over $170 when he or she is said to have a “poor” work history. Again, the test statistic leaves us with little doubt that the work‐ethic manipulation did not have its desired effect. Tests 3 and 4 look at the differences between white and black applicants solely on the basis of race. Neither test shows any significant difference, meaning that white applicants are not rewarded any more than blacks on the basis of race alone. However, further tests reveal that racial prejudice amplifies rewards and punishments.         "
"19","Tests 5 and 6 show that Emily and Keisha, when both are being compared to “lazy” Laurie, are rewarded very differently for their hard work. For her hard work, Emily sees an additional $123, a difference significant from zero at conventional levels. On the other hand, Keisha is rewarded with less than $10, a difference that is statistically indistinguishable from zero. What these tests (5 and 6) show is that Emily earns roughly 10 times as much money for her hard work than Keisha does, all else equal. We can also test whether the difference of these differences is significant. This is precisely what test 7 does, and it shows that such a large difference was unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. Now we have substantial evidence that hard work is rewarded in a manner that is tainted by race, is “laziness” punished in a similar fashion?"
"20","Tests 8 and 9 repeat the process from above and show that while Keisha loses over $100 for being lazy, Emily loses less than $25. Again, the former difference is significant while the latter is not: only the applicant with the African American name (Keisha) is punished for being lazy. The final test, test 10, presents another difference of differences test and shows that the magnitude of these differences is again unlikely to have occurred by random chance.7 While we can clearly see from Table 2 that hard work is rewarded and laziness is punished, the interaction terms illustrate how race conditions deservingness. This is one answer to those who take the “principled politics,” or race‐neutral values, perspective on welfare: blacks see no reward for their hard work, yet are punished for laziness at a disproportionate rate. As this experiment shows, the American norms of equal treatment cannot solely explain these results: Americans’ attitudes toward welfare are closely tied to modern racism.         "
"21","Next, we can look at the level of “deficit reduction” as a function of both the race of the applicants as well as racial resentment. Test 11 compares the amount of funds set to offset the state’s deficit in conditions 4–6 (when the applicants were both white) compared to the amount reserved in conditions 10–12 when the applicants both had black names. Again, all else equal, white applicants were worth extra money ($100) compared to a pair of black applicants. This shows that, on average, Americans are more willing to spend funds on welfare when both applicants are white than when both are black. To decompose the effects of racial resentment, I use a four‐question measure that was rescaled and summed to run from zero to one.8Figure 4 shows the smoothed average of deficit reduction pledged by individuals at various levels of racial resentment. As we can see, the average amount of money set aside to “reduce the deficit” increases steadily as racial resentment increases. At the lowest end, less than $100 is allocated to the deficit, meaning $1,400 was awarded to the applicants for welfare. At the highest levels of racial resentment, approximately $700 is being allocated to the deficit, and approximately $800 is being divided over the applicants—not even enough to meet either applicant's assessed need. Obviously, racial resentment is associated with reduced spending on these entitlement programs, but what if both the applicants were white?9"
"22","                Racial Resentment and Fiscal Responsibility"
"23","As Table 3 shows, this question can be answered through a simple least‐squares regression predicting the amount of money allocated to the deficit as a function of racial resentment, the races of the applicants applying, and the interaction of the two. Here, the constant in the model represents the amount of money allocated to offset the deficit if the respondent was viewing a pair of applicants without names. Several controls are used to predict how much money is not spent on the applicants: ideology, partisanship, income, education, and age as well as gender.10 As we can see, age, ideology, and racial resentment are the only variables that are significant in every model estimated. The second model adds variables indicating which pair the respondent was assigned to, and we can see the difference in the allocation between two white applicants and two black applicants is similar to test 11 from Table 2. In the third model, however, we interact racial resentment with each of the treatment variables to see if the race of the applicants moderates the effect racial resentment has on the dollars allocated to the deficit. The results show that the effect of racial resentment is conditioned by the race of the applicants a respondent is evaluating. As seen by the large negative sign for racial resentment interacted with two white applicants (RR x WW), the presence of white applicants attenuates the effect of racial resentment on a desire for fiscal responsibility. Clearly, race matters when evaluating applicants for welfare and, when given an “acceptable” alternative to spending the money, those who are most racially resentful will allocate money to decrease a state’s deficit, but at a far lesser rate when evaluating white applicants for welfare. In summation, those who are most racially resentful are willing to spend much more on welfare when the applicants are both white than when applicants are black.         "
"24","To better illustrate this finding, Figure 5 shows the estimated amount of money subjects would allocate conditioned on two things: the race of the applicants and a subject’s level of racial resentment. At the low end of racial resentment, the averages are nearly indistinguishable from one another, and each pair is awarded approximately $1,350.11 However, as whites become more racially resentful, they are less willing to spend money on welfare but are always willing to spend more for whites than blacks. Thus, the difference between the spending ceiling and the amount whites are receiving may just be part of a “principled” component of racial resentment. However, the large and significant difference between the amounts given to white and black applicants can only be attributed to racial animus.         "
"25","                Racial Resentment and Fiscal Responsibility, by Race of Applicant Pairs"
"26","As a robustness check, we can simply divide respondents into above and below levels of racial resentment and check whether an increase in racial resentment is met with a reduction in spending regardless of the target. Figure 6 shows another way in which the two groups—those with above and below average levels of racial resentment12—differ when evaluating various targets. Among the nine different types of applicants, only one did not fare significantly worse when being evaluated by those with above average levels of racial resentment: hard‐working applicants with white names.13 In other words, racial resentment matters when evaluating every group except hard‐working whites, which is exactly what the theory suggests as they are the exemplars of American norms. If the principled position were correct, and racial resentment was measuring an ideological position, moving from low to high levels of racial resentment should be met with lower support for every condition of social spending. Instead, we again see that the only group to benefit from this racism are whites who are conforming to the traditional norm of hard work.         "
"27","                Racial Resentment and Target Deservingness"
"28","Race and the American value of hard work matter a great deal in how Americans evaluate both redistributive policies as well as the deserving poor. In a nationally representative survey experiment, I find both applicant‐ and reviewer‐level factors influence how “deserving” the applicant for state assistance was perceived. The results show how work ethic matters differently for blacks and whites. Whites are rewarded more for the same level of work ethic, and blacks are punished more for the same perceived level of “laziness.” Furthermore, individuals who review the applicants are more likely to reward white applicants and punish blacks when they score high on measures of racial resentment."
"29","This study is a clean way to test the relationship between racism and fiscal responsibility and has several interesting results. First, white applicants are privileged compared to black applicants, but in a nuanced manner. While the unnamed hard‐working applicant for welfare earns an additional $65, and the lazy applicant loses $175, these differences are compounded when we control for the race of the applicant. Hard‐working blacks gain less than $10, while whites earn approximately 10 times as much. This disparity is also witnessed in terms of how idleness is punished: whites lose only $20 compared to over $110 that is taken from applicants with black names."
"30","Second, while some opponents of the theory of racial resentment argue that opposition to welfare is simply a function of a color‐blind “principled conservatism,” I show that one of the most influential causes of how much money a racially resentful person will allocate to offset the state’s budget deficit is race‐based. Funds allocated to reduce the state’s budget deficit—both a fair measure of fiscal conservatism and a socially acceptable alternative for those who wish to hide overt racism—indicate that those with higher levels of racial resentment allocate approximately twice as much money to the deficit when they are evaluating a black applicant, compared to under $400 when evaluating a pair of white applicants (Emily and Laurie). At the very least, we see that Americans are more willing to spend funds on Emily and Laurie as opposed to Latoya and Keisha, all else equal."
"31","Finally, the experimental study finds that higher levels of racial resentment are associated with significant differences in target allocations for every category of applicant except hard‐working whites. In other words, the only group not to be punished by higher levels of racial resentment are those who represent the American norm: hard‐working whites. The center panel of Figure 6 is evidence for the “principled conservatism” theory—moving from below average to above average racial resentment significantly reduces the amount an applicant is awarded in the baseline condition. Ignoring welfare's implicitly racialized nature, as well as the surrounding panels in Figure 6, this could be confused as evidence for the principled ideological position. However, every other panel shows evidence in support of the intersection between norms and race that racial resentment predicts.         "
"32","In an age when some argue that we have moved beyond the importance of race, this article shows just how much race still colors Americans’ beliefs about work ethic and the deserving poor. While some may be opposed to welfare spending on purely fiscal and race‐neutral grounds, the average American still believes blacks deserve less than whites, all else equal. For critics of welfare who tout their opposition to spending as nonracial in nature, this study does not prove them wrong. Instead it shows that, on average, American disdain for welfare spending is more a function of penalizing race, not laziness."
"33","What is perhaps even more troubling, in a time when some may believe racism is extinct, is that blacks are not even able to get credit for the same type of effort as whites. While some may use the heuristic that poor people must be lazy and because blacks are disproportionately poor they must therefore be lazy, this experiment has shown that welfare applicants with black names are not given credit even when they are labeled as excellent workers. The only explanation left is racial prejudice. Finally, it should be noted that this article carries with it real‐world implications. While the budgeting task may be artificial, and something most Americans will never have to do, it is important to acknowledge that last year over 40 million people applied for some form of government assistance. If the biases that exist in the national survey are reflected in those who make decisions about who gets funding and who is denied aid, perhaps implicit racism has won."
