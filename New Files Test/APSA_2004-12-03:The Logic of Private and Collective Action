"1","Olson argues that a firm would not contribute or lobby to secure a collective good because the individual contribution is unlikely to make a difference to the outcome and because the individual cannot be punished for not contributing. At the same time, Olson observes, business is very active politically. When firms are divided into smaller, more concentrated markets the free‐rider obstacle is mitigated, it is easier to coordinate political activity, and there is less diffusion of responsibility. When size varies among the firms, it may be that for the larger firm the gain from the collective good outweighs the cost of securing the good. Political activity “depends to a striking degree on the number of individuals in the group,” but it is not completely dependent as the group may have members with “highly unequal degrees of interest in a collective good” (1965, 45). Olson argues that the large amount of business political activity derives from the fact that multiple markets and related industries segment the larger business community. Political participation becomes rational in these smaller groups, with a small number of firms or a small number of oligopolistic firms for whom it is worthwhile to assume the cost of political activity. The standard measure for the degree of oligopoly in an industry is the concentration ratio.         "
"2","How has market structure performed in empirical tests? In Table 1, we show its mixed fortunes in 15 empirical studies that use concentration to explain firm political activity.1 The weight of empirical research reports no relationship between concentration and political activity. No study finds consistently significant results (5% level) when modeling the political activities of individual firms. Schuler, Rehbein, and Kramer (2002) find concentration positive and “marginally significant” at the 10% level, and Andres (1985) finds concentration related positively to PAC formation at the 10% level. Using a nonlinear form (incorporating both concentration and the square of concentration), Grier, Munger, and Roberts (1991, 1994) find a positive relationship at lower levels of concentration and then a negative relationship between concentration and political activity in the more concentrated industries. Concentration is significant for the probit model of the presence or absence of individual corporate PAC contributions aggregated to the industry level as the dependent variable in their larger 124‐industry sample (1978–1986), but not for their model of the amount of contributions (1994). Concentration is significant for all models in their smaller 110‐industry sample, and they describe a negative effect of concentration ranging from levels of concentration of 70% or above (1994), or 43.85% and above (1993). The idea is that highly concentrated industries have sufficient control to obviate the need for government intervention to relieve market pressures (Grier, Munger, and Roberts 1991, 737). As they recognize, this polynomial relationship between concentration and political contributions is contrary to Olson's theory.         "
"3","Of the other studies, the analysis by Esty and Caves (1983) finds a significant result for legislative outcomes, but not for PAC and lobbying activity aggregated at the industry level.2Pittman (1977) finds an interactive effect on his other independent variables for more highly concentrated industries (above the median concentration value). In Mizruchi and Koenig's (1988, 1991) model of the similarity of PAC contributions, concentration is significant only at the 10% level. Overall, evidence for the importance of concentration as an influence on business political activity is sparse. But given the power of the theoretical argument, it is worth exploring the effects of some different research design decisions and assumptions. Earlier research has suggested that the dependent variable requires more comprehensive measurement. But the independent variable also requires attention. The poor performance of the market structure argument may reflect poor measurement; we need to ensure that we have explored alternative measures of concentration that may better capture the relevant markets.         "
"4","The theoretical argument for concentration is that individual firms see government as a source of industry costs or benefits. Yet government deploys both coercion and incentives that capture the attention of firms as individuals not just as members of a group. Government selectively enforces a regime of regulations, exercises powers that may prevent a firm's competitor from entering the market, and creates demand for a firm's products. The private goods that a firm seeks from government involve both regulation and procurement, and we must represent both in models of firm political activity."
"5","We assume this private goods seeking generates expectations about the modes of political participation used by the firm. In research on citizen political participation, researchers separate out different activities, from voting to citizen contacting, as they reflect more or less instrumental behaviors (Leighley 1995). A citizen's vote is improbably linked to any definitive outcome and is a relatively uncommunicative act in comparison to contacting a representative directly about an issue of concern. Similarly, firms motivated by private goods likely prefer the more instrumental to the less instrumental political activities. Lobbying is the firm equivalent to contacting and is most easily tied to specific benefits for the individual firm, whether relief from regulation or securing a government contract. Of those analyzed, the least instrumental of activities available to firms is a soft‐money contribution to political parties rather than to an individual candidate running for election. While we know that the different forms of political participation are complementary (see Hansen and Mitchell 2000; Schuler, Rehbein, and Kramer 2002), if firms are private goods seekers the balance of their allocations for political activities should favor lobbying, as in fact it does (see Table A3 in the appendix). Firms that lobby spend on average over one million dollars, while average soft money and PAC contributions are about 230 and 150 thousand dollars, respectively.         "
"6","We analyze the Fortune1000 corporations (2000), along with the largest foreign investors in the United States from Forbes, for the 1999–2000 election cycle. Conventionally, analyses have focused on the Fortune firms (Andres 1985; Boies 1989; Humphries 1991; Masters and Keim 1985), although Hart (2001) focuses on a specific sector, and Grier, Munger, and Roberts focus on 124 three‐digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) industries (1994). In our sample of firms, 191 out of 311 different industries are represented based on the four‐digit North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), including both manufacturing and service sectors, and all 122 of the Standard & Poor's industry classifications are represented.3"
"7","We use PAC activity, soft money, and lobbying to measure political participation. Among the firms in our data set, 49% engage in PAC giving, 44% report lobbying expenditures, and 46% give soft money contributions. Overall, 773 firms, or 66%, are politically active, most in multiple activities (see the appendix for descriptive statistics and sources of our measures).         "
"8","In order to disentangle the impact of concentration, we include several variables drawn from the standard model of business political activity (see Grier, Munger, and Roberts 1994). Firm size is represented by revenues. We argue that foreign firms, fearful of the perception of interfering in the domestic politics of the host country, voluntarily constrain political activity (see Hansen and Mitchell 2000; Rehbein 1995). We use a dummy variable for foreign‐owned firms. While we argue that firms may seek private goods, this is likely in addition to public goods. To capture the public good dimension of regulation, we include an industry‐level measure that has been utilized effectively in earlier research (see Grier, Munger, and Roberts 1994). To incorporate the ideas of pluralists (see Jordan 1990, 2000) and countervailing power theorists like Galbraith (1954; see also Austen‐Smith and Wright 1994) we measure opposition activity by the frequency with which corporations are identified as targets in citizens' and environmentalists' campaigns, and we combine these into one measure of countervailing power. While anecdotal evidence suggests that business interests may countervail other business interests, Schlozman and Tierney find that almost 90% of their respondents named other corporations as an ally and only 23% also named antagonists among the business community (1986, 256–58). Environmental and citizen group activity provides a less ambiguous representation of the pluralist argument, although still not without methodological challenges. Specifically, the theoretical argument suggests the possibility of a simultaneous relationship between political activity and countervailing power; we will address this possibility in the model.         "
"9","To test the argument that firms may seek private, as well as collective, goods, we include firm‐specific measures of government regulation and government contracts.Firms seek to minimize costly regulation. To measure regulation at the firm level, we use the number of firm interactions with federal regulatory agencies and federal courts.4 We expect firms not just to fight regulation on behalf of an industry, but also to fight specific regulatory interventions as individuals, so we measure regulation at the firm level as well as at the industry level. We also use government contracts for individual firms as a direct measure of private goods that firms secure from government. With these measures we can control for the influence of other economic, institutional, and political factors in examining the impact of market structure on the firm's decision of whether or not to engage in political activity and at what levels. We note that firm political activity and government contracts may also have a simultaneous relationship, and we test for the possibility of endogeneity in the analysis.         "
"10","Our task in this article is to test market structure logic applied to political activity. The theoretical argument suggests that firms in competitive industries with larger numbers of smaller firms are less likely to organize for political activity. The first analytical challenge is fitting the firm to the appropriate industry. It is plausible that the poor results for concentration in the earlier research are attributable to the problem of finding the relevant market. Large, politically active firms may operate in multiple markets. This question of the relevant market is not a trivial one, and it occupies the courts as well as scholars. Numerous antitrust cases have been decided on the basis of the choice of market definition.5"
"11","In contrast to the earlier work that relies on a single measure of concentration, we systematically shift the analyses through multiple definitions of market for each of the firms in the sample. We rely on others' classifications of the firm's industry rather than making the judgment ourselves. First, we use the concentration ratio most used by scholars based on the U.S. Census Bureau's industrial concentration measures by the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. Most four‐digit SIC codes have a rough concordance with a six‐digit NAICS code. We use both the detail‐rich six‐digit NAICS designations, and following Grier, Munger, and Roberts (1994) we also test for the significance of the concentration measures at the four‐digit NAICS level, which is broadly equivalent to the three‐digit SIC (for example, “sugar and confectionery products” was classified as SIC 206 under the old system and is now 3113 under the new NAICS system).         "
"12","Using concentration ratios from the NAICS (or the old SIC) system is complicated. There are over 400 different six‐digit NAICS categories, an “industry” may comprise multiple six‐ or four‐digit NAICS codes, and many firms participate in activities that correspond to multiple codes. The most common way around this problem is the assignment of a firm or industry to a code that best describes a “plurality” of its activity. Furthermore, the firms in some industries—particularly banking—are involved not only in the products that they manufacture or the services that they provide, but also in investment in other companies that participate in activities that are completely different from the parent company. The Census Bureau has circumvented the difficulty of describing this phenomenon by assigning several “catch‐all” codes that designate “holding companies” with economic data that correspond to a very amorphous “industry.” Not surprisingly, there are no concentration values for these codes."
"13","In addition to using the potentially problematic NAICS‐based concentration measures, we develop an alternative concentration measure using Standard and Poor's (S&P) 122 industry categories. We rely on their industry classification of the firms in our sample, and we use revenue values from the S&P database in order to calculate four‐firm concentration ratios for each industry category (this database includes over 20,000 publicly traded U.S. companies in addition to thousands of foreign firms). Standard & Poor developed and maintains this classification system in order to provide data to investment and banking groups that monitor the performance of firms and industries. This measure avoids many of the problems created by multiple related NAICS codes by categorizing firms more generally.6"
"14","We also test the concentration hypothesis using the Census Bureau's Herfindahl Index, another commonly used measure of concentration. The Herfindahl index facilitates a more effective analysis of how industries with particularly dominant firms compare to other industries, yet it is available only for manufacturing industries.7"
"15","The other measures are not concentration ratios, but they capture a different dimension of market structure. Some of these measures have been included in earlier research. We use the number of establishments per six‐digit NAICS code, which is an updated version of the number of establishments per SIC code used by Masters and Keim (1985) and Humphries (1991) to explain corporate political activity. Masters and Keim found the expected negative relationship, the more firms the less political activity, but it was only significant at the 10% level (1985, 1169). When they included a larger sample of firms in their analysis, the number of firms was not significant at the undemanding 10% level. Humphries (1991, 362) also used number of firms, but found no significant relationship with corporate PAC formation. We also use a measure of the number of firms in each S&P industry category. Finally, using the S&P industry classifications, we examine two other concentration‐related measures: the individual firm's share of the industry's total revenue and the number of firms with 1% or greater share of industry revenue. We expect a positive relationship between firm share and political activity and a negative relationship between number of firms and political activity.         "
"16"," Table 2 presents a correlation matrix of our measures of market structure. What is striking is the general weakness of the relationships—indicating that the different measures define quite different markets. For example the four‐digit NAICS concentration ratio correlates with our S&P concentration value at only 0.24, and the correlation is only 0.17 when we use the narrower six‐digit NAICS measure. Even the four‐ and six‐digit NAICS concentration ratios correlate at only 0.63 suggesting that analysts are using quite different measures when they select one or the other. When we move to the measures of number of establishments, again we see the effect of quite different definitions of markets with a relatively weak 0.35 correlation between the six‐digit NAICS number of establishments and the S&P number of firms.         "
"17","For the multivariate analysis, we follow the literature and we first use logit analysis to predict whether or not a firm has a politically active PAC. In Table 3, we present the results of the PAC logit models, shifting through the eight different measures of concentration. For concentration, none of the eight measures are significant in the expected direction. The results that are significant, two of the S&P measures and the NAICS number of establishments, are in the wrong direction. The nonfinding for “concentration,” however measured, is consistent with much of the earlier research.8 Industry‐wide regulation, the public goods measure of regulation, is consistently significant for the PAC model, but there is evidence for a substantial private goods motivation for firm political activity as well. While firm‐level regulation is not significant, the other private goods measures, court actions and government contracts, are positive in all specifications and sometimes significant. Further, the firm‐level measure of countervailing power is positive and significant across all specifications, and this measure, where the firm itself is the target, also may capture the private goods incentive. The measure for revenue is positive and statistically significant for all eight specifications, and the dummy variable for foreign ownership is negative and significant in all specifications.         "
"18","Next, as suggested by earlier researchers, in order to move beyond the simple PAC measures we test the same set of models using other forms of political activity, namely lobbying and soft money contributions. Table 4 presents the models for whether or not a firm spends money on lobbying activities. With lobbying as the dependent variable, concentration still performs poorly across all specifications. The industry‐level measure of regulation is significant in two of the models, and all of our measures of private goods are significant in the expected direction across all measures of concentration, except the Herfindahl index with the much more limited number of observations (N = 385).         "
"19"," Table 5 reports the models using soft money as the dependent variable. Revenues, the foreign firm dummy, and our measure of countervailing power are significant and perform as expected. Our measures of private goods are insignificant for this less‐targeted mode of political activity. While we find a significant result for the industry‐wide measure of regulation in some of the models, concentration is insignificant across all specifications. So even when we expand our research beyond PAC contributions to include other types of activities, concentration remains a poor predictor of business participation in politics.9 These analyses do not provide evidence for the proposition of earlier researchers that concentration will perform better using forms of participation other than PAC contributions.         "
"20","In Table 6 we examine whether market structure has the expected influence when we aggregate the different forms of political participation. The dependent variable is assigned a value of 1 if a firm engages in any one or more of our three measures of political activity, PAC giving, lobbying, or giving soft money contributions, and is 0 otherwise. As in the PAC models, S&P concentration and total number of firms in the S&P industry category are significant in the opposite direction as expected, as is the number of establishments.10 Court actions and government contracts are in the right direction and significant across all models, and firm regulation is sometimes significant. Countervailing power, industry regulation, and the foreign firm dummy are in the expected direction and significant across all models.         "
"21","To test Grier, Munger, and Roberts (1991, 1994) alternative theory of a nonlinear relationship between political activity and concentration, we include concentration and concentration squared in all of our logit models. Among the 32 models run to test the nonlinear specification (one for each of the specifications in Tables 3–6), only two attain significance in the expected direction, both for soft money contributions. For soft money giving, the S&P concentration and its square are significant in the expected direction, and the Herfindahl index and its square are both significant in the direction predicted.         "
"22","In contrast to the poor performance of market structure, whatever the measure, note the significant results obtained for the firm‐specific measures of private goods, particularly with lobbying as the dependent variable. The earlier research has measured regulation generally only at the industry level with a dummy variable. Our measures of agency and court interactions with specific firms are generally good predictors of particularly the more targeted forms of firm political activity. Additionally, the most interesting and consistent finding in the literature suggesting the importance of private goods‐seeking activity is for the very limited group of firms holding defense contracts (Boies 1989; Burris 1987; Hansen and Mitchell 2000; Lichtenberg 1989). This group represents only a subset of those firms that have government as a customer. Our measure of government contracts incorporates all government contracts, not just the defense department, and is consistently significant in the more targeted form of political activity, namely lobbying.         "
"23","In Table 7, we examine the degree of firm political activity using tobit models to account for censoring on the dependent variable. Here we report models for the different types of political spending and a combined measure summing across the types of spending, using just the most common measure of concentration, the NAICS four‐digit. Industry regulation is consistently significant. The results of the private goods measures are consistently in the expected direction, although mixed in their degree of significance. Agency regulation is only significant in the lobbying model at the 5% level, and our measure of government contracts is consistently significant at the 10% level across all but the soft money models. The countervailing power measure is positive and significant. Again concentration, across all types of spending, is never significant in the expected direction no matter the measure of market structure used.         "
"24","While our central concern is the influence of market structure, an additional concern is that the relationships for both government contracts and countervailing power have only been modeled as if contracts and countervailing power determine political activity and have not accounted for the potential simultaneous influence of political activity on contracts and countervailing activity. Though simultaneously including both endogenous variables is prohibitive for these models, we do control for these endogenous relationships one at a time using a two‐stage tobit model.11 In Table A4 of the appendix we provide models for the first stage where we predict countervailing power and government contracts.12"
"25"," Table 8 presents the second‐stage tobit models for each type of political activity and a combined measure summing across political activities. Again for simplicity, we report the results using only one measure of concentration, the NAICS four‐digit.13 As in previous models, concentration is never significant in the expected direction.Our measure of industry regulation remains strong, and our measures of court actions and government contracts are significant in most models. And, these results are virtually identical across the eight measures of concentration.         "
"26","We have examined a number of plausible solutions to the paradox of corporate political participation. Our analyses of the variety of forms of participation, using a battery of measures of market structure, are broadly consistent with the PAC results of earlier research. It makes sense to use a battery of measures of concentration, representing different definitions of the relevant market. Even the decision about whether to use a four‐ or six‐digit NAICS (or SIC) measure is an important one given the moderate correlation (0.63) between the two. Only by exploring these measures can we have confidence in the findings of the influence of market structure on business political participation; substituting one concentration measure for another in our models had little impact on the magnitude, direction, or significance of the coefficients of the other independent variables.14"
"27","Despite the substance of these findings, we, like Munger, are reluctant to conclude that business political activity is irrational. Instead, we suggest that our results direct attention to the motivating assumption of this research field; much business participation is aimed not only at public goods but also at private goods. We present a range of supporting evidence for this solution to the paradox. The results for our firm‐level measures of contracts, court interactions, and regulation, even when controlling for industry‐level regulation, offers support for this solution. Further, earlier research has found strong support for the inclusion of other measures of private goods, such as defense contracts (Boies 1989; Burris 1987; Lichtenberg 1989), in predicting business political participation.         "
"28","While Olson (1965) framed the research problem in terms of explaining participation aimed at obtaining collective goods, a solution to the paradox lies in systematically testing for private goods as well as public goods in our models of firm political activity. Such a strategy promises to improve our understanding of how firms make participation choices.         "
"29","Such a solution, however, poses a new paradox: if firms are after private goods, why do so many join politically active associations? It is possible that associational activity is different and more exclusively focused on public goods. Or, following the logic developed in this article, a plausible solution lies in the extent to which firms can also manipulate the association in their efforts to secure private goods. This direction for research is anticipated in De Figueiredo and Tiller's finding that Fortune 1000 firms that lobby the Federal Communications Commission fear the hazard of releasing proprietary information when they lobby collectively with members of a trade association (2001, 109). The implication is that firms may also realize selective benefits through collective action perhaps in the form of information concerning government or rivals' strategies, or more directly in the form of soliciting the aid of the association in influencing government on the firm's behalf."
