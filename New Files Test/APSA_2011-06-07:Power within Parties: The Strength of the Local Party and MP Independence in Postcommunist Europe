"1","I treat political parties as organizations (Panebianco 1988; Schlesinger 1984) and build on theoretical insights from the literature on organizational behavior to develop an argument about the distribution of power within parties and the manifestation of this power distribution in MP behavior.2"
"2","Literature on organizational sociology suggests that power within an organization is not uniformly distributed. Rather, some subunits are more powerful than others due to asymmetries in intraorganizational dependency relationships (Emerson 1962; Pfeffer 1994, 1997; Pfeffer and Salancik 2003; Tjosvold and Wisse 2009). Specifically, subunit power originates from its ability to cope with the uncertainty that the organization faces by having access to, and control over, crucial resources (Hickson et al. 1971; Hinings et al. 1974; Pfeffer and Salancik 2003). The general argument runs as follows: organizations require a supply of resources from the environment in order to operate. These resources vary in terms of how difficult they are to obtain or how critical they are to the functioning of the organization. Each subunit extracts some of these resources and provides them to others in exchange for those resources that they need. Because of the dependencies generated, asymmetries emerge: those subunits that are more effective in securing critical and difficult to obtain resources acquire more power. Some authors refer to the capacity to cope with uncertainty itself as the most critical resource that any organization needs (Pfeffer 1994, 1997; Pfeffer and Salancik 2003). Subunits possessing such capacity are expected to obtain more power; in that sense, resource dependence and uncertainty coping amount to the same argument (Astley and Sachdeva 1984).         "
"3","The nature of uncertainty coping and resource dependence can vary over organizations and time. For example, in a study of a university, Salancik and Pfeffer (1974) show that the power of a university department is highly correlated with its ability obtain outside grants and contracts—critical resources in a university setting. Crozier (1964) shows that the most powerful subunit in a tobacco factory was that of the maintenance engineers: they could manage the only real uncertainty ever faced by the plant—the breakdown of the highly automated cigarette manufacturing equipment.         "
"4","In sum, subunit power within an organization is enhanced by its ability to effectively control resources that help reduce uncertainty for the organization. In other words, power is directly proportional to the organizational value of the resource that the subunit provides and inversely proportional to the availability of this resource from other sources (Emerson 1962; see also Cook and Emerson 1978; Cook et al. 1983; Fligstein 1987; Pfeffer 1994, 1997; Pfeffer and Salancik 2003).         "
"5","This argument can be applied to understanding the distribution of power within political parties. Parties, as other organizations, are not monolithic entities, but consist of various subunits, including party branches. Branches that are better at performing the essential tasks of the party are likely to be more powerful."
"6","In line with the existing literature, I assume that a party's central goals include votes (plus office) and policy (Strom 1990). The essential tasks performed by party branches that help achieve these goals include communication with, and mobilization of, the electorate. Party subunits with strong organizations—those that are more strongly socially rooted with visible and active presence in local life via participating in local government and politics, being associated with locally known leaders and activists, and having local structures and membership—have more control over these sources of power than subunits with weak organizations. Several arguments support this line of reasoning.3"
"7","A local party branch with a strong local presence has more expertise on how to present the party's message to the local electorate and how to run successful campaigns for the party in the national elections than a branch with little local‐level presence and expertise. Furthermore, a local branch with a stronger organization, given its involvement in and contribution to local affairs, is likely to appear credible in the eyes of the local population. Branches with weak organizations, on the other hand, lack such credibility and are therefore less able to extract the critical resources, i.e., votes from the local electorate."
"8","Participation in local politics permitted by strong local organization is especially relevant in helping to win votes both in the short and long term. Local presence and involvement in local politics help keep the party afloat even if on the national level the party is experiencing difficult times. Local politics tends to be more pragmatic—citizens are interested in getting solutions to very specific local problems and issues and care less about abstract ideological stances or national‐level scandals that the party may be drawn into (Geser 1999). Strong local party branches may, therefore, still attract support and members despite unfavorable macroeconomic or macropolitical conditions or despite a change in the ideological course of the party. Such local branches create an opportunity for parties that experience losses on the national level to recuperate and prepare for future opportunities in national politics through their involvement in local affairs. Furthermore, members’ commitment to local party branches tends to be less ideological and driven mostly by social gratification, which keeps activists working and local candidates running even if the party on the national level is losing support and members (Geser 1999). A strong party branch can continue educating the local electorate about party stances and intentions when, and in ways, national media campaigns cannot.         "
"9","There is some evidence that in new democracies of postcommunist Europe, parties win more votes in districts where they have a stronger organization, i.e., more members and local party offices, and active participation in local elections and politics (Tavits 2009b). The average difference between a party's vote share in a district with the strongest versus one with the weakest organization is about 5–20 percentage points depending on the country. This suggests that branches with strong organizations are better able to provide the resources (i.e., votes) that a party needs than those with weak organizations.         "
"10","The functions that strong organizations perform and that help them win votes also help a party reach its other central goal—success in policymaking both in terms of finding support for their policies and formulating popular new initiatives. Communication with the electorate is a crucial task in achieving this goal. Local branches and their members help conduct grassroots campaigns for candidates as well as for policy proposals and are important resources for keeping a party in touch with public opinion (Scarrow 1994). Literature on collective action and canvassing provides robust evidence that immediate contacts are more effective than other forms of contact in persuading voters (Gerber and Green 2000). Local branches, especially if involved in local politics, can also serve as testing grounds for new policy ideas (Geser 1999). Alternatively, by handling local problems, local branches may be able to develop effective and electorally popular policy initiatives that the national party can borrow for their national program.         "
"11","In sum, party branches that have strong organizations should be better able to perform the central tasks of the party and thereby help the party succeed in elections and in policymaking than branches with weak organizations. Therefore, branches with strong organizations are likely to be more powerful than their organizationally weak counterparts."
"12","One observable implication of this theory is that the behavior and status of representatives from powerful subunits are likely to be different from the behavior of representatives from weak subunits. Indeed, commentators have pointed out that strong party structure at the local level increases the personal influence of activists from that branch (PNB 2001) and that the support of such branches is necessary to construct a power base within the party (CTK 1994). Specifically, the theory implies that MPs from districts with strong party branches are more likely (1) to behave independently in parliament and break party unity and (2) to hold powerful positions—such as leadership positions in parliamentary committees—than MPs from districts with weak party branches.         "
"13","MPs are generally elected from specific electoral districts and are therefore tied, at least to some extent, to a party subunit in that district. Even in countries with one nationwide district, most MPs get their votes in a geographically concentrated manner and are tied to a geographically based party subunit (Crisp and Ingall 2002; Hazan 1999). Representatives are likely to be at least partially focused on issues and preferences of their district, and these preferences may not always be in line with those of the national party leadership. Several studies argue that there is an inherent tension between local and national representation and that the former is likely to lead to more individualistic behavior in parliament (Ames 2001; Bowler and Farrell 1993; Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina, 1987; Carey 2009; Crisp et al. 2004; Morgenstern, 2004; Sieberer 2006; Stratman and Baur 2002). The pressure to sometimes prioritize local issues over national party interests, exerted by the local party organization or by voters directly, is likely to be present regardless of the strength of the local organization.4 Where subunit power is likely to make a difference, however, is whether or not and, if so, how frequently, an MP chooses to give in to this pressure. MPs from more powerful subunits can pursue local or personal interests more freely, i.e., with less fear of punishment by party leadership, than MPs from less powerful branches. Since the central party leadership depends crucially on the powerful subunits, they are more likely to overlook and not punish dissenting behavior by MPs from those subunits. MPs are likely to be prominent and critical actors in their branch; punishing them equals punishing the subunit, and this association is one way they can be shielded from the wrath of the central party. In cases where branches themselves, and not the central party leadership, are in charge of executing any punishments decided on the central level, a branch can protect MPs even more directly by refusing to discipline them. In sum, because subunits with strong local party organization are indispensable for the party leadership, MPs from districts with such subunits are more likely to vote against the party line than their copartisans from districts with weak party subunits.5"
"14","An example may help illustrate the theoretical argument. In the Czech Republic, the Member of Parliament Vlasimil Tlusty, who belonged to the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS), frequently voted against the government's policy proposals throughout the 2006–2009 term and was in general known as a rebel within the party. This led the party leadership to call for the local branch to expel him from the party. The central party also wanted to expel another ODS rebel—Jan Schwippel—after he voted with the opposition to topple the ODS government in the spring of 2009 (CTK 2009c). However, the two MPs fared quite differently. Schwippel's branch was under a serious threat of dissolution if it did not expel the MP (CTK 2009b). The branch was weak: it only had five members, most of whom were Schwippel's own relatives, and doing away with it would not have done much harm to the party. Schwippel resigned on his own initiative to avoid the dissolution of the local organization. Tlusty's branch refused to abide by the leadership's request to expel him despite the potential threat of dissolution (CTK 2008). This branch was considerably stronger, as indicated by the 29 members who turned out to vote on Tlusty's case. In the event, the central office withdrew the calls for dissolving the branch (CTK 2009a). The local organization in question was simply too valuable an asset for the party.6"
"15","Subunit power is manifested not only in voting behavior, but also in the positions MPs hold while in parliament. Some of these positions are more desirable than others because they allow for more resources, visibility, and/or policy influence. A leadership position within a parliamentary committee is an example of such a position. Committee chairs and vice chairs plan and direct the legislative, oversight, and appointment responsibilities of the committee and thereby potentially exercise more influence in the parliamentary arena than the ordinary members of the assembly. Indeed, literature on parliamentary politics in various contexts, including advanced democracies as well as the postcommunist countries, treats committee leadership positions as influential and desirable (see Clark, Verseckaite, and Lukosaitis 2006; Fenno 1973; Holbrook and Tidmarch 1993; Smith and Remington 2001; Zubek 2008). Committee membership and leadership positions are generally decided at the party level. It is therefore fair to assume that intraparty power plays a role in who is nominated for a committee leadership position. If subunit strength indicates such power, then MPs from organizationally strong subunits are more likely to obtain leadership positions compared to their copartisans from weak subunits. Party leadership may want to nominate MPs from powerful branches to influential positions in order to keep the branches motivated: to reward them for good work and give incentives to continue mobilizing and communicating with voters. In addition to the visibility and influence, such positions may also provide MPs with better access to electorally valuable distributive goods, which further motivate and help the strong branches in their mobilization efforts.            "
"16","Contrary to the arguments presented here, the existing literature has largely assumed that power is concentrated in the hands of the leadership who have demonstrated their superiority of expertise or other skills and have therefore become indispensable for members (Michels 1966; Panebianco 1988; Scarrow, Webb, and Farrell 2002). These studies generally disregard party subunits as potential loci of power and therefore provide no prediction about the distribution of power beyond the leadership, or implicitly assume that all subunits possess equally little power because the center has an equal control over party subunits via the allocation of resources such as funding and a party label. For the relationship explored here, this would mean that an MP's branch affiliation plays no role in his or her behavior or position in parliament.7"
"17","In order to test the proposed argument, I use data from four postcommunist democracies: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland. The postcommunist region (unlike the advanced democracies) offers considerable variance in the organizational strength of party subunits and the extent of MP independence. The four countries constitute “most different systems” in the context of postcommunist Central and Eastern Europe. First, the four countries exhibit different levels of party system stability, with the Czech Republic and Hungary being the most stable in the region, Poland being the least, and Estonia representing a middle category. In terms of historical legacies, Estonia was part of the Soviet Union while the three others were not. Another potentially relevant factor is the electoral system. The four countries represent a variety of electoral systems used in the region: Hungary employs a mixed‐member system with single‐member‐district (SMD) and closed‐list proportional representation (PR) tiers, while the three others have open‐list PR electoral systems.8 The number and size of districts in the latter three countries also differ, with Poland using many and smaller whereas the Czech Republic and Estonia use few but larger districts. If the hypothesized relationship emerges in all countries despite the variety of differences between them, then the generalizability of the findings is enhanced.9"
"18","The dataset includes information from 12 legislative terms: the Czech Republic 1996–1998, 1998–2002, 2002–2006, 2006–2009; Estonia 1999–2003, 2003–2007; Hungary 1994–1998, 1998–2002, 2002–2006; Poland 1997–2001, 2001–2005, 2005–2007 for all MPs that belong to a party (i.e., excluding independents).10 Each term is a separate dataset, and rather than pooling across all of them, I perform separate analyses for each.         "
"19","The first hypothesis to be tested is that MPs from districts where their party has a stronger local organization are more likely to vote against the party line than their copartisans from districts where the local party organization is weak."
"20","The dependent variable for this analysis—Defection rate, or the rate at which an MP has defected from the party line of voting—is measured based on an MP's voting record in a given legislative term. In all four countries almost all votes, with only a handful of exceptions, are publicly recorded votes. This avoids selection bias in determining MPs’ voting behavior (Carrubba et al. 2006). Specifically, the measure identifies the share of recorded votes by a given legislator that deviates from the party line of voting. Following previous research, I infer party line from the behavior of the majority of its members who are present and participate in voting (Carey 2009; Skjaeveland 2001). That is, when a majority of party members vote “aye,” then “nay” and “abstain” votes are coded as defections.11 When no majority of party members who are present vote the same way, then there is no party line and no defections are possible. The participation rate can vary significantly, and it is fair to assume that votes where very few party members participate are not important to the party and no clear party position exists. Therefore, for measurement purposes, defection is only possible in the case of those votes where the majority (50%) of party members were present and voting.12 The formal presentation of the measurement of this variable is given in the online Supporting Information. The measure ranges from 0 to 1 and the actual values in all countries and parliamentary terms are highly skewed toward the low end of the scale, as most MPs vote with the party most of the time. Therefore, I have log‐transformed the dependent variable before using it in the analysis.13"
"21","Subunit organizational strength was defined as the extensive local presence of the local party unit and its participation in local affairs. This can be captured by considering the ability of a party to contest local government (municipal) elections in a given district (Deegan‐Krause 2006; Mudde 2007; Tavits 2009b). Specifically, the variable is measured by the share of local governments in a given national electoral district where a party runs its candidates in the local government election under the party label. The theoretical range of the measure is from 0 to 1.14 For each parliamentary term, I consider those local elections that immediately preceded or occurred in the same year as the start of that parliamentary term.15 Thus, the values of this variable are different for the different datasets (parliamentary terms) of one country.16"
"22","I consider this a valid indicator of subunit organizational strength for several reasons. Theoretically, a subunit that is able to run candidates in all (or most) local governments is (1) likely to have organizational presence in these localities in order to be able to nominate local candidates and (2) likely to have membership in these localities from which to draw nominees. Essentially, thus, organizational strength is a necessary precondition for being able to run candidates in local elections district‐wide and therefore serves as a valid and reliable indicator for the concept as defined here. Furthermore, party officials themselves and the media in the region use this indicator to compare the strength of parties in different regions and nationwide (Ideon 2009; Kalmre 1996). Other potential measures, such as district‐level party membership or the number of local party offices, are hard or impossible to obtain for all elections included in the analysis: parties are reluctant to give out information about their organization, and some parties do not even collect such information. Unlike the data on membership and local branches, reliable information about candidates in local elections is available for all parties included in the study across time from national election commissions or national archives. Tavits (2009b) presents evidence with data from postcommunist countries that, measured on national level, party membership, the number of branch offices per municipality, and the share of municipalities contested in local elections, are highly correlated and load on the same factor.17 Descriptive statistics for the dependent and independent variables are available in the Supporting Information.            "
"23","Other variables may account for why some MPs are more rebellious than others. I control for seniority, which can be measured in two different ways. First, Parliamentary term indicates the length of an MP's political career. It is measured in the number of terms (including the current one) that an MP has served in parliament. Second, National politician—measured by whether or not a given MP has held or is holding a cabinet position—indicates seniority in terms of one's position in the party. The predictions of the effects of these variables are not straightforward. On the one hand, politicians who have been in parliament longer and have more seniority may be less likely to break party unity (Bowler, Farrell, and Katz 1999) because their longevity and position are likely to be due, at least partially, to their loyalty (see Kam 2009). Furthermore, it is likely that such senior members belong to the party leadership and have an active role in designing party policies in the first place. On the other hand, nationally known politicians may have built strong personal reputations, feel less dependent on their party, and be more likely to vote against the party line.            "
"24","Additionally, it is possible that MPs from districts that have strong organizations behave independently not because of the strength of the subunits, but because of their personal characteristics or attributes. It may even be that the local organization, rather than empowering the MP, is strong only because of the strength of their MP. There is some evidence that MPs with local‐level representative experience—Local politicians—are less dependent on parties for their (political) careers because of their local prominence and therefore more likely to break party unity (Tavits 2009a). This is in line with the theoretical logic about the distribution of power within the organization proposed here, but focuses on the individual rather than organizational attributes, and therefore represents a potential alternative causal mechanism. Local politician is measured by a dummy variable coded “1” for those MPs who have had subnational‐level representative experience as mayors or local or regional councilors in their electoral district prior to or simultaneously with current national legislative appointment.18"
"25","Another alternative interpretation of the relationship proposed here is that MPs from districts with strong party organizations appear more independent not because of the power of their branch but because in such districts the intraparty competition for a seat is more fierce. Strong subunits are more likely to have more members, i.e., more potential candidates to choose from, than weak ones. Strong subunits are also more likely than weak subunits to participate in local politics and local affairs in other ways, which helps a greater number of potential candidates to obtain local name recognition and gather political experience. Therefore, in districts where the party has a strong as opposed to a weak organization, there are more likely to be a number of well‐qualified candidates, and intraparty competition for votes is greater. This incentivizes MPs from that district to differentiate themselves from copartisans (Carey and Shugart 1995). One way to do so is to behave more independently in parliament. The level of internal competition can be controlled for by the Number of competitors—a variable measured for each MP as the number of copartisan MPs from his or her district.1"
"26","Third, I argued that some organizational subunits are more powerful within the party because their organization is stronger at the grassroots level and therefore better able to perform the tasks central to the party—winning votes and communicating with the electorate. One might argue that the reported finding is not due to any organizational strength, but solely due to the electoral strength of the party in some districts compared to others. In order to control for such a possibility, I will also include a variable measuring the Electoral strength of each party in each district in terms of vote share in the national election that occurred prior to the start of the parliamentary term.            "
"27","Party dummies are also included in order to accurately capture the intraparty rather than cross‐party effects. Parties may differ in their overall level of voting unity. For example, opposition parliamentarians may be more likely to break party unity than coalition politicians regardless of their local ties, given that they have lower stakes in the policymaking process (Owens 2003). Similarly, other party‐specific factors may influence the likelihood of defections. For example, parties with centralized nomination rules may be more coherent (although see Shomer 2009), and those with no real chance of winning or losing as a result of defections (i.e., very small and very big parties) face no real incentive to preserve unity (Bowler, Farrell, and Katz 1999). Any district‐level correlation is accounted for by the robust standard errors clustered on electoral district.            "
"28","Table 1 presents the results of the 12 analyses using ordinary least squares regression. The table is arranged with independent variables in columns and different analyses in rows. The strength of the local party organization is positively and significantly associated with the frequency of defections in 8 out of the 12 models. MPs from districts where the local party organization has strong grassroots presence behave more independently in parliament than their copartisans from districts where the local party organization is weak.            "
"29","The hypothesized effect does not occur simply because of the personal attributes of MPs, the level of electoral competitiveness, and the electoral strength of the party. These control variables posed a particular challenge for detecting any organizational effects because they are highly correlated with each other and with the measure of organizational strength. Indeed, in all datasets where the hypothesized effect is statistically significant, it becomes much stronger than reported in Table 1 when these three control variables are excluded from the models. Furthermore, although the relationship does not hold in all parliamentary terms analyzed, the fact that it does hold in all four countries is suggestive of a general effect. Indeed, if the 12 different datasets were pooled into one single dataset, then we would observe a very strong overall relationship between local subunit strength and the likelihood of MP dissent.            "
"30","Because the dependent variable is log‐transformed, the coefficients of the independent variables can be interpreted as the percent change in the dependent variable given one unit change in the independent variable (Wooldridge 2002). A one‐unit increase in the strength of the local party organization implies a change from the minimum to the theoretical maximum because the variable only ranges from 0 to 1. The latter may not always be the actual maximum, although in most cases it closely approximates it. With these caveats in mind, the results for the Czech Republic show very strong effects: increasing subunit organizational strength from the absolute minimum to the absolute maximum results in 94%, 78%, and 66% increases in the defection rate in 1996–1998, 1998–2002, and 2002–2006, respectively. For the other cases, this effect is somewhat lower, ranging from 23% in Poland (1997–2001) to about 30–40% in Estonia (1999–2003), Hungary (1998–2002, 2002–2006), and Poland (2005–2007). These results suggest that the intraorganizational power of strong subunits enables MPs from those subunits not to follow the central party line if it contradicts their personal or constituency preferences. While all MPs may have equally strong incentives to sometimes serve their personal or constituency interests by dissenting from the party line in parliament, those from more powerful branches are more likely to get away with such dissent.            "
"31","A few words are on order for the datasets in the case of which the hypothesis did not find support. Since there was one failing case for all countries, the reasons for finding a null effect are not likely to be country‐specific but specific to a parliamentary term. A few possible factors separate the failing cases from the rest: the entry of many or large new parties to the parliament, party splits, and a polarized legislature. Estonia and Poland both witnessed the emergence of successful new parties in which the internal organizational power distribution may not have taken root yet. In Estonia, Res Publica entered parliament for the first time in 2003, tying for the largest number of seats in parliament. In Poland, a total of three new parties entered the 2001 parliament: Law and Justice, Civic Platform, and League of Polish Families. It is possible that in new parties and in legislatures dominated by these parties, the personal attributes of the MPs have a stronger effect on voting behavior than any organizational factors. Additionally, in Hungary, the right‐wing parties of the Christian Democratic People’s Party and the Independent Smallholders’ Party experienced significant splits during the 1994–1998 legislative term. As was the case with new party entry, during the institutional flux created by party splits, the patterns of power distribution may be disrupted. Finally, in the Czech Republic the parliament was significantly polarized during the 2006–2009 legislative term and the government controlled only a slim (if any) majority. This may have also altered the intraparty power dynamics by making it more costly to defect. Future studies may want to analyze more systematically conditions under which intraorganizational power structure breaks down or changes. The failing cases may be especially informative for this purpose."
"32","In addition to voting behavior, I have also hypothesized that subunit power can be manifested in the committee leadership positions. Specifically, because such positions are desirable and influential within the parliament, the party leadership should fill these positions with MPs who command more intraorganizational power, i.e., those MPs who are associated with strong party branches. In order to test this hypothesis I have assembled information on committee chairs and vice chairs in each parliamentary term. In all four countries included in this study, these positions are filled with MPs from both the opposition and coalition parties, and committee membership and nomination for leadership positions are decided at the party level. The variable is labeled Committee leadership position and coded “1” if a given MP holds (at least) one such position during a given parliamentary term and “0” otherwise.21 On average, about 20–30% of MPs had held such a position. The average is higher (52%) in the Czech Chamber of Deputies in 2006–2009. The descriptive statistics are presented in the Supporting Information.         "
"33","Table 2 presents the results of probit regressions using committee leadership position, which is a binary measure, as the dependent variable and subunit organizational strength as the independent variable. For the sake of consistency, all control variables remain the same as in Table 1. The models also include party dummies and robust standard errors clustered on electoral district.         "
"34","As the results show, subunit organizational strength has a positive and significant effect on the probability of holding committee leadership positions in 9 out of the 12 models. MPs who come from organizationally strong party subunits are more likely to become committee chairs and vice chairs than their copartisans from weak subunits. This general pattern supports the substantive conclusion drawn from the analysis of parliamentary voting—organizationally strong subunits are likely to command more intraparty power than weak subunits. Furthermore, note that even though this effect is not statistically significant in all datasets, there is no dataset where both tests (i.e., Table 1 and Table 2) generate insignificant results. At least one of the alternative measures of the dependent variable (i.e., either the defection rate or the committee leadership position) is related to organizational strength in a statistically significant manner in all 12 cases.         "
"35","As for committee leadership positions, the substantive effects of organizational strength are sizable in most cases, as indicated by the marginal effects reported in the table. Furthermore, because the dependent variable represents a binary outcome, one can interpret predicted probabilities above 0.5 as predictions of holding a leadership position and those below 0.5 as predictions of not holding one. In four of the datasets with significant results, the outcome predicted for MPs from the strongest subunits is different from that for MPs from the weakest subunits—the former are likely to hold a committee leadership position while the latter are not. Overall, these results provide further support that organizationally stronger subunits are powerful in that they can influence the central leadership disproportionately."
"36","This study explored the internal power distribution within political parties. I argued that those party branches that have a strong organization on the grassroots level are more likely to be powerful within the party than branches with weak organizations. Organizational strength leads to power because branches with a strong organization are better able to perform the central tasks of the party (communication with and mobilization of the electorate) and thereby decrease uncertainty about achieving the main goals of the party (votes and policy)."
"37","The article tests this argument by considering the relative independence and visibility of MPs elected from districts where party branches are strong compared to MPs elected from districts with weak branches. Specifically, I have considered the likelihood of MPs to vote against the official party line and to occupy positions important for the party in public office. The results of the analyses using data from different parliamentary terms in four postcommunist countries confirm that MPs from districts where the local party organization is strong are more likely to behave independently in parliament and ignore the party line of voting. This effect is not an artifact of MPs’ personal characteristics or a party's electoral popularity but is likely to result from a direct influence of the power of the local party subunit on the behavior of the MP. That MPs from strong party subunits can ignore the party leadership in voting strongly suggests that such subunits are powerful within the party. Further support for this inference was provided by the result that MPs from organizationally strong subunits are more likely to hold leadership positions within parliamentary committees than their copartisans from weak subunits."
"38","Future studies may extend this line of research by conducting large‐scale surveys of party members, leaders, local subunit organizers, and MPs in order to measure their perception of the distribution of intraparty power, the sources of power, and the effects of it. Such a design may allow theoretical refinement of the arguments presented here, especially of the relationship between the local organization and the individual MPs from those organizations. For example, while I have provided evidence that subunit organizational strength matters for MP behavior, I have not been able to show whether this is because MPs from such local organizations feel empowered or because they are coerced by the party branch to behave in a certain way."
"39","Additionally, it is likely that the unequal distribution of power between subunits also affects observable outcomes not examined here, such as the ideological placement of the party, its coalition preferences, its policy choices, and the like. Future studies may want to explore these effects more closely. Research on any aspect of party politics may want to take into account the possible uneven internal power distribution within political parties. In addition to subunit strength, these studies could also explore other sources of unequal power distribution, including ideological divisions or ties to external actors such as unions or interest groups."
"40","Finally, the study provides important implications to the literature on representation and party unity in parliament. The existing studies have mainly focused on the incentives provided by electoral systems and other institutional structures to explain why MPs stay loyal to the party and represent national‐level issues or become more parochial and ignore the party line in their representational style. The findings here suggest that under similar electoral rules and within the same party under similar party rules, MPs still behave differently. The power distribution within parties itself can determine where MPs’ loyalties lie, and these informal ways in which power is accrued may be more difficult to control by electoral or party rules."
