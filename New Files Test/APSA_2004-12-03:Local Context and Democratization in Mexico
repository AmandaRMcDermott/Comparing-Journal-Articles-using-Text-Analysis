"1","Most citizens in established democracies take for granted that—whatever they may think of the administration of the day—the system of government itself will be democratic. For transitional states, including Mexico, this is not likely to be the case (see e.g., Camp 2001, 1999; Canache 2002; Domínguez and McCann 1996; Domínguez and Poiré 1999; Klesner 1998; Lawson 2000; McCann and Domínguez 1998; Norris 1999; Rose, Mishler, and Haerpfer 1998; Rose, Shin, and Munro 1999). In the context of a democratic opening, “constitutional forms are lifeless or irrelevant if they do not have the support of the people” (Rose, Mishler, and Haerpfer 1998, 8). The question, then, of whether citizens in Mexico and other emerging democracies see their political institutions as genuinely democratic is at once much more uncertain and also more consequential than for those living in established democratic regimes.         "
"2","Mexico, in contrast to many “third wave” democracies, offers an analytically useful case of a country where subnational processes of political opening preceded the arrival of democracy at the national level. The emergence of competitive elections at the subnational level, however, was highly uneven, with the acceptance of multiparty electoral competition in some areas by the mid‐1990s and the continued electoral dominance of the PRI into the twenty‐first century in other parts of the country (Lawson 2000). Taking advantage of this diverse set of subnational political environments coexisting within the same country, we test our argument that local political context shapes one's assessments of procedural fairness and attitudes toward the system more broadly. We then examine how these views of the system in turn affect the willingness of citizens to engage in Mexico's burgeoning democratic politics.         "
"3","As Mexico's one‐party dominant political system slowly began to exhibit signs of change in the 1980s, with isolated opposition party victories at the local level and a growing voice of civil society, scholars began devoting more and more efforts to understanding and explaining the political attitudes of Mexicans (see e.g., Alduncín 1986; Booth and Seligson 1984; Craig and Cornelius 1980; Klesner 1987; Morris 1995). Within this literature, the work of Domínguez and McCann (1996) offers a baseline for understanding the impact of the dramatic social, political, and economic changes taking place in Mexico on the public's political attitudes. They show that, during this period, Mexicans were becoming increasingly committed to democratic values, even across such historically important social divisions as education, gender, and class. Citizens during the late 1980s and early 1990s were seen as having played a role in pushing “elites to democratize the political regime and in so doing have become actors on the nation's public stage” (Domínguez and McCann 1996, 50). In an effort to explain how the change in political attitudes of Mexicans came about, the authors offer several propositions, one of which focused on the heightened electoral competition that had emerged in the country in the 1980s and early 90s, “Mexican politics in the 1990s had become much more competitive than in the 1950s. The very fact of such increased competition may help to explain why Mexicans have become more interested in politics, more willing to participate, and less dependent on a few strong leaders for solving problems” (49–50). This emerging competition had, by 2000, become a fact of life for much of the country.         "
"4","Notwithstanding these broad trends of heightened electoral competition and a more politically engaged public, voter turnout for the historic 2000 presidential election was just 64% compared to 78% for the 1994 presidential elections, while only roughly 40% of eligible voters turned out for the 2003 midterm elections, the lowest of any federal election in over four decades.1 Recent analyses of the 2000 elections have identified several factors behind these low turnout rates that are directly relevant to our discussion of the influences local political context has on citizen attitudes and behavior. First, Klesner and Lawson (2001) find that citizen views of the electoral process in 2000 did in fact affect turnout, with those holding negative views of the process far less likely to cast a ballot than those viewing the electoral process as more or less clean. These findings reinforce those from earlier work on the relationship between views of elections and voter turnout (McCann and Domínguez 1998). Second, at the state level, a fairly strong inverse relationship appears between areas still dominated by the PRI and turnout levels. States long ruled exclusively by the PRI, such as Coahuila, Durango, and Chiapas produced turnout rates between 50 and 60%, while in states where opposition parties had made inroads during the 1990s, such as Jalisco, Aguascalientes, and Querétaro, close to 70% of voters turned out to cast their ballot on election day (http://www.ife.org.mx; see also Elizondo 2003, 35–36). In the subsequent analysis we bring these findings together by testing the notion that state and local electoral environments prior to the 2000 elections affected how citizens viewed the national system, and these views in turn affected their level of engagement within that system.2"
"5","The electoral landscape of Mexico on July 2, 2000 was dramatically different from that of only 15 years before. While the 1997 midterm congressional elections received their proper due as a critical step in the country's move away from its 70‐year, one‐party dominant system, the increasing number of opposition victories across Mexico's municipalities during the 1990s were equally important in demonstrating to Mexicans that elections, once described as a “ritual” (Alonso 1993), were now a mechanism that actually allowed them to “throw the rascals out.3 As Lawson (2000) and others have noted though, this emergence of meaningful elections did not occur evenly across the country. In fact, for close to 25 percent of Mexico's population, the PRI continued its 70‐year monopoly over state and local elections during the watershed years of the 1990s.4"
"6","At the federal level as well there is evidence that citizens experienced quite distinct processes of political change during the 1990s. Drawing from municipal‐level data, Fox concluded that the 1994 federal elections were in fact “two distinct election‐day processes, one ‘modern’ and relatively clean, the other filled with irregularities, including widespread violation of ballot secrecy and direct pressures by local bosses on voters” (1996, 205). Similarly, the election monitoring organization, Alianza Civica, found over twice as many incidents of voter intimidation in the 2000 elections in southern Mexico (with violations found in 23% of observed polling sites) as in the more industrialized north (where violations occurred in 10% of polling sites). These patterns are consistent with our contention that, even on the eve of historic elections, Mexicans were living under distinct subnational electoral regimes (Alianza Civica 2003).         "
"7","These distinct subnational environments of Mexico underscore the fact that, in marked contrast to the situation under established democracies, Mexican citizens could not take the basic character of the regime for granted. A central component of any democracy is the electoral process and, as Tyler (1990) and Lind and Tyler (1988) demonstrate, evaluations of procedural fairness are central to an individual's acceptance of the overall system. Consequently, if the basic system itself is seen as flawed and elections corrupt then citizens may be less willing to fully engage in their country's democratic process and, possibly, be less tolerant of the flaws and failings of the political system. It therefore becomes important to understand those factors that affect citizen views of such fundamental democratic features as elections and whether even in the most general terms they consider their system to be democratic. While broad claims may be made, not least by the Mexican government itself, about the extent and depth of democracy inside the country, the real test is whether or not people themselves find the system to be legitimate.         "
"8","Second, and following on from the previous point, we suggest that the variations in local electoral contexts will play an important role in shaping popular opinions toward the political system more generally. We have two broad reasons for suggesting this. First, a long‐established literature on contextual effects shows that local context helps shape political attitudes and behaviors quite generally. Work by Huckfeldt, for example, demonstrates that the “political opinions and behavior of individuals cannot be understood separate from the environment within which they occur” (1986, 1). “Friends and neighbors” effects are one of the better known examples of these contextual influences (see also, Canache 1996). Another important source of such influences may be found in the subnational context of the roughly 2,400 municipalities and 31 states of Mexico whose electoral environments either contributed to the system's democratization process or reinforced the idea that Mexican elections remained a mere “ritual” (Alonso 1993).         "
"9","Recent attitudinal research emphasizes the role of local institutions in providing voters with specific information which citizens then use to reason about government more generally (Listhaug and Wiberg 1995; Norris 1999; Rose, Shin, Munro 1999; Vetter 2002; Weatherford 1987). Given that many countries around the world are now fully emerged in the process of political decentralization, local political institutions now have an unprecedented visibility among the citizenry and consequently have the potential to dramatically alter how one views the political system and democracy in general (Cornelius 1999; Diamond 1999; Hiskey and Seligson 2003; Grindle 2000; Rodriguez 1997).         "
"10","Moving from how local political context affects system attitudes, we then examine the implications of these system views for citizens' level of engagement with the political system. We argue that the impact of these perceptions of procedural fairness extends beyond the decision to vote into many other areas of an individual's behavior within the political system. A well‐established political science literature ties civic engagement to socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., Verba, Brady, and Schlozman 1996). We argue that active participation in political life is not simply a function of one's socioeconomic status, but also depends, at least in part, on views of the process itself (Aldrich 1993; Klesner and Lawson 2001; McCann and Domínguez 1998; Tyler 1990) For established democracies the question of the cleanliness of electoral procedures generally has been settled and is therefore not likely to color the decision to participate. Thus a relative consensus exists on models of civic engagement for citizens living in established democracies. In democratizing states, where the process is more open to question, these procedural issues are more likely to influence one's decision to engage in politics. In purely instrumental terms, the benefits of political engagement would seem likely to diminish in the eyes of citizens who see the system as flawed. Questions of procedural fairness, then, should be incorporated into standard models of civic engagement in order to more fully understand the forces driving citizens' political behavior in emerging democracies.         "
"11","In this section we specify more fully our expectations regarding the determinants of Mexicans' views of their political system and their level of engagement with that system. The survey data used for analysis of these propositions come from the first wave of the Mexico 2000 Panel Survey Project, conducted in early 2000, approximately six months prior to the presidential election that brought Vicente Fox to power.5 The nationally representative survey of 2,400 Mexicans included respondents from 114 municipalities dispersed across all 31 states and the Federal District. The national coverage of the survey, and the fact that the home municipalities of respondents were included in the data, allows for the assignation of certain municipal and state‐level contextual variables to be assigned to each respondent in order to determine the impact one's political environment has on political attitudes and behavior.         "
"12","In our first set of models, we seek to explain variations across two dichotomous dependent variables, both of which tap certain elements of a respondent's views of the Mexican political system. The first relies on a question that simply asked respondents whether they viewed their system as democratic or not. Though helpful in providing a general assessment of one's views toward the Mexican political system, the multiple meanings attached to the concept of democracy by individuals in emerging democracies limits the utility of this item in measuring one's acceptance and evaluation of democratic procedures (see e.g., Camp 2001; Canache, Mondak, and Seligson 2001).         "
"13","For this reason we use as a second dependent variable a citizen's perception of the cleanliness of electoral procedures in Mexico. In some ways this is a more direct measure of the legitimacy of Mexico's political system. While this item also may suffer somewhat from differing interpretations of the response options, it at least employs a commonly understood process (elections) as its focus. As Camp and others (e.g., McCann and Domínguez 1998) have noted, “Most citizens in political systems where elections occur become involved through voting. Therefore, their ability to affect the outcome of government policy is influenced by their perception of the integrity of the voting process” (Camp 2003, 62). By using these two measures of citizen views of the system, then, we offer a fairly robust test of our contention that local context is critical in understanding how citizens perceive their larger system.6"
"14","Our principal independent variable, a citizen's local electoral environment, is clearly complex. Recognizing that we cannot capture all features of the concept, we first employ a categorical measure based on whether a respondent had experienced life under an opposition party government or not during the 1990s. We contend that the simple fact that an opposition party won control of a respondent's municipality or state carries with it a more general statement on the nature of that respondent's subnational political system during the 1990s. An opposition party victory during this period when the PRI still dominated the levers of power at the national level offers an indication that such democratic conditions as a secret ballot and the relative absence of coercive pressures on voters existed (Fox 1996). By using a measure that combines the partisan nature of state and local government during the 1990s, then, we have the ability to assess the impact of distinct electoral environments on citizen perceptions of their national system.7"
"15","Respondents were assigned one of four electoral environments based on the patterns of municipal and state government under which they lived during the ten years leading up to the 2000 elections.8 These are incorporated into our models as dummy variables with those respondents living in a PRI‐dominant environment (a town and state where the PRI did not lose between 1989 and 1999) serving as the base group. The expectation is that those respondents that experienced life under an opposition government during the 1990s will express more positive views of the democratic nature of Mexico's political system on the eve of the historic 2000 presidential elections than will their counterparts living in areas still ruled exclusively by the PRI.         "
"16","We also include two additional measures of subnational electoral environments across Mexico. First, we use Fox's (1996) state‐level data on the percentage of a state's polling sites that were observed by representatives of opposition parties during the 1994 federal elections. This ranges from Oaxaca, where opposition representatives were present at only 66% of the state's polling sites to Baja California Norte, where close to 99% of polling sites had opposition observers. The underlying assumption of this measure is that the presence of opposition party election observers helps ensure a far cleaner electoral process than one where elections were overseen only by representatives of the PRI and thus provides a rough gauge as to the advance of free and fair elections within a state circa 1994. Second, we include Crespo's state‐level index of party competition for 1994 (Crespo 1996).9 Where genuine multiparty competition exists at the state level we should expect voters to recognize and respond to that in terms of their views of the procedural fairness of the system as a whole. By using all three “context” measures, one derived from Fox, one from Crespo, and a third derived from our categorization of respondents' electoral environments, we seek to cast as wide a net as possible over the complex concept of one's electoral environment. To the extent that these measures work in consistent ways in the subsequent models we can have some confidence that our findings are not dependent upon a particular specification of the concept.         "
"17","Of course, local context is not going to be the only factor that shapes such attitudes, and we need to control for possible rival explanations. Chief among these additional determinants are economic factors. Along with controlling for individual‐level characteristics (education, income, age, gender)10 we also incorporate a respondent's socioeconomic environment into the model. Richer polities are often held ceteris paribus to have the conditions necessary for democratic development. We would expect then that citizens living in more developed municipalities are going to be more democratically inclined than their counterparts in less developed areas. To address this possibility, we include the degree of “marginalization” of a respondent's municipality11 and a categorical assessment of the level of urban development of the municipality.12 If the socioeconomic context in which a respondent lives affects his/her views of the political system, we should see an inverse relationship between the measure of marginalization and respondent assessments of Mexico's democracy circa 2000. Our view, though, sees one's electoral environment as far more important in shaping political attitudes than his/her development context.         "
"18","Personal economic circumstances may also affect views of the system. Citizens who are going through a rougher period economically may be more likely to be have pessimistic views of the system than those whose economic fortunes have improved of late (Clarke et al. 1993). To control for this possibility we include in the subsequent models a respondents' perceptions of their personal economic circumstances. To further account for the impact a respondent's views of his/her current situation might have on more general evaluations of the political system, we include in the models respondents' views of the current administration (Ernesto Zedillo) and their views of the level of corruption in government.13"
"19","Finally, we also incorporate into the model variables intended to control for an expected “winners' effect.” Generally speaking those who do well in a political system are more likely to regard the process as more fair and democratic than those who do not (e.g., Anderson and Guillory 1999; Blais and Nadeau 1993; Booth and Seligson 1993). We would therefore expect supporters of the PRI to be much more positive toward the system than other voters prior to the 2000 elections, regardless of the context in which they live. An indication of this “winners' effect” comes from the dramatic increase in positive views of the electoral process among supporters of the PAN after the 2000 elections, when their candidate had won.14 But it may also be the case that those with strong attachments to parties in general are likely to have some commitment to the electoral process. By contrast, those citizens with no strong attachments to any of the three major parties are likely to be less persuaded that the system works. Therefore we include a series of party identification dummy variables with those respondents not professing support for any of the major political parties serving as the baseline group.15"
"20","In the second stage of our analysis we consider the impact that views of the system and perceptions of electoral fairness have on the willingness of citizens to engage in politics even in very simple ways. If one's local political context affects how one views her larger political system, we then want to examine the connection between those views and subsequent patterns of political behavior."
"21","In modeling citizen engagement within an emergent democratic system, a citizen's views of the system's procedural fairness may be an important determinant of how much the individual interacts with the system. In addition to one's perception of the system, we also include the standard set of socioeconomic controls (e.g., income, education) as well as a respondents' ideology and partisan affiliation, and their views of the current government, their personal economic situation, and the level of corruption in the system. All of these items are straightforward components of individual‐level models of civic engagement in established democracies (see e.g., Dalton 1996; Listhaug, Aardal, and Ellis 2002; Norris 1999). By accounting for these other factors, then, we hope to identify more clearly the additional leverage in understanding civic engagement gained from knowing one's views of the political system.         "
"22","The idea of civic engagement encompasses far more than the act of simply marking a ballot. It can also be taken to mean the degree to which citizens are interested in and attentive to politics. Below, we consider the willingness to turn out and vote and three other factors: interest in politics,16 interest in the current campaign,17 and the frequency that an individual talks to others about politics.18 These measures represent an individual's willingness to engage in politics and civic life. In the subsequent analysis we focus our attention on what we term an “engagement index” that combines the “interest in politics” items into an additive index.19 Our second dependent variable combines this index with the voting intention item included in the survey. We also run separate models for each of the individual items to ensure our results are consistent. If our hypothesized relationships hold across several different measures and indicators of engagement we can have greater confidence that our results are robust and do not simply depend on one particular specification of this complex concept.         "
"23"," Klesner (2001) and Klesner and Lawson's (2001) findings of a strong relationship between citizens' views of the elections and their decisions to vote in the 2000 elections suggest the implications of the relationship between attitudes and behavior. While in the previous, one‐party dominant system, the PRI could rely on its monopoly over government resources as a means to ensure mass participation in politics, such explicitly material incentives to participate had become increasingly less common in the emerging multiparty system of the late 1990s. At the aggregate level this perhaps helps explain why voter turnout for the 2000 elections was13 points lower than in the 1994 presidential elections in which PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo won by a considerable margin. As the patron‐client bargains of the past became less relevant, and citizens in PRI‐dominant areas perceived a decade of national‐level political change as essentially meaningless since at the local and state level the PRI continued to dominate, they may have opted out of the 2000 electoral process.         "
"24","In analyzing the turnout data from 2000, Klesner (2001) finds that in districts where Fox's “Alliance for Change” candidates won, voter turnout averaged 66%, nearly 7 percentage points higher than in districts where PRI federal deputy candidates won. These findings are highly suggestive of a far more engaged citizenry in areas not controlled by the PRI, supporting our contention of identifiable linkages between local context, attitudes toward the system, and levels of engagement with that system (Klesner 2001; Klesner and Lawson 2001). Through analysis of variations in our “engagement index” we seek to establish that even beyond voting, the “local connection” is vital in understanding why some Mexicans were highly engaged in the new, more democratic political system of 2000 while others, during this watershed period in Mexico's political development, remained on the sidelines.         "
"25","One perennial problem in political behavior research is determining the causal nature of relationships between reported attitudes and behaviors of respondents.20 For our purposes, this problem presents itself in the form of the hypothesis that rather than views of the system affecting behavior, one's level of civic engagement in fact may shape her attitudes toward the political system. From this perspective, as one's level of engagement with the system increases, attitudes toward the system become more positive.         "
"26","We view this possibility either as a function of a learning process, where through involvement with politics the individual learns more about the merits of the system and thus subsequently holds more positive views of that system or simply as a post‐hoc justification for past behavior, where individuals with high levels of political engagement tend to profess more positive views of the system in order to justify their high level of involvement. Both of these processes are plausible, and ultimately make the connection between attitudes and behaviors, at least in democratic systems, circular to some extent. The task then of identifying the causal relationship between views of the system and levels of political engagement becomes not only one of demonstrating a significant statistical relationship between attitudes and behavior, but also of constructing a theoretical logic for such a relationship."
"27","For several reasons we believe that it is reasonable to suppose that a causal relationship runs from perceptions to behavior. First, a growing body of research at the cross‐national level suggests that in emerging democracies institutional performance does affect how citizens interact with their political system. Diamond notes this relationship between poor performing institutions and levels of engagement in his discussion of the “delegative democracies” of Latin America, where the “fundamental ills—personalism, concentration of power, and weak, unresponsive political institutions—have prominently contributed to the turbulence and poor quality of democracy and to the consequent political cynicism and apathy among Latin America” (1999, 39; see also McCann and Domínguez 1998; O'Donnell 1993). The implication is that as citizens increasingly view the system as one of “poor quality” they will then choose to disengage from political life, much in the same way as we have described. If a high level of engagement in politics alters one's views of the political system, as the alternative hypothesis would posit, the individual will either encounter a “cleaner” system than expected and change her views accordingly, or will discover through political engagement a “poor performing” system, a situation that would likely result in a more negative view of the system. Given that Mexico's political system on the eve of the 2000 elections was unevenly clean at best, we view the notion that engagement with politics would only cause one to view the system in a more positive light as unlikely.         "
"28","Only for those individuals whose political engagement led them to discover the progress that had been made in the Mexican system prior to the 2000 elections would this proposition make intuitive sense. Given the concerted efforts of Mexico's Federal Electoral Institute to assure all of Mexico's voters that their vote would be “free and secret,” there likely were many citizens whose political engagement did bring about a more positive assessment of the system. We see as equally likely, though, the opposite scenario, where individuals with high levels of involvement in politics would be less inclined to see Mexico's system as “clean” because of their direct experience with the less democratic aspects of the political system. Conversely, the proposition that one's assessment of the procedural fairness of a system helps explain their willingness to engage in politics has but one theoretically plausible outcome. That is, it is hard to imagine how seeing one's political system as fair will cause an individual to further disengage from politics."
"29","Finally, other research on political behavior also offers support for the “attitudes shape behavior” thesis. Cox's seminal work on strategic voting argues precisely this point in modeling the likelihood of an individual casting a strategic vote. It is the individual's view of the competitiveness of the district that leads her to cast the strategic vote, not the other way around (2002). Lanoue and Bowler (1992) found a similar process occurring among British voters. On the face of it then we view as having a stronger theoretical foundation the idea that one's views of the fairness of the system will affect his/her level of engagement, even while recognizing the potential for engagement to alter one's views as well.         "
"30","With respect to our first question concerning the factors affecting citizen perceptions of the national political system, the results displayed in Table 1 show that, in general, local context matters even after we control for a range of factors. The first two columns display results from our models of responses to the question “Is Mexico a democracy or not?” while the second two offer the model coefficients for respondent views of the “cleanliness” of Mexico's elections. For both models we employ a logistic regression analysis.21"
"31","The main variables of interest are those concerned with the local political context. We see for example a generally positive impact of measures of state‐level political context derived from the works of Crespo and Fox. Where multiparty competition is higher, citizens are more likely to expect elections to be cleaner and see Mexico as a democracy. We also see the same effect for states where more opposition observers were in place during previous elections. Looking at the impact of even more localized context we also see that voters respond not just to state‐level events but also to local events (PRI dominated localities in PRI states are the omitted category). In short, for a variety of measures, respondents living in areas that have experienced some form of opposition government were significantly more likely to have a positive view of the country's democratization process than those living in regions still dominated by the PRI."
"32","It is worth emphasizing that these contextual effects emerge despite the powerful influences of the other variables included in the model such as a respondent's evaluation of Zedillo, his/her evaluation of the economy and corruption, and his/her partisan orientation. All of these exhibit an important influence on views of the Mexican system, and all in the expected direction. For example, the more negative a respondent's view of Zedillo's performance as president, the more likely he/she was to characterize the Mexican system as undemocratic. Once controlling for these effects, one might expect the impact of the local electoral environment to diminish; yet it clearly persists independent of these individual‐level factors."
"33","One of the more intriguing results from this model is the insignificance of the coefficient for the marginalization level of a respondent's municipality. What this suggests is that perhaps geography or economic development is not “destiny” in terms of Mexican political attitudes, but rather, those attitudinal differences that appear to correspond to differences in development levels are more a product of the political development divides that characterize Mexican society and overlap the country's economic development gaps. Given the tendency among many observers to focus explanations of political unrest in developing democracies primarily on economic variables, this finding indicates that, at least with respect to system evaluations, local economic conditions are secondary to local political conditions in terms of shaping a citizen's views of the political system."
"34","Given the fairly vague nature of the “Is Mexico a democracy?” item, the results displayed in the second two columns of Table 1, those showing the impact of one's local electoral environment on views of the “cleanliness” of national‐level elections, are of more interest in our efforts at identifying the import of local context. Once again we find significant coefficients for the set of control variables, assuring that the model has included at least some of the more important determinants of citizen views toward the electoral process. Despite the strength of these control variables, both of the state‐level measures of political context and two‐of‐the‐three measures of local electoral environment have significant impacts.         "
"35","The one electoral environment variable that offers very little to the model is the category of respondents living in municipalities that had elected at least one opposition mayor during the 1990s, but were in states where the PRI continued its 70‐year electoral control of the governor's office. This finding highlights what many scholars of Mexico's decentralization reforms have found, namely that those reforms have generally served to strengthen the power of governors in such politically contentious areas as education and social development programs (e.g., Rodríguez 1997). Furthermore, the role of state governments in determining the level of autonomy and authority granted state electoral councils would seem to greatly affect the nature of one's political context.22 Thus, even if an opposition party were able to capture a municipal government election, it may have been incapable of countering the impact of a PRI‐dominant state government on citizen views of electoral fairness. Conversely, in those states where an opposition party was able to take control of the governor's office, respondents living in PRI‐dominant municipalities may still have had sufficient evidence that the country's electoral process was largely free and fair based on the positive impact the opposition government had on the state's electoral context.         "
"36","One way of showing the substantive significance of these patterns is to look at changes in the dependent variable. Table 2 shows the change in probability of seeing Mexico as a democracy and seeing elections as clean by the electoral context. As can be seen, the substantive import of these effects can be quite large. For example, when we compare “similar” individuals (e.g., same levels of education and income) who live in different electoral environments, we find that the likelihood of viewing the electoral process as “clean” moves from .28 for someone living in a PRI‐dominant state and municipality to .79 for someone living in a state and municipality where an opposition party had at least one election. This difference alone carries with it enormous implications for how much legitimacy is accorded a system by society. With this result we see how critical these subnational processes are in the broader concern of citizen support for democracy across many of the newly democratized systems of the developing world. Local electoral environments, even when coarsely defined, do seem to affect how citizens view their political systems and the electoral process that underlies that system.         "
"37","But do these perceptions, and in particular the perception of the cleanliness of the electoral process, have behavioral consequences? The short answer to this question is yes. Table 3 shows the results from a series of models on our engagement index and its components. These results show that assessments of procedural fairness do indeed shape a citizen's willingness to engage in political activities more generally. In all models, one of the strongest determinants of levels of citizen engagement is how fair an individual perceives the electoral process to be. Whether one measures engagement in terms of our “engagement index” or by any of its individual components, we can see that assessments of the system significantly affect a citizen's willingness to engage in democratic politics.         "
"38","Finally, neither of the contextual variables help explain citizen levels of engagement with politics, nor does a person's assessment of whether Mexico was a democracy at the time of the survey. Local context, then, has a direct and significant effect on how citizens view their system. Those attitudes, in turn, are critical in how willing an individual is to become involved in the political system and become, in Almond and Verba's classic term, “participatory” citizens."
"39","To empirically test the competing proposition that it was in fact the level of engagement of citizens that was affecting their perceptions of the system, we carried out a three‐stage simultaneous regression model to determine the relative strength of perceptions of clean elections on level of engagement and level of engagement on perceptions of clean elections. While we do not wish to place too much emphasis on this estimation procedure alone, given the nature of identification issues in structural models, the results do support in our view the more theoretically compelling proposition regarding how these variables relate to one another. We find that one's level of civic engagement does appear to have a significant, positive impact on views of the system as the alternative hypothesis would suggest. The strength of this relationship however, is outweighed by the effect of one's views of elections on levels of engagement. After standardizing the metrics for both variables, the magnitude of the coefficient for views of clean elections on political engagement was 30% greater than the impact of engagement on views of clean elections.23"
"40","A fundamental concern of scholars of democratization has been the factors that lead to the acceptance of, and basic belief in, the principal elements of a democracy among citizens. We offer an analysis of what we see as an essential determinant of the mass public's views of the political system, the local political context in which they live. Across the developing world democratic systems of government face multiple threats to their continued survival, from recurring economic crises to the persistent and in many cases growing inequalities that characterize many of these societies. We see the local context as a critical frontline for these struggling democracies, one where support for and engagement with a democratic system of government can either be fostered or frustrated."
"41","In the case of Mexico, the direct experience of life under a subnational opposition government during the 1990s served to inculcate among citizens in those areas an acceptance of the fairness of elections and of the Mexican system as democratic, attitudes that in turn increased one's willingness to engage in the formal political system. A significant portion of Mexicans, however, never had the experiential evidence of a local opposition government to support the claim that Mexico was becoming more democratic. For these citizens, regardless of what was taking place at the national level, life in their community continued to be ruled by a one‐party regime. On the eve of Mexico's historic elections in 2000, then, these citizens were far more inclined to view the system as fundamentally flawed and consequently many chose to disengage from political life during a watershed moment in their country's political development. Those still living under PRI‐dominant subnational electoral “regimes” today perhaps continue to view the system as undemocratic and elections as unfair, regardless of the fact that the PRI's 70‐year grip on the presidency has been broken. A significant portion of Mexico's population thus may be less inclined to support the inevitable jumps and starts of their country's new political regime and be more inclined to pursue their political objectives outside the legal avenues of the system. Anecdotal support of this proposition comes from the 2003 midterm elections, where turnout levels were among the lowest in Mexico's postrevolution period."
"42","The unwillingness to engage in the formal political system is particularly relevant for indigenous groups that are based largely in those regions still dominated by the PRI. It is in these regions where belief in the fairness of the system is most critical in fostering participation within rather than outside the system. Unfortunately, our analysis suggests that it is precisely these areas where citizens are most likely to view the system as fundamentally flawed and thus “disengage” from formal political participation. Mexico, as well as many other countries around the world, has witnessed one likely alternative to formal engagement with the system in the form of guerilla movements and other violent forms of political expression."
"43","The larger implications of these findings speak to some of the fundamental concerns of scholars focused on the societal and attitudinal requisites of democratic consolidation (Diamond 1999; Easton 1975; Inglehart 1997; Lipset, Seong, and Torres 1993). We have identified subnational sources of variations in these mass attitudes. If citizen evaluations of their political system are shaped as much, if not more, by what they experience at the local and state level, rather than processes taking place at the national level, this makes all the more imperative the promotion of democratic local “regimes” across the many countries that have undergone national‐level regime changes. One need only look at the one‐party legacy of the U.S. South to recognize that even in established democratic regimes, very undemocratic local regimes can survive. What the preceding analysis suggests is that these local regimes can have far‐reaching consequences for the level of system support within a society. As the prolonged transitions to democracy continue across the developing world, the importance of citizen support for and participation in democratic politics becomes magnified. Given the diverse subnational electoral environments within these countries, efforts to ensure that the democratization process reaches below the national level seem critical to the larger project of effecting democratic survival at all levels.
