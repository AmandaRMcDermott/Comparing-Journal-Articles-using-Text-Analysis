"1","Governed by the DC for the entire period after World War II until the collapse of the postwar party system in 1993–94, Italy is a country for which the standard expectation is that the DC, having constructed mass political machines in the Italian South in the 1950s, subsequently uses these along with its traditional Catholic subcultural networks in the North‐East to distribute benefits solely or principally to core supporters. Given the apparently reasonable expectation that it would continue to rule indefinitely, the DC is usually portrayed as distributing goods to the four (later five) parties of the governing coalition. More recently, however, some have contended that, despite the appearance of intense partisanship and polarization, a form of “consociationalism” in practice arose allowing the country's major opposition, the Italian Communist Party (PCI), to share the spoils (Pizzorno 1992). This view builds on earlier research documenting that local communist politicians were often very able in extracting resources from central government (Tarrow 1977) and is also consistent with the norm of universalism that is reported to have prevailed in the Italian legislature in the passage of pork‐barrel bills (Di Palma 1977; Predieri 1963).         "
"2","Distributive politics in postwar Italy were centrally controlled in a unitary political structure.2 Government expenditures and transfers almost all originate at the central level, although they may be disbursed by subnational units. Despite Italy's opaque budgetary process, it is reasonable to assume that the allocation of distributive goods is under the control of national legislators.         "
"3","Public investments were an important component of total public expenditures during the period we study, comprising as much as 21% of total public outlays in 1961 and falling below 10% only in the last two years of our study. Over the period as a whole, public works on average absorbed 15% of total public expenditures, corresponding to 2.5% of national net product.3 Hence, the discretionary expenditures that we analyze were substantively large.         "
"4","Distributive politics in postwar Italy have rarely been investigated with systematic analytic tools. Exceptions are Marzotto and Schachter (1983) and Sapienza (2004). Using a modified random sample of 534 southern Italian communes, Marzotto and Schachter study whether electoral competition between the DC and the PCI influenced the distribution of investments by the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno between 1950 and 1970.4 In an argument close to the one explored here, Marzotto and Schachter also investigate “the widely held belief that DC strongholds (cities returning over 50% of the vote to the DC) also received token funds—more as political payoffs to party notables than for their economic potential” (69n4). They contend that their data does not corroborate the “party stronghold” hypothesis and interpret this as supporting the view, which resurfaces in more recent literature, that “there is no political reason to waste scarce resources on cities where the party in power is clearly and undeniably in command” (Stokes 2005, 72). However, Marzotto and Schachter's analysis relies on bilateral correlations rather than multiple regression analysis and their data is less complete than that used here.         "
"5","Using more sophisticated statistical methods, Sapienza (2004) studies loans made by state‐owned banks in Italy. She finds that banks offer lower interest rates to firms in areas where the political party controlling the bank is strong. Her study, in contrast to that by Marzotto and Schachter (1983), finds that parties use their control over public banks to direct resources to party strongholds. Hence, existing quantitative literature is divided in its findings on how politics influences distributive goods in Italy.         "
"6","For the period under consideration, most votes in the Chamber of Deputies were secret, making it impossible to undertake direct analysis of the partisan bases of legislative decisions. Bills involving distributive benefits (“leggine”) were normally voted in committee, where they frequently received universal endorsement (Di Palma 1977; Predieri 1963), just as in the United States. Distributive policy was politically highly salient, as the DC and its allies are believed to have used their control over public resources to distribute patronage.         "
"7","Finally, students of the Italian party system have long stressed the factional nature of DC party organization (Zuckerman 1979). Ministerial positions were apparently allocated to Christian Democrats in function of their strength within the party's ruling executive body (Mershon 2001). Factions, in turn, drew strength from preference votes. This gave DC legislators incentives to cultivate personal votes. We should therefore observe DC legislators amassing unusually large numbers of preference votes, many more than those amassed by deputies affiliated with other parties (even relatively speaking). Preference votes may prove powerful weapons in resource allocation.         "
"8","In short, the established literature tells us that postwar Italy provides a rich, interesting, and theoretically appropriate environment in which to examine the determinants of distributive politics."
"9","The current literature offers competing formal models of distributive politics, generating different expectations about where politicians will direct local public goods (“pork”) as well as geographically targetable private goods (“patronage”;5 a useful summary is Drazen 2000, chap. 8). Cox and McCubbins (1986) study whether politicians direct goods to their core support groups, to opposition groups, or to swing groups, and find that risk‐averse politicians will invest relatively more in support groups and secondarily in swing groups. They will not invest at all in opposition voters.         "
"10","An alternative is due to Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) and Dixit and Londregan (1996), who contend that vote‐maximizing redistribution will target two classes of voters: those ideologically indifferent between the two parties (“swing voters”) and low‐income voters. The underlying rationale is the same in both cases. These are groups who are likely to be more responsive than others to distributive benefits, the former because they care less than other groups of voters about ideology relative to material benefits, the latter because their low income makes them cheaper to attract.         "
"11","These two sets of models lay out competing expectations about distributive politics. The Cox‐McCubbins model predicts that we should see distributive benefits going to the government's core supporters, whereas the Lindbeck‐Weibull/Dixit‐Londregan model predicts that we should see benefits going disproportionately to swing voters. Given this theoretical controversy, it is not surprising that the empirical literature has generated a confusing array of findings.6"
"12","Recent work by McGillivray (2004) reconciles these two competing models with a theory that specifies the institutional conditions under which each obtains. Two variables are used to capture the incentives facing politicians deciding the allocation of distributive goods: the type of electoral system and the strength of national political parties.7 The electoral rule generates expectations about the types of votes those seeking national public office will cultivate. In an SMD system, winning a legislative seat requires a plurality of votes in an electoral district, so votes in contested districts matter more to politicians than votes in safe districts. If parties are strong, they will therefore target marginal districts with local public goods, confirming the logic of the Lindbeck‐Weibull/Dixit‐Londregan model. In PR systems, all votes matter equally regardless of district location, because every vote contributes to the allocation of legislative seats among parties. Therefore, nationally disciplined parties staffed by risk‐averse legislators will target their strongholds in order to hold core voters and prevent the emergence of new parties, corroborating Cox‐McCubbins. All else equal, the theory generates the expectation that politicians will target resources to marginal districts under SMD and to party strongholds under PR.         "
"13","Building on earlier work on party strength by Levitt and Snyder (1995), McGillivray next complicates this formulation by varying party strength, conceptualized as the degree of personalism in electoral contests. (Operationally, party strength may be thought of as the degree of central party control over candidate selection.) In SMD settings, weak parties cannot discipline their legislators successfully. This compromises central control over targeting goods to specific electoral districts. Because party discipline is low, many coalitions can be formed in the legislature, allowing idiosyncratic rules and procedures of the legislative body to thereby affect coalition formation. In the United States, for instance—McGillivray's example of an SMD system with weak parties, and certainly the most extensively studied case in the literature—pork‐barrel projects are typically incorporated into omnibus legislation, receiving unanimous support from both sides of the aisle (Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981). Unanimity is driven by the chronic uncertainty surrounding the composition of minimum‐winning coalitions (Collie 1988). In this model of legislative policy making, government and opposition share in the distribution of public goods, and distributive politics are not ideologically or programmatically divisive politics, although in some cases they may underpin the formation of programmatic coalitions (Evans 2004). Legislators with greater seniority, greater influence in their party, and appropriate committee appointments are typically more successfully in targeting their home districts with higher levels of expenditures. Hence, McGillivray hypothesizes that in weak‐party majoritarian systems, redistributive policy is targeted to safe districts, because these districts by definition elect more senior and more powerful legislators.         "
"14","McGillivray's study does not extend to the fourth logically possible case, that of weak parties in PR settings. We observe weak parties under PR where open lists are used; that is, where candidate selection is not under central party control. We extend to that setting in the next section, where we spell out the incentives underlying the vote‐getting behavior of legislators and parties in open‐list PR. We build on these assumptions to derive testable hypotheses about where parties and legislators direct quasi‐public goods."
"15","A macrolevel literature argues that proportional representation and majoritarian electoral systems offer different incentives to parties regarding redistribution. Systems operating under PR tend to distribute benefits via large‐scale transfers whereas majoritarian systems tend to distribute goods that are geographically targetable, i.e., “pork‐barrel” projects (Lizzeri and Persico 2001; Milesi‐Ferretti, Perotti, and Rostagno 2002). By implication, not only is the overall level of geographically targetable projects relatively low in a PR context, but also pork‐barrel projects and patronage are relatively unimportant politically because the individual identities of legislators are unimportant where they are elected off party lists (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987).         "
"16","Open‐list PR, however, is similar to a majoritarian electoral system in that it pits contenders from the same party against each other in the search for individual votes. In the case of SMD, these contests occur as primaries, whereas in open‐list PR, they occur among candidates on the party list. This is because candidates are seated in function of the number of individual preference votes received. So, if party list votes are sufficient for party A to win three seats in multimember district y, the winning candidates are the three on that party's list receiving the most individual preference votes.8 In a closed‐list setting, by contrast, they are the three candidates the party leadership has placed at the top of its list.         "
"17","Open‐list PR reduces party control over candidate selection and generates factionalism and intraparty competition in the search for preference votes (Katz 1986; Pasquino 1972). Despite district magnitudes greater than 1, individual candidates must seek personal identities in their campaigns, and incumbents must “credit‐claim” for district‐specific policy outputs (Carey and Shugart 1995).9 Although studies of credit claiming focus almost exclusively on single‐member districts, it seems likely that the mechanisms are similar in multimember settings—except that the locus is the representative's bailiwick rather than the district as a whole.10"
"18","Under PR, we thus expect two possible influences on discretionary allocations, one coming from individually powerful deputies and a second from the strength of governing political parties. In multimember settings, the incentives facing individual legislators are distinct from those facing the political parties with which they are affiliated. Individual legislators seeking reelection cultivate votes in their bailiwicks (often their hometowns). Parties seeking more votes cultivate areas of core support, where it will be less expensive to attract the marginal supporter and where it is critical to fend off the formation of new parties. The former is likely to be more important in a weak party context, such as most situations of open lists; the latter where parties are powerful and able to discipline their legislators."
"19","In Figure 1, we summarize our theory of how electoral and party systems combine to produce differences in the patterns of the distribution of geographically targetable goods. The typology identifies how institutional conditions structure the incentives facing political actors whose decisions allocate goods.         "
"20","                 Predictions of Types of Electoral Districts Likely to Receive Most Resources under Alternative Institutional Arrangements                      "
"21","Our study provides systematic empirical assessment of whether infrastructure investments in postwar Italy went to areas of core governing party strength, as Cox and McCubbins would contend, or instead to the bailiwicks of powerful individual legislators, which is what we expect based on extending McGillivray's theory. The main party of government, Italian Christian Democracy, was strongest in the North‐East, whereas its most powerful individual legislators were elected from southern districts."
"22","Hence, we examine the following two propositions:"
"23","                        "
"24","Individual legislators who have greater institutional influence in the parliamentary arena will direct higher levels of expenditures or more benefits to their home districts;"
"25","Governing parties will direct higher levels of expenditures or more benefits to areas of greater electoral strength for the party(‐ies)."
"26","A way to represent this empirically is             "
"27","Several variables potentially capture the political influence (INFL) exercised by individual legislative representatives over public works expenditures. These include PREF, the deputy's national rank within his party in the number of individual votes received (where the deputy with the most preference votes receives a rank of 1), SEN, a measure of seniority (the number of previous terms in the Chamber of Deputies the deputy has held), EDUC, a measure of education (a dummy variable for whether the deputy has completed higher education), SEX, a dummy variable coding whether the deputy is male or female, PARTYOFF, a measure of influence within the party hierarchy (a dummy variable coding whether the deputy has ever held a higher office within his party), and MINUNDER, a dummy variable coding whether the deputy serves in government as a minister or undersecretary.11 We expect all of these measures of individual political influence to contribute to a deputy's ability to steer resources to his home district.         "
"28","Our measures of the strength of the governing party(‐ies) (GOV) in a given legislature and district use two indicators. GOVDEPS is the raw number of governing parties' deputies in an electoral district, and SHARE is the vote share received in the electoral district by all parties of government in the most recent legislative election. We include GOVDEPS because research shows that the size of the legislative delegation may be important in securing resources (Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder 2003). We include SHARE since we seek to estimate the importance of the extent of electoral support for the parties of government in discretionary allocations to electoral districts. Finally, in estimations designed to capture whether opposition parties receive infrastructure investments, we include a measures of district magnitude, DM, and, on occasion, the number of deputies elected to the Italian Communist Party, PCIDEPS, the country's major opposition party.         "
"29","We control for various socioeconomic characteristics of the provinces in which investments are made. For reasons that will become clear once the estimating strategy is laid out, we include only district‐specific characteristics that change over time. These are GDP, a measure of provincial wealth, and POP, the number of provincial residents. Our expectations about the effect of preexisting level of output are indeterminate. On the one hand, demand for infrastructure is arguably greater where output is higher. On the other hand, governments may reasonably decide to allocate infrastructure investments to areas where output is lower in order to encourage economic growth.12 Our expectations are that areas with more people are likely to receive more investments. Table 1 presents our independent variables and expected signs.         "
"30","As will be clear later on, our estimating technique of choice, fixed‐effects panel data estimation, effectively eliminates (or controls for) geographic characteristics that are fixed in time. This removes the need to explicitly include such variables in the regression models."
"31","During the period considered, Italy's Chamber of Deputies was elected on the basis of 32 electoral districts, with an average district magnitude of 20.13 Between 1948 and 1994, 11 legislatures were elected, most of which seated 630 deputies.14"
"32","For most of the years we study, Italy had 92 provinces.15 We gain the largest number of observations by arranging the data according to province‐year where possible because the data for our dependent variable—public infrastructure investments—are available at this level. To match data available only at larger levels of aggregation, we propagate the values of variables available in larger units (legislative periods, for instance, or electoral districts) across the smaller subunits. For instance, we propagate the characteristics of deputies, whom we observe only at the level of the electoral districts that elected them, across the provinces that form the districts. This preserves maximum information.         "
"33","Our dependent variable is public works expenditures, which are classic instances of geographically targetable and divisible goods. We work with computerized files of official data collected by Italy's national statistics office, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT), on flows of monies for capital investments by province and year.16 (Note that because this series begins in 1954, we lose information on the First Legislature, which sat from 1948 to 1953.) The data refer to capital improvements only, such as new construction in roads, airports, ports, and public buildings, and exclude ordinary maintenance expenses. We examine aggregate expenditures and also roads and airports, because the latter is especially susceptible to politicization.17"
"34","Our main independent variables involve elected members to the Chamber of Deputies. The standard source of data on the members of the Italian lower house during the first 11 legislative periods (1948–94) is known as the Verzichelli‐Cotta dataset, after the original compilation of the first nine legislatures (reported in Cotta 1979) and subsequently extended. We use a version into which we merged additional political characteristics of deputies.18 The resulting dataset contains approximately 7,000 records of seated deputies (11 legislatures x 32 electoral districts x 20 deputies per district [average district magnitude]).         "
"35","In each Italian electoral district in the period we study there are a variable number of elected members of the Chamber of Deputies, running from a minimum of one to a maximum of 54. The collective action of these deputies allocates public investments across districts, since spending bills require majority approval (either in committee or on the floor). Theoretically, we thus expect that deputies will necessarily coordinate on legislation allocating goods to districts, and we study the characteristics of deputies that make them more or less successful in securing such goods for their home districts. We necessarily aggregate the characteristics of deputies to the electoral district level, in order to examine the influence of deputies on spending where the spending is observed only geographically."
"36","Our electoral district aggregation procedures are of three types. We aggregate PREF as a weighted average of the national preference vote rankings of deputies belonging to the governing coalition, where the weights are equal to the relative importance, at the national level, of their party within the governing coalition. The intuition behind this measure is that nationally more powerful politicians within each party—where power is assessed by the relative number of preference votes received in the most recent election—will secure more resources for their districts. (In the seventh section, we present results using three alternate aggregation procedures.) We aggregate SEN as the average seniority of governing party deputies in the district, where seniority is defined as the number of prior terms in the Chamber. Finally, we use ratios to aggregate dummy variables (EDUC, SEX, PARTYOFF, MPPROF, and MINUNDER) to the level of electoral districts.19 For instance, the measure of SEX that we use is the ratio of male to female deputies in the parties of government in the district in each legislature. We use the prefix AGG to indicate that a given characteristic is aggregated to the level of electoral districts rather than describing individual deputies.         "
"37","For all variables, we confront operationalizing the concept of “governing party.” In parliamentary systems, multiple government coalitions may be formed during a single legislative session without new elections being called. In Italy, the average life of a coalition over the 10 legislative periods that we study is 10 months. We could define legislators as belonging to the governing coalition if their party were a coalition partner at any point during the life of the legislature. But some parties held portfolios for only very short periods—a few months, for instance. It seems unlikely that access to government power for only a few months would significantly improve the ability of that party's deputies to secure resources for their districts. We have therefore chosen to define governing parties as parties in government at least half of the life of the legislative period. Note that because Italy's electoral system was pure PR, vote and seat shares are almost identical."
"38"," Table 2 illustrates pairwise correlations between variables. Each reported value summarizes a set of 10 correlations, one for each legislature. Each has been computed as follows: for each of the 10 legislatures, pairwise correlations have been computed. Each value in the table reports the median of those correlations. If a value is positive, it means that more than half the correlations were positive. If the number is starred, at least nine correlations had the same sign.         "
"39"," Table 2 is instructive in several ways. We see that AGGPREF is negatively correlated with AGGMINUNDER, indicating that districts with deputies who receive more preference votes are also likely to have more ministerial positions. We interpret this to mean that elevation to government office hinges on the display of a large clientele. This is widely reported in the literature and provides one obvious incentive for deputies to make efforts to amass as many preference votes as possible. Note too that districts with more senior deputies are also those with deputies who are more educated, have held high‐party office, send more deputies into government as ministers and undersecretaries, and elect deputies who receive more preference votes compared with others in their party. Seniority thus coincides with other markers of political influence.         "
"40","The data form a panel comprising 90 of Italy's provinces (excluding the provinces that make up the electoral districts of the Val d'Aosta and Trieste) and 10 legislative periods (excluding, that is, the First Legislature, for which investment data are not available). Hence, we work with 900 observations. However, because we include a lagged dependent variable in the regressions, as we explain below, the number of observations drops to 810."
"41","Panels of data are characterized by a richness of information when compared to simple time‐series or cross‐sectional data. Such richness offers more than one potential estimation strategy, given that the parameters of interest can be identified using the variability of the data in the time‐series dimension, in the cross‐sectional dimension, or both. A fixed‐effects estimator, based on variation in the data “within” each statistical unit (in this context, provinces), is based entirely on the time‐series variation of the data. On the other hand, several estimators are available to exploit cross‐sectional variation of the data, from separate regressions on different cross‐sections to the “between” estimator. A random‐effects estimator, finally, captures variation of the data on both dimensions and is a weighted average of the “within” and “between” estimators (Baltagi 2005).         "
"42","We use a fixed‐effects estimator, which has the advantage of effectively capturing (or controlling for) all relevant variables that are idiosyncratic to the statistical units (in this context, provinces or electoral districts) that are fixed in time. We do not use estimators that exploit the cross‐sectional variation of the data, such as the “between” estimator or OLS on individual cross‐sections, because of the difficulty of correctly identifying and measuring some factors that are fixed in time. For instance, we would need a measure of the infrastructure stock at the beginning of the period since public investment decisions are plausibly influenced by the preexisting level of capital stock. However, a measure of public capital stock is unavailable. In results not displayed here, we find that the data exhibits enough variation in the temporal dimension to employ the “within” estimator that we use."
"43","A final issue regards the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable as a regressor; that is, the adoption of a dynamic model. A dynamic model implies the presence of a gradual adjustment mechanism of public investments to changes in the independent variables. As we report below, a lagged dependent variable is significant in the regressions, although the magnitude of the estimated coefficient is modest. This implies that investments are persistent over time, which accords with the fact that many projects are likely to take years to construct. The fact that our data are aggregated within legislative periods a priori dampens the effect.         "
"44","If we call xjit the jth regressor in the model, then the equation to be estimated is            "
"45","It is well known that a fixed‐effects OLS estimator of a dynamic model is biased. However, the size of the bias, being of order 1/T, diminishes quickly as T increases (Arellano 2003, 85). In the choice of estimators, we thus face the typical trade‐off between using a biased OLS estimator and using an unbiased instrumental variable whose characteristics depend on several factors, including the quality of the instruments available. In the present context, it is not clear whether our T is “big enough” to warrant the use of the OLS fixed‐effects estimator. In a later section, we show that the qualitative results that we obtain are remarkably persistent to changes in the estimation technique employed. For this reason, we first present results obtained using the simplest possible estimator—OLS with fixed effects—and later consider the main available alternatives.         "
"46","Fixed‐effects OLS estimation easily allows for testing. In particular, an F test can be used to test the joint significance of the fixed effects or of the idiosyncratic time effects. If the null hypothesis that the fixed effects are irrelevant is not rejected, then although the fixed‐effects estimator retains consistency, a simple pooled OLS estimator would be more efficient. The same applies to the time fixed effects when these are included among the regressors.20"
"47","The nature of our data makes it likely that they possess spatial dependence. Formal tests of this yielded results that would suggest this might be the case.21 The presence of spatial dependence does not affect the consistency of the fixed‐effects estimator. However, spatial correlation of the errors may yield inconsistent estimates of the standard errors of the parameters. This problem is particularly serious because positive correlations of external shocks across temporal units result in an underestimation of the standard errors, which may lead to the erroneous conclusion that the coefficients they refer to are significantly different from zero. In other words, if our data are characterized by spatial correlation, we may end up with results that appear to be statistically “significant” when in fact they are not.         "
"48","We address this problem using the method introduced by Driscoll and Kraay (1998), who provide a simple nonparametric estimator for the variance‐covariance matrix. Such a method has several advantages. First, its usefulness is documented by Monte Carlo simulations provided by the authors; second, it exhibits computational ease; and finally, since it is nonparametric, it bypasses the curse of dimensionality that is intrinsic to parametric variance‐covariance estimates. We report Driscoll‐Kraay standard errors for our estimates.22"
"49","We first present results of two fixed‐effects regressions, one with annual average infrastructure investments (in millions of lire at constant 1990 prices) over each legislative period as the dependent variable and a second with average spending on roads and airports over each legislative period as the dependent variable. Because they are more discretionary than, say, railroads or ports—ports, after all, cannot be distributed to landlocked provinces, and railway infrastructure was largely complete by the second half of the twentieth century—roads and airports are likely to be especially susceptible to politicization. The data analyzed run from Legislature II to XI (spanning election years beginning with 1953 and ending with that of 1992), with fixed effects for provinces and legislative periods included in the regressions, the latter meant to capture any shocks that affect all provinces similarly. (The coefficients for fixed effects are not reported, but most are significant.) The First Legislature is omitted due to lack of data on the dependent variable. Because of the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable among the regressors, we also lose the Second Legislature in the analysis. Our dependent variables have been transformed by natural logarithms.         "
"50","The main independent variables of theoretical interest are those measuring the aggregate political influence of deputies affiliated with the governing parties in each district—AGGPREF, AGGSEX, AGGEDUC, AGGSEN, AGGPARTYOFF, AGGPROF, and AGGMINUNDER—and the measures of the strength of the governing parties in the district, GOVDEPS and SHARE."
"51","As control variables, we include a measure of per capita value added at factor cost and at constant prices in the province lagged to the previous electoral period (we use the final year of the previous legislative period), LGDP, and a similarly lagged measure of provincial population, LPOP. (Measures of per capita income and population have been transformed by natural logarithms.) We also include among the regressors the lagged dependent variable, so that our T is reduced to nine.         "
"52","Because of how the variable was constructed, we expect the sign on the coefficient measuring the ability of government deputies to amass preference votes to be negative.23 We expect the signs on the other variables measuring the influence of governing party deputies to be positive, as presented earlier in Table 1. We expect the sign on the size of the legislative coalition of deputies from parties of government (GOVDEPS) to be positive, since more representatives should be able to extract more resources. Our theory leads us to expect, finally, that the sign on the coefficient measuring the vote share received by the governing parties (SHARE) will be negative, indicating that the parties of government are less able than their powerful incumbents to steer resources to their core electoral strongholds in a weak party system.         "
"53","Before turning to our results, two brief remarks are in order. First, as we have already emphasized, fixed‐effects estimates only use the variation of the data “within”—in the time‐series dimension—making no use of variation “between”—in the cross‐section. As a result, variation over time within each province and electoral district drives our results. Second, the standard errors reported are Driscoll‐Kraay nonparametric standard errors, which are robust to spatial errors."
"54","Results appear as Model 1 and Model 2 in Table 3, with logged total public investments and logged public investments in roads and airports as the dependent variables of the two models. Results show that positive variations in lagged income and population result in more infrastructure investments overall. Results of both models corroborate that districts receive more investments when governing party deputies are on average more senior and have held higher party office, as the signs on the coefficients for AGGSEN and AGGPARTYOFF show. When governing party deputies are more frequently male, districts appear to receive more investments but the effect is imprecisely estimated. Provinces receive greater investments when their electoral districts elect deputies who are appointed to government positions. For every additional member of government, an electoral district receives about one‐fifth of a percentage point of additional public investments, all else equal. Finally, when districts elect more deputies to the governing parties, they also receive more investments overall, although this is not true for roads and airports alone.24"
"55","Results are somewhat unexpected for two variables in the models we estimate. First, we find that deputies in the governing parties who are not professional politicians—that is, who held other jobs prior to entering parliament—are more successful on average in securing benefits for their districts. This is reflected in the negative coefficient on the variable AGGPROF. This is surprising since we expect professional politicians to have greater incentives to retain public office, and we believe spending is directed at that end. But in Italy, the large number of elected offices may explain this otherwise counterintuitive result. With approximately three million [sic] elected political positions open at local, provincial, and regional levels of government between 1984 and 2001 (Parigi and Bearman 2006), professional politicians may have been circulated to subnational levels of government by their parties. This may have given backbenchers who were professional politicians fewer incentives than nonprofessionals to retain national legislative office.         "
"56","Second, the rankings of districts in preference votes of deputies affiliated with the governing parties do not significantly affect public investments and are also incorrectly signed (we expect a negative sign on AGGPREF, since higher rankings are indicated with lower numbers). This is probably due to collinearity. The variable AGGMINUNDER (representing the number of ministerial positions in a district) enters significantly in Model 1. AGGMINUNDER is negatively and significantly correlated with AGGPREF, as we have seen in Table 2. There is clear multicollinearity between the two variables, reflecting the fact that a good way to improve one's chances of obtaining a ministerial position is by amassing preference votes. While AGGMINUNDER is not statistically significant in Model 2, results that we report in Table 6 indicate that if we purge undersecretaries from the measure of ministerial influence, spending on roads and airports is also significantly influenced by the proportion of deputies serving as ministers. For each additional minister, an electoral district receives up to seven‐tenths of a percentage point of additional infrastructure investments, all else equal.         "
"57","Finally, both models confirm that when a district gives a lower vote share to the governing parties, it receives more goods. Fewer investments are directed to districts when the DC and its allies receive more votes. In both Model 1 and Model 2, the variable SHARE is negatively signed and statistically significant. It takes an increase of around 6% of votes to the parties of government in a given district to see a decrease of around one percentage point in public investments."
"58","We now consider the role of the opposition in securing resources for infrastructure investments. Our strategy for doing so is simple. We add to our earlier model a measure of the total number of legislative seats in the district (DM). Our rationale is twofold. First, the overall size of the legislative delegation—that is, the number of deputies elected from the district, or what is called district magnitude—has been found to be a significant predictor of the resources going to electoral districts in the United States (Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder 2003). If deputies of government and opposition are working together to secure resources, reflecting a norm of universalism, we would expect that as there are more deputies, the district's legislative delegation successfully extracts more resources from Rome. Second, by including both DM and GOVDEPS in the same model, we effectively estimate the impact of the opposition on the delivery of investments to the district. The difference between the total number of seats in the district and the number of deputies affiliated with the governing parties is, of course, the number of deputies affiliated with opposition parties. By adding district magnitude to our initial model, we thus capture the legislative influence of the opposition. We report results for both total investments and for roads and airports alone in Models 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Table 4.            "
"59","Results fail to corroborate the hypothesis that a norm of universalism prevailed in the Italian legislature for infrastructure investments. The total size of the legislative delegation fails to achieve conventionally accepted levels of statistical significance and even exhibits a negative sign in some cases, meaning that more representatives actually secure fewer resources. At the same time, in the models that include GOVDEPS, the number of deputies affiliated with the governing parties is positively and, in the case of overall investments, significantly associated with investments. For instance, results in Model 3 can be interpreted as showing that for every 10 additional deputies elected to the governing parties, an electoral district receives four‐tenths of a percentage point more in monies for total investments. This suggests that the opposition was punished by governing parties in the amounts of overall investments directed at districts when opposition parties are strongest."
"60","In postwar Italy, opposition parties were of two sorts: the communist and, prior to 1963, socialist left and the small monarchist and nationalist extreme right. These are quite different types of parties, and it makes sense to examine the PCI separately. In Model 7 and Model 8, we report results similar to those just reported except that we isolate the opposition to the Communist Party (PCIDEPS). Whether analyzing total infrastructure investments or roads and airports alone, results show that when the number of deputies elected to the PCI increases, districts receive smaller amounts of investment monies. This result is highly statistically significant for total investments. For every 10 additional Communist deputies elected, a district receives close to one‐half of a percentage point less in total infrastructure investments, all else equal. The other coefficients in the model remain substantially unaltered. These results fail to support the argument that the Italian Communist Party successfully extracted resources to its areas of core strength or that a “consociational” political solution prevailed in the postwar Italian political regime."
"61","Two main issues may affect our results. First, the results that have been reported could hinge on the choice of proxy variables substituting for the theoretical variables discussed in the fourth section. Secondly, as already mentioned, the results that we have illustrated so far are obtained using an OLS fixed‐effects estimator, and it could be argued that T is not big enough to warrant such a choice. In this section we consider each issue in turn. We begin by specifically considering alternative proxies for the measure of individual preference votes (PREF) and the measure of ministerial position (MINUNDER) and then report results using a variety of alternative estimation techniques.            "
"62","The aggregation to the electoral district level of the measure PREF depends in part on a collective decision problem. The chosen variable, AGGPREF, is constructed as a weighted average of the national ranking of deputies from governing parties within a district. However, aggregating individual deputies' rankings by averaging them is just one possible strategy. It might be the case that not all deputies matter equally and that the political influence of an electoral district is better captured by the national rankings of its most prominent deputies. Moreover, AGGPREF is computed as a weighted average of the corresponding average rankings of the parties that, in a given legislature, are in power for at least half of the period. The weights obviously give paramount importance to Christian Democracy, given its sheer size and the fact that it participated in every government during the entire period studied. Nonetheless, it is possible that only the Christian Democrats really matter for the allocation of resources and that minor coalition partners were ineffective in steering investments to districts they represent."
"63","As alternative measures, we consider an aggregate index equal, for each district, to the (weighted) national rankings of the single deputy receiving the most preference votes in each electoral district. The weights represent the vote shares of each party within the governing coalition. We also consider the possibility that Christian Democracy is the only party that matters for allocating resources."
"64","The resulting measures are AGGMAXPREF (a weighted index of each district's top ranking deputy), AGGRANKPCDC (the average ranking of only DC deputies within electoral districts), and AGGMAXRANKPCDC (the national ranking of the DC deputy with the most preference votes within an electoral district). With respect to the measure of ministerial position, we also consider ministerial and undersecretarial positions separately, as AGGMIN and AGGUNDER, respectively, in place of the combined variable used in Models 1 and 2."
"65"," Table 5 shows the medians of the pairwise correlations, by district, of the various proxies, constructed using the same procedure described earlier for Table 2. Our interpretation of this table is similar to that for Table 2. Correlations of AGGPREF with its alternatives is close to 1. Ministerial and undersecretarial positions are slightly negatively correlated, meaning that when a district is allocated many ministerial posts it does not also obtain many undersecretaries.            "
"66","We report results using the alternative measures of preference votes in Models 9, 10, and 11 in Table 6 and using the decomposed ministerial measures in Models 12, 13, 14, and 15. Results using the alternative measures of preference votes are very stable, indicating that the choice of proxy does not affect the interpretation of the data. When deputies receive more preference votes, however measured, their districts are not allocated significantly more investments.            "
"67","When we break down government portfolios into ministerial positions and undersecretaries, we find that when districts elect more ministers, they are allocated more overall investments. Undersecretarial posts are less advantageous for electoral districts."
"68","We now consider the robustness of our results when we change estimation strategy and reestimate all the models using three alternative techniques. First, we use the Arellano‐Bond GMM estimator, as reported in Arellano and Bond (1991), both one step and two step. Because their two‐step estimator is known to underestimate the standard errors, we use the correction proposed by Windmeijer (2005).25 We report results of the Arellano‐Bond GMM one‐step estimator in Table 7. For reasons of space, we do not report the results of the two‐step estimator (available by request from the authors), but these were almost always essentially the same.            "
"69","As a third estimation method we employ an altogether different strategy.26 All the economic variables we use are annual, for a total of 41 observations covering 1954 through 1994. For the preceeding analysis we averaged annual data within legislative periods to obtain 10 observations to coincide with the availability of political data. Here we keep the economic variables at their original annual frequency. We annualize the political variables by propagating them within each legislative period so that, for each district, they have the same values for all the years in each legislature. This produces a much larger T, making it safer to use the fixed‐effects OLS estimator. More attention can be dedicated to the dynamic specification of the model in a context where the asymptotes are of the “big T” type (see Attanasio, Picci, and Scorcu 2000). In Table 8 we report the fixed‐effects OLS estimation of the dynamic model based on annual data. For reasons of space, we report estimates only for total spending.27"
"70","Results that are reported in both tables corroborate that all estimation techniques give qualitative results that are similar to the fixed‐effects results that we presented earlier. Using an instrumental variables estimator only marginally modifies the results obtained using a fixed‐effects OLS estimator. Our choice of the latter as our preferred alternative is also justified by the fact that a dynamic model using annual data provides by and large the same qualitative results. Finally, note that the overall estimation strategy employed allows us to explore different dimensions of possible heteroskedasticity of the errors. The Arellano‐Bond GMM estimators are robust to heteroskedasticity within each province. The Driskoll‐Kraay estimator, on the other hand, allows us to control for spatial serial correlation."
"71","We have studied the geographic distribution of resources to electoral districts in Italy over four decades. Our results document that when districts elect more powerful individuals off the lists of governing parties, they secure more infrastructure investments. The parties of government are not more successful in securing resources for districts when they receive larger vote shares. Finally, when the opposition parties are stronger, they are less successful in securing resources."
"72","The first result documents that in the open‐list electoral environment that prevailed in postwar Italy, individually powerful deputies secure resources at the expense of the governing parties themselves. By the early 1990s, voters in the DC's historically core North‐East electoral districts are precisely those who defect to newly formed parties, including the Northern League (Agnew 2002; Golden 2004b). The second result documents that, rather than sharing in the spoils, the PCI is punished in investment allocation. This finding fails to corroborate the hypothesis that a norm of universalism prevails in the postwar Italian legislature. Even if it is true, as the literature reports, that communist deputies vote with the parties of government on most bills allocating geographically targeted goods, the outcome punishes Communist electoral strongholds.         "
"73","Our findings introduce new questions that our data do not currently permit us to answer. First, how general are these results? Only studies that assemble parallel data on other countries using open‐list proportional representation can answer this. We suspect that where governing parties are factionalized and lack central control, the patterns we report here are likely to obtain elsewhere. Brazil is a country especially likely to reveal patterns similar to those identified here. Others that use open‐list PR and may be worth exploring include Panama, Sri Lanka, and many of the Eastern European transition nations. Second, why did the Italian Communist Party apparently fail to secure significant investments in its strongholds, despite the apparent norm of universalism that prevailed in voting the relevant bills? We can only speculate how much greater the penalty would have been in the communist heartland had Communist deputies voted against the governing parties on particularistic spending bills. Third, our modeling strategy allows us to assess change over time but not across space. This leaves open intriguing questions about which Italian provinces and electoral districts received higher allocations of investments."
"74","Finally, how do our results speak to the “core” versus “swing” debate that we discussed in the opening pages of our study? This debate currently animates much literature on distributive politics. Unlike previous studies, our work underscores the importance of distinguishing parties from individual legislators. In the context of SMD, these are easily assumed to be identical, but under PR, they may well not be. The debate on the type of voter targeted is often vague about precisely which type of political actor is doing the targeting. This problem deserves theoretical consideration not previously received. Substantively, our results suggest that when their control over legislative resources permit, individual legislators target their core constituents, who are typically localized in bailiwicks. That said, it is difficult to know how to operationalize the concept of “swing” when data are available only at the level of electoral districts. Thus, our interpretation awaits corroboration with appropriate individual‐level data."
