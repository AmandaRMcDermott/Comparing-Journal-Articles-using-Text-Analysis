"1","The role of the cabinet in policymaking has changed throughout the years, moving from the core to the periphery of policy decisions at different times (Fenno 1958, 1959; Warshaw 1996). By the Nixon administration, it appeared that “[p]residents entered office committed to reducing the power of the White House staff, yet once in office could not maintain that commitment” (Warshaw 1996, 37).2Moe argues that the president's accountability for the whole operation of government has created incentives for him to rely in significant part on “appointing individuals on the basis of loyalty, ideology, or programmatic support” (1995, 239; see also Nathan 1983; Waterman 1989). Rudalevige and Lewis (2005, 8–9) assert that presidents trade expanding the authority of the White House over cabinet against filling posts with political and policy allies to enhance policy responsiveness.3 Does perceived loyalty at the time of appointments produce ideological congruence in office? On the one hand, various scholars have assumed or derived the equivalence of administrator and presidential ideal points in formal models of bureaucratic policy implementation (Epstein and O’Halloran 1999; Ferejohn and Shipan 1990; Volden 2002; but see Barro and Gordon 1983; Bendor and Mierowitz 2004; Bertelli and Feldmann 2007; Nokken and Sala 2000; Spulber and Besanko 1992).4 On the other hand, scholars have categorized cabinet departments in ways that have implications for ideological congruence between president and agency. Inner cabinet agencies—State, Treasury, Defense, and Justice—provide counsel on highly important and sensitive national issues, and the secretaries of those departments consequently forge “close collaborative relationships with presidents” (Cohen 1986, 133, quoting Cronin 1980, 277). By contrast, outer cabinet agencies such as Labor and Commerce “are plagued by strong interests that pull the secretary away from the president” (Cohen 1986, 123). We test whether ideological congruence is systematically revealed on the job using the ideal point estimates we generate.         "
"2","The focus of much bureaucratic politics scholarship has been on independent commissions and agencies, leaving cabinet‐level departments largely unexamined (e.g., Hammond and Hill 1990; Nokken and Sala 2000; Snyder and Weingast 2000; but see McCarty 2004; Nixon 2004). There is nonetheless ample evidence that cabinet secretaries engage in a strategic balancing of legislative and executive mechanisms for bureaucratic control of their executive departments. Cabinet heads and agencies have multiple principals, both the president and Congress, a fact that creates profound implications for federal policymaking (e.g., Bertelli and Grose 2009; Gailmard 2009; Whitford 2005). The Senate's power over executive department heads resides both in confirmation and ex post oversight. While the House does not have appointment powers, it exerts political control over federal departments through oversight, budgetary, and appropriation powers. Incentives exist for presidents to situate department heads between their preferred policies or corresponding to those of competing principals: pivotal House members, pivotal senators, and the president (McCarty 2004; Nixon 2004).         "
"3","While the president can use cabinet appointments to form an ideological portfolio that maps to key interests and policy goals, cabinet members may use their discretion to direct agency policymaking.5 If agency heads diverge from his programmatic goals, the president has the incentive to fire them or to centralize authority in the White House to rein them in (Lewis 2008; Rudalevige 2002; Warshaw 1996), leading to policy (Spulber and Besanko 1992) and interbranch (McCarty 2004) commitment problems. Secretaries may drift from the president's program by “going native” or by responding to the organized constituent interests of their departments (Cohen 1986; Cronin 1980). In the case of the outer cabinet, the influence of constituent groups in policy implementation may be mitigated by strategically choosing a non‐ally (Bertelli and Feldmann 2007). Given the influence of resources over what might be accomplished in a policy area (see Ting 2001), should the president prefer more resources for a policy area, he may choose an agent with policy views that moderate his own policy preferences with those of Congress. If the president is not interested in expanding the policy production of a department, he may select a more extreme agent to increase policy responsiveness at the cost of additional resources (McCarty 2004).         "
"4","Cabinet appointees are subject to the confirmation of the Senate; yet “there is a general norm that the president should get the cabinet that he wants” (Cohen 1988, 10). Mackenzie (1981, 177–78) notes that this norm may yield when senators view the nominee as problematic for reasons of policy difference, conflicts of interest, as well as specific personal characteristics. Krutz, Fleisher, and Bond argue that the Senate's veto threat can become more credible when members present a negative image of nominees and use institutions such as the “hold” rule and persuasion to “expand the conflict to persuade senators to see controversy” (1998, 872). Volden anticipates that “the agency's position is…likely to be somewhere between” (2002, 113) those of the president and the Senate. What accounts for the ideological portfolio of the cabinet? We test the claim that presidents seek to assemble a team of ideological loyalists by examining several aspects of the distribution of ideal points in recent administrations.         "
"5","We also assess multiple factors that underlie the revealed ideology of cabinet secretaries. In choosing how to vote on proposed legislation, House members and senators consider the interests of the voters in their districts and states, partisan pressures, and their own ideologies (cf. Levitt 1996; Poole and Rosenthal 1997). Presidents take positions on roll‐call proposals to reinforce and clarify for Congress their policy preferences and to sway undecided members of Congress on vote choices; these revealed preferences are likewise influenced by voter ideology in the coalition of states required to garner an electoral college victory, party pressure, and personal ideology (Shull 1997). We test the claim that the ideology of the appointing president and of key congressional actors has a direct influence on cabinet secretaries’ revealed ideological preferences. Consistent with claims regarding the promotion of policy responsiveness, our hypothesis is that more liberal institutional actors will yield more liberal secretaries and vice versa.         "
"6","Cabinet secretaries and the president together form the ideological portfolio of the executive branch. In parliamentary systems, the selection of cabinet officials is a function of credible commitment to a specific policy program, i.e., “a proposal that promises to enact the preferred policy position of the person (party) nominated for each relevant [policy area] is credible in the sense that it depends only on giving ministers the power to do what they expressly want to do” (Laver and Shepsle 1990, 874).6 Given the role of the U.S. cabinet in implementing the president's policy program, appointing a liberal Secretary of Education does not in the same way commit the president to liberal education policies.7 Appointment incentives and multiple principals for agencies create a scenario in which cross‐policy trade‐offs may be made to improve the likelihood of implementing the president's program. The result, we demonstrate, is a nuanced ideological portfolio, not a cadre of presidential clones. In the following section, we present a statistical picture of this portfolio—something never before quantitatively estimated.         "
"7","Measuring interbranch ideology presents a host of difficulties (see generally Bailey 2007, 434–38; Treier 2009). Only three published studies have attempted to statistically estimate the ideology of executive branch actors other than presidents (Bertelli and Grose 2009; Clinton and Lewis 2008; Nixon 2004).8Nixon (2004) examines time‐invariant “common space” scores for executive branch appointees who have served in Congress.9 While novel, this approach is limited to only those few executive branch officials who have also served in Congress, and more importantly, incorporates no information revealed by the administrative actors while holding the office for which the estimates are associated. Clinton and Lewis (2008, 3) use 26 responses to an elite survey of experts—the sampling frame included 30 scholars of bureaucratic politics, three journalists, two think‐tank bureaucracy specialists, and two members of nonpartisan government agencies—as well as a set of objective characteristics at the time of an agency's creation in a multirater item‐response model to provide estimates of agency ideology. The Clinton and Lewis (2008) estimates are not on a common metric with any presidential or congressional ideology measures.10"
"8","The cross‐institutional comparability of the ideal points we estimate is facilitated by assuming that cabinet secretaries take the positions we record on the basis of a relative comparison of the same outcomes corresponding to “yea” and “nay” votes on the congressional roll call. While this assumption is a strong one, it is similar to that employed when estimating presidential ideal points (e.g., McCarty and Poole 1995; Treier 2010). Yet our assumption is more reasonable than, for example, that in Nixon (2004) where members serving in Congress and the bureaucracy have identical ideal points in both institutions—his measure is simply the Poole (1998)“common space” score from an administrator's tenure in Congress. This, naturally, limits his sample to those agency officials who have also served in Congress. We are interested in placing House and Senate actors on the same ideological dimension. To do this, we utilize legislators who have served in both chambers during the time period examined to “bridge” the House and Senate (Poole 1998).         "
"9","There have been no readily available data capturing the revealed preferences of administrators. We address this problem by conducting a content analysis of congressional testimony by the secretaries of all 15 cabinet‐level departments before either chamber of the 102nd through 108th congresses. These documents were collected from the NEXIS Congressional Universe testimony database, which limited our sample to 1991–2004 as testimony transcripts were not consistently available in the database prior to 1990 when coding for this project began. In total, we coded tens of thousands of pages of testimony. For instance, 3,216 pages of testimony transcripts totaling 1,472,654 words were coded for Defense secretaries alone. Each testimonial record was searched for any mention of legislation. Each mention was cross‐referenced to House and Senate roll calls in the Congress in which the testimony was delivered. We relied upon both preconfirmation and postconfirmation testimonies, though nearly all testimonies were from the postconfirmation period.11 The coding of roll‐call positions was based on both the extemporaneous question‐and‐answer sessions as well as the prepared testimonies.12 A fuller discussion of the coding procedure is included in the supplementary information that accompanies this article.         "
"10","References by cabinet officials to legislation debated in a congress in which the secretary was not testifying were excluded to ensure temporal matching of issues across institutional actors; this is consistent with existing techniques for measuring presidential positions (McCarty and Poole 1995; Treier 2010). The political costs of supporting bills that have passed or failed in prior congresses tend toward zero—amounting to “cheap talk”—and do not facilitate the types of comparisons we wish to make. Notably, cabinet secretaries sometimes take positions that contradict those made publicly by the president and also include issues well beyond the specific jurisdiction of the relevant department. For example, we recorded positions by Secretary of the Treasury Rubin on welfare reform legislation, Secretary of Labor Reich on the 1994 crime bill, and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Mel Martinez on the “No Child Left Behind” Act. Moreover, the proposals on which the secretaries did take positions have cutpoints—identifying the spatial split between supporters and opponents of a proposal—quite similar to those in the normal course of legislative business. Figure 1 compares kernel density functions for cutpoints on all roll calls, those on which both the president and a cabinet member recorded “votes,” and those on which secretaries revealed their stance. These distributions are very similar, particularly given uncertainty in estimating the cutpoints. This buttresses our confidence that secretaries are not voicing opinions on lopsided votes that might undermine the validity of their ideal point estimates when compared with members of Congress who vote on a wide range of issues.13"
"11","                Comparison of Cutpoint Densities, 102nd–107th Congresses"
"12","We excluded several cabinet members from the analysis given the small number of positions they recorded in our dataset.14 In all, we generated ideal point estimates for 46 cabinet members and a total of 3,855 estimates for all actors (presidents, senators, House members, and cabinet secretaries) between the 102nd and 108th congresses. Following Clinton et al. (2004), we estimate the ideal points in a Bayesian framework along a unidimensional space.15 Additional discussion of the data and estimation is included in the supplementary information. We now turn to the results of the measurement model and the assessment of those claims set forth in the prior section.         "
"13","Do cabinet secretaries display ideological congruence with the president once in office?Figure 2 presents executive branch and key congressional ideal points in the first congresses of the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.16 Negative values indicate more liberal ideologies, while positive values are more conservative. Both portfolios are diverse and reveal four secretaries—Ron Brown (Commerce), Mike Espy (Agriculture), Federico Peña (Transportation), and Warren Christopher (State)—statistically congruent with Clinton's ideal point of −0.47. The Bush cabinet displayed more ideological harmony with the president (located at 0.73), namely among secretaries Anthony Principi (Veterans Affairs), Donald Rumsfeld (Defense), Donald Evans (Commerce), Ann Veneman (Agriculture), and Rod Paige (Education). Fully 85% of Clinton cabinet members were statistically different from the president's ideal point estimate compared with 69% in the George W. Bush administration.         "
"14","                Ideological Portfolios of the G.W. Bush and Clinton Administrations and Pivotal Members of Congress, 103rd and 107th Congresses"
"15","The bulk of both cabinets fell between the president and key congressional actors in ideological terms. It is striking that the nearest congressional actor to President George W. Bush, the House median James Ramstad (R‐MN), denoted HM in Figure 2, is located in the center of the largest cluster of cabinet members, while the Senate filibuster pivot, Slade Gorton (R‐WA), SFP in Figure 2, has that characteristic in the first congress of the Clinton administration. Seventy‐one percent of secretaries confirmed under unified government—which characterized the 103rd and 107th congresses—were statistically distinct from their appointing presidents. By contrast, all nominees confirmed during periods of divided partisan government were statistically divergent. Figure 3 shows kernel density estimates of the distribution of cabinet member ideal points between 1993 and 2004 with the estimates themselves and those of other key actors arrayed below. The names of presidents appear at the location of their ideal point estimates, while the average location of the Senate filibuster pivot and House median during their administrations are represented by solid squares and triangles, respectively. As in Figure 2, the spatial location of executive branch actors suggests compromise between the president and Congress. The distribution of cabinet ideal points is much tighter under divided government, with evidence of more room for ideological diversity under unified partisanship, as would be expected. Taken together, these results suggest substantial evidence that cabinet secretaries are statistically distinctive in comparison with their appointing presidents. Claims in the literature that deference is given to the president to get the “team” he wants are more consistent with strategic appointments (e.g., Bertelli and Feldmann 2007) than ideological congruence.         "
"16","                Ideological Distributions of Cabinets Confirmed Under Divided and Unified Government, 1993–2004"
"17","It may be the case that ideological proximity to the president differs across types of administrative positions. We use Cohen's (1986) distinction between inner, outer, and older outer cabinet to categorize posts. The latter category relates to the suggestion that outer cabinet departments created before 1945 are seen to have greater prestige and more stable interest environments (Cohen 1986). Figure 4 shows kernel density estimates of the distributions of each agency category with presidential ideal points located by name. The older outer cabinet displays the most ideological diversity. In contrast to expectations, inner and outer cabinet agencies otherwise show little difference in ideological diversity. Inner cabinet secretaries appear no more ideologically proximate to their presidents than are outer cabinet agencies. Figure 5 displays all cabinet secretaries, presidents, as well as chamber medians in Congress for the period of our study. Horizontal lines represent the highest posterior density regions for each ideal point estimate as a graphical depiction of estimation uncertainty. The figure allows readers to make ideological comparisons across a wide range of actors. In general, this graphical examination suggests that the Cohen (1986) distinctions in cabinet positions do not have substantial impact on divergence from the president.         "

"19","                Cabinet, President, and Congressional Median Ideal Points, 1991–2004"
"20","Our estimates permit a fuller understanding of the impact of political institutions on the revealed preferences of cabinet members. To this end, we turn to a multivariate examination of the determinants of cabinet secretaries’ ideologies. To examine the claim that presidential and congressional ideologies contribute to secretaries’ revealed preferences, we regress the Cabinet secretary ideal point estimate on the ideal point estimates of the president and congressional chamber medians. Results are presented in Table 1. Model 1 is estimated via OLS with robust standard errors clustered on the cabinet secretary, the repeat observation. For robustness, two additional specifications are estimated. The unit of analysis in Model 2 is the secretary, eliminating the temporal changes in the congressional actors by including the Senate median in the first year of the cabinet member's service due to the power of that institution over appointments, and the House median. Model 3 is similar but employs the Senate median for the last year of service by the cabinet official.17 Models 2 and 3 are estimated with robust standard errors clustered on the cabinet department to correct for unobserved department‐level heterogeneity.         "
"21","The results present a different portrait of ideological relationships in the executive branch than conventional scholarly wisdom suggests. Strikingly, the president's ideal point exhibits the smallest weight in determining secretary ideology. In Model 1, the House median ideal point has the largest weight, more than three times that of the president, while the combined weights of Senate and House influence are over five times that of the president alone. These relative weights are robust to the specification in Model 2. However, the lack of statistical significance of the Senate median in Model 3 (in contrast to Model 2) may suggest the relative importance of the Senate at the time of appointments.18"
"22","The analyses presented in this section uncover elements of the structure of ideological diversity in the executive branch. We have claimed that our estimates will be useful for testing a number of theoretical predictions arising from separation‐of‐powers theoretical models. Following a discussion of their limitations to allow readers to be better consumers of the measures, we present an empirical application that uses our estimates to test one important implication of a formal model of executive‐legislative interactions."
"23","As noted above, our estimates have a variety of advantages over prior attempts to capture statistically the ideology of executive branch actors. They vary over time and are based on contemporaneous positions taken by cabinet officials and presidents on roll calls to produce comparable measures for congressional and executive branch actors. Before we turn to an application of our measures in testing a claim in the separation‐of‐powers literature, it is important to note some limitations of the measures of cabinet ideology we have introduced."
"24","Our estimates, like many ideal point estimates—such as the Poole and Rosenthal (1997) NOMINATE scores that are based on congressional voting behavior, but unlike the Segal and Cover (1989) judicial ideology measures based on prequalifications—are induced preferences (see Kreps and Porteus 1978) rather than a base form of ideological predisposition. Because the information we have collected—testimony before Congress—is revealed after an appointee is confirmed, it is possible that a person who would have opposed, say, funding for the Department of Labor will support it as Secretary of Labor. Similarly, a secretary appointed by a Democratic president and confirmed by a Republican Congress may appear moderate in our measures, though that appointee may be, in fact, personally very liberal. It would be less advisable to employ our estimates, for instance, in a study of the role of appointee ideology in predicting confirmation times. In contrast, our estimates would be well suited to examining such impacts on secretary tenure in office. The difference in our estimates is not identifiably associated with any primitive preference change but, rather, to the impact of the environment that a secretary inhabits once in office. In the supplementary materials, we provide some textual analysis, comparisons with Poole (1998)“common space” scores for secretaries who served in Congress, and the results of an elite survey of academicians with substantive knowledge of agency policy domains. These checks provide some face validity that our estimates capture at least some aspects of the secretaries’ personal views. Nonetheless, that evidence is suggestive, and scholars using the measures should temper their interpretations accordingly.         "
"25","It is also important to note that estimates for presidents and secretaries do not vary during their service in our measure, but scores for legislators vary for each Congress. Because the executive actors do not take positions on each roll call, we chose to base their positions on as much information as possible. The result is greater precision at the cost of capturing localized temporal fluctuations in executive ideology. Scholars using our scores should understand that they represent the ideological portfolios of administrations rather than changing contours within administrations. A related consideration—particularly evident for some cabinet secretaries—is that our estimates are just that, estimates. As Figure 5 clearly shows, they are accompanied by measures of uncertainty. Scholars should consider the role of uncertainty when using our scores in their own applications, particularly when the applications involve a subset of positions where uncertainty may be significant. More detail about the validity of our measures is included in the supplementary materials.         "
"26","Federal budgetary politics is rooted in the separation‐of‐powers and represents an important substantive context in which our estimates may provide leverage for researchers. We examine an interesting formal proposition regarding trade‐offs between ideology and budgetary resources. McCarty (2004, 416) models the interbranch competition in political control of agency policymaking as a bargaining game between a legislature and president. In the case of executive (cabinet‐level) agencies, the process begins with a legislative proposal of a specified amount of budgetary authority for the agency, which the president may accept or reject. The president also appoints an agency head, whom the legislature may confirm or reject. The agency then selects a policy. He specifies appointments to executive agencies as a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offer to capture a scenario in which “the president cannot commit not to use his removal power to change the agency's ideal point” (415, emphasis original).19 As noted in the preceding section, the fact that behavior in office is important to the problem makes it appropriate to use our measures.         "
"27","In budgetary negotiations for executive agencies, McCarty (2004, 417–18) shows that the legislature's optimal budgetary authority for the agency is a decreasing function of the distance between the ideal points of the appointed agency head and legislature (relative to the location of the president's ideal point). Operationalizing this result, we test the claim that the presence of a cabinet secretary with an ideal point away from the president's ideal point and closer to the legislature's ideal point results in a larger discretionary budget for the agency. McCarty makes the critical assumption that commitment is more difficult “if the agency head serves at the president's will” (2004, 415). Thus, cabinet‐level agencies provide a strong test of the theoretical predictions, since finding evidence of anticipatory budgeting on the part of the legislature to hedge against executive opportunism ex post in executive agencies would suggest that the removal power is weaker than generally expected. We provide statistical evidence below that these ideology‐budget trade‐offs are made.         "
"28","We estimate fixed‐effects regression models for panel data to examine allocations of discretionary budget authority to cabinet departments. The data for the dependent variable are drawn from the Public Budget Database compiled by the Office of Management and Budget. Our dependent variable is the natural logarithm of Discretionary budget authority in fiscal year t between 1991 and 2004, and the key independent variables are based on the preference estimates presented earlier.20 The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary budget authority as funds not otherwise made mandatory in extant law; these funds are appropriated annually in amounts determined by Congress. Independent variables are constructed for the fiscal year.         "
"29","Our claim is that a president desiring higher budgets for an agency will choose to appoint a department head closer to congressional policy preferences, and away from his own. Should larger budgets for a specific agency be unnecessary to the president's programmatic goals, the president need not make this ideological compromise. We examine this trade‐off in four models. Models 1 and 2 include relative distance measures between the secretary and president and the secretary and Senate median, (XA – XP)2– (XA – XS)2, while Models 3 and 4 employ relative distance measures between the secretary and president and the secretary and House median, (XA – XP)2– (XA – XH)2. Evidence for the hypothesis we examine is observed if as values of these two distance variables increase agency discretionary budgets likewise increase. Model 1 and Model 3 are panel regression models with fixed effects. Models 2 and 4 also include fixed effects but employ the first difference in discretionary budget authority as the dependent variable to detrend in the event that unit roots are present.21 We include the Relative distance between agency‐Senate and agency‐president variable and the Relative distance between agency‐House and agency‐president variable in separate models for both theoretical and empirical reasons. McCarty (2004) models a unicameral legislature and suggests that the advise‐and‐consent power of the Senate is important to the theoretical predictions. Thus, examining the Senate is warranted. However, the House holds the preeminent constitutional role in appropriations (cf. Fenno 1966; Wildavsky 1984). Empirically, the correlation between these two independent variables is very high, making separate models proper. Positive values of the first variable indicate that the Senate is closer to the agency than the president, while positive values of the second variable indicate that the House is closer to the agency than the president. Both models also include independent variables for presidential administrations, with that of George H. W. Bush being the omitted category.         "
"30","Results are shown in Table 2. All models support our expectations for departmental budgetary authority in executive agencies, namely, that presidents engage in a trade‐off between appointing ideologically congruent agency heads and enhancing agency budgets.22 Models 1 and 2 show that discretionary budget authority is greater when the secretary is closer to the Senate median than to the president. Models 3 and 4 reveal a similar relationship for the House median; as the secretary's ideal point is situated closer to the House and more distant from the president, discretionary budgetary authority increases. 23 The magnitude of this relationship is larger in the first‐differenced House model than in the first‐differenced Senate model, consistent with the primacy of House appropriations power (though it should also be noted that coefficient sizes of the House and Senate coefficients are not substantively that different). Nonetheless, our analyses suggest that congressional influence over the executive branch is shared between House and Senate.         "
"31","We have provided the first statistical portrait of the ideological portfolios of the executive branch of the U.S. government and its relationship to both chambers of the U.S. Congress. It represents a different picture of executive branch authority than the ideological allegiance view embraced in a wide variety of theoretical and empirical discussions of the separation of powers. Contrary to the assumptions of a number of theories and much conventional scholarly wisdom, ideological positions of cabinet members are often not the same as their appointing presidents' even though presidents retain the power of removal over executive branch appointees. Elements of the theoretical literature that have either assumed or derived agency preferences as equivalent to those of the president (e.g., Epstein and O’Halloran 1999; Ferejohn and Shipan 1990) or equivalent in executive agencies (Volden 2002) should be revisited in light of our findings.         "
"32","A developing theoretical literature suggests that agency preferences may be distinct from presidential preferences for various reasons (e.g., Bertelli and Feldmann 2007; McCarty 2004; Warren 2011). Our evidence suggests that the theoretical assumptions and predictions in this latter work may be more empirically realistic, and efforts in this direction should be continued. Our applications also demonstrate the influence of the congressional role in confirmation and budgeting, and the trade‐offs made in presidential‐legislative bargaining over the political control of policymaking. Taken together, our findings bring new perspective to the study of executive‐legislative relations and its importance to theoretical and empirical scholarship in U.S. politics. Our results may imply that presidents may care more about other criteria—such as agent competence, policy expertise, or political experience—when choosing department heads than ideological congruence. Further work should be conducted to assess why presidential ideology is a weak predictor of agent ideology and to determine if presidents are willing to trade off competence for ideological fealty.         "
"33","Our estimates constitute the first space‐and‐time comparable estimates for congressional and multiple executive actors, making their utility to other scholars quite substantial. Among their potential applications for executive branch and public policy scholars are examinations of the impact of ideology on confirmation times, the duration of cabinet service, rule‐making outcomes, and policy implementation. Potential applications also abound for legislative scholars. Questions regarding the extent of discretion granted to specific agencies by Congress—and to which agencies it is granted—can be tested using our ideal point estimates. Empirical studies of legislative oversight of the bureaucracy by congressional committees can be conducted to determine whether more hearings are held when agencies are out of step with their congressional principals. For those policy areas where there is substantial discretion granted to federal departments for policy implementation, cabinet ideal points might even be considered suitable measures of the status quo policy positions in spatial models analyzing congressional decision making, given that the implementation of many extant policies is charged to executive agencies. One could also test preference, party, and pivotal politics models of interinstitutional decision making."
"34","Our article answers the call for scholars to study American political institutions by incorporating both branches of Congress, the president, and the bureaucracy into a unified analysis of policymaking. Bond and Fleisher (1990) and Krehbiel (1998) have argued for the importance of including all pivotal legislative and executive actors in the policymaking process. We believe that important actors in the bureaucracy, presidency, Senate, and House must be considered when formulating theories and conducting empirical tests. The ideal point estimates we have produced help to make this possible.         "
