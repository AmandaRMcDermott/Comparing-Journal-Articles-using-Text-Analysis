"1","Before providing an overview of our main findings and more detailed analysis, we pause in order to justify the key assumptions that underpin our model. The first and central aspect of our model is that manifesto outcomes reflect weighted intraparty bargaining between factions. The second is that intraparty deliberations are used to alleviate the uncertainty faced by a party when drafting its policy proposals."
"2","We view a faction as a resource that allows its leader influence over policy. Our view thus accords with that of Laswell (1931), whose definition in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences states: “The term faction is commonly used to designate any constituent group of a larger unit which works for the advancement of particular persons or policies.”            "
"3","We study the influence of ideological party factions on its manifesto and so set aside the view that factions form to pursue particular material interests (as noted already, the endogenous formation of such “factions of interest” has already been studied). We view the manifesto as an outcome of bargaining between party faction leaders. More specifically, in our model, the weight given to a faction leader's views is increasing in the size of his faction. Correspondingly, when joining a faction, a politician increases the influence of its leader on final policy. We discuss the general claim and the specific assumption in turn, and with reference to the empirical literature on political parties."
"4","The existence of ideological factions has been noted in several empirical studies. Rose (1964) identified the organizing principle of a faction's ideology—shared values around which faction members ultimately cohere and coordinate activity. Analyzing over 100 parties on several dimensions, Janda (1980) found that the most common basis of factionalism was ideological and that factions typically also had distinct leaders. Moreover, recent text analysis using state‐of‐the‐art estimation and measurement techniques on party documents and speeches provides strong evidence of ideological intraparty groupings (see, among others, Bernauer and Brauninger 2008; Konig 2006; Laver and Giannetti 2004).3"
"5","Our claim that the manifesto reflects the outcomes of bargaining between factions is of course a generalization. As stated by Lo, Proksch, and Slapin (2014, 4): “There are few common procedures that govern how parties arrive at the final draft. At one extreme, a small committee composed of the party leadership may write the manifesto. At the other extreme, a party conference may discuss various proposals and vote on an issue‐by‐issue basis on amendments.” Put otherwise, there are a large number of extensive form games that could be analyzed to represent the specific protocols adopted by different parties. While our reduced‐form approach can be justified due to the feasibility constraint imposed by analyzing such a broad class of games, a stronger defense is built on empirical grounds: Our approach is consistent with broad findings in the empirical literature showing that a party manifesto (or changes to it over time) reflects the weights of different party factions.            "
"6","The earliest claims that party manifestos could be related to the bargaining power of factions can be traced back to Harmel et al. (1995). They understood manifesto (as well as other party) change as due to alternation in a party's “dominant faction.”4 For example, they argue that the replacement of the “left” with the “new socialist right” as the party's dominant faction led to the adoption of the Bad Godesberg program by the German Social Democratic Party in 1958. Budge, Ezrow, and McDonald (2011) analyze the time series data of party positions measured by manifesto documents and find that “factional struggles power the policy alternation pattern observed on the left‐right continuum.” Similarly, Lo, Proksch, and Slapin (2014) view a manifesto as a resolution mechanism for two factions (or, equivalently, two groups of voters), differentiated according to their ideology and competing for control.            "
"7","Our more specific claim, that outcomes correspond to weighted bargaining, can also be justified. As noted by Levy (2004, 2), even               "
"8","the mechanisms by which Western European parties reach internal compromise in their manifestos mimic some form of a weighted average of the ideal policies of their factions; the parties delegates vote on the policy principals in an annual conference whereas the balance of power between factions, that is, the proportion of votes that each faction receives, is translated into policy recommendations. These policy recommendations are then incorporated into the party's election manifesto.5"
"9","Indeed, the statistical evidence of Lo, Proksch, and Slapin (2014) is consistent with the conjecture that, on average, the manifesto content is a weighting of the ideological differences between different factions.            "
"10","A recent and specific case study is by Ceron (2012, 689), who provides strong evidence in support of the assumption that “factions negotiate over party positions according to the bargaining power of each subgroup.” He uses data from party congresses in Italy to measure faction preferences and size and relates this to policy positions of Italian parties. His empirical finding is that “party position will be closely related to the weighted mean of the factions' positions. Factions then affect the party proportionally to their strength.” These findings are perhaps surprising since on many dimensions (e.g., candidate selection), Italian parties are quite centralized (see Galasso and Nannicini 2011). Importantly for our purposes, Ceron (2012) finds that allowing for the identity of the median (politician or faction) in the party does not improve the fit of his statistical model when accounting for the bargaining weights of the party factions. This finding corresponds with our predictions (Proposition 4) below.            "
"11","Of course, there are mitigating factors. For example, Ceron (2012) shows that, in Italy, the relationship between the proportional strength of factions and policy position is stronger when leaders are elected by party committee. This suggests that our assumptions are weaker when leaders have a degree of autonomy from the parliamentary party. Such autonomy might arise when a leader's power stems from her direct relationship with voters or extra‐parliamentary groups. Nevertheless, even in such less likely cases the qualitative evidence suggests that, at times, our weighted bargaining assumption may hold. Beer (1965), for example, studies the British Labour Party in the 1950s and 1960s. It was part of a two‐party system whereby its manifesto provided a direct mandate for governance. Under its constitution, the party's National Executive Committee in charge of writing the manifesto was to implement the wishes of the party conference. Beer shows (chap. 8) that the party manifesto was controlled by neither a centralized leadership nor a majority in party conference. Instead, he argues that the party was divided “vertically between two sets of followers and leaders” (231). Each faction “had an ideology and each sought to commit Labour to its ideological position.” While the revisionists behind Hugh Gaitskell had the “balance of advantage in program‐making,” they were unable to always impose their views on the fundamentalist faction led by Ernest Bevan. The latter could count on a “solid core of about a quarter” of the parliamentary party, which included Bevan's “able lieutenants,” or key members of the National Executive Council who directly influenced the manifesto.6"
"12","We allow our politicians a rich set of motivations: They have (idiosyncratic) ideological concerns but also share a common desire that the party develops an informed program of governance. As we will describe in more detail in the following section, this statement (and so our model) is consistent with different interpretations. A leading interpretation is that politicians desire a program that is informed as to the wishes of the party's target voters. A different interpretation draws upon Burke's (1851) view of programmatic political parties cited earlier. According to this view, the party program reflects politicians' views about the national interest. Whichever interpretation of politicians' motives we adopt, there is inherent uncertainty as to which policies should be pursued toward such aims. Thus, insofar as a politician (or perhaps the party leader) wishes to appeal to voters (or to the national interest), she alone does not know which policies best serve that purpose.            "
"13","This uncertainty faced by parties in the manifesto‐writing process has been the subject of several recent empirical articles. These relate the time series data of party manifesto observations (analyzed on the left‐right dimension) to inductive and myopic decision rules that a vote‐maximizing party may adopt from one election to another: Somer‐Topcu (2009) explores policy adjustments as a response to electoral losses in the previous election, and Adams and Somer‐Topcu (2009) consider policy change in a current election as related to moves made by other parties in previous ones.7"
"14","While commonly observed and relatively easy to measure factors, such as previous policies and election results, are easily incorporated in our model (a common prior will suffice), our focus instead is on intraparty deliberations that form part of the manifesto‐writing process. That intraparty deliberations take place is self‐evident: At any party gathering, politicians will exchange views. Indeed, deliberation is a main mechanism deployed by parties to reduce uncertainty and is widely used by different parties. Consider, for example, the two main British political parties that, as we write, are finalizing their manifestos for the upcoming 2015 election. Central to the manifesto preparations of the Labour Party is its policy review, led by key members of the party's shadow cabinet who each hold a different policy brief. It is, as described in the documentation of the party, “a comprehensive process of discussion looking at every aspect of Labour policy in order to support the development of our manifesto for 2015.” Deliberations are also central to the Conservative manifesto‐writing process via the policy forum that produces discussion briefs on manifesto issues (e.g., most recently, housing and planning) that are then submitted to the party's central office."
"15","The existence of such deliberations does not, of course, ensure their relevance to the manifesto‐writing process. Such deliberative processes might be adopted for other purposes. For example, they can provide coordination around a leader's views.8 However, as noted by Landa and Meirowitz (2009), “In order for communication to do more than just allow participants to coordinate on a particular choice (that is, if deliberation is about convincing and/or being convinced by one's interlocutors), one or more participants must be uncertain about some aspect of policy choice.” Consequently, we start from the premise that although no politician is perfectly informed about the wishes of the party's target voters or the best policies to pursue from a national interest perspective, each has some private information that is relevant to choices a party makes. Such information may be obtained from constituency surgeries, interactions with research staff, or other sources. It can be exchanged in informal discussions or in formal consultation and intraparty deliberations such as those mentioned above. Additionally, it can affect the views of those (faction leaders) who determine the party policy.            "
"16","As is customary in the formal‐theoretic literature, we identify debate with verbal (cheap talk) communication between privately informed participants seeking to arrive at a collective choice.9 Specifically, we assume that each politician observes a private but imperfect signal. Using the multiplayer communication model by Galeotti, Ghiglino, and Squintani (2013), we study the strategic communication of such information to party decision makers, who in our model are faction leaders. This setup proves useful when analyzing manifestos as a collection of policy decisions to be made, where politicians have private information that is relevant to each of these decisions, and where players' preferences are affected by communication between them. Indeed, as the model can be used to describe any directed network of communication, it covers the types of discussions that politicians might have in the deliberative forums mentioned above. Our analysis of intraparty deliberation provides a framework for exploring the normative consequences of factionalism. As stated by Landa and Meirowitz (2009): “Unless we understand the conditions under which the incentives in deliberative environments encourage agents to be sincere or fully revealing, as opposed to insincere or withholding information, we cannot hope to offer a coherent (stable) normative argument for institutional design.”            "
"17","We contribute to a literature on endogenous parties stimulated by Krehbiel (1993), who raised the possibility that effects attributed to party organization may be due to similarity of preferences, which influenced a large body of work: Patty (2008) formalizes the notion of a “cartel party” and shows the effect of the size of the majority on its ability to discipline its members; Eguia (2011a, 2011b) looks at the role of parties in enabling blocs of politicians to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes that could not be obtained were each legislator to act in isolation. Morelli (2004) analyzes the effect of the electoral system on party formation, whereas Snyder and Ting (2002) explore the effect of party labels. Levy (2004) explores party formation using the citizen‐candidate model and shows that parties are “effective”—they influence outcomes independently—only when the policy space is multidimensional. In our article, a party is given by the set of players (politicians), and its internal factions form endogenously. These partitions are effective, in a sense similar to Levy, when parties are sufficiently heterogeneous.         "
"18","We share a focus on the intraparty determinants of the party platform with Caillaud and Tirole (1999, 2002), who also analyze the allocation of control rights on the quality of the party platform. In their model, the platform has an ideological and a valence component (e.g., a left policy can be of high or low quality). Ideological dissonance between the party leadership and its rank and file provides incentives for the former to invest in the quality of the platform design. The authors contrast platform design in an authoritarian party (where control is exercised by the leadership) and a democratic one run by the rank and file. Castanheira, Crutzen, and Sahuguet (2010) analyze platform design in a similar setup with two‐party competition that allows them to explore rent‐seeking behavior given the equilibrium degree of intraparty competition.         "
"19","In our model, quality depends upon the pooling of policy‐relevant information via intraparty deliberation rather than on investments made by party leaders. Our theoretical investigation into strategic aspects of intraparty deliberation follows Galeotti, Ghiglino, and Squintani (2013), whose framework for the study of multiplayer communication provides tractability and substantive new political insights, as witnessed by a host of recent papers: Patty and Penn (2014) study information transmission in small networks of decision makers; Patty (2013) determines the optimal exclusion and inclusion policies to maximize information sharing among cabinet members; Gailmard and Patty (2009) study transparency and optimal delegation by a principal to informed agents; Dewan et al. (2015) investigate the optimal assignment of decision‐making power in the executive of a parliamentary democracy; and Penn (2015) studies the formation of stable aggregations of different units within an association.         "
"20","While these papers build on the same methodology, each studies distinct political problems. At the purely theoretical level, the closest papers to ours are the latter two. Nevertheless, there are significant differences making our analysis both novel and challenging. Specifically, unlike Penn (2015), who holds the allocation of authority as exogenous, here the allocation is endogenously transferred to the leaders of factions that form in equilibrium. And unlike Dewan et al. (2015), who study the optimal allocation of authority within a group of politicians, we solve the significantly more complex problem of determining the equilibrium outcome of voluntary transfer of authority.         "
"21","We believe our model is the first that explores the endogenous formation of ideological factions of “principle.” However, a recent article by Persico, Rodriguez‐Pueblita, and Silverman (2011, 255) looks at the formation of factions of “interest.” In their model, factional allegiance allows politicians to advance their careers and deliver pork to their constituents. A faction is a “team of politicians who are mutually dependent on each other for career advancement.” Despite this critical difference, the two models have a common component in that both build on an intuitive assumption that factions become stronger—they have more bargaining power—the larger they are. In their model, a candidate's ability to obtain pork for his district depends upon the size and composition of the faction to which he belongs; in ours, a politician anticipates that joining a faction strengthens the position of its leader and influence on policy.         "
"22","In this section, we describe our model of endogenous faction formation and political debate within the party. We define a factional structure as a pair consisting of a partition of the party into factions, together with a leader for each faction. The influence of a faction leader on the party manifesto increases in the size of his faction. Intraparty debate takes place after the faction‐building stage, before the party manifesto is produced, and so is anticipated by politicians. We study factional structures that satisfy a specific stability/equilibrium requirement, motivated by the idea that factional structures should not be upset by unilateral deviations. The factional structure is stable if there is an equilibrium (within a class with desirable properties to be specified) in which each politician chooses to remain in his faction. Importantly, our model's restrictions are minimal. We do not commit to any specific game form that describes which politicians become faction leaders and how factions form. Thus, our results may be applied to political environments characterized by different mechanisms."
"23","We let  be the set of prominent, ideologically differentiated politicians in a party. A factional structure within  is defined as a partition  of , together with a function  assigning a leader  for each faction F. We let  denote the faction of leader l.            "
"24","To determine the stability of each factional structure , we introduce the following political game. Initially, the party is factionalized according to the structure . In the first stage of the game, each player i chooses whether to stay in his own faction, move to a different faction, or act independently. When joining a faction F led by leader l, a politician i increases the influence of l in the party, measured by the influence weight  and we normalize the sum of the influence weights across leaders to 1. For simplicity, the implications of a leader l's influence on the party manifesto are summarized by a single strategic variable  that lies on the left‐right spectrum . We assume that only faction leaders exert any influence on the party manifesto and that if a faction leader moves to a different faction, he transfers his influence to the leader of that faction. We denote the factional structure that arises after this first stage of the game as  to distinguish it from the initial structure "
"25","Each politician i would like all leaders' choices  to be as close as possible to his ideal point on . The ideal point is parameterized as  where θ is an unknown state of the world, uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. The state θ represents the common but uncertain component of the preferences of politicians in . Each one of them would like the “best decisions” to be made as far as θ is concerned. We are agnostic about the precise definition of “best,” as different parties may have different objectives. Interpretations include best from the voters' perceived perspective, so that politicians share a common aim of election, or best in the sense of policies that are in the voters' interest. The relevant point is that, whatever politicians' objectives, they are uncertain as to which policies best serve their intentions. As we shall see, this implies that it is beneficial to all politicians in  that as much information as possible on θ is conveyed to faction leaders through political debate. For each individual politician i, the individual bias  represents the extent and direction of i's bliss point deviation from θ. This may reflect i's own personal views and/or those of i's constituents.            "
"26","The focus of our model is the impact of factions on political debate within parties. In order to study intraparty communication, we adopt the following functional form for each politician i's terminal payoff:               "
"27","We stipulate that each politician i has some private information on θ. This, as already noted, is a necessary feature of a model of political debate. Here, each politician's information may come from his own research or information gleaned from interest groups, think tanks, private experts, and other interested parties. We represent i's private information as a signal  that follows a simple statistical law: Conditional on the state θ,  takes the value equal to 1 with probability θ and to 0 with probability .            "
"28","Before faction leaders exert their influence on the manifesto, politicians can convey their views and information to them. Communication takes a very simple form. Each politician i may send (possibly differentiated) message  to any other politician j. A pure communication strategy of player i is a function  of  Each communication strategy  from i to j may either be truthful, in that a politician reveals his signal to j so that  for , or not: In the latter case,  does not depend on . For any communication strategy profile , we let each politician j's information  be the number of binary signals known by player j after communication takes place, and note that  equals the number of players i whose strategy  is truthful plus 1. Our model allows for communication with multiple politicians, but we restrict to simultaneous messaging.10"
"29","As noted in our introduction, the existence of factions may exacerbate noncooperative forms of intraparty behavior. We study the (possibly) negative consequences of factions in prohibiting intraparty communication, analyzing communication under two different social norms. Under open communication, all politicians can communicate to any other politician. Communication is closed if politicians can communicate only within their faction (i.e., players are restricted to sending at most one truthful message).            "
"30","After debate takes place, by sequential rationality, each leader l makes choice  to maximize his expected utility  where the expectation is taken with respect to θ, and the pair  represents l's information (specifically, l's signal and the messages received by other politicians). We denote the associated policy strategy as .            "
"31","Our solution concept is pure‐strategy perfect Bayesian equilibrium. There may be multiple equilibria  in the communication games taking place after factions are established. For example, the strategy profile where no player is truthful and no information is aggregated in the party is always an equilibrium. Politicians' welfare, however, increases when information is aggregated: Faction leaders are better informed, so the quality of the party program is enhanced. Correspondingly, we adopt the standard equilibrium selection criterion: In the political game, we select equilibria  that maximize each politician's welfare and information aggregation on the equilibrium path. Specifically, we focus on equilibria  such that  is as large as possible, for all faction leaders l. As we shall see, our simple information and signal structure means that, along the equilibrium path, beliefs are straightforward to define using Bayes' rule.            "
"32","In order to construct out‐of‐equilibrium beliefs, we need to consider deviations in the stage in which players choose their factional allegiance. If a player j deviates from the initial factional structures —by choosing to join a faction different from his initial one, or by acting independently and retaining power over —then we restrict beliefs at any subsequent information set as follows. We posit that beliefs are consistent with play of the noninformative strategy  for all players  so that , whereas  is still as large as possible, for all leaders . An interpretation of this restriction is that any player j who deviates from his initial factional allocation is punished by “ostracism”—that is, nobody in the party is willing to talk to him anymore, whereas faction leaders are still optimally informed within the party.11"
"33","Within the equilibrium class defined above, we select the equilibria  that maximize welfare within the party. Our notion of welfare is ex ante utilitarian. We let  be the equilibrium utility of politician i from the influence of politician j over the party program in equilibrium . So, the utilitarian party welfare  is the sum of the utilities  across the politicians . However, some of our results hold also if considering all Pareto optimal equilibria, instead of only ex ante utilitarian optimal ones.            "
"34","We define a factional structure stable if the game with initial structure  has an equilibrium  among those selected above, in which each politician (including leaders) confirms allegiance to his initial faction (i.e.,  and ). In line with the empirical literature that points to ideologically cohesive groupings, as mentioned earlier, we restrict to ideologically connected factions: If politicians i and j belong to faction F, then so does any politician k whose bias  is between  and .            "
"35","Our core results compare these party structures with those that would exist if factions did not form. The benchmark of a nonfactional party  is defined as the one in which factions are prohibited and so each politician i decides on , but all politicians can communicate freely with each other. In the statement of our results, we make use of the fact that  could arise (possibly) as a stable factional structure, or it could be imposed were factionalism to be prohibited.12"
"36","Our model restrictions are minimal, so its results may be applied to political environments characterized by different mechanisms determining how factions form and who leads them. For example, a simple game is one in which there are no factions at the beginning of the game, and politicians first choose whether to try to form a faction becoming potential leaders; then the political game described above is played. Another possibility is to presume that the party is already factionalized at the beginning of the game, that different faction members challenge each other for leadership, and that then faction members may choose to change allegiance depending on the outcome of the power struggle for faction leadership.13"
"37","In any equilibrium of our game, a politician anticipates the effect of his faction allegiance on final party policy. Consequently, he is willing to be in a faction only if he expects that the leader will be more informed than he is in equilibrium. As customary, we solve our game backward, and here we use results by Galeotti, Ghiglino, and Squintani (2013) to determine the equilibria of the intraparty deliberation stage before then deriving the stable factional structures .         "
"38","The solution of the communication game is described as follows. Given communication equilibrium strategies  a politician j's choice is 14 In words, the preferred choice of each politician j equals the expected value of the common state θ given his equilibrium information, plus his ideological bias . Further, in anticipation of the final decisions, the profile of communication strategies  is an equilibrium if and only if, whenever a politician i is truthful to a politician j,               "
"39","On the basis of this finding, we can define the maximum possible information  held by politician j in the intraparty communication stage as the integer d that solves the equation  where the function  is defined as —for any set A, the notation  denotes the cardinality of A. We note that, by construction, the maximum information  coincides with  the equilibrium information held by each politician j in the nonfactionalized party.            "
"40","For any initial factional structure , the equilibrium information  of politician j depends on whether j is a faction leader or not, and on whether communication is open or closed. For each leader , under open communication,  the leader is as informed as possible in equilibrium. Under closed communication, instead . The leader is as informed as possible, compatible with the constraint that only members of his own faction communicate with him.            "
"41","The information  of any politician j influences the expected utility accrued by any player i anticipating the influence exerted by j on the manifesto. But player i's expected utility is also influenced by the ideological distance between player i and player j. Specifically, the expected utility accrued by any player i for politician j's influence is               "
"42","We now turn to the novel aspects of our inquiry, analyzing a model of faction stability built on the notion of voluntarism: Each politician i freely chooses his factional allegiance, anticipating the process of intraparty communication and the final party program. In so doing, he maximizes his own expected utility. Expression 1 allows us to find a simple characterization of stable factional structures, which we report in Lemma 1 (the proof is omitted, as it is immediate). To simplify the exposition of this result and subsequent ones, we henceforth restrict attention to equilibria of the communication game in which politicians babble to every politician j who is not a faction leader, so that .15                              "
"43","Lemma 1.Every stable factional structure  is such that for any faction F and politicians  and ,                     "
"44","The result is intuitive. The factional structure  is stable to unilateral deviations if each politician  prefers that his faction leader  has influence over the manifesto, rather than maintaining his independence or throwing his weight behind a different faction leader. By construction, this choice is checked under the stipulation that leaders are as informed as possible, compatible with equilibrium of the intraparty communication game, whereas all other politicians do not receive any information.16"
"45","As our model is one of cheap talk, we do not assume that a faction leader is informed by all members of her faction. Indeed, it may be that a politician will join a faction while being unable to communicate truthfully with its leader.               "
"46","Lemma 2.Politician i does not communicate with his faction leader  when the ideological difference between i and  is neither so small that i can always communicate with his leader, nor so large that he does not join her faction. Specifically, it is required that                     "
"47","This result is intuitive. If the ideological difference between the politician and the faction leader is small, then he will communicate information truthfully to her. If, on the other hand, it is too large, he will not join her faction. For intermediate values, the politician is willing to join the faction, as long as its leader is sufficiently informed. But at the same time, he is unable to truthfully communicate with the leader, in equilibrium. Why? Although he is happy to throw his weight behind the faction leader, the politician still wishes to influence her views. But because he is not ideologically close enough to reveal his information truthfully, in equilibrium, any such advice would be ignored.17 Realistically, then, some faction members will be closer to their leader than others: They will be able to communicate information and so affect the faction leader's views while other members will not.            "
"48","Using Equality 1 allows us to express party welfare as a simple function of the factional structure :            "
"49","In order to pursue this line of inquiry, we require a benchmark for comparison. As noted in our introductory remarks, we believe there are three principal reasons for the negative connotations of factionalism: that party politicians relinquish their independence when joining a faction; that when doing so, they consider only their own payoff; and that factionalism can be inimical to intraparty cooperation. In this respect, our model offers a natural benchmark, namely, the policy program that would prevail if factions were prohibited from forming, defined earlier as , under open communication. Thus, we contrast a world where a politician exerts influence over policy in accord with his own judgment with one where he has the opportunity of joining a faction and so increasing the power of its leader. To make the comparison interesting, we focus on the case in which the faction formation process does not achieve the first best of a unified party behind a single leader.         "
"50","We consider welfare implications of the faction formation process under open communication, within a broad class of ideology distributions that impose some structure on the primitives of our model. We assume that there are an odd number of politicians, denote the median politician by m, and assume that the ideology distribution is symmetric around m and single‐peaked at m, in the sense that politicians are more ideologically clustered as they get closer to m. Formally, we define the ideology distribution  as single‐peaked and symmetric at m, when for any  weakly decreases in i, and .18 This focus is based on the supposition that the ideology distribution is often concentrated closer to the party median, with fewer politicians found at the ideological extremes of the party.            "
"51","For this canonical case, we can prove that factionalism is beneficial to the party under open communication, that it can never be detrimental to attaining party goals, and that factions should not be prohibited from forming. In doing so, we uncover a novel rationale for factions.               "
"52","Proposition 1.Suppose that the ideology distribution  is single‐peaked and symmetric, that communication is open across factions, and that a single party‐wide faction is not a stable structure. Then it can never benefit any politician in the party to prohibit factionalism: If the optimal stable factional structure  does not coincide with the nonfactional party  then it strictly improves the welfare of every single politician.                  "
"53","The proof of Proposition 1 is involved and so relegated to the appendix. The key fact that leads to the result is that, when the ideology distribution  is single‐peaked and symmetric, the maximal amount of information  obtained with intraparty communication weakly increases as politician j becomes more moderate. As a consequence, it can never be the case (by Equation 3) that a moderate politician joins a faction led by a more extreme politician; as moderate faction leaders are more informed, extreme politicians transfer power to them. Further, because the ideology distribution  is symmetric, for every transfer of power from a leftist politician to a more moderate leader, there is a corresponding and symmetric transfer from a right‐wing player to a more moderate and informed leader. Each player benefits from these symmetric transfers, regardless of their ideology. From Expression 1, the ideological loss of each politician i due to j's decisions is a convex function of the ideological distance between i and j. So even an extremist gains more from a transfer of power to a moderate leader on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum, than he loses from a symmetric transfer of power away from his ideological bliss point.            "
"54","Our result uncovers a role for party factions. They provide a mechanism for tying extreme politicians into partitions led by more moderate and informed leaders. Proposition 1 shows that, within a canonical model specification, their formation always benefits the party. Later, we develop this insight further, fully characterizing the optimal factional structure for a subcase of this environment. Before doing so, and having shown the benefits of faction formation, we explore conditions under which factions may or may not have negative welfare effects, in a much simpler model specification. We also ask whether our results change when considering closed communication.            "
"55","In our introduction, we noted that factions are commonly perceived as detrimental to the achievement of common party goals. We have shown that this need not be so. Indeed, party objectives can sometimes be better achieved when factionalism is allowed than when it is prohibited. To uncover a negative role for factions, we must then move beyond the canonical class of single‐peaked and symmetric ideology distributions for which, as we have seen, factions involve empowering relatively moderate and better‐informed faction leaders."
"56","We first note that factions can be detrimental, relative to a benchmark where they are prohibited, only when (a) a party without factions is optimal and (b) this outcome can only be achieved by prohibiting them. Put otherwise, it must be that a nonfactional party is optimal, but that it is not a stable structure when politicians can voluntarily join factions. We demonstrate that this occurs only when factions form around leaders whose views are extreme relative to those of their members. When factionalism increases the power of these ideologically extreme politicians, it can be detrimental to the party as a whole."
"57","We illustrate these findings in a simple environment where the party is formed with three distinct ideological groups: left, center, and right. There are  politicians with ideology  politicians with ideology zero, and  politicians with ideology . Following Rose (1964), we refer to these leftist, centrist, and right‐wing groups as ideological tendencies. Our distinction between a faction and a tendency closely mimics that of Rose (1964), who described the former as “self‐consciously organized as a body, with a measure of discipline and cohesion,” whereas the latter is instead “a stable set of attitudes, rather than a stable set of politicians.” (Empirical evidence for this distinction from the British House of Commons, using proximity scaling of divisions, is provided by Wood and Jacoby [1984].) We thus study how a party of underlying tendencies relates to a stable factional structure: As we shall see, intuitively, stable factions form when the ideological difference between tendencies is not too large. We explore the welfare consequences of these intraparty partitions. While we do not impose any restrictions on , and , we have in mind an application to sufficiently large parties where the number of informed politicians is non‐negligible for each tendency.19"
"58","There are three possibilities with respect to the stable factional structures. The first is that the program is decided in its entirety by the leader of a party‐wide faction. When the party is unified in such a faction with a welfare‐maximizing leader, then welfare is higher than in a nonfactional party as the first best is achieved. Another possibility is that the party is not factionalized. Welfare is of course equivalent whether factions are allowed or prohibited. Of more interest is the third and remaining possibility: Two tendencies are joined in a cohesive faction, thus leaving the remaining tendency isolated."
"59","In dealing with this case, and without loss of generality, we take the right‐wing tendency to be isolated. Still there are two possibilities. The leader of the faction may be on the left or the center: We refer to the former as a left‐center faction and the latter as a center‐left faction. In exploring welfare implications, it is immediate that a center‐left faction benefits the party always: Leftist politicians must benefit, as joining a faction led by a centrist leader is a voluntary choice; centrist politicians benefit a fortiori as faction formation increases the power of a centrist leader; and right‐wing politicians benefit as a center‐left faction reduces influence of the left. This thus reinforces our earlier message that factionalism is beneficial when extreme politicians are tied into factions led by moderates."
"60","To see why factionalism can be detrimental, we consider the case where the welfare‐maximizing equilibrium involves a left‐center faction. Centrists must benefit as faction formation is voluntary, as do leftists a fortiori; however, increasing the influence of a leftist leader may be so detrimental to right‐wing politicians as to induce an overall welfare loss for the party.               "
"61","Proposition 2.Suppose that there are three ideological tendencies: left, center, and right. If the optimal stable party structure under open communication involves a center‐left (or center‐right) faction, then factionalism is beneficial to the party. If the optimal stable party structure under open communication is such that a left‐center or right‐center faction forms, then factionalism may be detrimental to the party.                  "
"62","In a three‐tendency model, our result highlights that a necessary though not sufficient condition for factionalism to be detrimental is that the faction leader is extreme. Investigating further, we present details of an example for particular parameter values.               "
"63","Example 1.Consider a stable left‐center faction: Let , let , and set  sufficiently large so that the faction leader is from the left (in fact,  will suffice). Suppose  and  are sufficiently large that L and R tendency politicians cannot communicate to C tendency politicians, or vice versa: Specifically, set  and . At the same time, take  sufficiently small so that C tendency politicians are willing to be in the faction led by a leftist leader: Specifically, set  noting that the right‐hand side of this inequality is larger than 1/12 because .                  "
"64","In order to compare welfare in the party with a left‐center faction to that of a party in which factionalism is prohibited, we specialize the example to  and  Straightforward algebra reveals the following: When  factionalism is detrimental to the party, whereas if  then factionalism is beneficial to the party.                  "
"65","Our example demonstrates that factionalism may be detrimental to the party when the tendency of right‐wing politicians is fairly extreme. In this case, they are severely hurt by the influence of the leftist leader of a left‐center faction, and this more than cancels the gains of other politicians from faction formation. Beyond this somewhat pathological circumstance, factions strictly benefit the party and so should never be prohibited."
"66","The conditions we identified for factions to be detrimental to the party appear stringent. This suggests the beneficial consequences of allowing politicians to freely join factions and thereby increase the influence of their leaders. As argued earlier, however, factionalism may damage parties by exacerbating noncooperative intraparty behavior. To explore this issue, we analyze a closed world where intraparty dialogue is restricted. Specifically, we assume that communication can occur only within factions."
"67","Our analysis reveals, surprisingly, that whether communication is open or closed is immaterial as long as the number of informed politicians in any tendency is not too small (specifically, it is sufficient to set , and . This is because there is no ideology configuration  such that a politician j would be willing to communicate truthfully with faction leader l if allowed to do so, yet be unwilling to be in l's faction. In fact, both the decision to communicate truthfully and to join the faction depend on the leader's information  and on the ideology difference . However, the willingness to be truthful decreases in , whereas the willingness to be in the faction increases in . When , and  any leader l has information  no smaller than 3 (at a minimum, he can gather truthful messages of the politicians of his same tendency). For  politician i cannot be willing to communicate truthfully to l without being simultaneously willing to stay in l's faction.               "
"68","Proposition 3.When there are three tendencies such that  and  the restrictions that factions may impose on intraparty communication are irrelevant to the welfare consequences of factionalism. Factionalism with closed communication within factions benefits the party unless it is divided into factions with noncentrist leaders.                  "
"69","Somewhat contrary to conventional wisdom, the overall conclusion of our welfare analysis is that, by and large, factions based on ideology are beneficial to the party. This insight stems from two aspects of factionalism that we believe have previously been overlooked. First, factions form via a process of voluntary transfer of power over the party decisions. Second, factions are by definition part of a larger body that has a common objective. Our specific message is that factions provide a mechanism for preventing politicians with relatively extreme views, or relatively poor information, from acting autonomously in the party."
"70","We have established that factionalism is beneficial to a party under a broad set of circumstances. Correspondingly, we have shown that a negative association between ideological factions and welfare can be established only under quite restrictive conditions. Moreover, we have uncovered an intriguing rationale for factions in tying extreme and poorly informed politicians into partitions led by moderate and well‐informed leaders. Here we develop this insight further, undertaking the full characterization of optimal party factions within a simple environment that is a subcase of the canonical model studied earlier."
"71","We study a party with an odd number of politicians, , where the ideological distance between each politician and his closest ideological neighbor is fixed and equal to β. We assume that  for . Considering politicians i and j, we let  denote the number of ideological positions separating i from j. Further, we assume throughout that : Each politician is initially endowed with authority over a single dimension.            "
"72","Using this example, we derive an iterative construction of the optimal stable factional structure, based on the following intuitive ideas. In the optimal structure, politicians should join a faction led by a more moderate politician whenever possible. Politicians are constrained: As the ideological distance β increases, they will be unable in equilibrium to join factions led by politicians who are too ideologically distant. We show that the optimal structure is determined by the requirement that the most extreme politicians join factions led by as moderate a politician as possible, thus reinforcing the imperative of tying in the extremists. In fact, we show that this imperative dominates all other requirements. In particular, selecting the stable faction that ensures that extremists are tied to leaders with intermediate ideology requires that such leaders do not join factions led by even more moderate politicians, even though there are stable factions in which they do."
"73","The details of our analysis are somewhat intricate, and so we begin our exposition with the informal description of a simple example.               "
"74","Example 2.Open Communication in a Party with Seven Politicians. We determine the optimal stable factional structure that maximizes party welfare for the case of  politicians and open communication with equidistant bias  for .                  "
"75","Dispensing with much detail, we focus on the provision of a clear exposition of our insights.20 Depending on the parameter value β, the optimal stable structure may take different forms. We distinguish between three mutually exclusive and exhaustive cases defined by the degree of ideological distance between a politician and his nearest ideological neighbor.            "
"76","We first suppose that the ideological distance between a politician and his closest ideological neighbor is small, specifically . We can then show that the party should be united under the leadership of the median politician . First, we note that in this case the analysis in section implies that the maximum equilibrium information of the median player 4, defined as d4, is at least 3. Moreover, we note that, by Inequality 2, all politicians are willing to join a faction led by player 4 when  and . Uniting the party under the most moderate politician yields the optimal structure, as it minimizes the aggregate ideological loss.               "
"77","Now suppose that the ideological distance between a politician and his closest ideological neighbor is not small, nor is it too large. Specifically, suppose that . Then we show that in the optimal stable structure, the party is divided into three factions: , , and , whose leaders are 3, 4, and 5, respectively.               "
"78","We begin as before by calculating the maximum equilibrium information  of any player j. Doing so, and because , we obtain that . Further, because , the most extreme politicians 1 and 7 are no longer willing to join a faction led by the median player 4. However, it is still possible that they join a faction led by a more moderate politician and in so doing that they improve party welfare. Inequality 2 implies that any politician i would join a faction led by a more moderate politician j who is at most two ideological positions away from i: So player 1 is willing to join a faction led by either 2 or 3. If the faction is led by 3, then, since it must be ideologically connected, 2 must join it also. So faction  forms. If 1 decides to act independently, however, then 2 can join a faction led by 4, in which case faction  forms. It can be shown that the former configuration is more advantageous. Because of the concavity in the politicians' payoff functions, the party's (collective) first‐order concern is to avoid extreme political stands. This can be achieved by tying the extremists into factions led by more moderate leaders. Extending this reasoning, it can be shown that the optimal stable factional structure comprises two factions:  and , whose leaders are 3 and 5, respectively.21 This configuration leaves the most moderate politician 4 isolated.               "
"79","Now suppose that the ideological distance between a politician and his closest ideological neighbor is larger than in the previous example, but not too large. Specifically, suppose that . Following the same steps as in the previous case, we find that politicians are only willing to stay in factions led by their immediate ideological neighbors. The party imperative—avoiding extreme ideological stands—requires that politicians 1 and 7 form a faction led by their respective neighbors 2 and 6, so that the optimal factional structure is  and . As a consequence, the remaining players 3 and 5 then form a faction  led by 4.               "
"80","Finally, we consider a highly polarized party, specifically . Then politicians are unwilling to join factions even when they are led by their most immediate neighbor. Hence, the only possible stable structure is one where each politician acts independently—that is, no factions are formed. We now derive a general characterization, building on two central points arising from the example above.               "
"81","First, we have seen that, in order to improve party welfare, politicians should join factions led by more moderate politicians. When the ideological distance is not too small, extreme politicians are unwilling to join a faction led by the median politician, but every politician is willing to join a faction led by a more moderate politician who is ideologically separated by, at most, a specific number of ideological positions. Intuitively, the number of ideological positions is a decreasing function of the ideological distance β. For example, we have seen that for  politicians are willing to transfer influence only to immediate ideological neighbors, whereas for , they are also willing to transfer influence to politicians who differ by two ideological positions.               "
"82","Second, we have seen that the optimal organization of the party when β is intermediate involves factions that include extreme politicians and the most moderate politicians possible. This holds regardless of the reduced capability of more moderate politicians to transfer influence. In our seven‐player example, we have seen that if 1 is willing to be in a faction led by 2 but not by 3, then the faction  is part of the optimal factional structure even though 2 would be willing to be in a faction led by 3. Making (already) moderate politicians adopt (more) moderate stances is less important for party welfare than tying extreme politicians to more moderate leaders.               "
"83","Our findings suggest an iterative procedure to calculate the welfare‐maximizing factional structure . Initially, as a function of the ideological difference β, we calculate the maximum number q of ideological positions across which a politician is willing to transfer influence. Then we build the optimal party organization. We make extreme politicians 1 and I be led by politicians who are q ideological positions more moderate (i.e.,  and , respectively). Since factions must be ideologically connected, this implies that all politicians between 1 and q (respectively, between  and I) also join the faction led by  (respectively, . If the remaining politicians  are now willing to be led by the median , then they should be united in a single faction under her. Otherwise, the iterative procedure continues by building two factions,  and  and then considering the remaining politicians . This procedure continues until the remaining politicians are united under a faction led by the median.               "
"84","Proposition 4 below confirms that the conjectured iterative procedure delivers the optimal factional structure, determines q precisely as a function of β, and in so doing calculates the equilibrium information  of all faction leaders l. Moreover, it derives the number G of factions in the optimal stable structure and their size. In the statement below, for any real number x, the notation  denotes the largest integer smaller than x, whereas the notation  denotes the smallest integer larger than x.                  "
"85","Proposition 4.Suppose that there are an odd number  of politicians, and that ideological neighbors are at fixed ideological distance β. The optimal stable factional structure is characterized as follows: (a) The leader of each faction is always its most moderate politician; (b) letting  for any integer d, and letting  be the integer d such that  each leader l's equilibrium information equals ; (c) letting  there are  factions symmetrically arranged around the median politician  and all factions are of size  except the one containing the median politician m, which is of size "
"86","A consequence of our result is that, in the optimal stable party faction, the median politician  never joins the faction of a different leader: He is the most moderate politician; hence, his decisions minimize the aggregate ideological loss of the party. Further, he is never less informed than any other politician. Combining these two considerations delivers the implication that it is never beneficial for him to join the faction of another.               "
"87","Before concluding our analysis of the optimal partition of parties into factions with open communication, we highlight one further substantive implication of our findings. We note that an external observer cannot always infer party policy from a simple summary statistic such as the median preference. Indeed, and as a consequence of our rationale for factionalism, we observe that when the ideological distance between ideological neighboring politicians is neither too large nor too small, then the optimal party structure comprises the factions , and  for  whereas for  it comprises the factions , and . Hence, the program will differ according to β, although the ideology of the median politician 4 remains unchanged (when renormalizing the ideologies, setting  for ). While intuitively one might think that knowledge of the party median provides a strong indicator of the policies a party will pursue, our analysis suggests that this is the case only for small ideological differences within the party. Otherwise, a detailed analysis of the stable party factions is required. So we conclude that factions matter for collective choice.               "
"88","We conclude this section by addressing the case of closed communication. To do so, we revisit Example 2, with seven politicians and equidistant ideological neighbors.               "
"89","Example 3.A Party with Seven Politicians and Closed Communication. We study the optimal stable factional structure for the case of  politicians with equidistant bias  for  who can communicate only with members of their faction.                  "
"90","When , as in the case of open communication, the party should be united under the leadership of the median politician . Indeed, the constraint that communication occurs only among the same faction members does not play any role if the party is united.               "
"91","In the range  there are two optimal configurations: the one with factions  and , and the one with factions  and . In both configurations, the faction leaders are 3 and 5, respectively. To appreciate the difference with the case of open communication, recall that there the optimal configuration is , with leaders 3, 4, and 5. The reason why  does not maximize welfare with closed communication is because it requires the median politician, player 4, to be isolated. But being isolated, player 4 can count only on his own information, and this makes his decision very imprecise. As a result, 4 is now willing to transfer authority to player 3 or 5, and this improves party welfare.               "
"92","In the range  the optimal configuration is composed of the three factions , and  with leaders 2, 4, and 6, respectively, as in the case of open communication.               "
"93","When , then as with open communication, the only possibility is that no factions form. Communication between politicians could not take place even with open communication. A fortiori, it cannot occur when communication is constrained to happen only within factions. As a result, all politicians prefer to act independently.22"
"94","The significance of contrasting our seven‐player examples under closed and open communication is in highlighting that the provisions of the party program need not be uniquely identified by the ideological distribution of politicians. Here, we show that the social norms that determine how communication takes place within a party play a role in determining the optimal stable factions, and hence the details of the final party program."
"95","The prohibition of communication may reduce the number of factions in the optimal structure. Ostensibly, the party will be less divided. Closed communication makes division more costly; hence, in the optimal stable structure, the party needs to be more unified."
"96","While this might suggest that closed communication may benefit the party, this is not so. This is because, in contrast to open communication, power may be transferred to relatively extreme leaders. (Unlike in Example 2, here it is optimal that politician 4 joins the faction led by either politician 3 or 5, as otherwise he would be uninformed.) Moreover, such leaders are (weakly) less informed than a leader would be in the case of open communication. Closed communication is thus always (weakly) detrimental to the party, and to each single individual politician, relative to open communication. The intuition then is simple: Closed communication implies that power may be transferred to relatively extreme faction leaders who are weakly less informed. Closed communication is detrimental, as it constrains the amount of information conveyed to faction leaders in equilibrium, though, by Expression 1, each politician is better off if leaders are as informed as possible.               "
"97","Although factions are ubiquitous, they are commonly perceived as playing a negative role in political life. Nevertheless, several empirical studies have suggested that factions can play a role in integrating extreme ideological streams of a party. We provide a formal defense of factions consistent with this more positive view. Our key research findings can be summarized succinctly: Factions play a role in tying extreme party politicians to more moderate faction leaders, who are better informed and so better placed to make decisions on behalf of a party. This leads to a defense of factions: They enhance the quality of party programs, by keeping the actions of the most extreme and less informed politicians in check, under the guidance of more informed and moderate ones. We conclude, then, by highlighting possible extensions, applications, and central lessons of our analysis."
"98","How might our insights extend to a world with political competition? We were motivated in part by recent research (Fujiwara and Wantchekon 2013) showing that intraparty deliberation enhances the quality of programmatic platforms and so provides electoral benefits. Our results reveal that factions can facilitate information sharing via intraparty deliberation and suggest that they may also provide electoral benefits.23 So a reasonable conjecture, albeit one left to further research, is that our central insights extend to a competitive environment.         "
"99","A limiting factor with respect to the generality of our conclusions is that we assume a party whose politicians share a common objective. We can be agnostic as to what the common objective is—the central point is that whatever politicians' objectives, and insofar as the party program can be used to attain them, party politicians are uncertain as to which policies best serve their intentions. We do assume, however, that party politicians are alike with respect to the weight they place on the common objectives and their idiosyncratic (ideological) concerns. Nevertheless, we can confirm that in at least one obvious and realistic case, where politicians with the most extreme ideological preferences care less about the common objective, all of our results hold."
"100","While there are limitations, it is also likely that our insights travel beyond political parties. Many organizations have a common objective to reach informed decisions, consist of a diverse body of opinion, and maintain organized internal groups who seek to control decision making. Consider, as one example, the case of an academic department that has a number of faculty positions to be filled, would like the hires that are made to be of a quality that enhances the reputation of the department, and where information about candidates is dispersed among faculty members who also have idiosyncratic biases. Our insights extend to such an environment: Starting from a point where all or some have a say in the hiring process, it would be beneficial for groups to form behind distinct leaders of factions who make final decisions."
"101","Our defense of factions provides lessons to be learned: Restrictions on information sharing between factions can be detrimental. This suggests that an optimal party design involves factions that tie extreme members to moderate leaders, thus facilitating better information‐sharing, alongside institutions that enable interfactional dialogue."
"102","As shown in the main text, depending on the parameter value β, the optimal stable structure may take different forms. The exposition below fills in the details."
"103","We first show that, when  the party is united under the leadership of the median politician "
"104","First, note that the maximum equilibrium information d4 of player 4 is at least 3 for  In fact, for d4 to be equal to 3, it must be that one neighbor on each side of 4 is willing to communicate to him. For this to be so, it must be that  Because  it follows that when  the median politician's maximum equilibrium information d4 is at least 3.               "
"105","Second, note that for the party to be united under 4, and because of inequality 2, it must be that:                  "
"106","For  we show that the party is divided in 3 factions:  and  whose leaders are respectively 3, 4 and 5.               "
"107","Because  again, it is the case that the maximum equilibrium information d4 of player 4 is at least 3. But now, it cannot be larger than 3 either. In fact, this would require that at least 2 politicians on one side of 4 are truthful to him in equilibrium. This would require that  where d4 would be at least 4. In sum, if the maximum equilibrium information d4 of player 4 were larger than 3, it would be necessary that  But because  this possibility is ruled out by "
"108","Having concluded that the maximum equilibrium information d4 of player 4 is exactly 3 it is immediate that this is also true for any other player . Each one of these players, in fact, has at least two neighbors on the same side and one on the opposite side.               "
"109","Because  uniting the party under politician 4 is not an option anymore. It is possible, however, that any politician i joins a faction led by another politician  who is at most two ideological steps away from i. This is because  when  and  by using inequality 2.               "
"110","Now note that party welfare maximization requires that politicians join factions led by more moderate politicians. This observation rules out many factional structures as optimal, though allows several possibilities including, for example,  with leaders , or  with leaders .               "
"111","To see that  provides a higher party welfare than , we need only compare the ideological losses, because the equilibrium information of all leaders equals 3 in both factional configurations. Under  politicians 3 and 5 lead factions of 3 politicians each. Under  politicians 2 and 6 lead factions of two politicians each, and 4 leads a faction of three politicians. Hence the net difference between  and  is that the influence weight 2/7 is taken from the intermediate ideology politicians 3 and 5 each, half of it (1/7) is given to median player 4 and half to a more extremist politician, respectively 2 and 6. Because players' utilities are quadratic losses, they are concave functions, and thus spreading influence reduces the aggregate players' utilities. In fact, the aggregate ideological loss induced by  is:                  "
"112","For  we now show that the optimal factional structure comprises the three factions , and , with leaders 2, 4 and 6 respectively.               "
"113","In fact, because  players are not willing to join factions led by politicians who are two ideological steps away. But because  we now establish that they are willing to join factions led by immediate ideological neighbors. In fact, as seen before, for  the maximum equilibrium information is  In this case, the condition required by inequality 2 for politicians to join the faction led by an immediate neighbor simplifies to  which is larger than 1/10 and hence does not impose any restriction. For , the possible leaders have information  Hence, the condition required by inequality 2 for politicians to join a faction led by an immediate neighbor simplifies to  which is smaller than 1/8, and hence is the binding condition.               "
"114","As in the previous case, although (as established) the optimal stable structure requires politicians to join factions led by their moderate neighbors, there are several possible structures. These include  with leaders  In order to conclude that, indeed, this is the optimal stable structures, we proceed as in case 3, using arguments based on the concavity of the players' utilities.               "
"115","Finally, for  the only possibility is that the party is non‐factionalized. In fact, in this parameter range, the maximum equilibrium information of any possible leader j is  At the same time, politicians are not willing to join factions led by even immediate neighbors with such equilibrium information.               "
