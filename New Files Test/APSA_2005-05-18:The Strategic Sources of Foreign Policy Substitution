"1","A significant portion of scholarly work on strategic behavior speaks explicitly about the nature of information and how states convey information to one another regarding their intentions. Among the notions advanced in the strategic literature are those of information asymmetry, signaling, credibility, resolve, and intent. Generally speaking, states seek to convey information to one another regarding their intentions and resolve, they seek to make those signals believable. For any of a variety of reasons, a differential might arise in the information each state has regarding the other's intent or resolve. Information asymmetries such as these introduce substantial variance into the decisions states make during crises; asymmetries are sometimes the sources of misperceptions."
"2","Regarding these asymmetries, Morrow (1989) argues that empirical models of crisis bargaining suffer two problems related directly to the process that characterizes states' strategic interactions. First, models of crises suffer from nonrandom selection since crises themselves do not occur randomly. Second, and more nefariously, models suffer misspecification since they (necessarily) exclude measures of states' beliefs about each others' payoffs for outcomes. If states have complete information about each others payoffs, it is likely they can effectively forecast the outcome of the crisis and perhaps avoid war. Since states are likely never to have complete information, they must make guesses about each others' payoffs based on observable features of their opponents. Observable features receiving notable attention in the literature include regime, state capabilities, and domestic threats; these bear discussion.         "
"3","While most work on the apparent peace among democracies focuses on the structural or normative characteristics of democratic states (e.g., Russett and Oneal 2000), a growing body of work is examining the function of one particular attribute of democratic states; transparency (e.g., Ritter 2000; Russett and Starr 2000; Siegel 1997). Because democratic states are characteristically transparent in ways other regimes are not, the capacity of foreign observers to apprehend domestic conditions in democracies is greater than for other regimes. Moreover, because foreign observers can verify claims a democratic government makes, democracies' claims (threats, demands, etc.) are more believable. Democratic leaders who make false threats (i.e., threats not in the national interest, threats difficult or impossible to carry out) suffer from the fact that their opponents can observe public and elite reactions and then gauge whether the threat is believable. Because democratic leaders live in glass houses where the falsehood of such threats might be revealed, they have incentives not to make threats they do not intend to carry out. This is the basic claim Fearon (1994) makes; when democratic leaders make public threats, they constrain themselves from backing down because to do so would incur punishment by the domestic audience. Because a democrat's opponent can see the potential audience costs the democratic leader is invoking, that opponent can guess that the threat is genuine. Schultz (1998, 2001) refines this claim by suggesting that one particular characteristic of democratic systems that facilitates signals of credibility is the presence of opposition parties. An opposition party will publicly oppose gratuitous threats or demands but will publicly support legitimate international threats or demands. Thus, foreign opponents can see they face a resolved (and united) democrat if the opposition supports the leader's foreign policy statement. Because a leader would find it difficult to carry out a statement the opposition opposed (and the leader would then suffer electoral costs), democratic leaders should only make threats they intend to carry out and for which they expect to find support in the opposition.            "
"4","On this basis, formal work suggests that the informational attributes of democracy, principally transparency, and the ability to signal credibly, are pivotal in shaping democratic foreign policy behavior. Fearon (1994, 585) argues that once a dyad publicly enters a crisis, the side least able to generate audience costs will be the side most likely to back down. Though derived from a different formal model, Bueno de Mesquita et al. (1999) argue similarly that, because democratic states know other democratic states cannot easily back down in crises, democratic dyads will strategically avoid crises in the first place; Reed (2000) provides empirical evidence supportive of this claim. Schultz (1999) demonstrates that democratic institutions inform opponents in crises about resolve, and thus when a democratic state initiates a crisis, its opponents are more likely to capitulate than are an autocratic initiator's opponents.            "
"5","All this points to the possibility that democratic institutions shape the informational environment in which states operate as they make foreign policy decisions. Democratic transparency permits foreign states some prescience regarding the foreign policy direction a democratic state might pursue. That same transparency, by shaping how foreign states behave in anticipation of democratic action, may produce limits on the foreign policies a democratic state can realistically pursue. For instance, suppose a foreign power believes it is likely to become a convenient scapegoat for a troubled democratic leader; the foreign power may have strong incentives to behave in ways that make it a difficult target for the democratic leader to justify attacking. Assuming the foreign leader can do so effectively, he has shaped the democratic leader's foreign policy options and perhaps limited those options. Thus, as regime attributes shape the informational environment surrounding dyadic interactions, they may also shape the foreign policy choice set and lead to substitution. Moreover, consistent with economic treatments of substitution, we can conceive of different foreign policies having different prices (costs) associated with them. So leaders choose policies with respect to costs, and democratic leaders may be more sensitive to changes in those costs than other leaders might be. Thus, a shifting strategic environment may produce greater incentives to shift to lower‐cost policies for democratic leaders than for autocratic leaders."
"6","By facilitating signaling, democratic transparency provides foreign observers with additional information about a democracy's payoffs for various foreign policy outcomes. Regime characteristics broadly influence the strategic/informational environment in ways that are not directly observable, but shape strategic behavior in important ways. Similarly, states' observable relative capabilities shape the dyadic informational environment, though capabilities can at times reveal less than regime might. Prior to the onset of conflict, observable capabilities permit states to evaluate their chances of prevailing in conflict and may be quite informative if one state is clearly stronger than the other. Both sides might expect the stronger side to prevail, and given that belief, the dyad would avoid militarized conflict since the stronger can make a demand and the weaker, knowing the futility of resistance, will acquiesce (other things being equal, e.g., alliances).2 However, observable capabilities become decidedly less informative as a dyad approaches parity. For example, Reed (2003) shows that the variance in types of defenders is substantially larger at parity than at preponderance, indicating that states are increasingly uncertain about what kind of opponent they face when relative capabilities are approximately equal.            "
"7","States' beliefs about their opponents' unobserved capabilities (resolve, morale, etc.) are important to determining how states behave during crises and how they decide whether or not to enter disputes in the first place. Fearon argues observable capabilities will be influential in determining whether states “‘select themselves’ into crises” (1994, 586), but will exert no real influence in how crises end. In fact, if an observably weaker state refuses to acquiesce to a stronger opponent's demands and thus perpetuates the crisis, it reveals information regarding its unobserved capabilities (perhaps its resolve). In this manner, a state's capabilities and how those capabilities shape the state's willingness to enter a crisis provide information to an opponent regarding the state's unobserved capabilities. Thus capabilities influence the informational environment and like democratic institutions, may shape anticipatory behavior. One state, gleaning information from a potential opponent's observable capabilities, may make foreign policy decisions in anticipation of what its opponent is likely to do. So doing may strategically shape the reasonable set of foreign policy options from which its opponent might choose."
"8","Both regime and the ratio of capabilities have unobserved attributes pertaining to the symmetry of information in a dyad and the level of uncertainty each side suffers prior to or during disputes. These provide an environment in which states understand each others domestic conditions and the foreign policy imperatives that might accompany them. Smith (1996) argues it is difficult for democratic states to motivate foreign aggression in response to domestic trouble (e.g., electoral threats, unrest) because foreign states can observe the democratic executives plight, and supposing he might pursue aggressive (externalizing) foreign policies, seek to avoid becoming scapegoats. So just when a democratic leader might most need a scapegoat, scapegoats might be scarce due to strategic interaction. Democratic transparency and capabilities shape the chances a democratic state can successfully externalize its domestic angst. Transparency allows foreign states to forecast potential threats. Dissimilarity in capabilities may suggest to foreign states they are vulnerable; their observable weakness relative to a troubled democracy makes them a desirable target since victory would be more certain for the democrat than it might be against a stronger opponent.            "
"9","The strategic argument suggests a reason for the mixed findings in research on the diversionary use of force abroad. An unobserved strategic interaction leads foreign states to behave cautiously, and thus avoid becoming the targets of a troubled democrat. Leeds and Davis (1997) and Clark (2003) provide empirical evidence of this unobserved process. In fact, Clark shows that strategic behavior by a potential target influences the ability of a troubled U.S. leader to externalize. In other words, strategic behavior by a foreign state shapes the American president's foreign policy decisions. What remains unclear, however, is whether and how foreign strategy influences the president's choice or the set of options from which he chooses. In other words, does foreign behavior force U.S. presidents to substitute policies for one another? If strategic factors lead to policy substitution, substitution models should account for strategic behavior. The next sections examines substitution arguments and then link strategic and substitution arguments.            "
"10","The search for empirical evidence leaders substitute foreign policies depending on the conditions they face at any given point in time originates in work by Most and Starr (1984, 1989) wherein the authors sought to diagnose the apparent lack of cumulation in world politics research. Regarding foreign policy substitution, Most and Starr argue that researchers tend to treat individual foreign policies as if they are independent outcomes of political processes, ignoring the possibility that leaders choose the policies they implement from an inclusive toolbox. Empirical research in world politics tended then (and still tends) to examine particular foreign policy events (e.g., militarized conflict) to the exclusion of other foreign policy behaviors that might sometimes be implemented alongside the policy of interest or even in the place of the policy of interest. Doing so is partially responsible for what Most and Starr refer to as “islands of research.”         "
"11","Since Most and Starr published their book in 1989, a growing body of work has focused on the notion of substitutability, and in recent years, scholars have made important strides in constructing empirical models of substitutability.3 More importantly, as Starr himself notes (Starr 2000), scholars have have begun to think constructively about the theoretical implications of policy substitution, tying how leaders choose policies to broader theoretical notions like opportunity and willingness (e.g., Cioffi‐Revilla and Starr 1995; Regan 2000).         "
"12","At its root, substitutability describes the possibility that foreign policy makers implement different types of policies in response to apparently similar stimuli; as McGinnis (1991) suggests, this might arise in part because indicators of foreign policy behavior all tap into the same underlying process. While conflict research commonly examines the tendency of states to use military force against one another, most research also commonly compares the use of force to an ill‐defined reference category representing “no use of force.” While such a variable, imagine it to be dichotomous, is technically comprised of categories that are both exhaustive and mutually exclusive, the reference category contains all foreign policy behaviors that do not comprise using force abroad. Thus, the reference category contains other forms of coercion (e.g., trade action, sanctions, alliance formation, or coalition building) that might reasonably be implemented instead of using force depending on the particular circumstance.         "
"13","The consequences of such research designs are (at least) two‐fold. First, finding a statistical relationship between x and y will not reveal that y (the use of force) is being substituted for some other manifestation of Y, say economic sanctions. Relatedly, finding that x is not associated with y may mask the possibility that some other manifestation of y, again, perhaps economic sanctions, is being substituted for the use of force for some reason. For example, suppose we have 100 cases in which we observe whether or not the United States takes military action toward Iraq; a dichotomous variable, 0 = no use of force, 1 = use of force. The United States uses force in 10 of the 100 cases in our data. Further, suppose of the 100 cases the United States seeks to convince the U.N. Security Council to adopt a new resolution sending arms inspectors to Iraq 20 times; unfortunately, this variable is not in the data because we are principally interested in the use of force. Finally, suppose the main independent variable in our analysis is whether or not Iraq takes belligerent action; it does so 35 times. We would expect a correlation between Iraqi action and U.S. foreign policy action in general. Probably, we would expect a relationship between Iraqi belligerence and U.S. uses of force. But since Iraq's actions might also be correlated with U.S. action in the U.N., the relationship between Iraq's actions and U.S. uses of force might be masked. The independent variable predicts the cases where the dependent variable is equal to one and where it equals zero because both uses of force and U.S. appeals to the United Nations tap the same underlying process of foreign policy aimed at containing Iraq. In any case, such an empirical analysis would miss an important part of U.S. foreign policy in response to Iraq.         "
"14","While empirical analysis might be misleading if it fails to consider the possibility of substitution, a second and perhaps more serious consequence has to do with theory building. Marching toward research designs that distinguish between the presence and absence of conflict produces theories that themselves only distinguish between the presence and absence of conflict and fail to consider the possible tradeoffs between or among different foreign policy alternatives. From a theoretical standpoint, focusing exclusively on the use of force as a policy response the United States might implement toward Iraq necessarily means that the decision to use force is independent of other types of foreign policy. In fact, it suggests using force is independent of all other policy actions that might reasonably address Iraqi intransigence. Speaking more broadly, students of international conflict routinely comment on the relative rarity of violent interstate conflict, but also comment on the frequency of interstate interaction. Suppose some portion of those interactions are noncooperative but do not produce interstate violence; why is violent foreign policy rare? One explanation is states resort to nonviolent forms of coercion to achieve their foreign policy goals. Another (related) explanation is states try to avoid costly contests, and militarized conflict is more likely than many other types of interactions to be costly. To avoid costly contests, states may seek other foreign policies to coerce the outcomes they prefer; thus, the coercive, but nonviolent outcomes we observe may be a function of the projected costs of violent foreign policy. If so, then the choice of foreign policy A is partially a function of the costs of foreign policy B. Theories of international conflict rarely consider the replacement of costly policy B with some other coercive but less costly policy; empirical models do so even less often."
"15","Recent models of policy substitution are beginning to overcome some of these problems in creative ways and examine a diversity of policies including military force, rivalry termination (Bennett and Nordstrom 2000), humanitarian aid (McGinnis 2000), and American intervention abroad (Regan 2000). However, many of these models may well suffer from the dual problems of strategic selection and misspecification Morrow (1989) described. If strategic concerns influence the set of policies from which leaders choose, theories and models of substitution should account for the strategic determinants of substitution. The next section constructs an argument joining strategy and substitution.         "
"16","What incentives do leaders have to substitute policies for one another? Why would a leader choose to use economic sanctions rather than military action if the state were in need of coercive foreign policy? One answer lies in the strategic arguments outlined above. If foreign states behave strategically, they have the capacity to shape the set of foreign policies a state might enact toward them. In more specific terms, a rogue state that believes it is about to be the target of military action might engage in conciliatory policy that makes the motivation of force against it more difficult; its opponent might have to resort to other types of coercive or punitive foreign policies instead. This section seeks to elucidate the argument that strategic processes shape policy substitutability by influencing the utility or availability of policy alternatives."
"17","Insofar as the (largely formal) research outlined above accurately represents how states interact strategically, the strategic and often indirect effects of variables like regime, relative capabilities, and domestic turmoil are critical to empirical models aimed at predicting dyadic conflict behavior. If none of these variables are related to strategic behavior and do not influence the amount of information states have about on another's payoffs for various foreign policies, then Morrow's (1989) concerns might be largely misplaced. Suppose that states have certain symmetric levels of information about each other which are invariant to regime (and signaling), power ratios, or domestic circumstances. In such a case, whether states enter crises and how they behave in crises is either random or at least is uncorrelated with beliefs or perceptions. Thus, neither the selection nor misspecification on which Morrow comments are problematic. Moreover, strategic behavior by one state would not significantly influence the set of policy options available to another state.            "
"18","Suppose on the other hand the formal arguments Morrow (1989), Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992), Fearon (1994), Bueno de Mesquita, Morrow, and Zorick (1997), Smith (1996, 1998), Schultz (1998, 2001) and others put forward are at least correct in that democracy, relative capabilities, and domestic circumstances shape how states perceive each others' intentions and evaluate each others' payoffs for various foreign policies. If these strategic arguments are correct, then Morrow's concerns over selection and misspecification are worth empirical attention. Moreover, if states seek indicators of their opponents' inclinations and then direct their own behaviors accordingly, strategic behavior is most probably unobserved yet influential with respect to observable dyadic outcomes. Further, one state might behave strategically with respect to another state and thereby influence the policy options from which that state can select. In this case, unobserved strategic behavior by state B influences foreign policy substitution by state A.            "
"19","It is not difficult to find anecdotal evidence of states' strategic efforts to influence their opponents' policy choices. Between December 2001 and June 2002, India and Pakistan were locked in an increasingly dangerous crisis over the disputed province of Kashmir. The crisis erupted after Muslim militants attacked the Indian parliament, and the Indian Prime Minister publicly blamed Pakistani militants who he claimed were allowed or even encouraged by the Pakistani government to target Indian interests. The crisis escalated during the spring of 2002 as militant incursions continued and as the two countries massed nearly a million troops along the Kashmir border, expelled each other's ambassadors, and spoke openly of war. In early June, India announced it would not use nuclear weapons first and accused Pakistan of “nuclear blackmail” for not making a similar pledge (Washington Post 2002). India's public pledge not to use nuclear weapons first has several implications. First, this is probably a pledge India would have a hard time recanting given the international audience to whom the pledge was made. Second, the pledge is a strategic attempt to force Pakistan to commit not to use nuclear weapons, thus reducing its military policy options by one. From an Indian point of view, so doing has the principle virtue of ensuring Indian conventional forces will only meet conventional resistance; Indian capabilities far exceed those of Pakistan, so such a commitment would be to India's advantage (Graham and Ricks 2002). Additionally, by making this pledge and pressing Pakistan to do the same, India stigmatizes Pakistan as the state that must decide the fate of the region; this pressure may make Pakistan's use of nuclear weapons even more difficult and thus limit Pakistan's policy options.            "
"20","If one state's behavior shapes the policy options an opponent can reasonably consider, the standard substitution model might be misspecified insofar as strategic action by B affects substitution by A. The India‐Pakistan crisis illustrates this very point; if we assume Pakistan's policy choices are independent of Indian behavior, we might misunderstand the extent to which interaction between the two states influences the viability of certain policy options. Substitution models typically consider some fixed set of policy options from which a policy maker selects and they examine variables that influence the policy choice. Substitution itself is unobservable; we do observe the use of policy A at one point in time and policy B at another, but the decision to substitute B for A and the process that produces this action are not observable. Likewise, the set of tractable policies is not directly observable; we can see that a leader has access to n policy options at time t, but we often cannot see whether policy i is one the leader can realistically implement. Substitution models in the literature treat this set of options as if it is fixed; all options are either always or are equally available. However, the policies the leader of state A, Pakistan, can realistically implement depend in part on the behavior of state B, India.            "
"21","The analysis below will focus on American foreign policy decision making, so we will begin to frame the discussion in the specific context of U.S. behavior. American presidents are oriented toward implementing foreign policies that jointly serve the national interest and their own electoral interests; as Smith (1998) puts it, they seek to implement foreign policies that suggest to the electorate they are competent foreign policy makers.4 Thus, international and domestic factors will influence the American president's foreign policy decisions. More specifically, presidential foreign policy choice depends not only on the characteristics of an opponent, but on the presence of an opponent. A model of U.S. foreign policy choice, then, should account for:            "
"22","                              "
"23","American domestic factors especially those related to a president's electoral concerns."
"24","International factors, particularly the characteristics of potential U.S. foreign policy targets."
"25","Factors related to the chances the United States has an available opponent."
"26","Constructing a model of foreign policy substitution and strategic interaction requires a design that accounts for state A's signals, state B's actions in response to those signals, and state A's ultimate policy choice. Such a model should account for these interactions in the context of American domestic variables, international variables, and the factors that determine whether the United States has an opponent. The focus of this analysis is exclusively on U.S. foreign policy behavior; the analysis includes all U.S. dyad years between 1949 and 1990 and examines the American decision to use force (Militarized Interstate Dispute data) or sanctions (Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott's (1990) sanctions data) in the face of foreign aggression. The dyadic interaction proceeds as follows. A foreign state, depending on its own characteristics and U.S. domestic conditions, decides whether or not to target the U.S. militarily. Should it decide to commence a dispute with the United States, the United States faces a decision about its response. The American president chooses among three alternatives: no coercive response; impose economic sanctions; use military force. This process can be represented formally as:               "
"27","In the structural equations above, State B observes American conditions and determines whether or not to target the United States. The decision to target the United States means the United States is the principle target in a Militarized Interstate Dispute. The U.S. response variables are simply dummy variables indicating U.S. sanctions and U.S. uses of force.5"
"28","What specific factors shape these decisions? State B observes American political and economic factors which inform it regarding the political health of the American president. American unemployment and presidential approval levels suggest the president's electoral viability and his inclination to seek diversionary targets. Leeds and Davis (1997) provide evidence that democracies are more likely to be targeted when they have good domestic conditions, less likely in poor domestic circumstances. Likewise, we anticipate that as economic and political conditions deteriorate in the United States, foreign states will be less likely to target the United States and invite a coercive response that serves the political needs of a troubled president. We measure unemployment as the percent unemployed using data from the Federal Reserve Bank, and we measure presidential approval using responses from the Gallup Poll. We use these jointly to capture the political health and thus the political motivations of the U.S. president; we include them both in the “target equation” and then unemployment in the sanctions equation and approval in the “force” equation for identification purposes.6"
"29","                                    "
"30"," H1: High levels of unemployment (low levels of approval) will decrease the probability the United States is targeted.                      "
"31","However, when the United States is targeted, higher levels of unemployment or lower approval levels lead a U.S. president to respond to foreign aggression with higher levels of coercion, effectively taking advantage of the diversionary opportunity provided him by virtue of being the target of military aggression."
"32","                                    "
"33"," H2: When the United States is targeted, unemployment will be positively associated (approval, negatively associated) with the implementation of sanctions and with the use of force abroad.                      "
"34","This is consistent with Miller's (1999) findings that disputes provide opportunities for executives to escalate under conditions that make diversionary foreign policy desirable. American conditions provide information to potential opponents regarding the extent to which the American president is constrained or distracted and the extent to which foreign aggression will produce resolved, coercive responses. Thus, presidential foreign policy decisions rest partially on the conditions that precipitate foreign aggression in the first place. Presidents substitute different levels of coercion depending on the nature of domestic conditions. Likewise, the opportunities for presidents to pursue coercive foreign policies depend on how foreign state interpret and react to American domestic conditions.               "
"35","American domestic circumstances signal would‐be aggressors, but do so in the context of institutions and information shaped by the relationship between state B and the United States and by state B's own particular attributes. Democracy and capabilities play principle roles in shaping how states interact and in determining the informational environment in which they make decisions. Consistent with the claims of the democratic peace research program, foreign democracies will be less likely to target the United States insofar as democratic institutions and norms constrain them from doing so, and insofar as they strategically recognize that, should a dispute with the United States escalate, neither side might easily back down."
"36","                                    "
"37"," H3: Democratic states will be less likely to target the United States than will autocratic states.                      "
"38","Democracies, however, will on occasion target the United States, and when they do so, the United States will implement less coercive policies than it would were it targeted by an autocratic state.7 The United States has strategic incentives not to escalate disputes with other democratic states since backing down becomes increasingly difficult in public crises. Moreover, a pair of democracies is likely to seek nonviolent (and therefore less coercive) solutions to disputes and thus not to experience escalation.               "
"39","                                    "
"40"," H4: When foreign democracies do target the United States, the United States will be less likely to use force or sanctions than when targeted by an autocrat.                      "
"41","Democracy will reduce the occurrence of conflict and the level of coercion the United States employs; the regime characteristics of state B serve to shape the acceptable foreign policies the U.S. president can consider implementing, thus encouraging foreign policy substitution. Put differently, foreign democracies encourage less coercive responses to aggression; foreign autocrats encourage American presidents to substitute more coercive policies in response to aggression. So by imposing costs for coercive foreign policies, joint democracy both discourage violent conflict and encourages democratic states to seek policies to substitute in their stead. This expectation is consistent with the democratic peace expectations about disputes and escalation to war, but it is broader as well because it anticipates behavior beyond the dichotomous conflict‐no conflict divide on which most democratic peace research focuses. These hypotheses bear explicitly on the costs of implementing coercive foreign policies against different regimes and anticipate that the costs associated with coercive policies toward fellow democracies will produce substitution away from coercion."
"42","Capabilities also influence both state B's willingness to target the United States and the American response. Stronger foreign powers are likely to be more inclined to use force against the United States than are weaker states.8 More powerful foreign states have physical capacities to make demands of the United States and potentially, to be strong enough to deter U.S. resistance. While most states cannot really match American military might during the Cold War period, some states may be sufficiently strong to discourage a U.S. military response that a U.S. president believes might be costly and/or lengthy. Moreover, the willingness of a foreign state to target the United States may well reveal information regarding its resolve insofar as the stronger United States could respond aggressively.               "
"43","                                    "
"44"," H5: Stronger states are more likely to target the United States than are weaker states.                      "
"45","However, stronger opponents may pose more significant threats and thus encourage a strong American response. Further, as the dyad approaches parity, the importance of unobserved factors (like resolve) increases as does uncertainty over the outcome of a dispute. The possibility state B can prevail not only should encourage strong Bs to target the United States (ceteris paribus), but should encourage the United States to resort to more coercive responses, to respond militarily."
"46","                                    "
"47"," H6: When strong states do target the United States, the United States is more likely use force or implement sanctions than when targeted by weak states.                      "
"48","Finally, we must consider the effect of targeting the United States on the level of coercion the United States employs in response. At first glance, it might appear as if the United States would take more coercive action when targeted than when it is not—this very relationship would make sense if we assume states do not behave strategically when they make foreign policy. If that were the case, states would make the decision to target the United States without regard for the likely U.S. response. Further, factors like U.S. unemployment would have little (or no) bearing on the likelihood of foreign aggression against the United States (contrary to the claims of Smith 1996, 1998; Leeds and Davis 1997; and Clark 2003).9 If, on the other hand, states do behave strategically as these (and other) authors have suggested, then foreign states will most probably target the United States when they expect the U.S. response to be least vigorous, and this might occur for any of a variety of reasons. First, as hypothesized above, if the United States is distracted by internal strife, its response to foreign aggression might be less coercive and immediate than otherwise. Second, if the United States enjoys prosperity and the U.S. president has little need for diversionary foreign policy, the U.S. response to being targeted might be diminished. Third, foreign states may seek to pressure U.S. decision making on issues important to those foreign states, but not sufficiently important for the United States to pursue heavily coercive responses. Prima facie evidence of this might be the large number of cases in which the United States is targeted and does not respond militarily (the dispute is not reciprocated). In any case, strategically inclined foreign states will pursue aggressive tactics against the United States when they expect the least resistance. Yet, it is not clear their strategic efforts will be sufficient to dissuade coercive American responses altogether, but strategic behavior should influence U.S. action; thus,               "
"49","                                    "
"50"," H7: The probability of U.S. sanctions or force will change when the United States is the target of military aggression.                      "
"51","This hypothesis is, to some extent, a cumulative test of the general claim that states make foreign policy decisions strategically with respect to their potential opponents' circumstances."
"52","Additionally, in the sanctions and force equations we control for the log of dyadic trade between the United States and state B since the value of dyadic trade may influence U.S. decision making regarding both conflict and sanctions. We also control for distance between the United States and its potential opponent (log of distance) and for whether U.S. government is controlled by a single party (unified) or not (divided).10"
"53","With only a few exceptions, studies of foreign policy substitution treat policy options as discrete and independent choices. Plainly stated, if a leader chooses among foreign policy actions such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and militarized force, the leader is assumed to choose one of the three.11 However, it is more realistic to expect leaders to select a “mix” of these policies. To meet his needs a leader may choose none, one, more than one, or all of the foreign policy actions. We model this dynamic with a multivariate probit model. In our particular case, we estimate the three simultaneous equations enumerated above as fully observed probit equations with correlated error terms distributed trivariate normal.            "
"54","The multivariate modeling approach relaxes three assumptions other techniques impose on substitution questions, and thus offers three important improvements over the usual multinomial model of foreign policy substitution. First, the technique enables us to model leaders' decisions to take more than one foreign policy action simultaneously. Since the outcomes are treated as three binary variables (rather than a single, categorical variable) any combination of outcomes is possible. Put another way, policies might be implemented as complements rather than as pure substitutes for one another since we can observe cases where the United States implements both sanctions and the use of force at the same time. Most previous studies of foreign policy substitution neglect this possibility and as a result may yield inconsistent results. Thus, the multivariate technique relaxes the assumption that the outcomes are strict substitutes rather than complements. Suppose k possible policy outcomes; the multivariate probit approach allows us to estimate k− 1 equations simulataneously, and all k− 1 dependent variables may equal one at the same time, formally indicating the choice of more than one policy. A subsidiary advantage of this structure is that the specification of the equations can vary across outcomes (again, unlike the usual multinomial model). Second, we are able to place some structure on the correlation between the unobservable factors related to different foreign policy choices. The model explicitly estimates these correlations among the disturbances instead of assuming them to be zero or constant. This also provides a way to gauge the extent to which outcomes are substitutes for one another (Alvarez and Nagler 1998). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we are able to explicitly model the endogenous relationship among foreign policy actions instead of assuming exogeneity. Since the use of force against the United States will certainly affect the policy with which the United States responds, we believe it is crucial to use a model equipped to address the endogeneity issue formally.            "
"55","To identify the model, the variances of the unobservables are standardized to unity such that               "
"56"," Table 1 presents estimates of the multivariate model, testing the hypotheses on strategy and substitution presented above. The results provide evidence that strategic behavior influences U.S. policy choice, encouraging American presidents to substitute policies for one another or to use foreign policies in complementary ways. Table 1 reports the probability the United States is targeted, the probability the United States implements sanctions, and the probability the United States uses force abroad. The two models differ in the inclusion of the endogenous variable (United States Targeted) in the second model. This difference between the models produces the most interesting finding; being targeted militarily has a substantial direct effect on the likelihood of American use of force abroad. The coefficient is positive indicating that being attacked increases the likelihood the United States responds. However, the total effect of “United States Targeted” requires the combination of the direct effect coefficient and the indirect effect of the variables in the “United States Targeted” equation. We interpret these total effects in more detail below. The significance of the endogenous variable, however, supports the contention that U.S. policy is not fully determined from within, nor is it strictly a function of the characteristics either of the United States or its potential opponents. Rather, how those opponents behave and the sources of that behavior shapes U.S. policy and leads to tradeoffs among foreign policy options.         "
"57","Also, note that the correlations among the equations are statistically significant in both models. Because ρ measures the correlation among the error terms in the three equations, it is really indicating the extent to which the unmeasured factors in each equation are correlated; so the estimates of ρ indicate the effect of those unmeasured factors before we include the endogenous variable (Model 1) and after we account for the endogenous variable (Model 2). In the second model, the estimates of ρ are substantively smaller than the estimates from Model 1, especially the estimate for ρ1,3 between the Target and Use of Force equations. Our conclusions on this point are that the endogenous variable model (Model 2) is better specified than Model 1 and that extant models of substitution that ignore endogeneity may suffer from underspecification. Moreover, the statistical and substantive significance of the endogenous variable provide circumstantial evidence that the process leading states to target the United States and U.S. responses are correlated. Such a finding is evidence that the outcomes (for example, sanctions and force) are substitutes for or complements to one another (e.g., Alvarez and Nagler 1998).         "
"58","Further, the significant correlations indicate the equations omit relevant, probably unobserved, variables; we suspect they omit factors that link strategic behavior to policy choice. Important among these are the costs states incur for different foreign policies. Our models seek to account for part of this environment by including indicators of regime and capabilities, but indicators of costs themselves are not readily attainable. The positive correlation between the “Force” and “Sanctions” equations indicates that unobserved variables increase the chances policy makers implement both sanctions and force; this is evidence sanctions and force are implemented as complements rather than strictly as substitutes.13 In addition, the fact that variables like democracy and capabilities exert similar effects on both sanctions and uses of force suggests the complementary way in which U.S. leaders implement them. Foreign democracies and weaker states are less likely to face either sanctions or force; foreign autocrats and stronger states are more likely to face both. In evaluating policy options, U.S. policy makers appear to minimize the costs of the policies they implement by mixing those policies rather than by strictly choosing one or another. The model therefore reveals evidence sanctions and force are related under the general “substitutability” rubric, but are specifically implemented as complements to one another.         "
"59","Turning to the substance of the results, unemployment and approval appear not to shape the strategic process the model represents. This runs counter to many findings in the literature that assert specific relationships between indicators of political health and foreign policy choice. We believe this is a result of the structure of the model. Because the model accounts simultaneously for the sources of targeting and responses, it incorporates foreign states' beliefs about each other which arise in part from the domestic circumstances in the United States. Those unobserved beliefs (in the errors) are correlated across equations and thus probably obviate the direct effects of observable variables indicating U.S. circumstances like unemployment and approval. While factors such as these probably shape foreign states beliefs about the United States, these factors do not appear to have the direct effects on United States."
"60","Statistically, the strongest results in the model are those pertaining to democracy and capabilities. Democratic states are less likely to target the United States; when they do, they are less likely to face sanctions or force than are autocratic aggressors who are likely to face both. Our findings on democracy are broadly consistent with democratic peace assertions, but also suggest that the United States must search for less coercive foreign policies to respond to foreign democratic states than in response to foreign autocracies. Strictly conceiving of foreign policy choice as “force” or “no force” (as many studies do) leaves unanswered the question of what policies democracies substitute for force abroad when force is too costly an option, as it is likely to be in democratic dyads."
"61","With respect to capabilities, stronger foreign states are more likely to target the United States and meet greater resistance when they do so; presidents substitute military and economic responses for other responses when facing strong opponents. The effects of democracy and capabilities suggest the magnifying effect of the endogenous variable. The endogenous variable in the model, whether the United States is targeted militarily, exerts a substantial effect on the probability the United States responds with military force. This finding is notable at least in part because the effects of such factors are rarely treated as if they have anything other than direct effects. Instead, the effects of democracy and capabilities are both magnified by the endogenous variable, or by the interaction between the foreign state and the United States. Figure 1 illustrates these effects.14"

"63"," Note: In each panel, upper lines represent the effect of x on force or sanctions when the endogenous variable (United States Targeted) equals one; lower lines (when visibly greater than zero) indicate the effect of x when the endogenous variable is off. Line lengths represent confidence intervals around the estimates.                     "
"64","The four panels in Figure 1 represent the effects of capabilities (in [a] and [b]) and democracy (in [c] and [d]) depending on whether the United States is targeted or not (i.e., whether the endogenous variable is on or off). These (and subsequent) figures are aimed at illustrating three things. First, we need to interpret the substantive effects of variables in the model (since the coefficients themselves are not directly interpretable). Second, the figures illustrate uncertainty around the estimates in the form of confidence intervals. Third, and most important, the figures allow us to assess the importance of the endogenous variable, being targeted militarily. The upper bars in each panel represent the effect of capabilities or democracy when the United States is targeted (when the endogenous variable is on) and the lower bars (sometimes not even visible) indicate those same effects when the United States is not targeted. The lengths of the bars represent confidence intervals around the predictions. In panels [a] and [b], stronger states are more likely to face either U.S. force or sanctions, especially if they target the United States militarily. More democratic states (panels [c] and [d]) are less likely to face U.S. force or sanctions, even if they target the United States, an act democratic states undertake less frequently than do autocrats. The effects of capabilities and democracy on sanctions is virtually absent when the endogenous variable is off (when the foreign state does not attack the United States); their effects on force are quite small, but visible under the same circumstance.         "
"65","These figures illustrate the importance of the endogenous variable, the relevance of strategic responses in modeling international politics. U.S. military action in response to military aggression become a near certainty as foreign capabilities rise. However, in the absence of such direct provocation, the tendency of the United States to resort to arms is far less certain. Such a finding not only suggests the importance of treating the strategic choice to target the United States as an endogenous part of the U.S. foreign policy‐making process, but it is also consistent at least with Jentleson's (1992) argument the public is “pretty prudent.” Troubled American presidents find military action more difficult to motivate without provocation, especially given the risk that a prudent public might suspect the president's political motivation. This is also consistent with arguments that the opportunity to use force abroad is not constant (e.g., Clark 2003; Meernik 1994). However, once presidents have justification, they are more than willing to respond to force in kind.         "
"66","Another way to evaluate model fit in general and the importance of the endogenous variable in particular is to examine successful predictions both with and without the endogenous variable. The ROC curves in Figure 2 allow us to do just this.15"

"68"," Note: Receiver operating characteristic curves; solid line indicates endogenous variable (United States Targeted) equals one; dashed line indicates endogenous variable equals zero; diagonal line is reference.                     "
"69","The panels in Figure 2 represent the percent of correct predictions for force and its absence (in panel [a]) and sanctions and their absence (in panel [b]). The diagonal lines in each panel indicate guesses based on the random draws, were it the case we had no model on which to base better guesses of whether to expect force or sanctions. On these diagonals in the middle of the panels, the chances of predicting either a zero or a one correctly is 0.5. The other two lines represent the proportion of correctly predicted zeros and ones without the endogenous variable (the dotted lines) and with the endogenous variable (the solid lines). Generally speaking, the further we move toward the upper‐right quadrant of the graph, the larger the proportion of zeros and ones the model is predicting correctly; at the extreme, the upper‐right corner represents the case where all the zeros and all the ones are correctly predicted. In both of the panels in Figure 2, the ROC curves extend above the diagonal, so the models not surprisingly outperform random guesses. In the case of U.S. uses of force in panel [a], the model with the endogenous variable predicts higher percentages of the cases correctly than does the model without the endogenous variable. This is true up to the extreme values on the x‐axis. With respect to sanctions in panel [b], the models with and without the endogenous variable are virtually indistinguishable from one another.         "
"70","The results as a whole suggest strategic factors are important determinants of leaders' policy choices. Strategic behavior appears to shape what policy responses are reasonable and thereby to push American presidents to substitute differently coercive policies. This model departs from most treatments of substitution by considering strategic factors and by incorporating strategic arguments about state behavior into the argument that leaders choose different policies in response to apparently similar stimuli. At its heart, the theoretical connection between strategy and substitution is straightforward. Because foreign states act strategically, the set of policies U.S. presidents (or leaders more generally) can consider is partially determined abroad: strategic behavior leads to policy substitution."
"71","We set out to answer a straightforward question: how does the strategic behavior of foreign states shape U.S. policy choice? It appears as if foreign strategic behavior does indeed condition American foreign policy behavior, leading American policy makers to choose among different levels of coercion. While conceptually simple, this is an important step forward in the empirical analysis of foreign policy substitutability because it suggests substitution does not derive exclusively from domestic constraints or mandates. Instead, one important impetus to substitute foreign policies is the behavior of the foreign states toward whom those foreign policies are to be aimed. Put another way, strategic forces are endogenous to the process of foreign policy substitution. Insofar as states behave in nonmyopic, strategic ways, it is only sensible to expect strategic interaction to shape policy choice. Our findings suggest future work might fruitfully pursue more detailed models of the explicit mechanisms by which one state's behavior shapes another state's policy choices and leads it to engage in foreign policy substitution. Moreover, the notion that actors interact in these strategic ways implies their behaviors are endogenous to one another and that endogeneity is a key to modeling strategic behavior and substitution."
"72","Our goals were not only to examine how strategic behavior affects foreign policy substitutability, but to produce a less restrictive econometric model than those typically employed in analyses of substitution. Toward that end, we argued the multivariate probit model would simultaneously provide three advantages. First, the model allows for the possibility that foreign policies are complements rather than strict substitutes. Second, it allows us to model the strategic sources of substitution as endogenous to the policy outcomes we observe. Third, it relaxes the assumption the policy outcomes are uncorrelated (relaxing the IIA assumption). The substantive results of the analysis suggest all three of these attributes of the model are advantageous. First, and most obviously, the endogenous variable improves the fit of the model and serves to reduce the correlation among the error terms of the individual equations. Reducing those correlations is indicative of more a fully specified model, suggesting that modeling the endogeneity of strategic effects is an empirically useful enterprise; our strategic approach suggests it is also theoretically useful. Second, the correlation among the disturbances suggests these processes do not necessarily produce independent policy choices, so were we to estimate a model relying on IIA, we probably would violate the assumption. That the disturbances are correlated also suggests these outcomes are substitutes or complements. The endogenous variable helps model the nonindependence among these policy outcomes and thus, in the second model, reduces the correlations. Finally, as the predictions indicate, the probability of sanction and force can both increase or decline, suggesting the possibility an American president may not consider these policy options strictly as substitutes, but may employ them as complements. These attributes of the econometric model are useful both to the construction of better estimates of foreign policy substitution and to tests of theories that suggest states interact strategically."
"73","Thinking more broadly about the idea of substitution leads us to wonder at the extent to which the metaphor might be usefully applied in other areas of political science. In a general sense, any utility theory is not only about individual choice, but about choice relative to opportunity cost, and thus is about either substituting one alternative for another or complementing one alternative with another. This is especially true where individuals expend scarce resources (just as consumers do) when they choose alternatives. Political candidates make choices about campaign strategy in such an environment where costs and finite resources lead them to choose alternatives either in place of others or in addition to others. For example, political candidates must choose regions of the country to aggressively campaign. In regions that the candidate does not visit in person it makes sense to ask questions such as how much television time might serve as a substitute for an in person visit to a specific region. In making this choice the candidate surely assesses the extent to which visits and television time are substitutes and also considers the strategic implications of such choices. Not only does the theoretical framework of substitution provide a useful way to conceptualize those choices, but the multivariate probit approach is a flexible and unrestrictive model appropriate for such a question. With respect to foreign policy choice, the model is sufficiently flexible to represent the theoretical possibility long recognized in the literature that foreign policies might be implemented in complementary rather than mutually exclusive ways. So in this manner, the model allows and in fact demands an expansion of how theories of foreign policy substitutability conceptualize the process of foreign policy choice."
