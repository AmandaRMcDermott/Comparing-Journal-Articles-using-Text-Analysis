"1","Three strains of existing research—candidate emergence, progressive ambition, and race and politics—offer a potential framework for understanding why so few African American House members become Senate candidates. Although existing research offers empirical findings on candidate pools, when candidates are likely to pursue higher office, and how voters will respond, the literature is inconclusive with respect to our research question. More specifically, it is unclear how race influences a House member's decision calculus regarding Senate candidacy."
"2","Candidate emergence studies argue that candidacy is biased in favor of overrepresented socioeconomic characteristics (Czudnowski 1972; Matthews 1954) and that potential candidates and candidate recruiters make decisions based on the experiences of those who have been successful previously, perpetuating the presence of the overrepresented (Kazee 1994; Stone and Maisel 2003). In particular, House members are one of the more overrepresented groups in the Senate; since 1964, 36% of senators came directly from the House.5"
"3","Yet solely looking at the number of senators who had immediate prior service in the House can be deceptive because the overwhelming majority of House members choose not to run for the Senate. Table 1 provides information concerning the frequency with which House members become Senate candidates. Only 9% of all House members between 1992 and 2008 ran for a Senate nomination at any point during their House careers, and African American House members are less than half as likely to run for the Senate as their nonblack counterparts. In reality, members use the House as a stepping stone to the Senate far less than candidate emergence research would suggest.         "
"4","Scholarship on political ambition contends that potential candidates consider the collective historical experiences of candidates when deciding whether to run for office (Canon 1990; Canon and Sousa 1992). Belonging to a group that is typically excluded from successful candidacy may decrease one's likelihood to run for office (Fox and Lawless 2005a). Because so few African American House members have run for the Senate and none have won, the historical record may discourage black members from entering the Senate candidate pool when compared to House members of other races.         "
"5","Political ambition theory also recognizes that political careers depend on the structural conditions which discourage some politicians to move through the system and encourage others (Black 1972; Eulau 1962). Politicians are conscious of opportunities for upward mobility (Hall and van Houweling 1995) and exhibit progressive ambition as they pursue offices perceived to be more important than the ones they currently hold (Schlesinger 1966). Strategic politicians’ assessments of the costs and benefits associated with seeking higher office help determine who runs and who does not (e.g., Brace 1984; Copeland 1989; Francis 1993; Kiewiet and Zeng 1993; Maisel and Stone 1997; Rohde 1979). The fact that many House members hold safe seats may limit members’ progressive ambition.6"
"6","Although some have found the elements of candidacy decision calculus to be the same regardless of race (Canon, Shousen, and Sellers 1996), others have found that African American politicians are significantly less likely to run for office (Fox and Lawless 2005b). This suggests that while the elements of candidacy decision making may not change, the weight of these elements may vary with race. Even if, in balancing the probability of winning against the risks of running (Black 1972; Jacobson and Kernell 1981), one assumes both black and nonblack House members face the same risks, the members’ decisions will differ if these groups do not have equivalent chances of winning a Senate seat. Voter response to candidate race affects candidates’ strategic considerations, and race and politics scholarship has produced conflicting findings on how white voters respond to black candidates (e.g., compare Highton 2004; Sigelman et al. 1995; Terkildsen 1993; Washington 2006).7"
"7","Given these mixed empirical findings, African American candidates may be uncertain regarding their chances for electoral success. When asked about winning statewide office, former Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder, one of only two elected African American governors since Reconstruction, stated, “It is not only important for the black candidate to be as qualified as his white counterpart, but, as older generation blacks like to say, in most cases, you have to be twice as good as your white competitor if you hope to stand a chance” (Jeffries 1999, 585). If this perception persists, even though African Americans have already demonstrated an ability to win election to the House, they may be less willing to run for the Senate than white House members.8"
"8","In summary, the research on candidate emergence, progressive ambition, and race and politics offers at best contradictory findings related to our empirical question. Given this uncertainty in the literature, we seek to provide more definitive answers as to why so few African American House members become Senate candidates."
"9","We theorize that the decision of a House member to seek a Senate nomination is a function of member and constituency demographics and contextual variables."
"10","The bivariate data in Table 1 show black House members are less than half as likely as nonblacks to run for the Senate. We should expect black House members to be less likely to pursue Senate seats than their nonblack counterparts when black members (and the political actors who encourage them to run) perceive their chances of success to be lower than white members. Similarly, women generally may be less likely to consider running (Fox and Lawless 2005a),9 even if quality male and female candidates have relatively equal probabilities of being elected (Burrell 1992; Darcy, Welch, and Clark 1994). As such, we hypothesize that female House members will be less likely to seek Senate nominations.10"
"11","Campaign finance, state size, and ideology should each affect House members’ decisions to run for the Senate and may have contextual linkages to race. We expect that House members who have a strong record of raising campaign funds will be more likely to run for the Senate. Not only may these members be better positioned to run, but they should also find it easier to attract additional financial support; early money may act as a signal of candidate viability. The ability to finance a campaign should be particularly relevant for African American House members contemplating a run for the Senate, as black members may raise less campaign funds than white House members (Swain 1997).11 We use campaign receipts from the previous House election as an indicator of a House member's ability to raise funds.            "
"12","Like campaign finance, state size should be linked contextually to the decision of African American House members to run for the Senate. We expect House members from larger population states to be less likely to seek a Senate nomination (Canon 1990; Rohde 1979). Large population states not only have a greater number of House members who could compete for a Senate seat, but these states also may have bigger pools of quality candidates. Furthermore, large state districts include a smaller percentage of the state's population than small state districts, likely leading to lower overall statewide familiarity (see Lee and Oppenheimer 1999). Finally, because Senate races in larger states are more expensive, the initial funds that a House member raises from his or her constituents are likely to be insufficient to finance a campaign. State size may be particularly relevant for African American House members—the 19 least populous states (as measured by the 2000 Census) have not elected an African American to the House of Representatives since the end of Reconstruction. We include the number of House districts in the member's state as an indicator of state population in our model.            "
"13","We have less clear expectations about the role of ideology in the decision of a House member to seek a Senate nomination. African Americans tend to be more liberal than white House members (Gerber 1996). Because primary voters typically are more ideologically extreme than general election voters (Aldrich and Rohde 2001), a more extreme House member may be more likely to run in a Senate primary. However, a more extreme House member might also judge her ideology and voting record as too extreme to win a statewide general election. Because we are interested in the effect of ideological extremity on the decision of a House member to seek a Senate nomination, we use the absolute value of first‐dimension DW‐Nominate scores (Poole and Rosenthal 1997).            "
"14","We control for several other variables that we expect correlate with the decision to run. We anticipate nonlinear relationships between the decision to run and both seat security and House seniority. A House member who easily wins his House race may feel confident enough to make a run for the Senate, but as that margin grows, he may be less willing to relinquish his seat (Carson 2005; Jacobson and Kernell 1981). Similarly, the probability a House member seeks a Senate nomination should increase with seniority until the point where the value of privileges associated with seniority, like committee and party leadership positions, will decrease his or her probability of running. To measure security and seniority, we use the number of terms served and the general election vote percentage from previous House elections for each representative in our model. Finally, we expect the presence of an incumbent to suppress House member decisions to run for the Senate (Carson 2005; Erickson and Wright 2009; Jacobson and Kernell 1981) and that House members should be even less likely to challenge a Senate incumbent of their own party.12"
"15","Our central investigation concerns the decision of House members, particularly black House members, to run for the Senate. We collected an original dataset that includes all House members in the 102nd through the 110th Congresses.13 In this dataset, which we refer to as the “House Member‐Congress” dataset, we included a separate observation for each congressional term in which a member served. For example, the dataset includes a House member who served in the 103rd through 106th Congresses as four individual observations—one for each term he or she served. Arranging the data in this manner allows us to evaluate every opportunity an individual House member has to run for the Senate.14"
"16","For each observation, we collected information regarding member and state demographics (race, gender, ideology, number of districts in state) and the member's House career (seniority, general election vote share, campaign receipts). We obtained most of these data from CQ Press's Politics in America Series. For campaign receipts not found in the Politics in America Series, we used campaign fund data from the Federal Election Commission (www.fec.gov).15"
"17","We removed House members elected between 1992 and 2006 who did not complete their House terms. Noncompletion of a House term obviously eliminates an individual's opportunity to run for the Senate while serving as a member of the House of Representatives.16 We removed those members disqualified for Senate candidacy because they were younger than 30 years old. Finally, we removed House member observations where no Senate seat was contested in the upcoming election, which left us with 2,617 observations. The dependent variable in our analysis is whether a House member decided to run for an upcoming Senate election.17 Because the dependent variable is dichotomous, we first estimate our model using a logit analysis.18 Later, we employ mediation analysis to support a more refined estimate of the causal pattern between House member race and the probability of running for the Senate.         "
"18","We present the estimates of our logit model in Table 2.19 Overall, the model provides some insightful results regarding the link between race, our contextual variables, and the progressive ambition of House members.         "
"19","Race and gender perform in the expected direction, but neither variable has a statistically significant influence on the decision of a House member to seek a Senate nomination. According to these results, a black or female House member is no more or less likely to seek a Senate nomination than a white or male member, respectively. However, this does not necessarily mean member demographics fail to play a role in the decision to run. As our discussion of contextual factors explains, race may be linked to campaign finance, state size, and ideology."
"20","A House member's ability to raise substantial campaign funds plays an important role in his or her decision to run for the Senate. An increase in the amount of campaign funds raised (from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above the mean) leads to a 111% increase in the probability that a House member will seek a Senate nomination (see Table 3). This relationship suggests that a member's record of raising substantial funds may indicate electoral viability and the ability to mount a competitive Senate campaign.            "
"21","The effects of campaign funds have potential implications for the role of race in the decision to run. Because black House members tend to represent economically poorer districts than their nonblack counterparts, black House members may face greater difficulty in raising the early money needed for a Senate run. In the 110th Congress, districts represented by black members had a median household income of almost 20% less than those districts represented by nonblacks.20 As Table 4 indicates, during the period spanning from the 102nd to the 110th Congresses, African American House members raised an average of nearly $300,000 less than their nonblack counterparts.21 If black House members have greater difficulty in raising district‐based financial support, they (and others—party officials, activists, etc.) may perceive their chances of winning a Senate seat to be lower than nonblack House members. In this way, a House member's race and the ability to raise money from one's district may be linked contextually.22"
"22","The size of the state a House member represents is also an important predictor of whether that member runs for the Senate. According to our results, members from smaller states are more likely to run for a Senate nomination than House members from states with more congressional districts. The probability a House member representing a state one standard deviation above the mean runs for a Senate nomination is 57% lower than that of a House member who serves in a state one standard deviation below the mean (see Table 3).            "
"23","Like campaign finance, state size may be linked contextually to race. Just as there is a relationship between state size and African American population (Lee and Oppenheimer 1999), there is a relationship between state size and the likelihood that a state has an African American House member. As seen in Table 4, black House members represent states with a mean of 20.80 congressional districts, compared to a mean of 18.62 for nonblack House members. The substantive significance of the difference between these two means is quite large, and the distribution of African American House members across the states likely constrains the opportunities of black House members to run for the Senate more than it does for nonblack House members.23"
"24","Like campaign finance and state size, ideological extremity not only affects a House member's decision to run for the Senate but also is linked contextually to race. Our model indicates that moderate House members are more likely to seek a Senate nomination, and, conversely, members with more extreme DW‐Nominate scores are less likely to run (statistically significant at the .10 level). When we examine the mean scores for black and nonblack House members, we find that black House members’ scores are more extreme, averaging .116 higher in absolute value than nonblacks (see Table 4). This fits with the conventional wisdom that most African American House members are among the more liberal members of that chamber.            "
"25","Voters, candidates, and recruiters may perceive African American House members to be more extreme. When asked why so few black House members seek a seat in the Senate, at least one leading African American former House member gave as his first explanation that black House members were too liberal. Yet, of the three African American members in our dataset who have run, two had less extreme DW‐Nominate scores than their party medians.24 This suggests not only that ideology does factor into the decision to run but also that only a proportion of black members may consider themselves viable candidates for the Senate—those with more moderate voting records.            "
"26","Voting records may also reflect district constituent preferences. Districts represented by African American members regularly give Democratic presidential candidates high vote percentages, reflecting an overall liberal district lean. The mean Democratic presidential vote share in districts represented by black House members is 76%, whereas the mean Democratic vote share in districts represented by nonblacks is 50%—a statistically and substantively significant difference.25 Thus, a black House member may have to support liberal issue positions and vote consistently with the preference of liberal groups in Washington in order to win Democratic House primaries and maintain electoral support.26 Put another way, the constituency contexts in which black House members win seats may lead to the selection of black members who are less favorably positioned strategically to run for the Senate, an office selected by a more moderate statewide electorate. The political career of Barack Obama speaks to this point in some respects. Although unsuccessful in winning a House primary against Bobby Rush, a very liberal incumbent, Obama proved capable of attracting sufficient support of moderate voters to win a Senate primary and general election four years later, something Rush would have been incapable of achieving.            "
"27","Our control variables generally perform as expected. House seniority has the expected curvilinear effect on the decision to run. As seen in Table 3, the predicted probability that a House member will seek a nomination increases as the member's seniority increases to five terms, but beyond that seniority exerts a negative influence on the decision to seek nomination. While House seat security has no independent effect on the decision to run, the presence of an incumbent and an incumbent of the same party both decrease the probability that a House member will decide to seek a Senate nomination. When there is an incumbent in a Senate race, the probability that a House member will seek a Senate nomination decreases by almost 80%. When the Senate incumbent is of the same party, the probability a House member runs for a Senate nomination decreases by nearly 50%. The fact that approximately 80% of the upcoming Senate elections in our dataset involve an incumbent may partially explain why the proportion of House members who run for the Senate is so low overall.            "
"28","In summary, our results indicate that both statistically and substantively, race alone does not explain the lower rates at which African American House members run for the Senate. Yet conclusions that race does not play a role in members’ decision to run for Senate would be hasty; several of the variables related to this decision are contextually linked to race. The context in which African American House members serve Congress, representing large population states and poorer, more liberal constituencies, would seem to affect members’ strategic calculations regarding the efficacy of running for the Senate and reduce the percentage of members who opt to do so. To pursue further these linkages, we employ mediation analysis to uncover the nature of the causal mechanisms that link race to the decision of a House member to run for the Senate."
"29","Mediation analysis seeks to explain the causal relationship between an independent variable, a proposed mediator variable, and a dependent variable. In a mediated relationship, the independent variable indirectly influences the dependent variable through the proposed mediator (Mackinnon, Fairchild, and Fritz 2007). With respect to the contextual variables discussed in the previous section, we propose that campaign funds (M1), state size (M2), and ideological extremity (M3) each act as mediators in the relationship between race (Xr) and the decision to seek a Senate nomination (Y). We conduct our mediation analyses using three methods—the causal steps method (Baron and Kenny 1986; Judd and Kenny 1981), a Sobel test (Sobel 1986), and mediation analysis using nonparametric bootstrap sampling (Imai et al. 2010).27"
"30","We use linear probabilities models to conduct a causal step analysis and a Sobel test for each mediator individually.28Table 5 contains the results of each step in our causal step analysis. First, we show in Model A that there is a statistically significant relationship between race and the decision to seek a Senate nomination. Black House members are less likely to seek a Senate nomination than nonblack House members (statistically significant at the .10 level). In the second step of the causal steps method (Models B1, B2, and B3), we illustrate that race has a statistically significant effect on all three of our proposed mediators. The results from this step show that black House members raise fewer campaign funds, black House members are more likely to serve in larger states, and black House members are more ideologically extreme than nonblack members.            "
"31","The third step in the causal method, Models C1, C2, and C3, demonstrates that all three mediators significantly predict the decision to seek a Senate nomination while controlling for the presence of race. Similar to the results in our logit analysis, these models show that House members who raise more campaign funds are more likely to seek a Senate nomination, members from larger states are less likely to seek a Senate nomination, and members who are more ideologically extreme are less likely to seek a Senate nomination. Race no longer has a statistically significant effect on the decision of House members to seek a Senate nomination in any of the models.            "
"32","In the final step of the causal step method, we compare coefficients of race in Model A to the coefficient for race in Models C1, C2, and C3 to determine if the effect of race is less than the effect of race in Model A. Indeed, the effect of race is reduced and loses statistical significance in each of our models. When the variable for campaign receipts is the proposed mediator, we see that the effect of race is reduced from –0.023 to –0.016. In the causal step analysis involving state size, the effect of race is reduced from –0.023 to –0.021. Finally, in the analysis involving ideological extremity, the effect of race on the decision to seek a Senate nomination is reduced from –0.023 to –0.018.29 This indicates that the ability to raise campaign receipts, state size, and ideological extremity each partially mediate the relationship between race and the decision to seek a Senate nomination.30"
"33","In addition to the causal steps method, we analyze the presence of mediated effects using a Sobel test (MacKinnon, Warsi, and Dwyer 1995; Sobel 1986). The Sobel test statistics in Table 6 suggest that campaign funding, state size, and ideological extremity each significantly mediate the effect that race has on the decision of a House member to seek a Senate nomination. The mediating influence of campaign funding is statistically significant with a p‐value of 0.001. The p‐values for the Sobel test statistic for state size and ideology are 0.064 and 0.060, respectively.            "
"34","Although causal steps analysis and the Sobel test are the most common methods of testing for the presence of mediation, we also use nonparametric bootstrap sampling analysis (Imai et al. 2010). This allows us to test for the presence of mediation using probit analysis, which is preferable given that our dependent variable is binary. The results of the nonparametric bootstrap sampling mediation analysis are consistent with the findings of the causal step analysis and Sobel test. Using this method, we find that the campaign receipts variable mediates 28% of the total effect of race on the decision to seek a Senate nomination. We find that state size mediates 8% of the total effect of race on the decision to run for the Senate. Ideological extremity mediates approximately 18% of the total effect of race on the decision to seek a Senate nomination.            "
"35","Taken together, the results from our casual steps analysis, Sobel test, and nonparametric bootstrap sampling all indicate that the relationship between race and progressive ambition is less straightforward than would appear at first glance. Campaign finance, state size, and ideological extremity mediate the influence of race on House members’ decisions to run for the Senate and serve as barriers which make it difficult for African American House members to rise to the Senate."
"36","One of the benefits of a bicameral legislature like the U.S. Congress is that the lower chamber can serve as a recruiting ground for the upper chamber, thus providing the upper chamber with a pool of experienced legislators and serving as a vehicle for the careers of members with progressive ambition. With more than half the senators in the 111th Congress being former House members, this recruitment function seems firmly established. The research we present in this article offers two important exceptions. First, although the House of Representatives is a common stepping stone to the Senate, it does not follow that most House members pursue a seat in the Senate. Our data demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of House members never run for the Senate. Second, African American House members are far less likely than their nonblack colleagues to run for the Senate. Not only has it been rare for African American House members to run for the Senate, but none have won. All three of the elected African American Senators had political careers outside the House of Representatives. While African Americans have steadily made gains at practically every level of political office, most of these offices are lower‐visibility offices and are not traditional stepping stones to the U.S. Senate. Interestingly, only the lack of gains for blacks in governor's offices (a high‐visibility office with a statewide constituency) comes near that of the U.S. Senate."
"37","Previously, explanations for the small number of African American House members who have run for the Senate were racial bias and a public hesitant to vote for African Americans in a statewide representative contest. Our analysis shows that the explanation is considerably more complex and nuanced. Factors contextually linked to the race of House members offer a more complete explanation of why African American House members choose not to run for the Senate. Because African American House members typically come from populous states, have more ideologically liberal voting records, and represent relatively poor, majority black districts, they are less likely to run for the Senate than are nonblack House members."
"38","These contextual conditions are unlikely to change in the near future. Because the African American population and most African American House members are concentrated in the more populous states, the apportionment basis of the Senate clearly limits the number of Senate seats for which African American House candidates can feasibly consider running. Barring a major redistribution of the country's black population, this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. Combined with the fact that African American House members raise less campaign funds than non‐African American House members, in part because they typically represent poorer districts, the paucity of African American House members running for the Senate is likely to persist."
"39","The only contextual variable that may show some signs of changing in a favorable direction for African American House candidates who run for the Senate is ideology. African American House members no longer have uniformly strong liberal voting records. However, most of these members represent liberal districts where more moderate candidates are likely to find it difficult to win.31"
"40","Our research also has lessons for studies of descriptive representation. Most of that work has focused on the House of Representatives and whether the election of African American members in districts with sizable African American constituencies has representational consequences (Cameron, Epstein, and O’Halloran 1996; Grose 2011; Lublin 1999; Swain 1993; Tate 2004). Our analysis suggests that those concerned with descriptive representation in American national government should shift their attention to the Senate. Without a single African American senator in the 112th Congress and never more than one in any Senate who was directly elected, the U.S. Senate is the institution that presents the biggest challenge for those who find value in ensuring some level of descriptive representation.         "
"41","Concerns with descriptive representation should focus on the collective impact of representation in both chambers. For example, while the House may be more responsive to minority concerns as the number of minority legislators increases, the Senate is less so (Minta and Sinclair‐Chapman 2009). Because the Senate is likely to persist in the descriptive underrepresentation of African Americans, it may be desirable for the House of Representatives to serve a compensatory role and intensify efforts to increase its African American membership to offset the lack of descriptive representation in the Senate.         "
"42","Although our findings show that African American House members face many barriers in running for Senate seats beyond the potential problem of racially biased voting, we do not believe an increase of African Americans in the Senate is impossible. However, for politically ambitious African Americans, the most viable stepping stone to the U.S. Senate does not appear to be the U.S. House of Representatives. That conclusion may be true for ambitious politicians in general, but even more so for African Americans."
