"1","The recall occurred just under a year after incumbent Governor Davis had been reelected to a second term. Republican Congressman Darrell Issa spent $1.8M of his own money to hire a professional firm to employ signature gatherers to meet the state minimum of 900,000 signatures needed to put the recall on the ballot (Bowler and Cain 2004, 8). The names of 135 Californians appeared on the final ballot to replace Governor Davis. Actor and body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger announced on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno that he would be a candidate to replace Governor Davis. Voters were required to cast two simultaneous ballots in this election: a yes or no vote on whether to recall Governor Davis and a separate vote for a replacement where the name of Governor Davis could not appear. Although a majority of voters would be needed to recall Governor Davis, the replacement candidate could be chosen by a simple plurality. The election of 2003 contained little that was typical of most elections for statewide office, even in a state as known for being out of the cultural mainstream as California.         "
"2","There was, however, one aspect of the election that was also atypical and yet has received much less attention by pundits, commentators, and scholars. The only serious Democratic candidate to replace Governor Davis was Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, the first‐ever statewide‐elected Latino to hold office in California,1 first elected in 1998 and reelected in 2002. He was a former Speaker of the California Assembly and was known as a moderate Democrat. Although the possibility that, if elected, he would be the most powerful Latino elected official in the country was noted in the press, virtually no one openly discussed the unique challenges he would face in trying to secure the support of a sizeable segment of white voters, whose support is still key to winning office in California. It was speculated that he would receive sizeable support from the state's growing Latino electorate, who were likely to block vote in favor of his election. However, very few commentators focused on whether white voters, especially white Democratic voters, would demonstrate reluctance to support the candidacy of a Latino as governor of the largest state in the nation, a state with the fifth largest economy in the world, the state with the largest concentration of Latinos in the country.2"
"3","In good California tradition, an important additional element in the 2003 election was the presence of yet another racially polarizing initiative on the same ballot, Proposition 54. Proposition 54, the Classification by Race, Ethnicity, and National Origin (CRENO) initiative, sought to make illegal the use of racial and ethnic identifiers and categories by all state agencies and all of California's counties, cities, and school districts. With the exceptions of prisons, police departments, and any requirements mandated by federal law, racial and ethnic data could not be secured by the State, and if available through other means (such as the Census), could not be used in any aspect of state policymaking."
"4","In this essay, we focus on the ways in which race and ethnicity3 are fundamental dimensions to understanding the 2003 election in California. We do not challenge the unique resources that Arnold Schwarzenegger brought to the campaign that made him a particularly higher‐quality candidate by some measures: megastar movie actor, wife from a prominent Democratic family, and no explicit political baggage, for example. By contrast, more than a few political observers suggested that Bustamante ran a particularly inept campaign. As a consequence, this article is not about the outcome of the recall election. Indeed, Schwarzenegger's advantages and Bustamante's failings are nonunique across voters or groups of voters. Rather, we use the two components of the ballot, recall and replacement, as a quasi‐experimental laboratory in which between‐group differences can be estimated while controlling for significant elements of partisanship, candidate quality, and issue positions in ways that rarely occur in elections research. Interestingly, both Governor Davis and Lt. Governor Bustamante were well known as moderate Democrats, and both had previously been elected and reelected to statewide office. Moreover, Arnold Schwarzenegger was known as a moderate Republican. There were far more similarities than differences in issue positions among these three candidates. As a result, substantial differences in support among these three candidates, across both the recall and the replacement elections, provide a window into the underlying preferences of California voters.         "
"5","Three specific questions structure our research. What accounts for more than 1.25 million fewer votes supporting Bustamante than opposing the recall of Davis, who were these switchers, and to what extent did racial polarization play a role? The well‐documented pattern of white racial polarization in electoral environments suggests that the fall‐off would, to a substantial degree, be among non‐Latinos whose partisan support of Davis eroded when confronted with the prospect of voting for Bustamante. If, in fact, that is the case, and there are significant between‐group differences in the erosion of support, we could not attribute those differences to qualities of either Bustamante or Schwarzenegger as candidates. Rather, those differences reflect the continuing importance of racial and ethnic identity to voter choice, even in locations with large Democratic majorities and a history of nonwhite electoral success. The presence of Proposition 54 on the ballot, another initiative which was likely to generate some degree of racial polarization among the voters, is helpful as an external validation of voter preferences if there is some correlation between the falloff in support for Bustamante and support for this measure."
"6","First, we begin with a brief history of partisan shift in California politics. This is done to provide a context for understanding recent shifts to Democratic dominance since the mid‐1990s, the racial and ethnic dimensions of that shift, and the contradiction apparent in the 2003 election. Second, we provide a detailed description of the types of choices California voters were asked to make in the 2003 election. Not only did they choose whether or not to replace the incumbent governor, they also chose a successor, and they were asked to make an entirely separate choice on a race‐specific initiative that was on the ballot. Third, we explore the underlying dimensions of these three choices with special emphasis on considering the extent to which concerns with race and ethnicity structured the preferences of major segments of the electorate. This is done with individual‐level data taken from the Los Angeles Times exit poll for the 2003 election. Fourth, we report our findings and provide primary conclusions based on the previous analysis. Finally, we discuss the implications of our conclusions for the future of California politics and especially the complex ways that race and ethnicity are likely to continue to structure much state and national politics and policymaking.         "
"7","Although California has always been a state where partisan power has shifted between Republicans and Democrats, Republicans have been in control of the state for far more of the state's history than have Democrats, holding the governorship 61% of the time, 94 years, as compared to the Democrats' 35%, 54 years (Huber 2004, 87).4 Since the Civil War, and with only a few interruptions, Republicans, conservative or progressive, have more or less dominated the state's political history until quite recently. Republicans captured California's electoral votes in every presidential election save one between WWII and 1990. Only two Democrats were elected governor in this period, Pat and Jerry Brown. Democratic success has been infrequent and short‐lived in California politics (Bell and Price 1992, 52–57).         "
"8","The 1990s, however, brought change as major demographic shifts, conservative domination of the Republican Party, and an increasingly engaged Latino electorate all served to increase Democrats' electoral successes in the state (Fraga, Ramírez, and Segura 2004, 174–77). Fraga and Ramírez note that of 11 elections held for governor, U.S. senator, and president of the United States between 1990 and 2000, Democrats have won nine (2003, 316). In seven of these nine races Latinos were significant contributors to Democratic victories, and since 1994 they have contributed the largest number of votes from communities of color to winning Democratic candidates. Latinos have increased their estimated share of the California electorate, i.e., those who turn out and vote on Election Day, from an estimated 9.4% in 1990 to 14.0% in 2003 (Barreto and Ramírez 2004, 12). Latino voters in California tend to support Democratic candidates by a 2‐to‐1 margin (Fraga and Ramírez 2003, 314–16).         "
"9","In 2002, not only did Gray Davis win reelection as governor, but also Democrats won every statewide office for the first time since the mid‐nineteenth century. Since 1992 California's two U.S. senators have been Democratic women, and Democrats currently dominate the state's Congressional delegation, and comfortably control both the State Senate and Assembly."
"10","This statewide support for Democrats, however, has coincided with—and perhaps even resulted from—clear majorities of the electorate voting in favor of three race‐ and ethnic‐specific initiatives in 1994, 1996, and 1998 (Bowler, Nicholson, and Segura 2006; Fraga and Ramírez 2003–04, 73–74).5 It was a majority of white voters, 63% in 1994, 63% in 1996, and 67% in 1998, that guaranteed the passage of each of these initiatives. That is, given the size of the white electorate in California during this period of time, which ranged from 79.4% in 1994 to 72.2% in 1998 (Barreto and Ramirez 2004, 12), white support for these propositions produced statewide preferences that were greater than the opposition coalition of white, Latino, African American, and Asian American voters (Fraga and Ramirez 2003, 317–19).         "
"11","The role of white voters as strategically positioned to determine electoral outcomes through block voting is well researched. Racially polarized voting was a key element of the reemergence of white electoral influence in the post‐Reconstruction South (Kousser 1992) and more recently the rise of the GOP in that region (Black and Black 2002; Carmines and Stimson 1989; Mendelberg 2001).6 Numerous studies have examined the varieties of demographic and electoral contexts within which a white block can structure electoral outcomes (Bolce, De Maio, and Muzzio 1992; Murray and Vedlitz 1978; Roscigno and Tomaskovic‐Devey 1994).         "
"12","Moreover, the evidence remains strong that, by and large, huge majorities of white voters will not vote for candidates of color (Jeffries 1999). While there is some disagreement on this issue (Sigelman et al. 1995), the patterns of electability and office holding confirm this central contention—racial and ethnic minorities only very rarely win elections among constituencies in which their racial/ethnic group is not a majority, and when they do so, it is often as a consequence of the presence of significant numbers of group members or other minorities in the electorate—though not a majority (Lublin 1997). In fact, Sonenshein's work (1990) focused specifically on California when identifying these patterns in the ethnic and racial distribution of voter preferences.         "
"13","Based on the above discussion, we reach three conclusions regarding partisanship, race, and statewide voting in California. First, both Democrat and Republican Parties have had a clear presence in state politics and, until recently, a majority of California voters have supported Republicans more often than they have supported Democrats. Second, Latino population growth has translated into greater political incorporation, especially through voting and representation. These gains in Latino political incorporation, with 1994 being an important watershed, have been key elements in recent Democratic gains. If Latinos continue to vote as Democrats by the 2‐to‐1 margin they currently display, it is likely that the Democratic Party will continue to gain in strength in the state. Third, the most influential racial‐ethnic segment of the California electorate has always been, and remains, white voters. They were the ones whose preferences drove partisan shifts in California's past. This remains the case despite recent Latino gains in political incorporation. This is most evident in the ways their preferences have dominated electoral outcomes on three race‐specific propositions that appeared on the California ballot in the 1990s. A white‐block vote can overwhelm competing majorities of Latino, African American, and Asian American voters."
"14","The continuing dominance of a white‐block vote in California despite significant gains in minority voting and representation was first noted by Cain (1992). He referred to this as the “new populism” (Cain 1992, 275). Although Cain was writing at a time before the recent propositions, his assessment that gains in minority empowerment in the state legislature were likely to lead to the increased use of statewide referendums and initiatives, and that although perhaps not “intentionally discriminatory,” nonetheless were likely to have “definite racial overtones” (Cain 1992, 274). More recently Bowler, Nicholson, and Segura find that the three race‐based initiatives of the 1990s seem to have had an impact on moving Latinos and some whites to identify as Democrats (2006). This propensity of some whites to identify as Democrats did not, however, prevent clear majorities of white voters from providing the statewide margins of victory for each of these propositions."
"15","Although 31 previous attempts had been made to recall a governor in California, 2003 was the first time that any effort qualified for the ballot (“California Recall History” 2004).7 Dissatisfaction with Governor Gray Davis was apparent as soon as he won reelection with 49.4% of the vote in 2002. During the campaign, he was accused of taking money from any and all special interests (Marinucci 2002) and spent an estimated $8–10M of his own 2002 campaign funds to interfere in the GOP primary by running negative advertisements against moderate Republican Richard Riordan. Shortly after reelection, he announced that the State would face a $30B budget deficit, a fact he allegedly hid during the campaign. Facing the threat of recall in the summer of 2003, he signed a bill allowing undocumented workers to secure California drivers' licenses after previously vetoing two identical measures, in what some argued was pandering to Latino voters (Morain 2002). Whatever the questions that might be raised about the tactics and monies used to put his recall on the ballot, there were reasons for many Californians to consider supporting the recall.         "
"16","The election to replace Governor Davis was basically a two‐person race, albeit a messy one.8 Arnold Schwarzenegger, a moderate pro‐choice Republican married into the Kennedy dynasty, was the most serious Republican candidate. Although Tom McClintock, a Republican state senator, was running as the true conservative, he never garnered the financial or organizational support of most California Republicans. The only other serious candidate in the replacement election was Cruz Bustamante, the sitting lieutenant governor. After being encouraged to run by major Democratic officials in the state, including influential members of California's Congressional delegation, Bustamante had the difficult challenge of both campaigning against the recall AND campaigning to replace Governor Davis should the recall prove successful. Bustamante was a moderate Democrat from California's Central Valley, former Speaker of the California Assembly, and successfully secured statewide election with 52.7% of the vote in 1998 and 49.4% in 2002. Bustamante and Schwarzenegger were the only serious contenders in the replacement portion of the ballot.         "
"17","It is important to note that both Cruz Bustamante and Arnold Schwarzenegger were clear moderates. Journalists had long written about Bustamante as a politician who did not easily fit into the stereotype of a left‐leaning ethnic politician (Walters 2003). The California Chamber of Commerce had commented on how pleased it was with aspects of his legislative record (Druker 2003). Bustamante was quoted as stating “I am built moderate. That's who I am” and “I'm an advocate on behalf of the Latino community. But for us to be leaders of an entire…state…you have to be a leader of all people, not just a few” (Nissenbaum 2000). With Bustamante's documented reputation as a moderate, it would appear unlikely that a spatial logic would drive moderate Democrats into the arms of the other party.         "
"18","Among the clearest indicators of Schwarzenegger's being moderate was his consistent support of a woman's right to choose, but in opposition to partial birth abortion. He had previously spearheaded a statewide proposition to expand afterschool programs for all children. However, he also opposed offshore oil drilling and supported gun control (On the Issues 2006a). In fact, “On the Issues,” a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, rated both Bustamante and Schwarzenegger as moderates based on their responses to a series of questions regarding citizen personal responsibility and government intervention in the economy. Interestingly, Bustamante was rated a “Moderate Libertarian” whereas Schwarzenegger was rated a “Moderate Liberal Populist” (On the Issues 2006a, 2006b).         "
"19","Finally, as we previously indicated, Proposition 54 was on the ballot. Proponents of the measure saw Proposition 54 as an important administrative step towards a “color‐blind” society, whereas opponents saw it as an attempt to legislate ignorance—that is, to undermine the need for efforts to redress racial and ethnic inequality by simply refusing to collect the information necessary to demonstrate it. Not surprisingly, the proposition drew emotional invective from both sides."
"20","The unique circumstances of the 2003 recall election make it an unusually helpful case in which to examine the dynamics of racial polarization in voting. This election offered many comparative advantages. First, we have a single electorate making two independent decisions—whether or not to recall Gov. Davis and who should replace him if he goes. That is, we have two observations of political behavior for each voter, one of which has a clear ethnic dimension to the decision while the other does not. Second, they occur on the same day, minimizing changes in the electoral and political climate and, more importantly, the demographics of the electorate. Third, the nature of the recall and the bitter partisanship that underlay it actually helps us structure a critical test of our hypothesis. That is, if only core Democratic supporters remained true to the Gray Davis cause, the likelihood that defection would occur by weak partisans and moderates is minimized. Weak partisans and moderates had already abandoned the Democratic ship, given the wild unpopularity of Gray Davis. Defection from Bustamante, after having voted to save Davis, instead represented defection by core elements of the Democratic/liberal coalition and, hence, would be more remarkable and more damning evidence about the persistence of racial bloc voting."
"21","California voters, therefore, were required to make three important decisions in the 2003 election, two of which had very clear racial dimensions. First, they had to decide whether or not to recall Governor Davis. If they did so, it would be the first time in the state's history and would only be the third time a governor was recalled anywhere in the United States (Bowler and Cain 2004, 7). Second, the replacement election required voters to choose between a Republican, Austrian immigrant, movie star, body builder, and the highest ranking Democrat Latino elected official in the state, both moderates. We analyze the two decisions together to gain analytic purchase on the motives of some voters in the replacement election. Third, the vote on Proposition 54 would again allow the statewide electorate to express its preferences on an issue of special concern to ethnic and racial minority voters.         "
"22"," Table 1 displays statewide vote results for the recall, the replacement, and the vote on Proposition 54. The recall was successful; 55.4% voted to remove Governor Davis from office. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the clear plurality winner in the replacement election, receiving 48.6% of all votes cast in the second portion of the ballot. Cruz Bustamante came in a distant second with only 31.5% of the vote; Tom McClintock received 13.5%. Interestingly, Proposition 54 was defeated by a landslide. A full 63.9% of Californians voted against this initiative (Secretary of State 2003).         "
"23"," Table 1 also reveals very interesting racial and ethnic dimensions to these three votes. The Times exit poll, which tracked the actual vote on a statewide level very closely, allows us to break out that vote by subgroup. Only among white voters did a majority, 60%, vote in favor of the recall. As Barreto and Ramírez argue, blacks and Asian Americans voted against the recall at rates very similar to their vote for Davis in 2002; however, the Latino vote against the recall of 55% was 14% lower than the support Davis received from them in 2002 (2004, 12). Similarly, whites were again the only racial‐ethnic segment of the electorate that cast a majority of its votes for Schwarzenegger; 53.6% did so. Bustamante received a majority of Latino votes (56%), and African American votes (66%), although these numbers were lower than what one would expect the normal Democratic vote to be from these segments of the electorate (Barreto and Ramírez 2004, 13). Asian American voters cast a plurality of their votes for Schwarzenegger (45.5%) and just over a third (33.6%) supported Bustamante. Unlike the votes on race‐based propositions in the 1990s, a majority of all racial‐ethnic segments of the electorate cast their votes against Proposition 54. African Americans did so at the highest rates, 87%, but sizeable majorities of Latinos (75%), Asian Americans (72%), and whites (62%) also did so.         "
"24","There were four possible combinations of votes that could be cast in the 2003 election. As indicated in Table 2, the votes of those who voted No on the Recall and For Bustamante, and those who voted Yes on the Recall and Against Bustamante are most likely explained as straightforward partisan or retrospective votes. Strong Democratic identifiers, and those generally satisfied with the performance of the Davis/Democratic administration, would be expected to support Governor Davis and at the same time vote for Bustamante, the only prominent Democrat on the ballot. Moreover, strong Republican identifiers and voters generally dissatisfied with the incumbent party performance would be expected to vote in favor of the recall, and for someone other than Bustamante. In short, the two most common patterns are easily understood as the product of partisan affiliation and the well‐identified role of retrospective evaluation.            "
"25","There are, however, two more unexpected patterns to votes that were actually cast. It is these that are our primary focus of attention, and the ones that allow us to more fully understand the possible racial and other dimensions that influenced voter decision making. In the first such pattern, a sizeable portion of voters voted No on the recall and Against Bustamante. These individuals could have supported Governor Davis, as one might expect strong Democratic partisans to do, or perhaps they felt that the recall itself was unfair. In any case, they did not vote for Bustamante. As indicated in Table 2, Latino voters were the least likely to display this pattern of behavior. The data in Table 3 reveal further that of those who voted against the recall, whites and Asian Americans were far more likely to subsequently choose not to support Bustamante. A full one‐third of whites and Asian Americans displayed this pattern as compared to 19.1% of African Americans and only 9.6% of Latinos.            "
"26","The second unexpected pattern is where individuals voted Yes on the recall and For Bustamante. Bowler and Cain suggest that one possible racialized element of the campaign may have been Latino voters whose interest in having a co‐ethnic in the governorship was so strong that they voted strategically against Davis to increase the chances that Bustamante would win. Table 2 reveals that this was a very uncommon pattern. However, 7.2% of all Latinos did make such a judgment. As indicated in Table 3, of Latino and African American voters who voted “yes” on the recall, 18.2% of African Americans and 15.5% of Latinos did also vote to support Bustamante. This suggests that, while the numbers were certainly small, there may have been some among these communities of color who did engage in this strategic behavior.            "
"27","The patterns exhibited in Table 3 appear to be accurate and can be externally validated using the Field Poll taken immediately prior to the election.9 Moreover, they are clearly suggestive of racial polarization as a potential contributing cause of both declining support for Bustamante among recall opponents, and surprising support for him among recall supporters. We now set out to identify, on multiple dimensions including but extending beyond race, which individual characteristics were most associated with these two unusual patterns of vote choice.            "
"28","To explore these questions, we employ a statewide exit poll of California voters, conducted on October 7, 2003, by the Los Angeles Times.10 The sample frame was all California voters. The total number of interviews was 5,205 voters from 74 precincts. The resulting data were then weighted using sample weights calculated by the original collector of the data to adjust for statewide sampling error, absentee voters, and declines‐to‐participate.11 Though not without its problems, the exit poll results closely mirror actual vote outcomes, and its sample size is particularly useful for the sort of split‐sample comparisons we undertake here.12"
"29","The first step in our analysis is to describe those voters—call them “defectors”—who voted “no” on the recall and then went on to vote for a gubernatorial candidate other than Lt. Gov. Bustamante. We call these voters defectors because they exhibited a preference on the recall that could broadly be understood to be “Democratic” in its partisan coloring, yet went on to vote for a non‐Democrat in the election. Davis had become so wildly unpopular by the time of the recall that it is reasonable to expect that his remaining supporters would be disproportionately core partisans, so their refusal to vote for Bustamante is certainly noteworthy. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4.            "
"30"," Table 4 reports one‐way analyses‐of‐variance between the dependent variable—voting for Cruz Bustamante13—and an array of potentially important independent variables. This comparison is made only among voters who voted against the recall. Each of the predictor variables is self‐explanatory, where the value one (1) indicates the presence of the characteristic and zero (0) the absence of the characteristic.14 Missing data are treated as missing. We examined the associations between ideology, partisanship, gender, religious preference, and SES measures on the one hand with whether the voter reported defecting from Bustamante on the other. In addition, we also looked at two political controls—the vote in the 2002 gubernatorial election, i.e., whether the respondent claimed to have voted for Davis in 2002, and the respondent's vote on Proposition 54, the racially relevant proposition forbidding the state from collecting any data on race and ethnicity.15 The value in each cell is the mean, in this case the probability that a voter in each category defected.            "
"31","The racial and ethnic dimensions of the replacement election were immediately apparent in Table 3. As we reported above, while only about 10% of Latinos who voted against the recall defected from Bustamante, the comparable numbers for non‐Hispanic whites and for Asian Americans both exceed a third. That is, more than one in three white and Asian American voters who voted against the recall went on to vote for a non‐Democratic candidate in the replacement election. Moreover, these differences are significant for all groups (except between Asians and non‐Hispanic whites). Returning to Table 4, we find additional evidence for a racial component. Fully 47% of voters who voted against the recall but took the racially conservative position of supporting Proposition 54 also went on to defect from Bustamante.            "
"32","Turning to other measures, defections were more common among Republicans, Conservatives, and Protestant Christians when compared to other voters, while less common among Singles, Catholics, Democrats, Liberals, and those who voted for Davis in 2002. Gender (Female), education (College Graduate), and Jewish religious preference did not appear to have a significant effect on the likelihood of defection.            "
"33","These relationships, of course, are bivariate and fail to control for the impact of overlapping characteristics. To estimate the precise effect of each factor, controlling for all others, we entered these predictors into a multivariate estimation. Our universe of analysis is all respondents who voted against the recall, and the dependent variable is “Defection” or a vote against Bustamante, coded one (1) if the voter defected and zero (0) if they did, in fact, vote for Bustamante. Since the dependent variable is dichotomous, we use logistic regression."
"34","We estimate the effects of the same predictors, largely in the form they appeared in Tables 3 and 4 with some modest exceptions. For categorical variables such as party, race/ethnicity, ideology, and religion, one category is excluded (by necessity) and each of the categorical dummies should be interpreted as effects in contrast to the unexpressed base category. Among racial and ethnic categories, Latino is the unexpressed category since, ex ante, we expected this group to have the lowest rate of defection. In addition, we add income and use the ordinal measure of education rather than dichotomize it.            "
"35"," Table 5 reports the results in the form of logit coefficients and standard errors. In addition, we compute the net change in the predicted probability of defection by varying each independent variable from its minimum to maximum value, holding all others at their means. We estimated the model twice, once with all respondents who voted against the recall and once with just non‐Republicans. Interpreting the motives of Republicans who voted against the recall is difficult, and it is not clear that their failure to also support Bustamante is analytically the same as similar behavior among independents and Democrats.            "
"36","The first two columns of Table 5 report the results for all recall opponents. The results largely mirror those in the bivariate analysis. Anglos and Asian American are significantly more likely than Latinos to defect, and African Americans are somewhat more likely, though this effect is only marginally significant. Looking at the changes in predicted probabilities reported in the second column, the probability of defecting is increased by almost 10% for African Americans, 17% for whites, and 19% for Asians as compared to Latinos. Moreover, the effect of Proposition 54 is sizeable as well. Supporters of the so‐called “racial privacy” initiative are 11.5% more likely to defect from Bustamante than opponents. The effects on party and ideology are much as we would expect, with Republicans and Conservatives much more likely to defect (25 or 26%), whereas Moderates and Independents are only somewhat more likely to defect (13%), when compared with Democrats and Liberals. People who Voted for Davis in 2002 were about 22% less likely to defect. None of the sociodemographic variables reach conventional levels of significance, though there does appear to be modest, marginally significant evidence that Singles are less likely to defect (about 4%) and higher Income respondents more likely (about 6% across the entire range of incomes).            "
"37","The presence of Republicans in this analysis, again, somewhat confounds interpretations since we would not expect Republicans to vote for Bustamante, even if they opposed the recall for other reasons—perhaps a commitment to the regular political process, etc. For this reason, we reestimate the model excluding Republican identifiers. The new sample size is only slightly reduced—as there were few Republicans voting to defeat the recall and retain Gov. Davis."
"38","The reestimation, however, has very little effect on the size or significance of the estimated effects. The magnitudes of the effects for Conservatives and Anglos are somewhat smaller, not surprising since many of those are lost to the analysis when Republicans are excluded. Nevertheless, Anglo Democrats and Independents are 16% more likely to have defected from Bustamante than Latinos, and white Conservative Democrats and Independents are 20% more likely to have defected than liberals.            "
"39","What, then, can we conclude from the analyses presented in Tables 4 and 5? It is difficult to assess motive with survey data. But the evidence regarding patterns of behavior is provocative. Over one‐third of all non‐Hispanic white and Asian American voters who supported Davis in the recall chose not to vote for Bustamante. In addition, self‐identified conservatives—even those not in the GOP—were far more likely to defect. More importantly, the persistence of the findings with respect to racial and ethnic groups is maintained even once we control for ideology. That is, whatever spatial considerations might have contributed to the overall pattern of vote choice, the unique contribution of racial and ethnic identity and racial polarization remains an independent and important factor driving some defectors.            "
"40","Perhaps most importantly, voter preferences on a clearly racialized issue had an important impact, lending credence to our contention that racial conservatism played a unique roll. Supporters of the racially charged Proposition 54 were substantially more likely to defect from Bustamante, even though they had defended Davis by voting against the recall. So while we cannot say with certitude what share of defectors did so for explicitly racial reasons (as opposed to ideological or idiosyncratic), it appears highly likely that racial sentiment was responsible for some meaningful share of the falloff between opposition to the recall and support for Bustamante."
"41","The second curious pattern—with potentially racial overtones—that we wished to explore was that of recall supporters who, surprisingly, voted for Cruz Bustamante in the replacement election. Others have suggested that some liberal Democrats and Latinos, frustrated with Davis' inaction on matters of concern to them, might have voted strategically by supporting the recall in hopes of installing Bustamante in the governorship. What evidence is there for this claim?"
"42","As we described in Table 2, the overall numbers of folks engaging in this pattern of behavior is small, from a low of .47% of Asian Americans to a high of 7.2% of Latinos. Nevertheless, as we can see in Table 3, Latinos—who presumably are best served by this strategy, should it have succeeded—do, in fact, engage in this behavior with some frequency. Among Latino recall supporters, 15.5% went on to support Bustamante. And surprisingly, African Americans did so as well, with over 18% of African American recall supporters voting for Bustamante. By contrast, extremely small percentages of Anglo and Asian American voters (2% and 1%, respectively) supported Bustamante after supporting the recall.            "
"43"," Table 6 reports the effects of other predictors. Among recall supporters, Latinos and African Americans, Democrats, Liberals, Catholics, supporters of Davis in 2002, and Single voters are more likely than others to have voted to ditch Davis in favor of Bustamante, whereas Anglos and Asian Americans, Republicans, Conservatives, Proposition 54 supporters, College Graduates, and Protestant Christians were less likely than other voters to have engaged in this strategic behavior.            "
"44","Once again, while these bivariate relationships are helpful in a descriptive sense, estimating the size and significance of the effect requires a multivariate logistic estimation. The universe of analysis is all voters who voted in favor of the recall, and the dependent variable is whether or not that voter was a “strategizer,” or supported the recall for the opportunity to put Bustamante in office, as evidenced by a vote for Bustamante in the replacement election. This time, among racial/ethnic variables, Anglos are the unexpressed category rather than Latinos since, ex ante, we expected their rates of exhibiting this behavior to be the smallest."
"45"," Table 7 reports logit coefficients and standard errors, as well as changes in predicted probabilities. The first column of Table 7 includes estimates for all recall supporters. The results are largely as we would expect. Strategic behavior was more likely among Latinos and African Americans, Democrats, Liberals, and supporters of Davis in the previous election, and less likely among higher Income respondents.            "
"46","Again, however, the presence of Republicans in the analysis confounds interpretation, since the vast majority of Republicans supported the recall and, we would expect, very few did so for the goal of placing Bustamante in the governor's chair. Since our goal is to differentiate sincere recall supporters from the strategic among respondents who may have conceivably preferred a Democratic governor, we reestimate the model excluding Republicans and limiting the analysis solely to Democrats and Independents who supported the recall—thereby lowering the N by two‐thirds. The results and predicted probabilities are reported in the third and fourth columns of Table 7.            "
"47"," Latino Democrats and Independents are about 9% more likely to have engaged in this strategic behavior than Democratic or Independent whites. Surprisingly, African American Democrats and Independents are almost 16% more likely to engage in this behavior than whites. Democrats are about 5% more likely than Independents to use this strategy, and Liberals about 8% more likely than conservative Democrats or Independents.            "
"48","In general, we expect that most liberals, Democrats, African Americans, and Latinos would oppose the recall. But a share of them did not, and a curious share of those went on to support Bustamante for governor. For our purposes, this is clear evidence of strategic behavior, albeit a bad strategy with—from the point of view of these voters—disastrous results. In summary, there is modest evidence for the contention that some small share of Liberal Democrats, African Americans, and Latinos voted to get rid of Gray Davis in hopes of placing Cruz Bustamante in the governorship."
"49","Attributing motives on the basis of observed behavior is always a risky undertaking. The unusual patterns of behavior in the 2003 recall election may well have been the product of an uncertain and uninformed electorate voting for idiosyncratic reasons. The patterns in the data suggest otherwise. That is, there are more than a few systematic elements to predicting which voters cast ballots across the recall and replacement election that appear, at least in partisan or ideological terms, to be inconsistent."
"50","First, the numbers of voters engaging in these patterns of behavior are sizeable, especially the defectors. The falloff of “Democratic” support between the recall and replacement election was 13.1% overall and higher among whites and Asian Americans. Cruz Bustamante got the lowest share of the statewide vote of any Democratic candidate in memory and, according to Barreto and Ramirez (2004), underperformed Democratic expectations in every subgroup. The exit poll numbers suggest that fully 12.2% of the total electorate fell into the defector category. While only about 2% did the reverse and supported the recall while voting for Bustamante, patterns emerge here as well.         "
"51","Second, and more importantly, the racial patterns in the data are inescapable. Latinos and African Americans are far less likely to have defected from Bustamante given a no vote on the recall, and far more likely to have voted for Bustamante given a yes vote—and possibly a strategic yes vote—on the recall. Moreover, every one of those relationships holds up in the multivariate analysis, even once we control for a host of other sociodemographic and political factors that might have conceivably created the appearance of racial divide when there was none."
"52","The literature has long debated the presence and persistence of racially polarized voting patterns in the United States and the degree to which they apply to Latinos. Two specific manifestations of racialized voting are most often considered: the reluctance of whites to vote for candidates of color, and the propensity of minority voters to support co‐ethnic candidates when available. In these data, we see evidence in support of both contentions."
"53","In terms of what this might say about the immediate political future in California, we offer several thoughts. First, we find remarkable the degree to which whites, now a minority of the state's residents though still a majority of the electorate, have continued to determine political outcomes. Barreto and Ramirez (2004) suggested that minorities could have changed the outcome had they stayed more reliably Democratic and turned out in proportion to their share of the electorate. But, for our purposes, this somewhat misses the point. Only whites gave majority support to the two eventual outcomes—a successful recall and the election of Schwarzenegger. Moreover, the outcome of the replacement election may have been changed if the Anglo voters who had opposed the recall merely stuck with Bustamante.         "
"54","Second, we wonder if these outcomes suggest a ceiling on the growth of Latino political power in California. Latinos have become a power within the state's Democratic Party and, by some accounts, are directly responsible for the Party's unrivaled success in recent years. And a Latino has twice been elected statewide to the Lt. Governor's office. But in the first occasion when voters might have conceivably placed a Latino in the state's highest office, the candidate and the Party fared very poorly with the electorate."
"55","Our analysis reveals that racial and ethnic identity, though no longer the absolute barrier to political incorporation it once was, remains an entrenched factor that continues to slow the pace of political progress for minority citizens and shape the landscape of electoral possibilities."
