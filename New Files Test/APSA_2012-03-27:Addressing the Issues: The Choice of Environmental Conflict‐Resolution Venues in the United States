"1","By far, the richest literature on U.S. environmental conflict resolution centers on third‐party facilitation and mediation. The bulk of the literature consists of empirical studies evaluating the process and performance of mediation in a specific organizational setting or in relation to a specific type of conflict. Among the more common dimensions of mediation that are evaluated are settlement rates (Susskind, McKearnan, and Thomas‐Larmer 1999) and participant satisfaction with the process, the mediators, and the outcomes (Andrew 2001; Sipe and Stiftel 1995; Susskind, McKearnan, and Thomas‐Larmer 1999). In addition, close scrutiny has been devoted to the benefits parties gain from participating in mediation processes, such as improved conflict‐resolution skills or the development of social capital (Buckle and Thomas‐Buckle 1986). Very little of this work compares mediation to other forms of conflict resolution, and that which does focuses on outcomes such as compliance rates (Dukes 2004; Kloppenburg 2002; Sipe 1998). Only a single large‐n study has examined and evaluated processes and outcomes from using mediation to settle environmental conflicts. Emerson et al. (2009) empirically test the factors that affect whether an agreement is reached and implemented, finding that the most important factors are whether appropriate participants are included in the process, if participants have the time and resources to participate, and if an appropriate facilitator is selected (Emerson et al. 2009).         "
"2","Much of the empirical work on mediation and alternative conflict resolution underpins an extensive normative literature on mediation and facilitation best practices. Practitioners are instructed on issues from how to convene a mediation process to how to hold parties to their commitments (Susskind and Cruikshank 2006). In addition, government officials are encouraged to revise and redesign decision‐making processes in ways that lessen the likelihood of conflict or that support consensus outcomes (O’Leary and Raines 2002; Susskind 1994). Even though much is understood about mediation processes, much remains to be studied about environmental conflict‐resolution processes in general.         "
"3","A handful of scholars studying U.S. environmental conflicts have provided some notable explanatory insights into conflict‐resolution processes by exploring the social and institutional paths taken by conflicts as they emerge and are resolved. In tracing conflict processes, researchers have used case studies to examine factors that affect how the conflict is perceived and managed, as well as the quality of the conflict‐resolution outcomes. Critical contextual factors that define and structure conflicts include characteristics of the participants, such as their ideologies or whether and how they are organized (Lewicki, Gray, and Elliott 2003). Also important are the issues involved in the dispute, such as values or distributional challenges, or threats to health and safety. In addition, the institutional context is important, particularly whether there are clearly defined conflict‐resolution venues, their perceived legitimacy, and their flexibility in handling conflict, as well as how participants frame issues (Putnam and Wondolleck 2003, 42–52). Other case studies have identified factors such as the relationship of the parties to each other and their resources, the quality of the conflict‐resolution venue or venues, and the quality of the agreement reached as important in the success of conflict‐resolution processes (d’Estree and Colby 2004).         "
"4","Using case studies to trace conflict processes and draw lessons about key factors that structure and condition conflicts and how they are resolved is a critical step in theory development. Tracing conflict processes highlights the importance of the parties to conflicts and their relationships with one another, the types of issues at stake in conflicts, and the types of conflict‐resolution venues involved. However, as Emerson et al. note, “there is much to be gained by broader, more generalizable, study” (2004, 222) beyond case studies. Moreover, broader studies of conflict resolution need to compare a wider range of dispute‐resolution approaches. Ideally, this would occur through a consistent, long‐term data‐collection project that would allow for a range of questions about the different dimensions of conflict and conflict‐resolution processes to be addressed (Emerson et al. 2004)."
"5","One potential starting point to address Emerson and colleagues’ concerns is through research that compares conflict‐resolution processes in diverse venues, beyond just mediation. Venues matter because they can influence how effectively, efficiently, or equitably a conflict is resolved. In the United States, environmental conflicts deal with important public policy questions, and actors in such conflicts have multiple venues at their disposal to attempt to settle their differences (Baumgartner and Jones 1993). According to both public policy scholars and legal scholars, actors in policy debates or conflicts may act strategically in selecting venues (e.g., see Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Busch 2007; Juenger 1989; Sabatier and Jenkins‐Smith 1993), often with the aim of increasing the probability of achieving their goals (Pralle 2003). As part of that strategic process, a fundamental question that may arise is: what is the likelihood that a given forum can effectively address a particular conflict? Because different venues have diverse capacities and rules for decision making, not all venues may be appropriately suited to the issues of a given conflict. While a few studies of international conflicts have touched upon the relationship between the nature of conflict issues and venues (e.g., see Hensel 2001; Hensel et al. 2008), comparative and quantitative research in the domestic environmental conflict‐resolution field is limited on this front. Therefore, we focus the remainder of our analysis on diagnosing how the issues underlying environmental conflicts relate to the venues that address them.         "
"6","The first step in examining whether and how conflict issues are related to different types of conflict venues is to devise a theoretically meaningful typology of conflict issues. As some scholars have argued, such a typology is important in fostering replicability of studies and comparability of measures across conflict settings (Hensel et al. 2008). We propose to use a categorization of common‐pool resource dilemmas developed by Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker (1994), as it allows for consistent identification of types of issues underlying environmental conflicts. We do not claim that it is appropriate for all types of conflict issues; however, it is applicable for all types of environmental conflicts associated with common‐pool resources (CPRs), and as Dietz, Ostrom, and Stern (2003) note, virtually every environmental problem includes a common‐pool resource. Moreover, from the perspective of individual resource users, all CPR dilemmas are characterized by suboptimal outcomes and are sources of conflict (McCay 2002; Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994). Distinct interactions and behaviors produce each of the dilemmas, and solutions will require distinct institutional responses. Consequently, we expect that different types of dilemmas will be addressed in different types of venues.         "
"7","Two broad but related categories of dilemmas involve those that primarily relate to the externalities created by competing for access and use of a CPR and those that primarily relate to restoring, maintaining, and enhancing the productivity of a CPR (Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994), summarized in Table 1.         "
"8","Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker (1994) refer to externalities that result from competition for resource access and use as “appropriation dilemmas.” Appropriation dilemmas may be divided into two subtypes. One type, technological externalities, involves competing types of uses of a common‐pool resource. Competing uses may result from the impairment that more intensive resource‐harvesting technologies can pose on less intensive technologies (i.e., a deep well operated by a city that draws down an aquifer beyond the level that can be accessed by smaller farmer‐owned wells; Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994). However, the externalities from competing uses do not have to be technologically driven. For instance, instream flow uses, such as fishing, may compete and conflict with off‐channel uses of water, such as irrigation. A second appropriation dilemma involves assignment problems that arise when resource users compete and conflict over access and use of particularly productive areas of a CPR (Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994). For example, grasslands with surface‐water sources provide more productive and reliable forage for cattle than those without water sources. Addressing conflicts that involve appropriation issues requires careful regulation of access to the most productive areas and the separation of and limits on different types of uses.         "
"9","Problems of protecting the productivity of a resource, labeled “provision problems” by Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker (1994), may also be divided into two categories. Demand‐side provision problems result from overuse—harvesting or withdrawing resource units at a rate greater than the resource can sustain over time, which then leads to the degradation of and diminishing of the quantity and/or quality of the resource. Supply‐side provision problems center on the collective action challenges of protecting, restoring, or enhancing the productivity of a resource, such as restoring riparian habitat. Solutions to provision problems require limiting harvesting and/or disposal practices to sustainable levels (for demand‐side problems) or investing in projects to restore or enhance the productivity of a resource (for supply‐side provision dilemmas). Moreover, solutions to provision problems need to be adapted, depending on whether they relate to the quantity or the quality of the resource being affected.         "
"10","In addition to the underlying CPR dilemmas that can be used to define conflict issues, many studies point to whether conflicts involve distributional issues as an important factor shaping environmental conflict resolution. Distributional issues arise when one party gains at the expense of another party. In the bargaining, negotiating, and mediation literatures, win‐lose issues are viewed as very difficult to resolve, and practitioners are advised to help the parties seek out win‐win solutions (Lewicki, Gray, and Elliot 2003). Distributional issues pit parties against each other, and parties are more likely to act opportunistically and strategically to ensure that they capture a larger share of benefits, albeit at the expense of the other parties.         "
"11","Developing a typology of CPR conflicts can advance both theoretical and empirical research on environmental conflicts in the United States by providing a foundation for developing hypotheses to test how conflicts relate to resolution venues. Parties to environmental conflicts in the United States have access to venues that range across the different branches of government. By venues, we refer to those action arenas that involve a distinct set of actors who interact to address conflicts under a prescribed set of procedures. While courts are considered the quintessential conflict‐resolution venue in the domestic context, conflict‐resolution venues also include representative bodies, such as legislatures or commissions that collectively choose to consider conflicts and the means of resolving them (aka “collective choice” venues); public agencies, which have rule making, planning, and management authorities; and mediation and negotiation, which provide arenas to devise or negotiate resolutions to conflicts, often in the shadow of courts, representative bodies, and public agencies.1 Conflicts are often considered in more than one venue before they are resolved, particularly if conflicts involve multiple underlying issues. Although the movement of conflicts and policy debates among venues is of growing interest to scholars studying venue shopping (e.g., see Busch 2007; Pralle 2003), the study of how a given conflict moves from one to another is outside the scope of this study. Instead we hone in on the likelihood of specific issues or sets of issues being addressed in a venue. We acknowledge that it is unlikely that particular types of conflict issues and resolution venues will be perfectly aligned. However, we do expect to see that a given venue is likely to address particular types of issues, based on the capacity of the venue to provide workable solutions to the issues. Given the paucity of literature linking issues and venues, our hypotheses below are largely grounded in logical assumptions about how venue capacities would likely match up to issues, but they do not preclude the possibility that a venue will address other issues.         "
"12","In addition, the hypotheses are developed for a specific type of CPR—water—because our dataset consists of water conflicts. Common‐pool resource scholars have long argued that different types of resources differ along key features; for instance, rivers and streams are highly mobile whereas grasslands and forests are not (Ostrom 2007; Schlager, Blomquist, and Tang 1994). As a result, common‐pool resource dilemmas are likely to pose different challenges depending on the type of resource involved. For instance, supply‐side provision problems in a forestry setting would center on replanting trees, or rehabilitating streams, whereas the same types of problems in a water setting would center on investing in and operating infrastructure, such as a dam and reservoir, or a water‐quality treatment plant. Thus, the hypotheses reflect the water setting of the United States; other types of resources may require different hypotheses to adequately capture the interaction between issues and venues. We begin with a discussion of agencies and collective‐choice venues and the types of conflicts they are likely to address before turning to mediation and courts and the types of conflicts they are likely to address.         "
"13","Collective‐choice venues and agencies are closely associated as agencies are created by legislatures, assemblies, or councils to implement and administer laws through a variety of means. In the water arena, collective‐choice bodies commonly grant agencies regulatory authorities that would enable them to deal with assignment problems. For instance, water agencies may have the capacity to pass rules on well spacing to prevent groundwater pumpers from interfering with one another. Collective‐choice bodies also often empower agencies with the capacity to devise standards to address demand‐side provision problems, or resource impairment, particularly around water‐quality issues due to their technical nature. Finally, water agencies are commonly granted the authority to engage in planning and operating reservoirs or developing watershed restoration programs, and thus the capacity to deal with supply‐side provision dilemmas. Thus:"
"14","            "
"15","H1: Agencies are more likely to address conflicts involving assignment problems, demand‐side provision problems, and supply‐side provision problems.                  "
"16","Collective‐choice bodies are likely to have the capacity to address three types of issues. First, in relation to water, collective‐choice bodies have the authority to make decisions about how to allocate resources among competing uses, such as hydropower versus fisheries or municipal uses versus irrigation uses. Second, while agencies would likely have the capacity to maintain and operate projects needed to address supply‐side provision dilemmas, collective‐choice bodies also have the capacity to deal with these issues because authorizing and appropriating funds for projects occurs within legislatures. Third, while the popular perception of legislatures is that they attempt to avoid high‐conflict issues, legislatures have the ability to make side payments to the losers in distributional conflicts. Thus:"
"17","            "
"18","H2: Collective‐choice venues are more likely to address competing‐use conflicts, supply‐side provision problems, and distributional issues.                  "
"19","Just as collective‐choice venues and agencies are closely associated, so too are mediation and courts. Mediation often occurs in the shadow of courts and is viewed as a more flexible, less conflictual, and more cost‐effective alternative for resolving conflicts compared to courts (Bingham 2002). As previously noted, many scholars of U.S. environmental conflicts expect that mediation venues have greater capacity to address difficult and complex conflicts relative to other venues. In particular, the capacity of mediation venues to help disparate interests find common ground suggests they would likely be more attuned to distributional conflicts. At the same time, mediation venues have the capacity to involve diverse sets of interests and multiple stakeholders in conflict resolution. Thus, another issue that may be matched to mediation is a demand‐side provision problem that affects resource quality. For instance, water pollution often originates from multiple sources, many of which are diffused and difficult to track, so devising workable solutions may require involving multiple regulators and many stakeholders. Likewise, supply‐side provision problems affecting resource quality may be difficult to resolve. For example, such problems often involve restoring degraded riparian habitat or increasing instream flows to a river, which could require negotiated solutions across a range of stakeholders. Thus:         "
"20","            "
"21","H3: Mediation forums are more likely to address conflicts involving distribution issues and demand‐side and supply‐side provision problems involving quality.                  "
"22","Finally, courts are designed to interpret and enforce rules and laws and to review the actions and decisions of public officials, including representative bodies, public managers, and judges. It is difficult to predict, a priori, the types of conflicts courts are likely to address compared to other venues. Parties to conflicts may call upon courts’ powers of review to examine the actions taken by public managers, they may test the constitutionality of an act adopted by a legislature, or they may ask that a rule or right be recognized and enforced. None of the powers of courts are unique to particular types of dilemmas and the conflicts they engender. Consequently, there is no reason to believe that courts will be more likely to address particular types of conflicts. Thus:"
"23","            "
"24","H4: Courts are likely to address a wide range of conflicts and are not likely to address any particular type of issue more than others.                  "
"25","To test the hypotheses presented above, we use an original dataset of water‐resource conflicts in the western United States. Western water‐resource conflicts provide a useful setting for assessing the environmental conflicts literature because of relatively long‐term records of disputes over resources in this region, dating to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The nature of water resources as central to both human, industrial, ecological, and recreation needs also captures a wide range of underlying environmental issues and resource problems. Focusing on western basins further allows us to control for one component of the institutional setting—state water rights—since eastern states and western states are governed under different water‐rights doctrines."
"26","The population of conflicts comes from a broader study of 14 interstate river basins that are governed by interstate river “compacts” (self‐governing agreements between the states that establish rules for the allocation of water resources between states).2 Choosing basins that are governed by interstate compacts provides multiple types and levels of conflict‐resolution venues, including state‐level and basin‐level collective‐choice institutions and conflicts that may be large in scale and scope. It not only provides a richer context for analysis, but also provides a setting where “visible” conflicts have been at play for, in some cases, nearly 100 years. By visible, we mean that conflicts are readily identified through a commonly known record, such as court cases, the media, agency reports, and the compact commissions that monitor the basin. We therefore identified any conflict event in this population of watersheds that has occurred since the date when basins entered into an interstate compact through 2005. These conflicts were not selected as a representative sample of all water conflicts in the western United States (as no dataset identifying all such conflicts exists), yet the population of conflicts in this dataset is geographically diverse (cutting across 12 states) and encompasses small localized conflicts to larger‐scale conflicts involving numerous parties across an entire basin, bringing up multiple issues. The substantive issues underlying these conflicts—from supply protection to quality impairment and competing uses—commonly appear in water resource management conflicts around the globe (Bencala and Dabelko 2008).         "
"27","Conflicts were operationalized as any dispute or disagreement by two or more parties over either the cause of a water issue, a solution to a water issue, or both. Since conflicts can reoccur and evolve over time, we coded a conflict “event” as starting during the year it was first identified in public records and ending if a resolution was made, or if the issues or the conflict parties changed. In collecting conflict data, we used a coding form that captures indicators of theoretically relevant variables characterizing each of the conflict events.3 We reviewed all publicly available primary and secondary sources that have discussed conflicts or debates within the river basins in the study to identify and code conflict events.4 A total of 192 conflicts were identified in our dataset.         "
"28","The dependent variables are the four venues discussed earlier—courts (state or federal), collective‐choice forums (e.g., formal commissions and legislatures), public agency intervention (federal and state), and mediation or negotiations.5 We identified and coded the presence or absence of these variables in addressing each of the 192 conflicts. As noted earlier, institutional venues may not be mutually exclusive; thus, our coding identifies where multiple forums were involved in a conflict. The independent variables include the different types of common‐pool resource issues: (1) appropriation problems, which include (a) technological externalities and (b) assignment problems; (2) demand‐side provision problems, related either to (a) the impaired quantity of the resource or (b) impaired quality, coded for each conflict; and (3) supply‐side provision problems, broken into (a) problems around maintaining the quantity of the resource and (b) the enhancement of the quality of the resource. Operationally, we use the definitions provided earlier to determine if a conflict exhibited the presence or absence of any of these variables. So, for instance, if water users in a conflict were competing for use of a prime area of the resource (e.g., recreation versus fishing on the headwaters of a stream), the conflict would be coded for assignment issues. Our variable for distributional issues is operationalized as whether a conflict involves both a question of who has access to a limited supply of water and how much water those users will or should receive from the limited supply.         "
"29","For control variables, the conflict‐resolution literature also points to the contextual factors of the conflict as critical in shaping conflict outcomes and potentially the choice of conflict venues. Within this context, parties play a prominent role. For instance, a history of prior interactions between parties can challenge conflict resolution, which may affect the choice of resolution forums. To measure a history of prior conflict among parties, we have reviewed all of the case literature on the conflicts and coded whether the parties to a given conflict event were involved in a prior conflict event. Similarly, the diversity of interests or parties is recognized as a factor shaping conflict outcomes. This variable is measured as the sum of the number of distinct types of groups (from agriculture, industry, municipal users, state agencies, tribes, and hydropower) involved in a conflict (versus the total number of parties). Finally, the year the conflict originated may influence venue choice, given that mediation and negotiation are relatively recent phenomena."
"30","Table 2 presents the percent of all types of issues that are addressed by the four types of venues in our study. Among the 192 water conflicts in our study, there are 473 issues (an average of 2.5 issues per conflict), and no single issue is addressed solely by one type of venue. All venues have addressed all types of issues and often in combination with other venues. Of the 192 conflicts, 98 have been addressed by some combination of venues, and the number of issues and the number of forums per conflict are positively correlated (r = .208, p < .01). Of the 94 conflicts addressed by a single forum, courts addressed two‐thirds. Collective‐choice bodies or agencies addressed most of the remaining conflicts (30%), while mediation was used as the only venue in 6%, or six conflicts.         "
"31","The descriptive data offer some preliminary support for the hypotheses. In examining the issues addressed by agencies, the data show that agencies are significantly more likely to address assignment problems, demand‐side provision problems dealing with quality, and supply‐side provision problems, as expected (H1), as well as conflicts with more issues. One such conflict emerged in the late 1980s in the Arkansas River basin. The conflict dealt with (1) assignment problems, where parties argued that the timing of flows from reservoir releases upstream was mismatched to demand, (2) demand‐side quality issues regarding how water releases would affect species, and (3) supply‐side quality issues related to how to best maintain the quality of flows in the basin. While the conflict did appear in federal court, it was the Bureau of Reclamation that was called upon to address the conflict by changing flow strategies from the reservoirs."
"32","The descriptive data also lend support for Hypothesis 2. Collective‐choice forums do not appear to address significantly more issues of “competing uses,” but they are involved with significantly more issues of both demand‐side and supply‐side provision that affect resource quantity, as well as distributional issues, as expected. An example of a dispute involving distributional issues was identified in our research among the three states overlying the Rio Grande basin (Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas). The states argued over how to credit or debit appropriate states for water released during high‐flow years, and the implications of these releases for state compliance with state water‐allocation rules under the Rio Grande compact. The conflict was eventually resolved through the interstate river basin commission, a collective‐choice forum, overseeing the compact agreement."
"33","Mediation and negotiation forums address the fewest number of all of the conflict issues in our dataset (33%), but the most number of issues per conflict. Although the data do not show that mediation is more likely to address distributional issues, this venue is involved in a significantly higher percentage of both supply‐side provision issues related to water quantity and demand‐side provision problems involving quality issues, as expected (H3). An example of a conflict involving both issues surfaced in the mid‐1990s when the Army Corps of Engineers began permitting projects to maintain flows (a supply‐side provision issue) along a portion of the Yellowstone River, but the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opposed the projects because of the potential impacts on the quality of watershed habitat (a demand‐side quality issue). The conflict was mitigated through a stakeholder group called the Upper Yellowstone Task Force, which provided a neutral forum for discussing the issue and conducting a third‐party assessment of how the projects affect the health of the river ecosystem."
"34","Courts are the most prominent conflict‐resolution forum, addressing 65% of all issues, but unlike the other forums, courts are not more likely to address any particular issues over others, which supports Hypothesis 4. For example, among the 60 conflicts in our dataset where courts alone addressed a conflict, a wide range of issues emerge: from competing uses and demand‐side quantity problems among groundwater and surface‐water users in the South Platte basin in the 1960s; to a dispute in the Klamath basin over tribal rights that not only raised issues of competing demands between tribes and irrigators but also demand‐side provision issues around the impacts of those rights on habitat quality; to a supply‐side provision dispute in the Pecos basin when an environmental group sued federal agencies in 2000 over the maintenance of river flows for an endangered fish."
"35","Given that multiple venues may address a conflict, we also considered whether venues work in concert to address particular issues. The data do show that significant and positive correlations exist between collective‐choice venues and agencies. First, they tend to match up around issues of demand‐side quantity problems (Phi correlation = .415, p < .05). This finding may help explain one of the discrepancies in our descriptive data where agencies are not more likely to be involved in these issues on their own, as Hypothesis 2 predicts. Additionally, collective‐choice and agency venues tend to match up around the demand and supply‐side quality variables (Phi correlation = .270 and .328, respectively, p < .05). The two forums also have a positive and significant correlation on distributional issues (Phi correlation = .205, p < .05). These correlations are not surprising given the relationship between collective‐choice venues and agencies around rule making and implementation. Positive correlations between other forums were not found across any of the issue types. Most notably, mediation is no more likely to work in tandem with courts than with other conflict‐resolution venues. (See the Supporting Information for a full table of all correlations across venues, by issue.)"
"36","Since the descriptive data do not control for the contextual factors that might structure conflicts, we assess the hypotheses using four separate logistic regression models—one for each conflict‐resolution forum—on the 192 cases of conflict. The unit of analysis is the conflict event, with the dependent variable for each model being the presence or absence of that particular venue in the conflict‐resolution process, and independent variables being the issues present in each conflict. The models control for the history of conflict between parties, party diversity, and conflict‐start year. Each of the models also controls for the presence of multiple venues involved in a conflict. All four models are estimated using robust clustered standard errors, with the clustering variable being the watershed unit at which the conflict emerged. This approach helps account for potentially endogenous, basin‐level conditions."
"37","Table 3 presents the results of four separate logistic‐regression models, demonstrating the effects of the conflict issues on the probability of a conflict being addressed by a particular venue. The coefficients represent the log likelihood of a venue addressing a conflict. (The odds ratios are not shown in this table for ease of interpretation; marginal effects are presented in Table 4.) The Wald chi‐square measures, testing the significance of the full model against the null model, demonstrate that all four models are significant at the .01 level. The models’ Pseudo R‐squared, McKelvey and Zavoina's R‐squared, and Hosmer‐Lemeshow tests support the fit of each of the models.6 Since the logit models only present the log‐likelihood effects of the explanatory variables, the actual magnitude of the effects is hard to interpret from these models. Table 4 presents the marginal effects or the change in the probability of a given venue addressing a conflict relative to changing a value of a significant explanatory variable while holding all other variables in the model constant. (The effects model is run with all variables in the model, but only the significant variables are presented.) In looking at the effects of the different issue types on venues addressing conflicts, the models’ results align with the descriptive data in Table 2 and support the hypotheses, with a couple of exceptions.         "
"38","The first logit model examines the likelihood of an agency addressing a conflict. It supports the first hypothesis, with the indicators for assignment problems, demand‐side quality, and supply‐side quality all positively related to the likelihood of agencies addressing conflicts. The marginal effects analysis, shown in Table 4, reveals that of the three significant and positively related variables, assignment problems have the greatest effect. If a conflict includes an assignment problem, the probability of an agency considering the conflict increases by 57%. Also, the impact of demand‐side quality issues is greater than that of supply‐side quantity. This may be due to the authority agencies have to address quality issues, whereas they share authority around supply‐side quantity issues with collective‐choice venues. The significant and negative relationship between competing use issues and agencies is also notable. Water agencies are typically not granted the authority to decide among competing uses, and if conflicts involve competing‐use issues, agencies are 23% less likely to address them. The control variables in the agencies model suggest that agencies are more likely to be involved in cases where parties have a history of conflict, but less likely to address more recent conflicts.         "
"39","The second logit model shows that collective‐choice forums are significantly more likely to address supply‐side provision problems and distributional problems as Hypothesis 2 predicts. As shown in Table 4, when a conflict involves supply‐side provision issues around water quantity, the probability of a collective‐choice venue addressing the conflict increases by 16%. If a distributional issue is involved, the probability of a collective‐choice forum addressing the conflict increases by 13%. As expected, a positive relationship between competing‐use issues and collective‐choice venues exists, but it is not significant. While we made no predictions about demand‐side quality issues, the model suggests a negative relationship between collective‐choice venues and quality issues, the impact of which is notable. If conflicts involve demand‐side quality issues, the probability that collective‐choice venues address the conflicts drops by 44%. Collective‐choice bodies delegate authority to address quality issues to public agencies, as discussed in relation to the first hypothesis, and this finding reflects that. The control variables further indicate that collective‐choice bodies are reluctant to act on issues in which the parties have a history of conflict, perhaps because such parties may be less willing to compromise on solutions, which may be necessary for successful resolution in collective‐choice venues. The presence of multiple venues also has a strong effect in the collective‐choice model, possibly suggesting that other venues are needed to bring conflicts to the attention of policymakers.         "
"40","While the hypotheses directed at agencies and collective‐choice venues are largely supported by the logit models, the mediation hypothesis is not. The only expectation met is that demand‐side provision problems that affect resource quality are positively and significantly related to mediation forums addressing conflict. Contrary to Hypothesis 3, supply‐side quality issues and distributional issues have a significant and negative effect on the likelihood of mediation addressing such conflicts (also supported by the descriptive statistics). In terms of the control variables, a history of conflict and party diversity are not significant, and, yet, it is these characteristics of conflicting parties that the literature suggests that mediation is best equipped to handle. Finally, the start year and multiple‐forums variable are positive and significant for the mediation model, which makes intuitive sense as mediation has become more commonly used in recent decades and is often used in conjunction with other venues."
"41","The final model reveals a more nuanced picture of the role of courts in resolving water conflicts than what is expected in Hypothesis 4 by indicating when courts are less likely to be involved in resolving conflicts. Conflicts involving supply‐side provision problems around quantity and distributional issues have a significant and negative effect on the likelihood of courts addressing them. This may be due to the relative effectiveness of agencies and collective‐choice venues in tackling these issues. Courts are significantly less likely to address supply‐side quantity provision problems if agencies also address the issue (Phi correlation =−.307, p < .05), and they are significantly less likely to address distributional issues if collective‐choice bodies also address the issue (Phi correlation =−.357, p < .05). Rather, courts may be better at interpreting existing rules and statutes, or determining whether access to water supplies or restored habitat is called for. This may explain why supply‐side provision issues dealing specifically with quality increase the likelihood that courts will address a conflict. The control variables further indicate that courts tend to be the single arbiters of conflicts and that they are significantly less likely to address conflicts in which party type is highly diverse."
"42","Both the descriptive data and the logit models provide support for the hypotheses regarding conflict issues and conflict‐resolution venues. Notably, the results indicate that public agencies and collective‐choice venues interact in addressing conflicts as well as complement one another in the types of conflicts addressed. While both address supply‐side quantity issues, namely water infra‐structure projects, they tend to trade off on other issues. Public agencies address quality issues while collective‐choice venues do not."
"43","The data provided mixed results for the mediation hypothesis, however. The descriptive data showed that mediation is more likely to address demand‐side and supply‐side provision issues involving quality, such as a conflict over the impacts of nutrient run‐off from agricultural water users (demand side) and what mitigation strategies are best for minimizing the run‐off (supply side), but the supply‐side provision variable did not hold up in the logit results. Nor did the data support the expectation that mediation would be more likely to address distribution issues, which the literature argues is most suited to mediation. This result is somewhat surprising, given that distribution issues involve win‐lose situations, and mediation should arguably help find creative ways around such cleavages. This unexpected finding may be because the use of mediation in water conflicts is relatively recent or because it appears in a small number of conflicts in our dataset. Thus, it may be too soon to discern patterns of mediation use; or it may be that the factors that influence the use of mediation are more idiosyncratic, such as ready access to a mediator or parties having previous experience with mediation."
"44","The results also supported the prediction that courts play a dominant role in conflict resolution. We acknowledge that this reliance on courts may reflect some bias in our data toward court cases (which are more visible and easy to identify from public records than perhaps other cases), but it also may reflect a natural tendency toward courts as the recognized, formal, third‐party arbitrator of disputes in the United States, as courts were designed. Yet the data also indicate that some issues may not be as well‐suited to courts. Those are issues where agencies and collective‐choice bodies are more likely to play a role, namely provision problems involving supply‐side quantity issues and distributional problems."
"45","This article advances theoretical and empirical scholarship on U.S. environmental conflicts in three ways. First, the typology of common‐pool resource dilemmas is a theoretically meaningful way of classifying and measuring diverse sets of environmental conflict issues. Second, conflict‐resolution venues tend to address some kinds of issues and not other types of issues. This appears to be a function of the capacity of a venue type to address an issue, but also the actions of other venues. The capacity of venues to address different types of conflicts may have implications for how quickly and successfully conflicts are resolved. Thus, understanding the matching of issues to venues is a key starting point for examining relations between conflict issues, venues, and outcomes. Third, the research presented in this article offers a new dataset and a large‐n, empirical approach that responds to long‐standing calls for social scientists to compare diverse conflict‐resolution venues (Bingham 2002; McEwen 1999).

"46","We recognize the limitations in our data, which involve only water conflicts in the western United States, and in our scope of analysis. Extending this research beyond water conflicts would require some attention to hypotheses building around other issue types. Given that the issue typology can be applied to many environmental issues, and that the venues we studied can be accessed for a range of environmental conflicts, our hypotheses and methods should offer a valuable starting point. Within the water sector, the scope of our analysis could also be extended to explore more facets of the conflict‐resolution process. Conflict‐resolution processes encompass a series of steps from conflicts being addressed or considered in conflict‐resolution venues to agreements reached that are designed to resolve conflicts, to the implementation and performance of the agreements. This article focused on the initial stage of the conflict‐resolution process—linking issues to venues—and it is only one lens on that stage of the process. We are not able to uncover with these data how a particular conflict moves in and out of venues at different points of time and the degree to which actors engage strategically in those decisions. More qualitative, in‐depth research of a subset of conflicts would help better understand the role of human agency in selecting venues and how that relates to the nature of the issues. Additionally, empirical testing of other stages in the conflict‐resolution process is needed. From our dataset, a future article will explore how conflict‐resolution agreements are conditioned by conflict issues and conflict‐resolution venues. Such studies, which extend beyond the mediation subfield, will be valuable contributions to the rich literature on domestic environmental conflicts."
