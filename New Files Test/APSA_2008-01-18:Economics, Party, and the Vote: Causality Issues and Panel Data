"1","A focus on the national elections of the United States seems especially appropriate, given that these are the most studied cases in the survey research literature on economic voting (Lewis‐Beck and Stegmaier 2007). It is worth briefly summarizing these findings, which are virtually all cross‐sectional. (Because of our purposes, we only cite leading time series studies on the U.S. case. They provide further support for an economics‐elections connection [Clarke and Stewart 1994; Erikson 1989; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Fair 1978; Hibbs 1982; Norpoth 1996; Tufte 1978].) For the U.S. surveys, the retrospective evaluation of national economic conditions has repeatedly demonstrated rather strong effects in presidential elections (Alvarez and Nagler 1995, 1998; Fiorina 1981; Kiewiet 1983; Lewis‐Beck 1988; Nadeau and Lewis‐Beck 2001; Norpoth 2004). A not atypical example comes from Alvarez and Nagler (1998, 1360–62), who found for the 1996 contest that voters who perceived the national economy as “better” were 38% more likely to vote for Clinton, compared to those who saw it as “worse.” Further, this economic variable had a bigger impact than any other issue.         "
"2","Following the revisionist argument, these strong economic voting effects are merely the product of the influence of party identification on economic evaluation and on vote choice. For example, suppose before the 2004 U.S. presidential election that voters are considering a vote for incumbent President Bush. Republican identifiers will tend to favor Bush, because they are Republican. Also, the argument goes, Republican identifiers will tend to see the economy as better than it is (because they want to give their Republican president credit for its management). If party identification generally works this way, a strong correlation between economic perception and vote choice will likely result. This observed correlation will be real, but it will be spurious, i.e., not causal. That is, it exists only because of different partisan feelings, not because of any real differences in assessments of the economy."
"3","As convincing as the revisionist argument may be, any empirical evidence tends to be inconclusive, assuming it remains cross‐sectional. An essential requisite of causal inference, temporality, cannot be established in a single election survey. Regardless of their level of sophistication, they measure the variables at the same moment. For example, party identification in 2004, economic perception in 2004, and reported vote in 2004 all are items posed within the same hour of the ANES postelection survey. Careful dissection of these responses cannot really establish causation, beyond the admittedly important requisite of covariation. As Lewis‐Beck and Stegmaier observe, “When individuals are surveyed at two or more points in time … the variation is more likely to be causal” (2000, 195). Below we follow this lead, commencing with relatively simple panel considerations, eventually moving on to more complicated scenarios."
"4","With respect to the 2002–2004 ANES study, it is the most current presidential election panel available. Further, it offers a hard test, at least in the eyes of those who argue that economic voting was unusually weak that year (Norpoth 2004). Turning to other U.S. panels, we find they generally do not appear suitable because of measurement issues. For example, with the 1972–74–76 panel, there is no national retrospective item, and the other economic indicators vary from election to election. However, we do look at the 1990–92 panel, as shall be seen.         "
"5","Our main focus is on the proper estimation of structurally simple models, assessing the effect of party and economics after the imposition of SES controls. This clarifies presentation and is particularly important when we move to more complex estimation procedures. As well, it offers a tougher test of the economic voting hypothesis. The last point merits emphasis. If other variables, for example other issues and ideology, are excluded, this advantages the magnitude of the party identification coefficient relative to the economic perception coefficient. That is because party identification, compared to economic perception, would generally be expected to be more collinear with ideology and with other issues. In these simpler models, then, the economic perception coefficient will tend to be biased downward, while the party identification will tend to be biased upward (Lewis‐Beck 1995, 59).         "
"6","Here, in words, is the basic model we estimate across these panel data:             "
"7","Ordered probit estimates, on the 2004 ANES survey, appear for the baseline, static model (equation 2) in column 1, Table 1A. One observes the conventional result: party identification and economic evaluation are both important in expected ways. Further, while party registers a more important effect, it is not that much more important, i.e., the party‐economy coefficient ratio = 1.21/.44 = 2.75. In other words, this ratio—only about 3:1—leaves economics showing a relatively strong impact. Of course, these results directly highlight the possible exaggeration the revisionists complain about; they claim the economic estimate is bigger than it should be.         "
"8","What happens if we lag the two independent variables, as in equation 3 above, measuring them both in 2002, so taking advantage of the dynamic possibilities of the panel? One observes (column 2, Table 1A) that the impact of economic perception goes down a bit. But so does the impact of party. However, the difficulty with this joint two‐year lag is that party identification can still contaminate economic perception, because both are measured at the same time point (in 2002). What is needed is to lag party (back two years) but not lag the economy. This frees contemporary economic perception from the distorting influence of contemporary party identification. If the revisionist hypothesis is true, then the coefficient of the economy should decrease in magnitude (from column 2, Table 1A). We see that this does not occur (column 3, Table 1A). The economics coefficient rises from .36 to .49. Furthermore, the party effect takes a dip, from 1.14 to 1.06. Overall, from this more appropriate lag structure, the effects of party are seen to deteriorate more than the economy, leaving a new party‐economy ratio of 2.16 (i.e., 1.06/.49). (For more discussion of the lag structure, see the accompanying footnote.)1"
"9","On the basis of these dynamic results, the economy actually emerges with stronger direct effects than the static analysis revealed. Furthermore, the economy emerges stronger, relative to party identification. (An argument against this conclusion is that lagged vote, rather than lagged party, is the preferred partisan measure. Consequences of this alternative specification are pursued in the footnote.)2 Accordingly, in previous cross‐sectional work the economic effects may not have been inflated by the influence of party identification. On the contrary, if anything, the suggestion is that contemporaneous party identification measures have suppressed somewhat the true economic effects. This point is pursued more fully below.         "
"10","The foregoing panel analysis takes an important step by allowing incorporation of the temporality requirement for firm causal inference. Nevertheless, it remains problematic for at least three reasons. First, if party identification shapes economic perception, then an ordinary single‐equation coefficient undervalues party identification's impact (because party identification would have additional effects that traveled indirectly through economic perception)."
"11","Second, and somewhat differently, it can be argued that, in the models estimated thus far, party identification is tacitly assumed to be exogenous. Currently, the exogenous versus endogenous status of party identification is a subject of considerable debate. One view is that party identification operates exogenously (e.g., is stable over time and impervious to short‐term influences). Another view is that party identification operates endogenously (e.g., is changeable over time and responsive to short‐term influences). (The literature here is not small. On the former perspective, deriving from the Michigan tradition, see the leading example of Green, Palmquist, and Schickler [2002]. On the latter, the classic statement remains with Fiorina [1981], and his “running tally” idea.) We do not take sides on this debate here; however, it does seem worth applying some exogeneity tests. To the extent that party identification, as ordinarily measured, is actually endogenous, its estimated effects could be biased. Of course, to be evenhanded, the corollary is that economic perceptions may also be endogenous; that issue needs to be faced as well.         "
"12","Third, the problem of correlated error terms, typically acute with panel data, could well be producing biased estimates all around (Finkel 1995, chap. 5). With overtime data, what causes a variable at time t − 1 could continue to have effects at time t. Imagine that things influencing party identification at t − 1 are represented by an arrow from an error term (et − 1) to the variable, and things influencing vote at time t are represented by an arrow from an error term (et). One of these things could be subjective social class. If subjective social class influences party identification at t − 1, and subjective social class influences vote at t, then the error terms (et, et − 1) would be correlated. Such examples could be easily multiplied. A solution to this source of bias is to exogenize the suspect variables through the use of an instrumental variables approach, to which we now turn.         "
"13","To overcome the above biases—simultaneous equation bias or correlated error bias—the recommended procedure is construction of instruments, in a two‐stage process. (A classic exposition appears in Kmenta 1997; for a more current treatment, see Woolridge 2006.) In the first stage, the endogenous independent variable, Y, is regressed on proper exogenous variables, thus creating an instrumental variable Y′. In the second stage, this Y′ is substituted into the original equation, and reestimation takes place. The method “works” because the instrumental variable is effectively exogenous, thereby eliminating the source of the difficulty.         "
"14","A classic panel survey example of instrumental variables use comes from Fiorina (1981, 170), where he uses two‐stage probit (TSP) for construction of a 1974 party identification instrument to employ in predicting the 1976 presidential vote. It is worth reviewing his choice of exogenous variables to construct this instrument, for we take inspiration from them. They fall into the category of Socio‐Economic Variables (mid‐Atlantic region, Confederacy, central city, rural, unemployed, union, middle class, working class, high income, Catholic, minority, low education, high education, professional‐managerial, blue collar) and Basic Attitudes (presidential performance, Nixon pardon, personal financial situation, government employment performance, most important problem, civil rights; Fiorina 1981, 229–30).         "
"15","In column 1, Table 1B, one observes our basic equation 1, estimated using instrumental variables, to predict the 2004 presidential vote. Party identification in 2002 is an instrumental variable—PID′—constructed from available SES variables and basic attitudes in that 2002 ANES survey. (See the bottom of Table 1 for construction details.) On the one hand, the effect of party identification appears reduced, even compared to its weakest reported coefficient in Table 1A (see column 3). On the other hand, the effect of economic perception is increased, even over the strongest coefficient in Table 1A (see column 3). The implication is that, with these biases removed, the economic effect is stronger, relatively and absolutely. But this conclusion is premature. A number of challenges must be faced, most especially that of the exogenous status of the instruments.         "
"16","In constructing instrumental variables, the cardinal requirement is that the exogenous variables selected as building blocks truly meet the requirements of exogeneity. Otherwise, the instrument will be a “poor” one. (See the helpful discussion in Woolridge 2006, 525–40). Each exogenous variable (X) must be determined outside the system and not an object of causal explanation in the model. Further, it cannot be correlated with the error terms in the model. These standards are readily obtainable with most SES measures, such as those used here. For example, your race is something you are born with, as is religion usually. Gender, union membership, gross income group, age category, and years of schooling tend to be inertial, the “givens” of a voter's life at the time.         "
"17","However, it is more difficult for basic attitude variables to reach a standard of “pure exogeneity.” In Fiorina's example, from above, one may wonder about the exogenous status of presidential performance, one of his choices. Surely it is somewhat correlated with other things that influence vote, things that are represented in the error term. The same caution could be raised about the civil rights variable used. Of course, these concerns bear on our choice of basic attitudes to build our instrumental variable for party identification (column 1, Table 1B). We utilized two: 1996 presidential vote (as reported in 2000), and liberal‐conservative ideology as measured in 2000. While these variables do find precedent in Fiorina's (1981, Appendix B) selections, their exogenous status is not beyond dispute. Still, they would seem largely so, partly because they tap attitudes that are rather fixed, or events relatively distant in time.         "
"18","Recognizing the realities of survey research practice, it is tempting to “make do” with these respective lists of exogenous variables. However, since at a theoretical level the basic attitudes used in the instrument construction may be open to challenge, further testing seems necessary. Following a strategy effectively employed elsewhere, we propose different instruments, constructed under an increasingly rigorous standard of exogeneity (Bélanger et al. 2006). In Table 2, the party identification instrument (PID′) is built according to three different exogeneity conditions: broad, moderate, and strict. The results of estimation under broad conditions, appearing in column 1, Table 1B, have already been introduced. It is worth adding, at this point, that there the ratio of effects—party identification to economic perception, is 1.43 (i.e., .76/.53).         "
"19","The estimation results under moderate conditions appear in column 2, Table 1A. Here the variable of reported 1996 presidential vote was removed in constructing PID′. Note that the party identification effect actually goes up (compared to column 1), but so does the economic perception effect. The estimation results under strict conditions are perhaps of the most interest, for they offer the sternest test (see column 3, Table 1B). Here, all attitudinal variables were removed from the instrument construction, now based only on core SES variables. The economic effect goes up; the party effect goes down. Thus, the party‐economy ratio reduces to 1.21 (i.e., .93/.77). The suggestion is that, when party identification is properly measured, under conditions approximating pure exogeneity, its impact on the vote barely surpasses that of national economic evaluation.         "
"20","Thus far, emphasis has been on the measurement of party identification. This attention is not misplaced, given the role of partisanship in this controversy. However, it is also possible that economic perception, as measured in Table 1B, generates its own correlated error bias. For example, one might imagine that variable Z, represented in the error terms, influences vote and influences economic perception. Hence, it would seem a useful exercise to exogenize economic perception, and rerun the analysis. In Table 1C, this is done. The party identification instruments are constructed exactly as in Table 1B. The instrumental variable for national economic perception, ECN′, is constructed from a number of SES variables, plus political interest and the pocketbook.3 (The variables are detailed at the bottom of Table 1.) This instrument seems “good,” in that it correlates reasonably well with the original economic perception variable (at .43). One observes that the estimated coefficients change little, from Table 1B. The party‐economics effect ratio in the final column of Table 1C is 1.15 (i.e., .90/.78).         "
"21","We have carried out numerous causal tests, seeking to tease out more precise effects of party identification and economic perception on the vote. From an initial panel analysis one sees that, once temporal ordering of the causal structure is taken into account, party loses effective ground to the economy. Further, after an extensive exploration of exogeneity conditions, it becomes obvious that partisan effects do not much exceed economic effects, in this panel study. It is of interest to see to what extent these results survive replication, in another panel. Available studies with the full complement of variables, repeated measures, and substantial N required here are scarce. Fortunately, however, the 1990–92 ANES panel would seem to serve."
"22","It is in many ways ideal for replication of the foregoing tables from the later ANES panel. For both these presidential contests, a Republican president (a Bush) was contending for reelection, in the face of serious economic and military issues. Further, each panel survey affords the same party, economic, sociodemographic, and basic attitudinal items, as well as comparable sample sizes. In Table 2A are the preliminary panel estimates (to parallel those of Table 1A). The relative effects of the economy are even stronger, essentially at parity with party (column 3, Table 2A). In Table 2B, where party identification is exogenized as before (in Table 1B), economic effects sustain themselves. Indeed, under strict exogeneity conditions, economic effects essentially equal party effects in absolute value, .62/.66 (column 3, Table 2B). Lastly, in Table 2C, with party identification and economic perception both exogenized (as was done in Table 1C), we see that economic effects clearly exceed those of party, under conditions of both “broad” and “strict” exogeneity.         "
"23","There is value in making a general comparison of the 2002–2004 and 1990–92 panel results. We observe that, in both panels, once causality conditions are properly attended to, economic perception has a much larger vote influence than previously estimated cross‐sectionally, while party identification has a smaller one."
"24","While these U.S. panel results reinforce the importance of the economic vote, what holds for other democracies, under similar testing, remains to be seen. Economic voting has been much studied in the United Kingdom. (Some survey research examples are Alt 1979; Clarke et al. 2004; Johnston et al. 2000; Sanders 2003; Studlar, McAllister, and Ascui 1990.) We focus on the 1995–97 BES panel, because of its depth, and because this particular dataset has served as principal data source for the leading revisionist critique, from Evans and Andersen (2006). Another parliamentary democracy, Canada, has yielded numerous investigations evidencing economic voting. (Some examples are Blais et al. 2002; Carmichael 1990; Clarke and Stewart 1996; Gélineau and Bélanger 2005; Happy 1992; Nadeau and Blais 1993; Nadeau et al. 2000; Nevitte et al. 2000.) To illustrate, Clarke and Kornberg examined the determinants of the sitting conservative government popularity in the early 1990s and concluded that “many Canadians blame the federal government for the poor state of the national economy” and that “economic evaluations… have an important direct and indirect effect on Conservative support” (1992, 32, 50). Furthermore, Canada has available rich panel surveys of elections. Of these, we select the most contemporary, 2004–2006.         "
"25","Our aim is again to compare the economics and party coefficients, after estimating the same model (equation 1) in the same way as Table 1. That is, the model posits incumbent vote to be a function party identification, national retrospective economic evaluation, and selected control variables.4 (Details on the coding of all the variables appear at the bottom of Table 3.) For both countries, as with the United States case, the socioeconomic control variables include age, gender, education, and income. Also, leadership effects have been found important in these parliamentary systems (Blais et al. 2002; Clarke et al. 2004; Nadeau and Blais 1995; Nevitte et al. 2000). Therefore, an incumbent leader evaluation variable was included as a control. (It turns out that substantive conclusions about the impact of the economy and party remain basically unchanged, with or without this leadership control.) The estimates appear in Table 3.         "
"26"," Table 3A reports the British two‐stage ordered probit panel results for the full range of exogeneity tests. (Thus, they parallel the tests of Table 1C, the most rigorous battery.) One observes that, across all the exogeneity specifications, the economic perception coefficient somewhat exceeds the party identification coefficient. Further, it appears fairly stable, in itself, and relative to party. Under the strictest definition of exogeneity (in column 3, Table 3A), the party‐economy ratio is almost exactly at parity (i.e., .90/.97). Table 3B reports the comparable Canadian results. The economic perception coefficient appears quite stable across the three columns, more so than the party identification coefficient. Under a broader construction of exogeneity, the economic effect clearly exceeds that from party. Even under the strict exogeneity construction (column 3, Table 3B), the economic coefficient is still relatively strong, yielding up a party‐economy effects ratio of .90/.63 = 1.43. In these two countries, according to this panel evidence, the impact of economic perception on vote choice is strong, rivaling that of party identification, with which it approaches parity.         "
"27","There are two other panel survey studies of economic voting, Johnston et al. (2005) and Evans and Andersen (2006). Both examine United Kingdom panel surveys from the 1990s, the former the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), the latter the British Election Study (BES). For example, Johnston et al. (2005, Table 3) explain 1997 Conservative vote as a function of 1992 vote, economic perceptions, and socioeconomic controls. Note that their right‐hand‐side partisanship variable is lagged vote, not lagged party identification, as we have it. The immediate question is whether our results could differ simply because of the use of a different independent variable for partisanship. To test this possibility, we reestimated the BES models of Table 3, constructing and using the instruments for 1992 vote (V′), instead of for party identification (PID′). The results actually yield a slightly stronger effect for economic perception (e.g., at 1.08 under strict exogeneity) than for partisanship (e.g., at .93 under strict exogeneity). The same conclusion holds when the instrument is 1995 vote intention (V″) instead of PID′. Thus, the BES findings of Table 3 are reinforced. (Because of space considerations, these additional results are not reported in detail; however, they are available from the authors on request.)         "
"28","The Johnston et al. (2005) study does not employ an instrumental variable approach. Moreover, it examines only egocentric (pocketbook) measures, because the BHPS did not offer any sociotropic ones. Thus, direct comparison of their results to ours is not possible. Fortunately, the investigation of Evans and Andersen (2006) does employ, as we do, BES panel data to assess the impact of national economic retrospective evaluation during the 1997 election. However, they make different choices with regard to key questions of measurement, analysis, and specification, and these choices point to the reasons for the different conclusions.         "
"29","Let us consider measurement first, since the differences here are easy to see. Evans and Andersen use one dependent variable; we use another. Our dependent variable—vote for the incumbent party—is constructed from the standard BES vote question, of the general form “In the general election, which party candidate did you vote for?” That is to say, it is a vote variable. Their core models rely on a party variable, rather than a vote variable. Specifically, they employ the item which asks the respondent to “choose a phrase from this card to say how you feel (italics added) about the Conservative Party. Strongly against (1); Against (2); Neither in favor nor against (3); In favor (4); Strongly in favor (5)” (Evans and Andersen 2006, 197–98). Because of its affective format, this item reads very much like a party identification measure. Indeed, the response wording seems quite close to the BES party identification measure. In full, that measure asks: “Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, or what? Would you call yourself very strong [party named], fairly strong, or not very strong?” (Clarke et al. 2004, 338–39). The use of a party identification‐like dependent variable, rather than the dependent variable of vote, which has been used almost exclusively in the survey research on economic voting, makes comparison across models problematic (Lewis‐Beck and Stegmaier 2007).         "
"30","The measurement choice for the dependent variable also bears on issues of analysis. The analysis goes forward in two phases. First, a graphical chain analysis is carried out, with the above party dependent variable, call it Pt, ultimately predicted from itself measured four times prior (in 1996, 1995, 1994, and 1992), and from economic perception, call it Et (measured in 1997). They find that the magnitude of the Et coefficient is progressively reduced, as the prior values of Pt are added to the model, and ends up a small number (Evans and Andersen 2006, 198 and Figures 3 and 4). This result fails to surprise, given the extremely demanding estimation assumptions of graphical chain analysis (Cox and Wermuth 1993). These assumptions include those required of the more commonly known technique of recursive causal modeling (Kmenta 1986, 717–20). In particular, no reciprocal causation is permitted, and the error terms must be uncorrelated. Since Evans and Andersen (2006, 194, 198) explicitly argue for reciprocal causation between economics and politics, they recognize that the graphic chain analysis is insufficient. Nevertheless, they retain its basic results, using its biased significance tests to define the equations of the structural equation models (SEM) they go on to estimate: “Structural equation models were then used to estimate models with identical structures to those uncovered from the graphical chains” (Evans and Andersen 2006, 198).         "
"31","An SEM is a set of equations, estimable if certain conditions are met (Long 1983). It does allow errors to be correlated, representing an advance over the graphical chain analysis. However, like any system of simultaneous equations, other assumptions are required for estimators to be desirable. Foremostly, the equations must be identified, normally meaning at minimum that each has a permissible number of exogenous and endogenous variables, according to the order condition (Kmenta 1986, 660–72). Unfortunately, Evans and Andersen (2006) do not demonstrate that their models are identified. Further, readers cannot begin to assess the identification condition themselves, because they neither present the set of equations estimated, nor explicitly state which variables are exogenous and which are endogenous. However, by their own argument, economics influences politics and vice versa: “If these subjective assessments are influenced by the very phenomena that they are assumed to affect—partisan attitudes—their impact will be overestimated if this reciprocal relationship is not taken into account” (Evans and Andersen 2006, 195). Given this reciprocal link, the economics and party variables are necessarily endogenous.5 Therefore, before estimation goes forward, they ought to be made effectively exogenous, by some instrumental variables‐like procedure. Since Evans and Anderson have not done this, their reported coefficients risk being decidedly biased.         "
"32","Last, but not least, is the issue of model specification. It could be that the different substantive findings regarding the economic perception coefficient are a product of using somewhat different sets of control variables. Therefore, we reran the UK models (those in Table 3A), substituting their control variables, and measuring them in the same way. Those variables are as follows: class, age, gender, education, region, political interest, attention to politics on television, and attention to politics in newspapers (Evans and Andersen 2006, 198). These new results generated substantively similar conclusions about the strong importance of economics for the voter. Under the strictest exogeneity conditions, economic perception even surpassed party identification slightly in its effect, .76/.52, respectively.         "
"33","Conventional wisdom holds that economic perceptions wield a major impact on democratic vote choice. The revisionist view dismisses the conventional wisdom, arguing that reports of strong economic voting rest on distortions induced by partisan bias. To explore this charge, a number of tests on contemporary U.S. presidential election panel data were first conducted. In a preliminary panel analysis, the electoral impact of economic perception actually increases (both absolutely and relatively), once the time dimension of causality is taken into account. In more sophisticated panel analyses, with exogeneity conditions given full consideration, the strength of economic perception on the vote choice heightens further. This result was replicated on the 1990–92 U.S. presidential election panel."
"34","To challenge these findings comparatively, the same equation was estimated on UK and Canadian election panels. Again, sociotropic economic evaluations were found to have strong effects on vote choice. Moreover, the finding is consistent across the different time periods and countries, despite the fact that the economic context was quite different in 1992, 1997, 2004, and 2006. In 1992, the U.S. election was fought in the aftermath of a recession. In 1997, the UK economy was improving at the time of the election, following a period of recession and monetary crisis. The 2004 U.S. election and the 2006 Canadian election came after an extended time of economic growth. The fact that our results hold up in these varied national and economic contexts gives us further confidence in their robustness."
"35","In reality, conventional cross‐sectional analysis exaggerates the impact of party identification, rather than the impact of economic perception. It is possible to be fairly precise about the degree of exaggeration. The effect ratio (party:economics) in a conventional survey analysis is about 3:1 in the United States, according to Table 1A. However, the effect ratio in a strictly exogenized panel analysis falls to just above 1:1 (column 3, Table 1C). Similar changes occur in the other nations analyzed. For the United Kingdom, the party:economics ratio for a conventional cross‐sectional analysis of the 1997 election is close to 4:1. But in the fully exogenized panel analysis, it drops to about 1:1 (column 3, Table 3A). In Canada, we observe a comparable decline, from 4:1 in the cross‐sectional analysis, to just under 1.5:1.0. In words, usual work carried out on a cross‐sectional national election survey in these countries risks giving party identification perhaps three times the impact it should have. Put the other way, it makes economic perceptions appear something like one‐third as strong as they are in fact. The revisionist critique of distortion coming from cross‐sectional data appears correct in worrying about bias. However, unexpectedly, the bias concerning the economic coefficient is substantially downward (rather than upward).         "
"36","Our efforts reinforce an earlier reservation raised in direct response to the revisionist critique: “Usual measures of partisanship may act as an overcontrol in economic voting models, thereby deflating estimates of the economic effect. In future analyses, researchers should strive to make partisan measures, such as party identification, as exogenous as possible” (Lewis‐Beck 2006, 211). One prescription, coming out of our study, is continued replication of such panel analyses, for other elections, in other countries. These certainly provide opportunities for fresh investigation. In the meantime, we should take solace from the present evidence. First, it shows that economics does really matter for the vote choice, even more so than previously thought. The strength of this economic voting reminds us that democratic governments, after all, can be held accountable to the electorate. Second, it vindicates the enormous amount of research that has come up with positive findings on economic voting. These cumulative efforts at scientific achievement were not in vain.         "
