"1","Over the last 30 years, an extensive literature has explored how politicians bargain over policies that produce uncertain outcomes. This work specifies precise conditions under which individuals will acquire expertise about the connection between policies and outcomes, and then demonstrate how they use this expertise to their advantage in communications with others who may not share their preferences. Building off the core insights of Crawford and Sobel (1982), political scientists have constructed signaling models that investigate these communications within a wide range of strategic political environments, including committee‐floor relations within Congress (Gilligan and Krehbiel 1987, 1990; Krehbiel 1992), agency oversight across the legislative and executive branches of government (Callander 2008; Huber and Shipan 2002), civil service reform (Gailmard and Patty 2007), and political debate more generally (Austen‐Smith 1990).         "
"2","For our purposes, three characteristics of this work warrant attention. First, and as others (e.g., Callander 2008; Hirsch and Shotts 2008) have pointed out, existing models too easily convert laypersons into experts. Under the canonical specification in which outcomes are expressed as the sum of policy and a constant stochastic shock, once a layperson learns how one policy relates to an outcome, she can infer the outcome of any policy—a feature of the mapping function understood as “full invertibility.” As a result, the first mover in a game will have no incentive to signal detailed information to the layperson because the layperson will simply appropriate the information in order to shift the policy to one that produces her ideal point.1"
"3","Second, all of the models on offer require that each policy instrument generates one, and only one, outcome. When modeling bargaining between political actors who share the same jurisdiction, such as city council members, this simplifying assumption may be warranted. It is less defensible, however, when examining bargains struck between political actors with markedly different constituencies, such as presidents and members of Congress. Policies, after all, routinely yield outcomes for a particular district or state that look quite different from the outcome for the nation as a whole. Reducing steel tariffs, cutting farm subsidies, or increasing insurance regulations may benefit the country as a whole while also hurting local economies in Pennsylvania, Kansas, and Connecticut. Conversely, federal grants and aid may materially improve lives in specific communities without having much of an impact at all on the national welfare."
"4","Third, by construction, the existing models assume that each policy outcome is equally salient for all political actors. But as soon as we allow policies to generate multiple outcomes, we confront the possibility that political actors value these outcomes differently. This is a particularly salient feature of negotiations between presidents and members of Congress. For as Lewis and Moe (2009, 371, 370) observe, because they are “national leaders with a broad, heterogeneous constituency, presidents think in grander terms than members of Congress,” who themselves tend to evaluate policy “on the special (often local) interests that can bring them security and popularity in office.”         "
"5","Our model addresses the three limitations that characterize recent theoretical work on information acquisition and signaling. First, following Callander (2008), we incorporate a mapping function that has the desired properties generated by partial and proportional invertibility—that is, a function that offers some insurance to a layperson against uncertainty when an expert proposes a single policy; and that the amount of uncertainty that a layperson confronts increases in the extent to which she deviates from the expert's proposal. Second, we allow for a single policy to generate two outcomes: one of which concerns national affairs, the other local. Third, and finally, we allow politicians to disagree about the importance of these outcomes. With these three modifications, our model simultaneously supports equilibria in which one player will invest in expertise even when the other can amend his proposal and demonstrates that presidential bargaining success can increase even when ideal points are held constant.         "
"6","The game consists of two players—a president and a representative member of Congress.2 Hence, , where P identifies the President, and L identifies the Legislator with whom he bargains. In the game, the President and Legislator interact with one another to select a policy . This policy exists on a one‐dimensional line, which can be thought of as denoting liberalism and conservatism (with values on the left indicating a liberal policy and values on the right indicating a conservative policy) or monetary commitments (with larger values indicating more expensive policies). We assume that policy is bounded between 0 and 1 for mathematical clarity, but in principal, the policy space should be thought of as including all possible policies.3"
"7","Each policy p results in both a national political outcome  and a local political outcome . Like the policy itself, each of these outcomes exists on a one‐dimensional line. The mapping function from policy to national political outcome is ψ1, such that . Likewise, the mapping function from policy to local political outcome is ψ2, such that . Thus, each policy p produces a pair of relevant outcomes  for the players in the game. Both the President and Legislator have preferences over each of these outcomes, though, as we will see later, their utility need not weigh the two outcomes equally. The President's most preferred outcomes are denoted  while the Legislator's most preferred outcomes are denoted . To simplify notation, the Legislator's most preferred outcomes are normalized to (0, 0). Consequently,  can be thought of as the Euclidean distance between the President's and the Legislator's most preferred outcomes.4"
"8","Each player may pay a cost  to acquire expertise about the outcome j produced by policy p. To allow for the possibility that the President and Legislator may pay different costs to acquire expertise, we denote  and  as the costs the President must pay, and  and  as the costs the Legislator must pay.            "
"9","The game begins with the President deciding whether to acquire expertise on how policies translate into national and/or local outcomes. The President may choose to acquire expertise on one, both, or neither mapping function. In a slight abuse of notation, , where A1 indicates the President has acquired expertise on how policies translate into national outcomes, A2 indicates the President has acquired expertise on how policies translate into local outcomes, B indicates the President has acquired expertise on how policies translate into both national and local outcomes, and ∅ indicates the President has not acquired any expertise. After choosing whether or not to acquire expertise, the President then proposes a policy ; that is, a policy that will produce an outcome between the Legislator's ideal outcome (0) and the President's ideal outcome ().5 In total, the President's strategy set is characterized as: .            "
"10","The Legislator observes the President's actions (whether the President acquired expertise, and the President's proposal ). She then chooses whether to invest in acquiring expertise on how policies map onto local and/or national outcomes. Subsequently, she enacts a new policy . Thus, the Legislator's available actions are: . Since the game is sequential, the strategy set for the Legislator is a mapping function from each action of the President to a set of actions of the Legislator: formally, . The enacted policy  yields an outcome , and payoffs are realized.            "
"11","The President, we postulate, cares only about the national political outcome.6 Hence, as the gap between the President's preferred national outcome and the actual national outcome increases, the President's utility decreases, which is captured by the expression . Because the President's utility is unaffected by the distance between his preferred local outcome and the actual local outcome, the only other relevant portions of the President's utility function are the costs he may have paid to acquire expertise on how policies translate into outcomes. The President's utility, then, is given by: , where  is an indicator for whether the President acquired expertise on national outcomes, and  is an indicator for whether the President acquired expertise on local outcomes.7"
"12","The Legislator's utility function is slightly more complicated. Though the President remains preoccupied exclusively with national outcomes, the Legislator cares about both national and local outcomes. Therefore, the Legislator's utility is defined over the distance between policy outcomes and her ideal points along both dimensions—that is, her utility decreases when either  or  increases. We recognize that the Legislator may not value both outcomes equally. Indeed, such an assumption seems unlikely. We therefore introduce a parameter  to scale the relative significance of national vis‐à‐vis local outcomes. Like the President, the other portions of the Legislator's utility function reflect the costs that may have been paid to acquire expertise. The Legislator's utility is given by: , where the first two terms identify the relative losses (weighted by ) associated with policy outcomes that diverge from the Legislator's national and local ideal points, and the latter two terms identify the costs that may have been paid to acquire expertise about either of the two mapping functions.            "
"13","Players can only choose policies, but their utilities are defined over outcomes. Before we can derive their optimal strategies, therefore, we first need to characterize how policies translate into outcomes. Depending upon the behaviors of the President and Legislator, policy  produces outcome j as follows:               "
"14","The mappings of policies onto outcomes, you will notice, vary across different subgames, depending upon the acquisition of expertise and the willingness of a lay Legislator to abide the policy proposal of an expert President. In each case,  is common knowledge and represents the sensitivity of outcome  to policy p, whereby larger values indicate greater sensitivity.8 Last,  is a stochastic shock, which characterizes the uncertainty of the policymaking environment (more on this below). Players have common knowledge that  is a random variable, distributed uniformly with support .9 The multiplicative combination of  and  generates the effect of proportional invertibility discussed earlier, for as a lay Legislator's enacted policy deviates farther from an expert President's policy proposal, the uncertainty cost (which both the President and Legislator will incur) associated with the variance of  increases.            "
"15","In three subgames, different mapping functions characterize how policy p produces outcome j. In the first, the Legislator becomes an expert on outcome j, in which case she pays no uncertainty cost, and the mapping function reduces to . This captures the intuition that by acquiring expertise, the Legislator knows exactly what outcome a policy will produce and therefore does not care whether the President's proposal is based on expert information or not, as she will ignore it regardless.            "
"16","Second, if neither the Legislator nor the President acquires expertise, then the mapping becomes . This captures the notion that a lay Legislator does not place any stock in the proposal made by a lay President, and as a result, partial and proportional invertibility of the mapping function is lost, and all policies carry an uncertainty cost equal to the full value of the variance of .            "
"17","Third, and finally, if the Legislator remains a layperson and the President acquires expertise on j, then the mapping function becomes . By introducing , the mapping function becomes partially and proportionally invertible. As  increases, the Legislator's enacted policy deviates farther and farther from the President's proposal; and consequently,  is being multiplied by a larger number, yielding a quadratically increasing uncertainty cost. Because , though, it follows that , meaning that  for all p. In words, the uncertainty cost associated with a proportionally invertible signal from the President can never exceed the uncertainty cost that the Legislator pays when both players lack expertise. Hence, when the Legislator is able to guard against some policy uncertainty, she is always made better off.            "
"18","Thus far, we have considered the uncertainty cost structures of a single mapping function. Central to our theory, though, is the recognition that policies can generate multiple outcomes, each of which has its own mapping function. If a Legislator acquires expertise about only the local mapping function, she still faces potential uncertainty costs associated with the national mapping function. Provided that the President has acquired expertise about the national mapping function, of course, the Legislator can avoid this uncertainty cost by simply enacting the President's proposal. So doing, though, she may well be enacting a policy that she knows will generate a local outcome that is less preferred. And to the extent that she deviates from the President, she will have to pay an uncertainty cost on the national mapping even as she pays none at all on the local one. Hence, just as the Legislator faces an uncertainty‐bias trade‐off within each mapping function, so too does she face one across the mapping functions."
"19","Why should the mappings of policies onto outcomes vary according to the expertise of the President and Legislator? The motivating intuition here is simple enough. When either the Legislator is herself an expert or if she enacts policy that perfectly represents the views of an expert President, then she can be expected to write policy that is sufficiently clear and precise so that only a single outcome will be realized. On the other hand, when a lay Legislator tries her hand at writing policy, she unavoidably introduces ambiguities and imprecisions that permit a variety of interpretations and, by extension, a variety of plausible outcomes. But to the extent that she writes policy that reflects an expert President's proposal, the lay Legislator can sharpen the language of a proposal and thereby reduce the range of possible interpretations and, again by extension, the range of resulting outcomes."
"20","In this model, acquiring expertise on outcome j does not reveal the true value of  to player i. Rather, acquiring expertise affects the indicator function attached to , so that the effect of  on a policy outcome is eliminated. In this sense, the acquisition of expertise constitutes the purchase of insurance against uncertainty rather than the translation of uncertainty into certainty. Hence,  itself can be thought of as a lottery that captures the uncertainty associated with a policy for laypersons. Players, under this formulation, do not update their beliefs about . Rather, by becoming experts, players no longer play the lottery associated with  when selecting a policy.            "
"21","Because this is a game of complete information, the equilibrium solution concept is subgame perfection."
"22","Depending on the values assumed by the parameters , this game supports multiple equilibria. Here, we focus on one wherein the President invests only in national expertise (and therefore has no additional knowledge about local outcomes) and proposes a new policy, and then the Legislator invests only in local expertise (and hence has imperfect knowledge of national outcomes) and enacts a new policy. In this section, we outline the conditions needed to sustain this equilibrium and identify the resulting policy outcomes.               "
"23","Theorem 1.For sufficiently large  and sufficiently small  and , an equilibrium exists wherein the President acquires expertise on only national outcomes and proposes a policy that produces either his ideal national outcome or, under select circumstances, the Legislator's. The Legislator then acquires expertise on only local outcomes and enacts a policy that either is closer to her ideal point (in the case when the President proposes his ideal point) or that perfectly matches the President's proposal (in the case when the President proposes her ideal point).                  "
"24","Proof. See online Appendix A.            "
"25","In order for this equilibrium to hold, two conditions must be met. First, given that the President has learned how policies translate into national outcomes and made a policy proposal to the Legislator, the Legislator must prefer over all other available options to learn how policies translate into local outcomes, to forsake the opportunity to learn how policies translate into national outcomes, and then to enact a new policy. This condition is satisfied when  is sufficiently large and  is sufficiently small. Second, knowing what the Legislator will do in response to each of the President's strategic options, the President must prefer over all his other options to learn how policies translate into national outcomes (but not local outcomes) and to make a new policy proposal. This will be true when the cost to the President of acquiring expertise on national outcomes () is sufficiently small.            "
"26","Notice that this equilibrium supports two sets of actions by the President and Legislator. In the first, the President proposes the policy that induces his exact ideal point, , which the Legislator then amends to some value  Consider, though, the case where  generates the outcome . In this instance, the Legislator amends the President's proposal to such a degree that the outcome, in expectation, generates her own ideal point. Given that this is her optimal strategy, however, the President would be better off just setting policy exactly at her ideal point and thereby eliminating the uncertainty cost of having a layperson set policy. As a result, there exists a basic threshold at which the President shifts from proposing his ideal point to proposing the Legislator's ideal point.10 As a result, when concessions occur, they amount to capitulation.11"
"27","Other equilibria can be derived from the model. For the most part, though, such equilibria rely on parameter values that seem implausible—for instance, that the Legislator's costs of acquiring local expertise are greater than those of acquiring national expertise; and, further, that the cost to the Legislator of acquiring national expertise is lower than the cost to the President of doing so. Moving forward, therefore, we focus on the comparative statics of this particular equilibrium."
"28","In our model, presidential success is characterized as the distance between the President's ideal policy () and the Legislator's enacted policy (). We denote this distance . Taking the partial derivative of  with respect to λ, we find that presidential success weakly increases as the Legislator attaches greater importance to national outcomes relative to local outcomes.12 When the inequality in Theorem 1 does not hold, and the president capitulates to the Legislator, the effect of λ on  is null. Otherwise, the effect is strictly decreasing.            "
"29","It is possible to recover the key comparative static with respect to λ in a model that relaxes the strong assumption that local outcomes do not figure at all in the President's utility. Consider, for instance, a model in which both the President and Legislator each have their own λ parameter:  and , respectively. In this case, the President's utility function would become , and the Legislator's utility function would become . In this setup, the core comparative static persists as long as . In words, all we need to assume is that, when weighing national outcomes against local outcomes, the President assigns greater importance to national outcomes than does the Legislator.               "
"30","As specified, our model requires the President to only introduce policies in the interior space between his and the Legislator's ideal policy. As a result, the President regularly proposes the policy that produces his ideal national outcome. If we allow the President to propose any policy , and if we further allow the Legislator to amend any proposal, strategic proposal making can optimally occur. To see this, notice that the President can anticipate the amount by which the Legislator will amend his proposal. This amount, after all, makes the Legislator indifferent between the relative policy losses to be had (which are weakly decreasing in the policy reduction toward her ideal point) and the uncertainty costs associated with deviating from an expert President's proposal (which are strictly increasing in the same policy shift). The President, therefore, has clear incentives to increase his proposal by exactly this amount, so that the Legislator will subsequently amend it back to his ideal point.13 Moreover, because of the proportional invertibility of the mapping function, the President will rightly anticipate that the Legislator will not amend this more extreme proposal by an even larger amount. For even though the Legislator knows that the President is asking for more than he really wants whenever he proposes , she cannot respond in kind without incurring an even larger uncertainty cost.               "
"31","By allowing the President to submit any proposal within the entire policy space, the equilibrium identified in Theorem 1 and its associated comparative statics do not entirely unravel. If the Legislator simply commits up front to ignoring any proposal that is greater than the President's ideal point, and that therefore reflects not just any expertise acquired but also his effort to negate the Legislator's subsequent ability to amend this proposal, then our equilibrium is no longer subgame perfect, but it remains a Nash equilibrium, which is sufficient to support our core predictions regarding λ. Moreover, we can recover subgame perfection in this equilibrium by introducing to the players' respective utility functions costs associated with verifiably extreme proposal making, a move that is broadly consistent with the formal literature on “blame‐game vetoes” (Groseclose and McCarty 2001) and scholars' widespread recognition of the importance of position taking more generally (Mayhew 1974).               "
"32","Certain events can be expected to change λ and thereby alter congressional support for the president. Some events—such as regional natural disasters—may enhance certain members' concern for their local districts, yielding a lower value of λ and a Congress less disposed to support the president. Other events, though, may have a more uniform effect across legislators and, therefore, may be more amenable to empirical investigation. We consider one such possibility: major military conflicts. A significant body of research underscores the ways in which wars reorient both public and elite opinion around national considerations about security, citizens' shared status as Americans, and the competitiveness of the United States in the international arena (for a review, see Howell 2011). In conjunction, this historical work and our theory predict that policies enacted during war, all else equal, will more closely approximate the president's preferences than those enacted during peace.         "
"33","Budgets provide an ideal venue in which to explore this possibility. The basic setup of our theory, after all, constitutes something of a distillation of the appropriations process, wherein each year the president proposes and Congress disposes a federal budget. Since the enactment of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the president has been responsible for composing a complete budget proposal, which is submitted to Congress each year, and which initiates the actual authorization and appropriations process. Producing the president's budget is no trivial undertaking. In multiple volumes and thousands of pages, the president's budget identifies funding levels not just for individual agencies but also for individual projects and employees within those agencies. The president then supplements specific requests with extensive policy and legislative recommendations, detailed economic forecasts, and exhaustive accounts on the performance and finances of federal agencies and programs. When they ultimately get around to crafting a final budget, members of Congress rely upon the president's budget more than any other document for information about operations within the federal government—another fact that is consistent with our model's allowance for informational asymmetries between the branches of government (Schick 2007, 90, 189–93).         "
"34","Moreover, and as others (e.g., Canes‐Wrone 2006) have pointed out, appropriations mitigate a host of problems endemic to empirical work on separation of powers issues. First, and perhaps foremost, budgets help attenuate endogeneity concerns associated with presidential position taking. Unlike the traditional legislative process, the appropriations process does not permit presidents to remain silent on particularly controversial bills or members of Congress to refuse to cast judgment on presidential proposals. Second, with budgets, unlike legislation, we have a reasonably clear and continuous measure of presidential success—and one, moreover, that can be readily compared across policy domains. Third, as others have argued (Fenno 1966), presidents tend to want to give more money to agencies than do legislators, an empirical regularity that lends itself to relatively clean empirical testing. Hence, the more members of Congress wish to accommodate the president's proposal, the smaller the observed differences between proposed and actual appropriations will be. And should members decide to give the president exactly what he wants, these differences will vanish altogether.         "
"35","We track budgetary proposals and allotments for the same 77 agencies and programs that Kiewiet and McCubbins (1991) analyzed in their work on delegation. In the empirical analyses that follow, therefore, the unit of observation is a particular agency and/or program budget in a particular year. The dataset spans 74 years, from 1933 to 2006 inclusive. In online Appendix B, we provide extensive information about the agencies included in our sample.            "
"36","In total, we have 3,201 observational units, which is significantly less than the possible number of cases supported by this dataset (77 agencies times 74 years yields 5,698 observations). The cause for the drop‐off is threefold. First, in just a handful of instances, budgetary data for a particular agency in a particular year are simply not available. Second, we recognize that in the first year of a president's first term, the official budget proposal comes from the previous president. We therefore drop these observations, limiting the sample to the last three years of a president's first term and all four years of the president's second term. Most commonly, though, an agency‐year observation does not exist either because the year precedes the agency's establishment or because the year appears after the agency's merger with another agency, internal division, or outright termination. If an agency's entry and exit from the dataset are plausibly exogenous, then the resulting unbalanced structure of our panel is readily accommodated by our empirical model's fixed‐effect specification, which we detail next."
"37","Our dependent variable characterizes discrepancies between proposed and final appropriations for each agency in each year. The distribution of these differences reveals substantial skewness. As our dependent variable, therefore, we take the natural log of the absolute value of the difference between proposed and final appropriations for each agency in each year—that is, ). Larger values of this variable indicate greater discrepancy between what the president requested and what Congress ultimately granted; smaller values indicate less discrepancy.14 When interpreting the effects of any particular covariate, positive values indicate an expansion of the difference between proposed and final appropriations, while negative values indicate a contraction.            "
"38","Though Congress can readily impede executive functioning, it may have a more difficult time either galvanizing existing executive functions or jump‐starting altogether new ones. To account for this asymmetry, we consider another dependent variable that continuously measures final appropriations that are lower than the president's proposal but that treats appropriations that exceed proposals as equivalent to ones that exactly meet them—that is,  if , and zero otherwise.15"
"39","Our primary independent variable of interest is war, which proxies for the importance of national outcomes (λ). Following other scholars (e.g., Clark 2006; Epstein et al. 2005), we identify major wars as World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the Afghanistan War. To be identified as a war year, the United States must have been at war when appropriations were proposed. Hence, 1941 is not coded as a war year, since the United States did not enter World War II until after the Pearl Harbor attacks of December 7. Meanwhile, 1991 is coded as a war year, as Bush issued his proposal while the Gulf War remained ongoing, even though Congress set final appropriations after that war had ended. The variable “War” therefore identifies the following calendar years: 1942–45; 1951–53; 1965–73; 1991; 2002–2006 (when our panel ends).            "
"40","The likelihood that Congress accommodates the president's requests depends upon more than just the presence of peace or war. Most importantly, perhaps, it depends upon just how much money the president requests. At the margin, we expect that Congress will look more favorably upon smaller requests than larger ones. We therefore control for the logged value of the president's proposal for each agency in each year."
"41","Congress's response to the president surely also depends upon the level of political support that he enjoys within its chambers. Presidents who confront congresses with large numbers of ideological or partisan supporters are likely to secure appropriations that more closely approximate their requests than presidents who face off against congresses dominated by the opposition party. Following Kiewiet and McCubbins (1985a, 1985b), we therefore control for the percent of House seats held by the president's party in each year.            "
"42","We also include three economic indicators: the average unemployment rate during the year when appropriations are proposed and set; the national growth rate since the previous year; and the total budget deficit from the previous year. One might expect that presidents receive greater popular support when the economy is doing well, and further, that the economy might do better in times of war due to increased government spending. By controlling for these three economic indicators, we preclude their ability to bias the effect of war on presidential bargaining success."
"43","All of our statistical models include fixed effects that account for all observable and unobservable time‐invariant characteristics of individual agencies and presidents. Identification in the model, therefore, comes from changes in proposals and appropriations within agencies and within presidential administrations. Finally, to account for any serial correlation, we conservatively cluster the standard errors on agencies.16"
"44","Table 1 presents the estimated impact of war on Congress's willingness to abide by the president's budgetary requests. The effect, as expected, is negative, substantively large, and statistically significant. During periods of war, differences between proposed and final appropriations attenuate substantially. Taking the inverse log of the point estimate, this translates into a roughly 26% decrease in the average discrepancy between proposed and final appropriations for our sample of agencies during the period under investigation.            "
"45","The other variables in the model also behave as expected. Presidents who confront congresses with larger numbers of House copartisans enjoy higher levels of budgetary success than do presidents who must work with larger numbers of partisan opponents—an effect that is substantively large and statistically significant. Congress demonstrates greater accommodation to the president's proposed budget when national growth rates are large and less accommodation when available revenues (as measured by budget deficits) are relatively scarce. Consistent with expansionary fiscal policy during periods of unemployment, presidents also experience more accommodation from Congress when unemployment rates are high. We also find that Congress appropriates monies that more closely approximate smaller budgetary requests than for larger ones—another effect that is substantively large and highly statistically significant. Finally, the agency and president fixed effects, which are not reported in order to conserve space, are both jointly significant."
"46","As alternative characterizations of the dependent variable, we have estimated models that consider the logged absolute value of the difference between proposed and final appropriations as a percentage of the president's proposal for each agency in each year—that is, . We have estimated models with the dependent variable as the raw differences between proposed and final appropriations in columns 1 and 2—that is, as . We have examined the dependent variable as the proportion of the president's proposal that is enacted into law—that is, . In an effort to address the possibility of asymmetric effects associated with under‐ and overappropriations, we also have set an upper limit on this proportion at one, such that  if , and  otherwise. And finally, we also have utilized a measure developed by Canes‐Wrone (2006) in her study of the impact of public appeals on Congress's willingness to abide the president's budgetary proposals. Canes‐Wrone estimates the absolute value of the difference in annual percentage changes in presidential proposals and annual percentage changes in final appropriations—that is, . Every one of these alternative specifications furnished comparable results.            "
"47","We also have explored alternative model specifications, including ones that exclude the president's proposal from the regressors; include the raw value of the president's proposal; include subsets of the economic variables; account for the partisan composition of the Senate as well as (or in lieu of) the House; exclude the substantial number of president and agency‐specific fixed effects; control for Stimson's (1999) “public mood” measure; characterize president‐Congress disagreements in terms of standard ideal point estimates; and include controls for periods of unified and divided government, election years, public approval of the president, each agency's budget authority from the previous year, and the president's term in office. In nearly every instance, the main results with respect to war hold.17"
"48","As Neustadt (1954) documents in his classic article on budgetary clearance, the president did not immediately assume full control over the proposal‐making process the moment that Congress granted it to him in 1921. Rather, the construction of budgetary clearance procedures constituted a work in progress, with the most significant strides being made in 1939, when the Bureau of the Budget was officially recognized as an agent of the president with new, comprehensive oversight powers, and 1947, when James Webb, Truman's new Director of the Budget, overhauled and strengthened budgetary review processes. We therefore reestimated our main models for the post‐1938 and post‐1946 periods. The recovered estimates associated with war are indistinguishable from those presented in Table 1.            "
"49","We also have estimated a variety of models designed to account for changes in Congress's propensity to support the president over the course of a war. To the extent that we find any evidence of temporal effects, they suggest that appropriations more closely approximate presidential proposals later in a war rather than earlier. For example, when estimating the same model as shown in column 1 of Table 1 but adding a simple counter for the number of years that had passed since the onset of war, we observe a negative effect that just misses standard thresholds of statistical significance (p = 0.106). Other models that include indicator variables for each year of a war, or that isolate only the first year of a war, generate comparable effects. And in no instance do we find any evidence that congressional accommodation is confined to the early stages of a war.            "
"50","Up until now, we have provided estimates of the average effect of five wars on the budgetary allotments of 77 agencies. In Table 2, however, we distinguish budgets for defense and nondefense agencies. In both instances, and regardless of the particular statistical model we estimate, the effect of war is negative and substantial. Wars have comparable effects on Congress's willingness to abide presidential proposals for defense and domestic agencies alike. Though the estimated effect of war is not always significantly different from zero, none of the separate estimates for defense‐ and nondefense‐related agencies are statistically distinguishable from each other. The other background controls also tend to perform similarly in both defense and nondefense policy.            "
"51","Though all of these five wars raised the salience of national considerations, they did not do so equally. As discussed in Howell (2011), two of our five wars did the most to alter the terms of interbranch deliberations over domestic policy: World War II and the post‐September 11 wars. Although the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf wars undoubtedly involved massive troop deployments, prolonged military commitments, and sizeable expenditures, they did not do nearly as much to alter the terms of domestic policy debates. Assuming this is right, then our theory suggests that budgetary appropriations during World War II and the post‐September 11 wars, which we shall call the “High λ Wars,” should even more closely approximate the president's proposals than they do during our other wars, which we refer to as the “Moderate λ Wars.”            "
"52","On this score, Table 3 presents supportive evidence. Columns 1 and 2 replicate the models estimated in Table 1, except this time, we disaggregate World War II and the post‐9/11 wars from the Vietnam, Korean, and Persian Gulf wars. So doing, we find that the main effects of both High λ Wars and Moderate λ Wars are negative and statistically significantly different from zero for both characterizations of the dependent variable. Beyond that, though, we also find that these two estimated effects are significantly different from one another. Indeed, the estimated effects for High λ Wars are roughly three to four times larger in magnitude than those for Moderate λ Wars. In column 1, the effects of Moderate λ Wars are statistically distinguishable from High λ Wars at p = 0.07, while in column 2, they are statistically distinguishable at p = 0.03. This suggests that at least with regard to budgetary politics, the differences observed across wars can be just as significant as those observed between periods of war and peace. The coefficients on each of the control variables, meanwhile, are consistent with the results of Table 1.            "
"53","In this subsection, we investigate the incidence of strategic proposal making by tracking budgetary requests for agencies in war and peace years. We then account for the biases that such strategic behavior on the part of the president can introduce by instrumenting on presidential proposals. We do not find any evidence that our core findings are an artifact of strategic proposal making."
"54","If presidents scale back their proposals during war, particularly those involving domestic agencies and programs, then confidence in our preferred interpretation necessarily erodes. Such behavior, after all, might represent presidential efforts to accommodate a more provident Congress. On the other hand, if presidential proposals remain constant or increase during war, then it is hard to tell a plausible story in which our results derive from heightened presidential accommodation to Congress."
"55","Figure 1 plots the average peace‐ and wartime proposals for each agency within those presidential administrations for which both observations are observed. The y‐axis denotes wartime values, and the x‐axis denotes peacetime values. By construction, observations from those presidents who served only in time of peace or war (Eisenhower, Kennedy, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Clinton) are excluded from the analysis, as they do not contribute anything to our estimates of the impact of war. Most observations for all proposals (far left panel), as well as the subset of defense (middle) and nondefense (far right) proposals, are clustered right around the 45‐degree line, indicating a rough equivalence of war‐ and peacetime proposals. Those that stray, meanwhile, almost always do so above the 45‐degree line.               "
"56","Presidential Budget Requests during War and Peace"
"57","Note: Limiting the analyses to the six presidents (Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Johnson, Nixon, and George H. W. Bush) who submitted budget requests during times of both peace and war, we calculated the average agency budget requests for each president during peacetime and wartime. The x‐axes in the above plots represent presidents' average peacetime requests, and the y‐axes represent presidents' average wartime requests. Amounts shown are the logged values of the budget requests in 1983 dollars. Points located above the 45‐degree line indicate that a president requested more agency funds during wartime than during peace; points below the line indicate that he requested less.                           "
"58","When estimating regressions that posit presidential proposals as a function of war along with agency and president fixed effects, the recovered effect of war is positive and statistically significant. During war, presidents request, on average, 60% more for defense‐oriented programs and agencies and 19% more for domestic ones than they do during peace. But when adding to these models the political and economic controls in Tables 1 and 2, the estimated effect of war hovers around zero and does not approach statistical significance.               "
"59","Presidents do not scale back their wartime budgetary requests. Presidents may even increase them. This fact bodes well for our preferred interpretation, as it suggests that Congress appropriates amounts that better reflect presidential proposals during war than during peace, even though presidential requests, depending on how they are characterized, either remain the same or increase."
"60","Instead of directly gauging the extent of strategic proposal making on the basis of trends in actual peace‐ and wartime proposals, in principle it is possible to account for such unobserved behavior within our main statistical models. Following Kiewiet and McCubbins, we instrument proposals on identifiers for first‐term presidents and the year of each term during which proposals are made and budgets set.18 Each of these instruments, it bears emphasizing, generates estimates that are substantively large and statistically significant, both individually and jointly. First‐term presidents request smaller budgets than do second‐term (and in the case of Roosevelt, third‐ and fourth‐term) presidents. And over the course of a single presidential term, presidents request larger and larger budgets.               "
"61","Because presidents are more apt to recommend cuts in agencies and programs when they first assume office, these instruments also may satisfy the exclusion restriction. Presidents behave this way, after all, because a greater portion of these programs and agencies pursue mandates not of their making and include employees not of their choosing. Irrespective of their expectations about how Congress will receive their proposals, presidents should propose systematically lower proposals in the first year of their first term in office (Schick 2007, 109). Over time, though, presidents have ample opportunities to reorganize and staff their bureaucracy to their liking. Having done so, presidents can be expected to request more spending. Moreover, they do so regardless of their expectations about whether Congress will actually comply, something that we do not observe.19"
"62","The full complement of results based upon the resulting system of equations is presented in Table 4. The results for the first stage of the system of equations are encouraging. Individually, our instruments are highly significant; jointly, they generate an F‐statistic that exceeds conventional norms. Moreover, the pattern of results broadly conforms to our rationale for using these particular instruments. Most importantly, we see in columns 1 and 2 that the estimated effect of war remains large, negative, and statistically significant.20"
"63","Policies routinely produce distinct local and national outcomes. This basic fact, we argue, has important implications for policymaking in a system of separated powers. Because presidents represent the country as a whole, whereas individual members of Congress represent a single district or state, interbranch negotiations can be expected to feature disagreements about both the merits of policy alternatives and the relevant criteria by which to evaluate them."
"64","We elaborate a theory that explicitly accounts for these jurisdictional—and by extension criterial—differences. We identify conditions under which presidential influence increases as legislators assign greater importance to national vis‐à‐vis local outcomes. Further, we find empirical support for this prediction when examining the United States appropriations process. During war—a time when the national outcomes of policy are paramount—congressional appropriations more closely align with presidential requests than they do during peace on both foreign and domestic policy. This finding is robust to a variety of measurement strategies, model specifications, and identification strategies."
"65","Our theory, to be sure, presents a radically simplified characterization of president‐Congress deliberations over public policy. As a simplifying assumption, we treat the mappings of a policy onto local and national outcomes as perfectly, positively correlated. Future work might allow for these processes to be imperfectly correlated and then estimate comparative statics on the strength of correlation."
"66","Our theory also leaves out much of the complexity of both the executive and legislative branches. Future work might expand the role of the president by allowing him to either veto legislation or exercise an option to act unilaterally. Likewise, scholars would do well to expand the role of Congress by modeling a legislative branch composed of multiple actors, each representing a single district within the nation. Further, one could introduce features of Congress such as the committee process. Indeed, it seems clear that each added nuance of lawmaking can shed additional light on interbranch negotiations and separation of powers issues more generally. At a minimum, introducing these complexities highlights the fact that, even if Congress writ large serves the entire nation just as the president does, the president should not be thought of merely as the sum of 435 legislators."
"67","Despite its parsimony, our theory supports an eclectic array of implications that extend well beyond war and that align with previously established empirical regularities. It suggests, for instance, that presidents should experience greater bargaining success on policies that centrally concern the nation's welfare and less success on policies that invoke stronger regional considerations. For this reason, we should expect presidents to fare better on foreign policies—noted primarily for their national outcomes—and worse on domestic policies. Though for decades the so‐called “two presidencies thesis” attracted a fair measure of controversy (compare, for example, Wildavsky 1966 and Oldfield and Wildavsky 1989), recent research shows that presidents do in fact fare better on foreign policies (e.g., Canes‐Wrone, Howell, and Lewis 2008). Also consistent with our model, members of Congress are more supportive of the president's policy agenda on the subset of foreign policy issues with a distinctly national focus (e.g., security) than those issues (such as foreign aid and trade) with stronger regional implications (Milner and Tingley 2010, 2011).         "
"68","Suppose, further, that the national media and presidents themselves focus their attention on those policies that, by reference to some fixed criteria, evoke stronger national concerns. If true, then we should expect presidents to experience greater congressional deference on these subsets of policies, a finding that is consistent with a large literature indicating that presidents improve their bargaining leverage by “going public” (Canes‐Wrone 2006; Kernell 2007; Rudalevige 2002). By a similar logic, those members of Congress who assign relatively greater importance to national outcomes, all else equal, can be expected to vote in ways that better reflect the president's policy preferences. True to form, a number of scholars (Bond and Fleisher 1990; Edwards 1989; Grofman, Koetzle, and McGann 2002; Jessee and Malhotra 2010) have found that party leaders, committee chairs, and members of Congress who plan to run for the presidency tend to vote more consistently with the president than do rank‐and‐file members of Congress. And finally, there may be important intertemporal dynamics to explore within wars. As the condition of war becomes commonplace—as it may now, with the persistent threat of terrorism keeping the United States on a heightened state of alert—the attention of members of Congress may drift back to their districts and states. If it does, then our theory would predict a diminution of the president's wartime influence.         "
