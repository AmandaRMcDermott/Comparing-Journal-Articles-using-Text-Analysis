"1","In this section we derive two alternative models, an independent effects model and a secondary‐effects model. The independent effects model uses only two of the assumptions described in the introduction: a policy change affects the provision of multiple goods and individuals have diminishing returns in those goods. This model generates the intuitive, commonly assumed relationship that the more an individual values a good being increased by a policy, the more likely that individual is to support that policy. The secondary‐effects model adds in the correlated preferences assumption. With just this one additional assumption, the standard relationship no longer necessarily holds. Now if a policy increases a good, individuals who desire that good more highly may well be less likely to support that policy.         "
"2","Assume an individual has preferences over three goods, she prefers more of each good all else equal, and the individual wants a mix of the three goods. These goods could be as general as “financial security” or as specific as “unemployment insurance.” Further, assume provision of these goods is at least partly a function of some policy “x,” where increasing that policy would lead to an increase in the provision of goods A and B and a decrease in the provision of good C. The utility function in equation 1a characterizes the general version of this individual's preferences and equation 1b the functional form we will work with for illustrative purposes. In equation 1b, the terms A, B, and C represent the three goods, and the parameters β, ζ, and γ indicate how much an individual values each of the goods. Natural logs are taken to ensure that individuals want a positive mix of the three goods.               "
"3","Proposition 1.   If preferences are uncorrelated, the more an individual values a good being increased by the policy change, the more likely that individual is to support the policy change independent of how it affects the provision of other goods.                "
"4","Now also allow preferences across two goods to be negatively correlated by assuming β+ζ= 1. That is, the more an individual values one of the two goods, the less that individual values the other good. This new preference function is defined in equation 2a below.               "
"5","Define good A to be military security, good B to be economic security, good C to be sovereignty, and assume the government is considering increasing the level of military expenditures. In evaluating this policy proposal individuals face the standard guns‐versus‐butter trade‐off issue (Eichenberg 1989). The more a government spends on the military the less the government spends on welfare programs (assuming no increase in taxes or debt). Thus, individuals get more military security at the expense of economic security.            "
"6","Now, in testing whether individuals who place a greater value on military security are more likely to support this policy change, measures such as ideological self‐placement, income, and occupation are often used. One expects individuals who are further to the right, richer, and in capital‐intensive jobs (e.g., entrepreneurs and investors), to prefer more military security all else equal. Thus, these are the individuals who would have larger β terms. However, one would equally well expect individuals who are further to the left, poorer, and in working class jobs to prefer more economic security. That is, these are the individuals who would have larger ζ terms. What is important here is that these measures are not just proxies for how much an individual values military security, or for how much an individual values economic security, but rather they are proxies for both values simultaneously. Thus, by definition as β increases, ζ decreases and vice versa."
"7","When does this new constraint affect predictions?Equation 2b, the derivative of utility equation 2a by x, demonstrates the answer.               "
"8","Proposition 2.   If a policy change increases the provision of one desired good at the expense of another desired good, even if preferences over those goods are negatively correlated, the more an individual values the good being increased, the more likely that individual is to support the policy change.                "
"9","This constraint does affect predictions if the policy change is not zero‐sum. To understand why, return to the original situation characterized, an increase in policy x is associated with an increase in goods A and B, and a decrease in good C (i.e., A′(x) > 0, B′(x) > 0, and C′(x) < 0). Further, assume that the primary goal of the policy change is to increase the provision of good A. Thus, good A is being increased by an arbitrarily larger amount than good B.               "
"10","In this situation, individuals who more highly value the primary good being increased (i.e., individuals with a larger β term) can be either more or less likely to support the policy change. As equation 2b demonstrates, the answer depends upon whether the benefit from the increase in the provision of good A, A′(x)/A(x) or the benefit from the increase in the provision of good B, B′(x)/B(x), is larger.               "
"11","How can the benefit from the increase in the secondary good (i.e., the good being increased by an arbitrarily smaller amount) be larger? First, recall that individuals are defined to desire a mix of the goods by taking the natural logs of each of the goods. This assumption implies that individuals value each additional unit of a good less than the previous unit (i.e., diminishing marginal returns). For example, a person values finding a twenty dollar bill on the sidewalk more if she only has ten dollars in her purse than if she has ten thousand dollars in her purse."
"12","As a result, getting more of one good than another good does not necessarily mean that there is a greater benefit from the good being provided in larger quantity. To illustrate, imagine a person likes to consume apples, oranges, and bananas. Currently the individual has one hundred apples, no oranges, and ten bananas. This individual then has to decide whether to sacrifice five of her bananas for an additional five apples and one orange. Because this individual already has one hundred apples, getting five more is a negligible change. The one‐hundred‐and‐first to one‐hundred–and‐fifth apples might be nutritional, but they are not very appetizing. However, since this individual currently has no oranges getting the first one is a substantial increase. In fact, it is quite possible that getting that one orange is worth more to this individual than all five apples put together. If the orange is worth more, the more the person values apples over oranges, the less likely this person is to decide to make the trade, even though the primary increase is in apples. Thus, if there already is substantially more of the primary good being increased, an individual who values the increase in the primary good more may be less likely to support the policy change. This finding is restated as proposition 3."
"13","Proposition 3.   If a policy change is increasing the provision of two goods, individuals have diminishing marginal returns to scale, and preferences over those goods are negatively correlated, then an individual who more highly values the primary good being increased may be less likely to support the policy change.                "
"14","What are the implications of these theoretical results for empirical testing of public opinion? First, if the independent effects model is correct, we do not have to worry about policy changes affecting the provision of multiple goods. The more an individual values the goods being increased and the less they value the goods being decreased, the more likely they are to support the proposed policy change. Thus, one can safely operationalize a test of public opinion formation without having to be overly concerned with controlling for all of a policy change's secondary effects. However, if the secondary‐effects model is correct, this answer changes. Now, predicted relationships over primary effects are a function of a policy change's secondary effects. Whether individuals who value the primary good more are more or less likely to support the policy change depends upon how the policy change affects provision of the secondary good. Thus if individuals recognize these secondary effects, not taking them into account can lead to a critically misspecified empirical model."
"15","To determine whether there is empirical support for the secondary‐effects model, the next section applies these models to public opinion over forming a common EU defense. This issue is both timely and salient. Political elites in Europe for the first time are moving forward with a plan to create the EU's first official military body, a 60,000‐strong rapid‐reaction force. However, the viability of ongoing funding and perhaps expansion of this initiative will at least partly depend upon public support for the endeavor. Thus, to the degree that these elites want this initiative to come to fruition, they need to be concerned with generating and maintaining a substantial level of public support. Understanding how individuals form preferences over this policy will help elites both anticipate likely sources of support—which will be different in different countries if the secondary‐effects model is correct—and suggest what public relations strategies are likely to elicit the most positive responses from the public at large (e.g., whether they should emphasize the military or economic benefits of forming a common defense)."
"16","Assume individuals value three goods, military security, economic security, and sovereignty. Individuals want a mix of these goods and the more individuals value military security the less they value economic security. Thus, assume individual utility functions are defined by equation 2a, where good A is military security, good B is economic security, and good C is sovereignty.            "
"17","Next, assume governments are deciding over whether to join a common defense. Define Δαm to be the direct effect of joining the common defense on military security, Mil to be the initial level of military spending, Mil* to be the level of military spending if a common defense is formed (Mil*=ΔMil + Mil), Sov to be the initial level of sovereignty, and Sov* to be the level of sovereignty if a common defense is formed. Finally, assume governments are operating under a budget constraint, B. Thus, the more that is spent on military security (Mil) the less that is spent on economic security (B‐Mil). Equation 3 defines the utility individual i derives if the government does not join the common defense, and equation 4 defines the utility if the government does join.               "
"18","The relationship between support for common defense and four of the parameters is derived below. Equations 5 through 8 are the first derivatives with respect to budget (B), military expenditures (Mil), the individual's relative valuation of military security (βi), and the individual's valuation of sovereignty (γi), respectively.               "
"19","There are four possible sets of comparative statics depending upon whether only military security increases (i.e., Δαm > 0 and ΔMil≥ 0) or both military and economic security increases (i.e., ΔMil+Δαm > 0 and ΔMil < 0), and whether preferences over military and economic security are correlated (β+ζ= 1) or uncorrelated. These correspond to the four possible scenarios derived in the previous section (only good A or both goods A and B increasing and preferences over goods A and B being uncorrelated or negatively correlated). Equations 5 through 8 characterize the two scenarios when preferences are correlated. By substituting ζi in for 1 −βi in equation 6 and eliminating ln (B−Mil*) and ln (B−Mil) from equation 7 they characterize the two scenarios when preferences are uncorrelated.3"
"20"," Table 1 summarizes the predictions generated under these four possible scenarios. As can be seen, the comparative statics are consistent with the theoretical expectations derived in the previous section. Relationships do not depend upon whether preferences are negatively correlated when only one of the goods is increasing (proposition 2), but they do depend upon whether preferences are negatively correlated when both goods are increasing (propositions 1 and 3). Further, the secondary‐effects model uniquely predicts that the relationship between an individual's relative valuation of military security and her support for common defense should depend upon the military to budget ratio (the third comparative static in the table). This result, therefore, provides the basis for a test that can discriminate between the independent effects and secondary‐effects model.            "
"21","In the 1999 Eurobarometer individuals were asked whether they believed defense policy should be decided by their national government or jointly within the EU (where the response was coded a one if they supported a joint defense and zero otherwise). To test under what conditions individuals are more likely to prefer a common EU defense, measures of government budgets (B), military expenditures (Mil), individuals' relative valuations of military to economic security (βi), and concern with sovereignty (γi) are needed. The first two measures are relatively straightforward. Total government expenditures in billions of dollars are used to measure government budgets and total military expenditures in billions of dollars are used to measure military expenditures.4"
"22","Measuring the valuations of military security, economic security, and sovereignty is more complicated, because there is no single measure of βi or γi.5 Rather, there are a set of relevant theories that suggest several different factors any of which might influence the values of these parameters. Consistent with the extant literature we rely upon ideology, utilitarian consequences, the materialism/postmaterialism divide, and cognitive mobilization as the primary theoretical motivations for the proxies of βi and γi. Each choice is considered in turn.         "
"23","The first argument claims that an individual's ideology influences her policy preferences. In this case, the farther to the left ideologically, the more an individual should value economic security and the welfare state, and therefore the smaller βi should be. This notion is the standard guns‐versus‐butter trade‐off (see Eichenberg 1989). Thus, a measure asking respondents to place themselves on a left‐right scale measuring one to ten, where one is the farthest left and ten is the farthest right, is included.6"
"24","Utilitarianism, by contrast, argues that individuals tend to support policies that provide them with tangible benefits. For example, Gabel and others argue (Gabel 1998a, 1998b; Gabel and Palmer 1995), and demonstrate, that individuals who benefit more from European political and economic integration are more likely to support membership in the European Union. They primarily rely upon demographic characteristics, such as education, occupation, and income, to capture which individuals are more or less likely to benefit from integration.         "
"25","As applied here, individuals who benefit most from military security should weight military security higher (i.e., larger βi), while individuals who benefit most from economic security should value economic security higher (i.e., smaller βi). Two individual level measures of utilitarian self‐interest are used: (1) education, and (2) occupation. To determine education levels, respondents were asked to indicate in which of four categories they belonged: (1) up to 15 years; (2) 16–19 years; (3) 20+ years; or (4) still studying. In expectation, individuals with higher levels of education should value economic security relatively less, since they are less likely to need a social safety net. Note, because one of the categories is “still studying,” the education variable is transformed into a set of three dummy variables. The lowest level of education, “up to 15 years,” is omitted so that each dummy can be interpreted as a higher level of education than the baseline category.         "
"26","To determine occupations, individuals were asked to choose among a variety of categories. Because it is difficult to form an ex ante expectation over how most of the occupations should value military versus economic security, only two dummies were included, unemployed and retired. In expectation both of these categories should value economic security comparatively higher than the average individual. The unemployed is more likely to need the state to provide unemployment insurance, health care, and housing compared to the typical member of the population. Similarly, retired individuals are often dependent upon fixed incomes and therefore guarantee that they will be able to afford housing, health care, and other basic needs are more important compared to a typical member of the population.7"
"27","Three state‐level measures of utilitarian consequences are also included. They are (1) a dummy variable that equals one if a country has a land border with a non‐EU country,8 (2) a dummy variable that equals one if a country possesses nuclear weapons; and (3) a dummy variable that equals one if a country is not a member of NATO. These factors should influence the nationwide average value of βi. Countries with non‐EU land borders are closer to regions with greater potential instability, and therefore individuals in countries with non‐EU land borders should be more concerned with military security on average (i.e., larger βi). Countries that have nuclear weapons already have a powerful unilateral military capability, and therefore individuals living in these countries should care relatively less about additional military security on average (i.e., smaller βi). And countries that are not members of NATO are not already in a military alliance, and therefore individuals living in non‐NATO countries should care relatively more about additional military security on average (i.e., larger βi).         "
"28","All of the above measures are proxies for the βi term and therefore provide the basis for a discriminating test between the independent effects and secondary‐effects models. The next three measures are first and foremost included as proxies for the sovereignty term (γi), and, because the independent and secondary‐effects models make identical predictions over this term, therefore are primarily included as controls. How they may act as more is discussed subsequently.         "
"29","First, according to Inglehart'ssuccessor generation theory (Inglehart 1970b, 1990), there has been a change in fundamental political values across generations. Older generations are “materialists” who consider economic and military security paramount, while younger generations are “postmaterialists” who consider intellectual fulfillment, self‐actualization and belonging as most important. Inglehart and others argue that postmaterialists should be more likely to support yielding national sovereignty to supranational institutions, because doing so leads to a less nationalistic society (Inglehart, Rabier, and Reif 1991; Anderson and Reichert 1996; Inglehart 1970b; but see Gabel 1998b). If correct, older individuals should be less likely to support forming a common defense than younger individuals because they are more concerned with the potential loss of national sovereignty (i.e., larger γi). To test this hypothesis we include the generational variable age, in which respondents were coded into four categories: (1) 15–24 years old; (2) 25–39 years old; (3) 40–54 years old; and (4) 55+ years old.9"
"30","Second, according to Inglehart's cognitive mobilization theory (1970a), individuals who discuss politics more frequently are more exposed to political rhetoric. If that rhetoric is positive, individuals are more likely to support the proposed policy and if that rhetoric is negative the opposite is true. Further, Inglehart also suggests that the rhetoric associated with supranational EU institutions tends to be positive. Thus, since the survey question asks whether individuals support a common defense at the European Union (EU) level, individuals who discuss politics more should be more likely to support European integration (i.e., smaller γi). To test this hypothesis we include a discussion variable in which respondents were coded into the three following categories: (1) discusses politics frequently; (2) discusses politics occasionally; and (3) discusses politics never.         "
"31","Finally, a last control measure is included through the sovereignty term (γi). Presumably, the more comfortable individuals are with ceding sovereignty to the EU, the less concerned individuals should be with ceding sovereignty in general. Thus, to control for this hypothesis we include the variable EUgood in which respondent were asked if they thought membership is (1) a “bad thing,” (2) “neither good nor bad,” or (3) a “good thing.”10"
"32","Note that the age and discussion measures are first and foremost included as controls for Inglehart's two theories. However, there are also plausible interpretations of the measures that would cause them to enter in through the βi term, and thereby provide a discriminating test between the independent effects and secondary‐effects models. First, older generations may value military security more highly, because they experienced more of the post‐WWII recovery period. If true, βi should be increasing in age. Second, individuals who discuss politics more frequently may have a more sophisticated understanding of policy choices. With this increased understanding comes a greater ability to appreciate policies that generate less concrete or obvious benefits, and thereby a higher relative valuation of military security (e.g., a social security or unemployment check is a more tangible good than a lower probability of getting in a war). If true, βi should be increasing as political discussion increases. Both of these measures are operationalized such that the empirical model can test between these alternative motivations.         "
"33"," Table 2 relates the predictions from Table 1 to the measures described above. Column two indicates the measures used to operationalize the various parameters as well as whether that parameter should be increasing or decreasing as the measure increases in value. Columns three through five indicate how an increase in the parameter should change the probability of support for forming a common defense.            "
"34","Note that in the table we predict support for forming a common defense should decrease as concern with sovereignty increases. This is predicated on the assumption that individuals will perceive forming a common defense to decrease sovereignty (Sov*− Sov <0) While we believe this assumption is reasonable, it is made only for descriptive convenience. No conclusions depend upon sovereignty decreasing.            "
"35","The relationships characterized in this table can be used to test between the independent effects and the secondary‐effects models. Several of the predictions are nondiscriminating. In particular, the effect of a change in government expenditures, military expenditures, and sovereignty can neither refute nor support the secondary‐effects model, because both models predict the same relationship depending upon whether only military security or both military and economic security are expected to increase. However, the predictions over the relative valuation of military to economic security are discriminating. If and only if preferences over military and economic security are correlated should the relationship between the proxies for the βi term and support for common defense be a function of the military to budget ratio. Thus, finding such a relationship would be evidence in support of the secondary‐effects model.            "
"36","To test for the hypothesized relationship, the following heteroskedastic probit was estimated. Possible spatial autocorrelation resulting from having multilevel data (individual level respondents across multiple countries) is controlled for by clustering errors by country (Steenbergen and Jones 2002). Further, the possibility that political sophistication will influence the strength of any derived relationships is controlled for by including the discussion variable and the education dummies in the variance.               "
"37","The sample consists of 21,001 respondents from the 15 EU member states. Table 3 reports the results of the regression.            "
"38","As can be seen almost all of the terms are significant at the 1% level. Only the employment and border variables are insignificant at conventional levels.12"
"39","An examination of these results provides support for the secondary‐effects model. First, consider the coefficients on the terms included solely as proxies for βi. As previously demonstrated, the secondary‐effects model uniquely predicts that when the military to government expenditure ratio is small, individuals with larger βi terms are more likely to support forming a common defense, and when the military to government ratio is large, the opposite is true. In the analysis, six individual level and three state level measures were included as proxies for βi. Of those, the left‐right measure, the three education dummies, the not‐NATO dummy, and the border dummy are expected be positively related to βi, while the retired dummy, the unemployed dummy, and the nuclear weapons dummy are expected to be negatively related to βi. Thus, according to the secondary‐effects model, we would expect the proxies that are positively related to βi to have positive coefficients on the uninteracted terms and negative coefficients on the interacted terms, and the opposite on the proxies negatively related to βi. As can be seen, this is true for all seven of the nine proxies that are significant. Thus, all of these results are consistent with predictions generated by the secondary‐effects model and inconsistent with predictions generated by the independent‐effects model.13"
"40"," Figure 1 illustrates how a change in βi, conditional on the military to government spending ratio, influences the probability of support for forming a common defense. To create a simulated βi term, we simultaneously varied four of the βi proxies—the left‐right measure, the education measure, the retired dummy, and the NATO measure—from their minimums to their maximums.14 The x‐axis scales βi accordingly. We then generated predicted probabilities of support while holding the military to government expenditure ratio either at a low ratio (1/100 billion dollars) or a high ratio (ten/one hundred billion dollars) and holding all other values roughly at their averages.15 Ninety‐five percent confidence intervals are plotted around the predicted values. As can be seen, an increase in βi is associated with an increase in support for forming a common defense when the ratio is small and associated with a decrease in support for forming a common defense when the ratio is large. In both cases, probabilities of support start at moderate values for low values of βi and converge on one or zero as βi approaches its maximal value. Thus not only are the conditional directions of effect consistent with the secondary‐effects model's predictions, but it is clear that support varies substantially as one moves from being someone who is characterized as having a small βi term to someone who is characterized as having a large βi term.            "
"41","                 Support for Common Defense as a Function of β                         "
"42","Next consider the results on the two Inglehart measures, age and political discussion. These results are treated separately since arguments were made for including them either as proxies for the sovereignty term (γi) or for the relative valuation of military to economic security (βi). The age variable behaves consistently with the expectation that older generations should be more concerned with military security (i.e., that age influences βi) and inconsistently with the expectation that younger generations should always be more supportive of forming a common defense (i.e., Inglehart's successor generation theory). The discussion measure behaves inconsistently both with the expectation that more politically involved individuals should value military security (i.e., that discussing politics influences βi) and that more politically involved individuals should be more supportive of forming an EU common defense (i.e., Inglehart's cognitive mobilization theory). Thus, these results provide partial support for the secondary‐effects model since only the secondary‐effects model predicts that the effect of age on support for a common defense should depend upon the military‐to‐budget ratio.            "
"43","Finally, consider the predictions that do not cleanly discriminate between the secondary and independent‐effects models. First, the EU membership variable works in the predicted direction. The more an individual is supportive of EU membership, the more likely that individual is to support forming an EU common defense. Of course, since predictions on the sovereignty term do not discriminate between these two models, this finding is only mentioned because it is substantively interesting.16"
"44","Next consider the government and military expenditure terms. Since both terms are interacted numerous times, it is difficult to directly interpret the relationship between these variables and support for forming a common defense. Thus, instead we consider how an increase in military or government expenditures affects the probability of support while holding the rest of the variables roughly at their averages.17"
"45","First, it turns out that an increase in government spending is associated with an increase in support for forming a common defense. For example, if we fix military spending at eight billion dollars and increase government spending form 80 to 100 billion dollars, we find that the likelihood of support increases from 13% to 27%.18 Thus, this finding is consistent solely with the models that assume common defense is only perceived to increase military security.19"
"46","Evaluating the military expenditures relationship is a little more complex since two of the models predict its relationship to depend upon the military to spending ratio. Setting government expenditures at 100 billion dollars, we find an increase in military expenditures for low ratios (from one to four billion dollars) yields a decrease from 76% to 61% likelihood of support, and an increase in military expenditures for high ratios (from 7 to 10 billion dollars) also yields a decrease, this time from 43% to 27%.20 Thus, it turns out that an increase in military expenditures is associated with a decrease in support for common defense independent of the military to spending ratio. This finding is nondiscriminating. It is consistent both with the models that assume common defense is only perceived to increase military security and with the models that assume common defense is perceived to increase both military and economic security, but that the countries sampled in this study all happen to have small military‐to‐budget ratios.21"
"47","Putting all of these findings together, which model receives the most support? Two of the 13 predicted relationships are consistent with either an independent‐effects or a secondary‐effects model assuming only military security is expected to increase and one of the 13 predicted relationships is consistent with an independent‐effects model assuming both military and economic security is expected to increase. In comparison, nine of the 13 predicted relationships are consistent with a secondary‐effects model assuming both military security and economic security are expected to increase. Thus, the evidence is supportive of, although not perfectly supportive of, the secondary‐effects model."
"48","Public policies can have multidimensional effects. However, relatively little is known about how much individuals consider anything beyond the most direct impact of a policy change in forming preferences, and whether it matters even if they do. This study is an effort to help provide answers to those questions. On the theoretical side, this article demonstrates that multidimensional policy effects can critically affect empirical model specification if preferences over any of the affected goods are negatively correlated (i.e., an individual's preferences are defined as per the secondary‐effects model). In fact, one might conclude that a theory is supported when in fact the evidence is inconsistent with what the theory should predict or that a theory is rejected when in fact the evidence is consistent with what the theory should predict. On the empirical side, this article tests for evidence that secondary effects do matter by looking at public opinion and European common defense. While not uniformly supportive, the mass of evidence is consistent with the supposition that there are multidimensional benefits from forming a common defense and individuals perceive those benefits."
"49","These results have two substantive implications worth highlighting in conclusion. First, individuals appear to care about not just the military implications of forming an EU defense, but also the sovereignty and economic implications as well. As a result, what types of individuals tend to support forming an EU defense force depends upon ones nationality. Support for a joint defense in countries with larger military to budget ratios tends to be stronger among older, less educated individuals with left political leanings, while the opposite is true in countries with smaller military to budget ratios. Also by implication, if the political elite of Europe wish to muster support for this proposed venture, their smartest strategy is to go beyond just touting the military benefits of forming a joint defense force, and instead also openly espouse any even seemingly small economic benefits. As the secondary‐effects model demonstrates, even very small absolute changes can have a substantial impact on ones overall evaluation of a policy."
"50","Second, these findings may help explain why public opinion has traditionally been perceived as volatile and unpredictable. If secondary effects do matter, we should expect the relationship between individual level demographic characteristics and public opinion to depend upon time‐ and country‐fixed effects, such as government budgets and military spending. Thus, what would be perceived as cross‐national and intertemporal inconsistencies in preferences are really a product of previously uncontrolled for variance in state level variables. This reality is most striking when left‐right ideology is considered. There is no one‐to‐one relationship between left‐right self‐placement and support for common defense. Rather, whether the left or the right is more likely to support forming a common defense depends upon who sees themselves as having the most to gain. And the answer to that question depends upon state‐level variables."
