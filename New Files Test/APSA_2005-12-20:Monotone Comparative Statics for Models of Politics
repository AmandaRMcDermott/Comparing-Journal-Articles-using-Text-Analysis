"1"," Powell (2002) studies the following problem, which we will call the appeasement problem. (See Fearon (1995) for related models.) Two states must divide some territory. There is a status quo division, but one state (call it D) is dissatisfied with that status quo. The other state (call it S) is satisfied with the status quo division.         "
"2"," S gets one chance to try to appease D by offering it some of the disputed territory. Let x be the fraction of S's territory that it offers. S is uncertain about how dissatisfied D is. S believes that D will accept an offer of x with probability p(x). Assume that p(x) is strictly increasing, so x >x′ implies that p(x) >p(x′). The better the offer, the more likely D is to accept it. If D accepts the offer, then war is averted and S is left with 1 −x of its territory. If D rejects the offer, then there is a war.         "
"3"," S believes that it will win a war with probability q. Thus q can be thought of as S's relative military strength. If S wins a war, then S keeps all of its territory. If S loses the war, it ends up with none of the disputed territory. Given all of this, S will choose the offer of appeasement, x, to solve the following maximization problem:            "
"4","One way to find the comparative statics for this problem is to choose a specific functional form for p and calculate the solution explicitly. For example, suppose p(x) =x. This means that S believes that if it offers one‐half of the disputed territory, then D accepts that offer with probability one‐half and likewise for all offers between 0 and 1. Under this assumption, S's maximization problem can be rewritten as follows:            "
"5","While this final conclusion seems intuitive, the preceding derivation relied on the functional form of p, the probability that D accepts an offer. Without this functional form (p(x) =x) the analysis would not have simplified in the nice way that it did and so we would not have had an explicit solution for the optimal offer.1 But the functional form was not chosen because of some compelling substantive political argument that the probability of an offer being accepted is linear in the offer. Rather, it was chosen because it simplified the algebra. This is troublesome for at least two reasons. First, if the conclusion, rather than just the derivation, relies on the functional form, then the conclusion is suspect unless the functional form can be substantively justified. Second, this approach makes it hard to generalize or add nuance to the results, since to solve a richer model we would still have to find functional forms that lead to explicit solutions, a process which gets harder and harder as the model becomes more realistic.         "
"6","To see this second point more clearly, consider an intuitively appealing extension of the appeasement problem. One might like to model S as having two decisions to make rather than one. For example, suppose that S's perceived military strength is actually the result of both some preexisting military capacity and the level of military buildup during the negotiations. Write this probability as q(z, θ), where z is preparation for fighting and θ is preexisting military capacity. It is natural to assume that S's military strength is increasing in both military buildup (∂q/∂z > 0) and in preexisting capacity (∂q/∂θ > 0). Further, a military buildup is costly. We represent this cost with a function c(z). Finally, it seems sensible to think that the likelihood D accepts an offer of appeasement depends on both the offer (x) and S's military buildup during the crisis, so the probability of acceptance is some function p(x, z).         "
"7","To solve this richer, more realistic model, we have to find S's optimal offer by analyzing the following maximization problem:            "
"8","Motivated by the desire to solve models of this sort we now turn to the theory of monotone comparative statics. We begin by developing techniques that are useful for solving general decision theoretic problems such as the one above. We then extend these techniques for use in game theoretic settings.2"
"9","In developing the theory, we start with the simplest case: a one‐dimensional decision. We will develop this rigorously and then show intuitively how the techniques extend to more general cases. This will allow us to solve our motivating example above, as well as a host of other political science models."
"10","Before proceeding, one technical point is necessary. When developing more general models in the way that we advocate, one is not always assured of having unique solutions. For ease of exposition, while developing the theory we assume unique solutions. However, this assumption is not necessary in order to reach comparative static conclusions. Indeed, one of the strengths of the monotone comparative statics approach is that it allows one to make comparative static statements even when there are multiple equilibria. However, it is easier to explain the basics when there is only one solution. We return to the issue of multiplicity later in this section."
"11","We will study comparative statics in the context of a general optimization problem:            "
"12","This general optimization problem can represent a host of political decisions. As in our opening example, it might represent the optimal level of appeasement given a state's military strength. In this case, a* corresponds to the optimal offer (x* in our opening example) and θ corresponds to S's military strength (q in our opening example). Another political problem this optimization problem could represent is the decision over what tax policy a legislator supports (a) given the percentage of people in her district living below the poverty line (θ). One can come up with many further such examples.         "
"13","Consider two possible choices, a and a′, where a > a′. If the problem is choice of tax policy, then a would be a higher tax rate than a′. In order to think about monotone comparative statics, we will need to study the function f(a, ·) −f(a′, ·), which is called the incremental return. The incremental return is a measure of the benefit (or loss if it is negative) that our decision maker realizes by moving from the lower choice (a′) to the higher one (a). Clearly, for any given level of the parameter θ, the decision maker prefers a to a′ if and only if f(a, θ) −f(a′, θ) > 0.         "
"14","In order to derive monotone comparative statics, we will study a special property of the incremental return known as the single‐crossing condition. We will show that when the single‐crossing property holds, then powerful comparative statics follow.         "
"15","The single‐crossing condition requires that the incremental return change sign only once as the parameter θ increases. That is, suppose that a decision maker prefers policy a′ to policy a when θ is small. This means that, for a sufficiently small θ (call it θ′), the incremental return is negative. If, for some new θ > θ′ the decision maker would prefer policy a to policy a′ (so that the incremental return is positive for this new parameter value θ), then all decision makers with parameter value greater than θ must also prefer a to a′. Otherwise, the incremental return would change signs more than once and, therefore, would not satisfy the single‐crossing condition. The single‐crossing property is illustrated in Figure 1.         "
"16","                 Objective Functions (Left Panel) and Their Incremental Return (Right Panel) Satisfying the Single Crossing Property                      "
"17","Definition 1  The function f satisfies the single‐crossing condition if  for all               a > a′andθ > θ′, f(a, θ′) −f (a′, θ′) ≥ 0impliesf(a, θ) −f(a′, θ) ≥ 0, andf(a, θ′) −f(a′, θ′) > 0impliesf(a, θ) −f(a′, θ) > 0.            "
"18","At first glance, the single‐crossing condition may seem hopelessly technical, belying our earlier promise to ground comparative static analysis in easy and intuitive assumptions. However, it is our intention to show that the single‐crossing condition is, in fact, both easy and intuitive. We will start with why it is intuitive. Then, after developing a little more theory, we will show how checking for the existence of the single‐crossing condition is often quite easy as well. First, however, in what sense is the single‐crossing condition intuitive?"
"19","Consider the appeasement problem mentioned above. Imagine that there are two appeasement offers, a large appeasement or a small appeasement. Suppose that a state with relative strength q prefers the large appeasement offer. Then the single‐crossing condition requires that all weaker states also prefer the larger appeasement offer. The intuition underlying the single‐crossing condition is also now clear: if a moderately strong state prefers the large appeasement offer, then it reveals a preference for a large concession and low probability of war to a small concession and a high probability of war. A weaker state has a lower expected payoff from war, so it has even more reason to prefer the combination of a large concession and low probability of war. The power of the monotone comparative statics approach is that comparative static results hold as long as we are comfortable making assumptions consistent with intuitive statements such as the previous sentences.            "
"20","For another example, consider the tax problem mentioned above. There, the choice variable represents a tax rate and the parameter θ represents the percentage of people in a district who live below the poverty line. So, consider two possible choices of a tax rate, a high level of tax, a, and a low level of tax, a′. Suppose, further, that a legislator with fraction θ′ of her constituents below the poverty line prefers the larger tax, a. Then, the single‐crossing condition holds only if all other legislators from districts that are even poorer will prefer the higher tax rate to the lower tax rate (they will also have a positive incremental return).3"
"21","Now that we have seen that the single‐crossing property has a substantive interpretation, we present the central result of monotone comparative statics: if the single‐crossing condition holds, then the optimal choice changes monotonically with the parameter. Throughout the article, theorems are presented without proof (though we always provide the technical intuition and a citation to the proof)."
"22","Theorem 1 (Milgrom and Shannon (1994)) Assume that f satisfies the single‐crossing property and leta*(θ) = arg maxa∈A f(a, θ). Thena*is weakly increasing inθ.            "
"23","The proof of this result follows straightforwardly from the intuitive interpretation of the single‐crossing condition. Consider a decision maker with type θ′ who prefers a to a′. Her payoff function satisfies f(a, θ) −f(a′, θ) > 0, which we can rewrite as               "
"24","We have, thus far, seen that the single‐crossing property is intuitive and powerful. However, these alone do not make it useful. To make this concept practical, we need a way to check whether or not it holds so that we can know whether or not we have monotone comparative statics in an applied model. It turns out that there is a sufficient condition for single crossing, called increasing differences, that is easy to check in applications. We develop this next.            "
"25","We begin with a definition of increasing differences, which is illustrated in Figure 2.            "
"26","                 Objective Functions (Left Panel) and Their Incremental Return (Right Panel) Satisfying Both the Single Crossing Property and Increasing Differences                         "
"27","Definition 2  The function f has increasing differences if the incremental return, f(a, ·) −f(a′, ·), is weakly increasing in the parameter,θ.               "
"28","If the incremental return is weakly increasing, then the single‐crossing condition is satisfied. Why is this? Increasing differences is true if:                  "
"29","Increasing differences is a generalization of the classical idea of complementarity—an increase in the parameter increases the marginal benefit of an increase in the choice variable. Another way of interpreting this is that, the higher the value of the parameter, the more efficacious is an increase in the choice variable. For example, in the appeasement problem, if state strength and offers of appeasement are complements, then the stronger the state is the more likely a small increase in the appeasement offer is to lead to acceptance. Under convexity and smoothness assumptions, the optimal choice in a formal model sets marginal benefits equal to marginal costs. When the parameter and choice variable are complements, an increase in the parameter increases the marginal benefits, which then increases the optimal choice. The monotonicity theorem based on increasing differences generalizes this result so that it holds without the extraneous assumptions regarding convexity and smoothness.4"
"30","If the objective function (f) is twice continuously differentiable, then increasing difference becomes trivial to verify. To see this, write the definition of increasing differences as                  "
"31","This condition is easy to check. In particular, we can confirm that, the optimal choice has monotone comparative statics with respect to some parameter by taking a simple cross partial derivative. Thus, the single‐crossing property is indeed powerful, intuitive, and useful."
"32","It is worth noting that monotone comparative static results do not depend on differentiability. We used differentiability to verify the single‐crossing property in a particularly easy way, but the monotonicity theorem was stated entirely in terms of the single‐crossing property. This is important because in some applied settings differentiability is not a good assumption. Consider a couple of examples. In a model of parliamentary coalition formation, the actors might be extreme‐leftist, left‐center, centrist, right‐center, and extreme‐rightist parties. The centrist party might have to choose which other parties to bring into a governing coalition. There is no sensible way to model this decision continuously—the choice is inherently discrete. Similarly, in a model of conflict and appeasement (which we discuss in more detail later) the land under dispute might have religious significance making partition infeasible."
"33","In such discrete choice situations, we can still reach comparative static conclusions using monotone comparative static techniques. This is because, unlike other techniques (such as the implicit function theorem), monotone comparative statics do not depend on differentiability in any way. We do not, for instance, need to exploit a first‐order condition to do comparative statics, we simply need to determine whether the incremental return is single crossing."
"34","Moreover, in discrete choice situations, the objective function may sometimes be differentiable in the parameter (θ) even though it is not differentiable in the choice variable (a). For instance, in an appeasement setting the land might not be infinitely divisible. If the parameter is something continuous, such as relative military power, then it is reasonable to assume differentiability in the parameter. In this case, we can check whether the incremental return is weakly increasing using calculus. Recall that the incremental return is f(a, θ) −f(a′, θ). The incremental return is weakly increasing if, for all θ∈Θ and a, a′∈A with a > a′:               "
"35","Thus far, we have presented the results assuming that a unique solution to the decision problem exists. However, our current focus on discrete choice forces us to confront the issue of multiple optima. In the typical case of discrete choice with continuous payoff functions, the decision maker will be indifferent between two choices at the parameter value where she switches from one choice to the other. For example, in the cutpoint case, the decision maker is indifferent between the two actions if θ=θ*. Thus, at that point there are multiple optima.5 An advantage of the monotone comparative statics approach is that it allows us to draw comparative static conclusions even in these cases.            "
"36","This appearance of multiple optima raises an important question—what does monotonicity mean for sets of solutions? The literature offers several answers to this question; we use the simplest one. Say that a set of solutions S1 is greater than another set of solutions S2 if the greatest element of S1 is larger than the greatest element of S2 and the least element of S1 is larger than the least element of S2. (Notice that this definition of monotonicity reduces to the standard order on real numbers when there is a unique optimum.) All theorems we have stated (and will state throughout) hold exactly as stated if we substitute this concept of increasing sets for the usual concept of monotonicity (Milgrom and Shannon 1994).            "
"37","Now that we have presented the basic theory, let's put it to work in our motivating example. In our opening treatment of the appeasement problem we chose a specific functional form for p, the probability that the offer is accepted, in order to derive comparative statics from an explicit solution. Using monotone comparative static techniques we can derive these comparative statics without assuming a functional form, or even concavity of the objective function.            "
"38","Consider the one‐dimensional problem:               "
"39","Substantively, this says that, so long as more generous offers are more likely to be accepted, states with stronger chances in war will offer less territory to a dissatisfied bargaining partner. Importantly, the result depends only on the substantive claim that better offers are more likely to be accepted. We did not need the additional substantive restriction that the objective function be globally concave.6 Thus, in addition to being easy to check, the monotone comparative statics approach clarifies which assumptions drive the results.            "
"40","As discussed above, if we do not assume differentiability we can still make comparative static statements. This is important substantively because one might want to analyze the appeasement problem in a case where the territory is not perfectly divisible. For example, suppose that part of the territory has important religious significance for influential groups in each state and that consequently divided control of the religious site is unacceptable to these groups. In this case, the set of feasible offers in not convex and the objective function cannot be everywhere differentiable. However, we can still say that the optimal offer is weakly decreasing in military strength since the weak comparative static conclusion depends only on increasing differences, which does not imply convexity, continuity, or differentiability."
"41","So far we have studied the simplest possible decision problem: one actor making one choice. We now generalize the results to show how they apply when a single decision maker has to make multiple choices and the state of the world is described by multiple parameters."
"42","In order to address the multidimensional problem we need to extend the notion of complementarity discussed above to a multidimensional setting. Formally characterizing the analog to the single‐crossing condition for a multidimensional monotonicity theorem would require a lengthy technical tangent from our main theme.7 Instead, we will simply extend the earlier concept of increasing differences to show sufficient conditions for monotone comparative statics in a multidimensional problem. This is the essential tool for applied work.         "
"43","In the one‐dimensional problem we assumed that the action a was in . Since this is now a multidimensional problem, the decision maker is choosing a vector a= (a1, a2, … ,an). Thus, we assume that the action is . Similarly, before we had a single parameter θ that described the state of the world. Now, we assume the parameter is .         "
"44","The multidimensional decision problem is now written:            "
"45","Definition 3  If the set of alternatives, A, is a subset of               and the set of parameters Θ is a subset of               , the setX=A×Θis a product set if it can be represented by the Cartesian product of subsets of.8"
"46","Now we can define supermodularity."
"47","Definition 4  A function               is supermodular if                                 A×Θ               is a product set and f has increasing differences for all pairs of arguments of the function.            "
"48","For a simple example, this definition says that if we have a twice continuously differentiable function f(a1, a2, θ), then it is supermodular if all of the following hold: . As we add in more choice alternatives or more parameters, increasing differences must hold for each possible dyad.            "
"49","This is clearly a generalization of increasing differences. If A and Θ are one dimensional, then the definition is exactly the same as the earlier definition of increasing differences. Moreover, as we discussed earlier, the key fact about increasing differences (and the single crossing property) that made monotone comparative statics work was complementarity. Supermodularity simply extends the notion of complementarity saying that all choices and parameters must be complements with one another.            "
"50","Given this, we can state the main result, which is that supermodularity is sufficient for monotone comparative statics. We will say that the solution to the multidimensional maximization problem (labeled a*) has monotone comparative statics if every component is weakly increasing in the parameters. This result is formalized in the following theorem.            "
"51","Theorem 2 (Topkis (1978)) Consider the problemmaxa∈Af(a, θ)whereθ∈Θis a parameter. If f is supermodular, then the optimal solutiona*has monotone comparative statics.            "
"52","This result is based on a simple idea. An increase in a parameter θ has the direct effect of weakly increasing the optimal levels of each component of the action, since supermodularity implies increasing differences for each pair of parameter and action. Since supermodularity also implies increasing differences for each pair of actions, this direct effect induces indirect effects of further increases in the action variables. Thus, all the effects of an increase in a parameter on the optimal solution are in the same direction."
"53","Without supermodularity, the interactions between choice variables could potentially outweigh the direct effect of the change in parameters, and then the direction of comparative statics would depend on the relative size of direct and indirect effects. For example, consider the simple example of a function f(a1, a2, θ). Assume that a1 has increasing differences with θ and with a2 but that the function is not quite supermodular because a2 does not have increasing differences with θ. Now consider the effect of an increase of θ on the optimal a1. An increase in θ leads to a direct effect of upward pressure on the optimal a1 because of increasing differences. However, an increase in θ can also put downward pressure on the optimal a2 which has the indirect effect of putting downward pressure on the optimal a1, since a1 and a2 have increasing differences. There is no way to sign the overall effect (that is, the net effect considering both the direct and indirect effects) of an increase in θ on a1 without making detailed assumptions about the functional form of f (precisely what we are trying to avoid doing). Thus, for monotone comparative static claims to be true we need the full strength of the supermodularity assumption. Increasing differences of a parameter and one particular component of the choice vector is not sufficient to make monotone comparative static claims about that binary relationship.            "
"54","As we pointed out earlier, it would be nice to be able to solve a richer, multidimensional version of the appeasement problem. For instance, Bueno de Mesquita et al. (1999) present a related model in which the decision‐making country must choose both an offer to make and how much to invest in military preparedness.9 Using the results on multidimensional problems, we can easily handle such complications.            "
"55","Assume that the utility of S to war depends on both some preexisting military capacity and on the level of military buildup during the negotiations. Write this utility as q(z, θ), where z is preparation for fighting and θ is military capacity. It is natural to assume that ∂q/∂z > 0 (more preparation increases S's chance of winning) and that ∂q/∂θ > 0 (preexisting capacity makes S more likely to win). Increasing military preparedness is costly, with cost function c(z). Now, the state solves               "
"56","We will see that the comparative statics of this problem depend on the cross‐partial . This cross‐partial derivative is positive only if military preparations and military capacity are complements. When might this be true? Suppose that θ measures the state of military technology and that a given increment to spending is more productive when technology is better. Under this assumption, z and θ are complements and so the crosss‐partial is positive.            "
"57","If z and θ are complements, it is straightforward to verify that the objective is supermodular in (−x, z, θ). In particular:               "
"58","This means that we can conclude that x* is decreasing in θ and that z* is increasing in θ, without ever solving explicitly for x*. Notice that an empirical researcher attempting to evaluate this model may not observe the underlying state of military technology (θ), but likely will observe the offer (x) and the level of build‐up (z). The key observable prediction, then, is that x and z will be negatively correlated.            "
"59","As we mentioned at the outset, a key advantage of monotone comparative statics is that it highlights the substantive content of the assumptions, so they can be examined with qualitative empirical work. For example, we just derived the result that, if preexisting military capacity makes resources devoted to a military buildup more productive (that is, if they are complements), then ex ante stronger states will choose both less generous offers and greater buildups. The key condition used in this argument concerns the effect of preexisting capacity on the efficiency of military investment, a subject which qualitative empirical work and expert interviews can shed light on. If this assumption is false, then the comparative static predictions do not hold."
"60","The other approach that one could use to derive comparative statics from the multidimensional appeasement model is to employ the implicit function theorem. If we assume that territory and military capacity are both perfectly divisible, that the objective function is twice continuously differentiable, and that the first‐order condition characterizes the optimum, then we can use the implicit function theorem to calculate the comparative static derivatives as:               "
"61","So far, we have concentrated on the role of increasing differences and supermodularity in ensuring that choice variables are weakly increasing in the parameters. In this section, we tie up a couple of loose ends in this discussion. First, we discuss an alternative sufficient condition for the single‐crossing property that is useful in multiplicatively separable problems. Second, we discuss the problem of ensuring that the solution is strictly increasing in the parameters. Although the results we present hold for multidimensional problems, we simplify the discussion by restricting attention to one‐dimensional choices.         "
"62","In some situations, the decision maker's objective function may not be supermodular, but we can still apply monotone comparative statics. Recall that supermodularity is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for monotone comparative statics. In certain circumstances, a useful trick makes it possible to demonstrate that a decision problem has the needed complementarities even though supermodularity of the objective function cannot be established. This trick involves taking logs. We illustrate this using an example."
"63","Consider the following simple model of election spending.11 A candidate is running for office as a challenger and must decide how much money to devote to campaign spending a. The probability that the challenger wins p(a, θ) is increasing in campaign spending and decreasing in the incumbent's level of name recognition θ > 0.12 The candidate also gains some utility from holding office, u(a). This utility is a decreasing function of the amount of resources spent on campaigning (). This assumption reflects the idea that campaign funds are raised in exchange for promises that the challenger will provide favors to interest groups if she wins, and that providing these favors uses resources that the candidate could otherwise use to pursue her own legislative goals.            "
"64","The candidate's objective function is U=p(a, θ)u(a), and he solves the following maximization problem:               "
"65","Fortunately, comparative statics conclusions continue to hold when the objective function is transformed in any monotonic way. A particularly convenient such transformation is to take logarithms. Hence, to attempt to establish comparative statics of our elections model, we can study the transformed maximization problem:               "
"66","Definition 5  The function f:                  is log‐supermodular if log f is supermodular.               "
"67","To see the usefulness of log‐supermodularity, assume again that the candidate expects to win the voter's vote only if ε≤a−θ. The candidate believes that ε∼F, where F is a strictly increasing, absolutely continuous distribution with density f. Thus the candidate wins with probability                  "
"68","What are the comparative statics of this problem? Consider the effect of a change in the name recognition of the incumbent on the level of campaign spending by the challenger. The first derivative of the objective function with respect to a is                  "
"69","It turns out that this condition that  (called the hazard rate) be decreasing is equivalent to an empirically testable claim about the distribution. In particular, this condition will hold if the density (f) is logconcave. While logconcavity of the density is not a qualitatively intuitive assumption, it has two desirable properties. First, it seems a relatively innocuous assumption since most of the standard assumptions we use in formal and statistical modeling (normal, uniform, extreme value, beta, Weibull, etc.) are logconcave (Bagnoli and Bergstrom 1989). Further, one can use nonparametric methods to empirically evaluate whether or not logconcavity is present (An 1997). Thus, by using the trick of taking logs of the original objective function, we are able to show that the problem has monotone comparative statics as long as the distribution of shocks in the stochastic voting model is logconcave.               "
"70","The monotonicity theorems that we have presented only tell us that a* is weakly increasing in a parameter—we have not yet ruled out intervals of θ over which a* is constant. Sometimes it is possible to go further and show that the solution must be strictly increasing. To do this, we must strengthen the assumptions in two ways. First, we assume that f is differentiable in a. Second, we assume that  is strictly increasing in θ. Notice that the second condition implies that the incremental return f(a, θ) −f(a′, θ), is strictly increasing in θ as opposed to the earlier increasing differences condition, which was that it was weakly increasing in θ.            "
"71","Now we are ready for a strict comparative statics result. We have assumed that f has strictly increasing incremental returns and is differentiable. This clearly implies that f has increasing differences, so the earlier monotonicity theorem implies that a*(θ) ≥a*(θ′). We want to show that, under the stronger conditions, this inequality is strict.            "
"72","Assume that a*(θ) is in the interior of A. Since a*(θ) is optimal at θ, the first‐order condition holds, which implies that:               "

"75","We can use this result to strengthen the earlier results from the appeasement problem. Since the objective function in that problem is differentiable, we can conclude that the optimal offer is strictly decreasing at any q where x*(q) is not 0 or 1.               "
"76","Monotone comparative statics tools are useful beyond decision theory—they also can be employed in strategic settings. For this, we must extend the idea of complementarity to strategic complementarity. Informally, a game is a situation where several decision makers make choices and all of them care about the choices of the others. A game has strategic complementarities if each player wants to choose a higher action when another player increases her actions. We will start with a simple example to show how some of the decision‐theoretic monotone comparative static results developed above can be used in a game‐theoretic setting. We will then progress to techniques specifically suited to analyzing comparative statics of equilibria of game theoretic models.         "
"77","Consider the following model of an arms race between two states. A state, i, has to choose a level of investment in arms, ai. The state cares both about how well armed it is as well as how well armed its rival, j, is. Further, investment in arms is costly. The cost of an investment ai is given by ciai. The payoff to state i is given by:            "
"78","An equilibrium of this game is a pair (a*i, a*j) such that a*i is a best response to a*j and vice‐versa. To do comparative statics we will take a closer look at the best response functions. For player i the best response function (which determines the optimal level of ai) is a function of both aj and ci, which we will write BRi(aj, ci). We can use our previous results to show that BRi is increasing in aj and decreasing in ci. To see this note first that            "
"79","So far we have treated player i's decision problem in isolation. However, we would like to think about strategic interactions between i and j. As we have already seen, a decrease in the cost of arms to player i increases the level of arms in which player i invests. Further, an increase in player i's investment leads to an increase in player j's investment. Since a Nash equilibrium requires each player to choose a best response to the other's choice, this suggests that a decrease in player i's costs will increase the level of arms investment by both players.         "
"80","In order to formalize this intuition we need to think more generally about the nature of equilibria in game theoretic models. A Nash equilibrium is a profile of actions (a1, … , an) such that, for all i, ai=BRi(a−i), where BRi(a−i) is player i's best response to the actions a−i of all the other players. We can write a profile of actions as a vector a, and say that it is a Nash equilibrium if a=BR(a), where BR(a)=(BR1(a−1), … , BRn(a−n)). An equilibrium, then, is a fixed point of the map taking the vector a to BR(a). Thus we need to extend the earlier comparative statics ideas from optimization problems to fixed‐point problems.         "
"81","We start by formally defining strategic complementarity."
"82","Definition 6  A game has strategic complementarities if each player's decision problem has monotone comparative statics.            "
"83","Notice that in a game with strategic complementarities the best response functions will be increasing. That is, a player's optimal choice is increasing in each other player's choice. Intuitively, it is not surprising that strategic complementarity is sufficient to insure that if something increases one player's best response function, then all the optimal actions will increase, just as occurred when the costs to one player decreased in the arms race game. This intuition reflects the following theorem.13"
"84","Theorem 4  (Tarski)               Let f=(f1, f2, … , fn), where. If eachfiis increasing in a and θ, then a greatest and least fixed point exist, and they are increasing inθ.            "
"85","The first part of the theorem (the existence of fixed points) is illustrated in Figure 3. A fixed point in these two‐dimensional drawings is a value of x such that the value of the function (call it f) is also x (that is, x=f(x)). The picture on the right demonstrates that a decreasing function does not necessarily have a fixed point—a decreasing function with jumps need not cross the 45‐degree line. The picture on the left shows that an increasing function (even if it has jumps) always has a fixed point. To convince yourself of this try to draw a function (with or without jumps) from x= 0 to x= 1 such that it never crosses the 45 degree line (that is, x never equals f(x)).            "
"86","                 An Increasing Function Has at Least One Fixed Point But a Decreasing Function with Jumps Need Not                         "
"87","The second part of the theorem (monotone comparative statics) is illustrated in Figure 4. It is assumed that the function is increasing in the parameter. Thus, when the parameter increases from θ′ to θ, the function increases pointwise. The result is that both the least and greatest fixed points (marked in the figure) increase. Notice, that, as in the figure, fixed points other than the greatest and least may decrease rather than increase in the parameter. This is not of major concern, however, since Echenique (2002) shows that if equilibrium sets are ordered this way, then a broad class of adaptive adjustment processes will converge to greater equilibria whenever a shock increases the equilibrium set.            "
"88","                 An Increase from θ′ to θ Shifts f up (f Is Increasing in θ) and Consequently Both the Least and Greatest Fixed Points Increase                         "
"89","These game‐theoretic techniques can be applied to a range of substantive models of interest to political scientists. For instance, Tarski's fixed‐point theorem formalizes our earlier discussion of the arms race. We showed that the best response functions in the arms race model are increasing in the actions (the level of weapons investment) and the parameters (the cost of weapons). Given this, Tarksi's fixed‐point theorem establishes that an equilibrium exists and that it has monotone comparative statics."
"90","Many of the most important formal theory papers of the past 20 years have featured incomplete information. Thus it is important that monotone comparative statics techniques can simplify the analysis of these models as well. From an abstract perspective, extending the results to include uncertainty is easy—the expected payoff function must satisfy the single‐crossing condition. Indeed, the appeasement problem and the campaigning problem we studied in earlier sections are already problems of choice under uncertainty.         "
"91","Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to examine some results that are specific to uncertainty. The standard model of choice under uncertainty is expected payoff maximization—the decision maker maximizes            "
"92","As always in monotone comparative statics, we want to determine when a* is weakly increasing in s. Athey (2002) exploits the special structure of expected payoff maximization to find conditions on the Bernoulli utility function (u) and the probability distribution (f) that together imply that the expected utility function (U) is single crossing. In applications, it is often easier to check these more primitive conditions on utilities and distributions than to check directly whether the expected utility function is single crossing.         "
"93","The easiest way to understand the intuition for Athey's result is to start with the special case in which the unknown parameter θ can take only two values . In this case, expected utility maximization says            "
"94","It is easy to prove this intuitive conclusion if we strengthen the assumption that u is single crossing and instead assume that it has increasing differences. Let , and write the expected payoff as            "
"95","As demonstrated in this simple example, in order to study monotone comparative statics in incomplete information environments, we need a way to order probability distributions. In the example with just two values of θ, this is easy—one distribution is greater than a second if and only if it assigns higher probability to the larger value of θ. In the two value case, then, we can say that a distribution that assigns probability p to  is greater than another distribution that assigns probability p′ to  if p > p′.         "
"96","It turns out to be useful to rewrite this condition in a different way. We will say that a distribution (f(·, s1)) that assigns probability p to the higher parameter value is greater than a distribution (f(·, s2)) that assigns probability p′ to the higher parameter value if            "
"97","If we extend this ratio inequality to hold for all pairs θ1, θ2∈Θ, even when there are more than two values of θ, then we say that the s1 distribution likelihood ratiodominates the s2 distribution. This is a strong notion of “larger” for random variables.14"
"98","Definition 7  A distribution                                 f(·, s1)                                 monotone likelihood ratio dominates                               or is                                 larger in the likelihood ratio order than a distribution                                 f(·, s2), if for allθ1 > θ2, θ1, θ2∈Θ,               "
"99","We will also use the following, closely related definition."
"100","Definition 8  A family of distributions satisfies the monotone likelihood ratio property if it is indexed by parameters, s, that can be ordered such that                                 f(·, s′)               monotone likelihood ratio dominates                                 f(·, s″), for alls′ > s″.            "
"101","This definition simply says that if distributions can be rank ordered in terms of monotone likelihood ratio dominance, then they are said to satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property."
"102","Athey's theorem shows that the monotone likelihood ratio order is the notion of larger needed to extend single crossing to the case of uncertainty with more than two possible parameter values. We state two of her results, one for one‐dimensional problems and one that applies to multidimensional problems."
"103","Theorem 5 (Athey)                               "
"104"," Assume that A is one‐dimensional. If                        u, is single crossing in a and θ, and f satisfies the monotone likelihood ratio property, thenis single crossing in a and s and, therefore, a*(·)is weakly increasing in s.                     "
"105"," If u is either supermodular or log‐supermodular, and f satisfies the monotone likelihood ratio property, then                        a*is weakly increasing in s.15"
"106","We already know how to check the conditions on u. However, in order for this theorem to be useful, we must also be able to check whether the distribution satisfies the monotone likelihood ratio property.            "
"107","Recall from the definition that the likelihood ratio order requires               "
"108","We have described how to extend the single‐crossing property, and thereby monotone comparative statics, to problems involving uncertainty. However, the question remains as to whether there is any intuition underlying the assumption that the family of densities is ordered by the likelihood ratio order. Milgrom (1981) shows that this ordering on distributions is particularly natural in problems where the distributions are derived from Bayesian updating.            "
"109","To see why, assume that the decision maker has a prior distribution f on Θ and that she observes a signal with likelihoods p(s | θ). Using Bayes's rule, her posterior distribution is then               "
"110","To see how this is related to the model's primitives, rewrite Bayes's rule in odds form:               "
"111","Likelihoods that satisfy this condition also arise quite naturally in models of measurement error. Assume that the signal is a noisy observation of the true parameter value, s=θ+ε, where ε is a mean zero random variable independent of θ distributed according to a logconcave density, f. The likelihood ratio is . Since f is logconcave, the likelihood ratio is increasing in s.            "
"112","It will be instructive to see how these techniques can be applied in the appeasement problem we have already examined. Assume that the relative military strength of the satisfied state is q(θ), where θ is D's strength and q is decreasing. Further assume that S knows its own strength, but must rely on intelligence reports to assess D's strength. The intelligence service produces a signal, s=θ+ε, where ε is independent of θ and has a logconcave density, f. Due to the argument in the previous paragraph, S's posterior beliefs (f(θ | s)) satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property. The expected utility function is given by               "
"113","We have demonstrated a variety of ways in which monotone comparative static techniques aid formal theorists in building, solving, and deriving results from models. We have also discussed how qualitative empirical research can help to evaluate whether the assumptions necessary for monotone comparative statics hold. We conclude by discussing several ways in which monotone comparative statics have benefits for researchers who want to combine formal models and quantitative empirical research.16"
"114","There are several approaches to testing the empirical implications of theoretical models. An increasingly popular technique is to derive a complete likelihood function from a formal model augmented only by random noise. This structural modeling approach has been applied in each of the empirical subfields. A few examples include Diermeier, Eraslan, and Merlo's (2003) work on government formation in parliamentary systems, Smith's (1999) and Signorino's (1999) estimations of a variety of models of crisis bargaining in international relations, and Gowrisankaran, Mitchell, and Moro's (2003) estimate of the incumbency advantage in the United States Senate based on a formal model of electoral selection. The primary benefit of this approach is that it allows the researcher to fully estimate the structure of an equilibrium model. This provides a strong test of the theory and facilitates counterfactual simulations which are useful for prediction and policy evaluation.         "
"115","As Signorino and Yilmaz (2003) point out, the validity of this approach to estimation depends on the functional forms implied by the formal model accurately reflecting the true data‐generating process. Often, however, formal theorists think of their models as partial treatments, intended to isolate particular mechanisms of interest, but failing to capture the full complexity of the political situation being studied. In these situations, it may not be feasible to do structural estimation. Nonetheless, even if we cannot test the full specification of the model, we want to be able to test some of the predictions of the model, to determine whether the basic causal mechanisms the model identifies are important. When the monotone comparative statics approach applies, it facilitates this more limited type of testing of theoretical models by providing some assurance of the robustness of comparative static predictions even with an incompletely specified model.         "
"116","When we model a decision problem by assuming that a decision maker maximizes f(a, θ), we intend to highlight the role of θ in the determination of a. We typically do not intend to suggest that there are no other important determinants of a. That is, we think the true data‐generating process results from the maximization of f(a, θ) +g(a), for some arbitrary function g. Ideally, our results would be robust to such arbitrary perturbations that do not directly affect the particular relationship we are studying. Such robustness does not hold for all decision problems, but it does hold if f has increasing differences. In that case, f(a, θ) +g(a) satisfies the single crossing condition for all g. Thus increasing differences justifies drawing comparative statics conclusions from partially specified models. What is important for comparative statics is not fully specifying the problem, but only correctly specifying the parts of the problem where the variables of interest interact.         "
"117","By comparing the right‐hand panels of Figures 1 and 2 it is easy to see why increasing differences gives us this kind of robustness but single crossing on its own does not. No matter how one shifts the graph of the incremental return in Figure 2, it will remain single crossing. However, a shift of the incremental return in Figure 1 could easily cause the graph to cross zero more than once. More formally,the incremental return in the perturbed problem is            "
"118","Monotone comparative statics approaches provide some robustness against incorrect specification, and thus yield the type of prediction that can be tested even when we are not confident enough in our theoretical model to test its full specification. Because the comparative static predictions do not depend on precisely specifying the functional form, it is natural to test these limited claims nonparametrically, without making any assumptions except those necessary for monotonicity.17 This can be done, for example, by using rank tests, either on the raw data or on the residuals from regressions of the variables of interest on a vector of control variables (Rosenbaum 2002).         "
"119","For example, recall that in our model of the appeasement problem the level of expenditures on military buildup (z) and the offer of concession (x) were negatively correlated. Since, as discussed above, monotone comparative statics are invariant to monotone transformations of the domain, we can test this prediction of the model with only ordinal information, using Spearman's rank correlation test. Hence, when we are concerned that misspecifications of our theoretical model might limit the validity of structural estimation, but there are monotone comparative statics, we can suggest an alternative approach that still allows us to test the empirical implications of theoretical models with confidence in the robustness of our conclusions.         "
"120","It is important to note that monotone comparative statics do not provide robustness against arbitrary specification errors in standard linear models. Signorino and Yilmaz (2003) point out that omitted nonlinearity leads to omitted variable bias, and they show that simple strategic models of deterrence imply nonlinearities that make estimators like logit and probit inconsistent. They identify one case where the standard linear‐index estimators may be appropriate: the left‐hand side variable must be unconditionally monotonic in the regressors. Since omitted variable bias typically leads to bias in all of the coefficients, one needs this unconditional monotonicity in all of the regressors. Monotone comparative statics typically do not yield this strong result. In particular, the results described in this article are ceteris paribus results. In empirical applications, this means that the researcher needs control variables to isolate the effects described by the theory. But monotone comparative statics says nothing about unconditional monotonicity of the left‐hand‐side variable in these control variables.         "
"121","Thus, in our view, monotone comparative statics and associated nonparametric methods should be viewed as complementary to structural approaches. Monotone comparative statics, for instance, can play an important role in the approach advocated by Signorino and Yilmaz (2003) in which the researcher iterates between reduced form and structural models. By providing predictions that are robust to specification error, monotone comparative statics contribute by allowing for nonparametric testing that can then lead to revised theoretical models that approach a true model of the data generating process, leading ultimately to a model that can be structurally estimated.
