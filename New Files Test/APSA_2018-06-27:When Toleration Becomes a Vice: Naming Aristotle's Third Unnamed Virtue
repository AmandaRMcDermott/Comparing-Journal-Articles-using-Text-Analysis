"1","This project is not the first to look beyond the early modern tradition in search of additional resources to illuminate toleration.7 However, it is the first we are aware of to make the case that the virtue of toleration is akin to the nameless virtue of Book IV, Chapter 6 of the Nicomachean Ethics (EN).8 Before making this case, however, it is necessary to recall a few principles of the ethical system in which this virtue is situated.         "
"2","According to Aristotle, the goal of human life—happiness—is best understood, pursued, and achieved by living virtuously.9 Virtues are individual dispositions that best enable one to act in a manner conducive to human flourishing.10 They are dispositions because they describe a state of character or mind that dispose us to act in the right way. Aristotle divides virtue into two broad categories: intellectual and moral virtues. The intellectual virtues encompass such things as wisdom (sophia), intelligence (nous), and prudence (phronesis). This article, however, is principally concerned with the moral virtues, of which Aristotle identifies 10: courage, moderation, generosity, magnificence, magnanimity, and five “nameless” (anonymou) virtues (Curzer 2012; Gottlieb 2009). Moral virtues are dispositions (hexeis) of the soul that relate to particular realms of our “passions and actions” (1106b17). Since we do not possess moral virtues by nature, they must be cultivated by good habits through “the activities akin to them” (1103b22). In other words, the path to moral virtue is forged by consistent actions that approximate the virtue itself. For example, moderation is inculcated by constantly abstaining from pleasures. Hence, in examining and cultivating moral virtues, Aristotle is primarily concerned with feelings and action rather than thought. Whereas good action promotes virtue, bad action habituates vice.         "
"3","Aristotle's most famous ethical principle—the doctrine of the mean—is also central to his conception of moral virtue and, as will be argued, critical for understanding how toleration can become a vice. For Aristotle, moral virtue is best understood as the mean between two extremes. Just as with developing physical strength, the best activity resides between the excess of overexertion and the deficiency of inactivity. For example, courage is the mean between the vice of cowardice (the deficiency) and the vice of rashness (the excess). The courageous individual is neither ruled by fear (cowardice) nor completely immune to it (rashness). Moreover, along such continua, Aristotle suggests, people are more inclined toward the vice associated with pleasure, or at least the avoidance of pain (1109b8–9). With courage, for instance, most people tend to the deficiency of cowardice because acting cowardly is more likely to prevent pain. Nonetheless, the other extreme is just as degenerative—the soldier who runs recklessly into battle is not courageous; he is foolish and rash."
"4","According to Aristotle, most moral virtues are best understood as a mean between excess and deficiency. The doctrine of the mean, however, becomes more nuanced when he explains that this continuum is not simply an abstract set of values against which all actions are to be measured. Instead, virtue resides in “the mean relative to us” (1107a1). That is to say, Aristotle accounts for natural differences in our capacities. For example, courage for a large and athletic man will manifest differently than in a smaller, constitutionally weaker man. Nonetheless, the robust athleticism of the former may pose challenges for other virtues, such as moderation. Thus, for Aristotle, moral virtue is simultaneously guided by universal principles and the particular capacities of its practitioner."
"5","In addition to his awareness of varying capacities, Aristotle views virtuous action as contextually sensitive. Arguments concerning moral action and virtue may be “stated in outline only and not precisely” (1104a2). Acting virtuously is akin to the medical art; the proper course of action can neither be indiscriminately prescribed nor robotically implemented. Particulars are essential. The art of the doctor does not reside in memorizing a catalog of remedies, but in discerning which medicine, and how much, is appropriate in particular cases. Similarly, the virtuous individual is capable of identifying the relevant particulars in any situation and acting accordingly. Aristotle summarizes the importance of various particulars when discussing the feelings associated with moral virtue: One must “feel them when one ought and at the things one ought, in relation to those people whom one ought, for the sake of what and as one ought—all these constitute the middle as well as what is best, which is in fact what belongs to virtue” (1106b21–24). In short, the demands of virtue change according to circumstance. It is essential, therefore, that the individual maintain the appropriate disposition (hexis) to act in the right way.         "
"6","This general outline provides a preliminary grounding for thinking about toleration as a moral virtue. When understood as a moral virtue, toleration refers to the disposition of an individual, in pursuit of human flourishing, to feel and act in a certain way. According to this conceptualization, toleration describes the behavior and character of an individual, not a policy proposal or the status of a particular group.11 Toleration, like other moral virtues, is cultivated when individuals act in ways that resist the temptations of each vice and approximate the aims of the virtue. Moreover, when applied to toleration, these principles reveal why the standard binary of tolerance and intolerance is inadequate. Although a subsequent section examines the vices of toleration more deeply, it is important to note here that toleration is a mean between two extremes. Aristotle's reflections on the doctrine of the mean also highlight that the most common vices are those associated with pleasure, not pain. In other words, intolerance—the vice that inappropriately causes pain to others—is not the most prominent perversion of the virtue. In addition, the mean of toleration is a mean relative to us that is sensitive to various contextual factors. Due to its sensitivity to our own capacities and situation, tolerant conduct cannot be universally prescribed or outlined.         "
"7","Finally, for Aristotle, the virtues are not realized independently. Virtues do not exist in a vacuum; they are closely bound up with their moral and intellectual counterparts. To detach a virtue from Aristotle's ethics and expect it to operate of its own accord is akin to removing an organ from the body and demanding life. Given its contextual nature, the most relevant intellectual virtue to realizing moral virtues appears to be practical wisdom (phronesis). For, as Aristotle says, “it is not possible to be good in the authoritative sense in the absence of prudence (phronesis), nor is it possible to be prudent in the absence of moral virtue” (1144b30–33). The study of any moral virtue must not disregard phronesis and the larger constellation of virtues that Aristotle outlines.         "
"8","Aristotle identifies 10 moral virtues: courage, moderation, generosity, magnificence, magnanimity, and five “nameless” (anonymou) virtues. That these latter virtues are unnamed points to the new ground Aristotle is covering in his Nicomachean Ethics. As Paula Gottlieb (2009, 38–39) notes, the existence of nameless virtues demonstrates that Aristotle did more than simply name the prevailing dispositions of his times; he was also uncovering virtues for which there were no fitting terms. While all Greeks would have no difficulty recognizing courage and moderation as virtues, for example, Aristotle could only use analogous names for the latter five. The analogous names are (1) timeis orexei: the virtue of longing for small honor, (2) praoteis: gentleness, (3) philia: friendliness, (4) aleitheutikos: truthfulness, and (5) eutrapeloi: wittiness. Each nameless virtue appears in Book IV of the Nicomachean Ethics.         "
"9","Several scholars have noted that the nameless virtues all pertain to social relations (Allen 2004; Curzer 2012; Gottlieb 2009; Lombardini 2013). Although it has been argued that other moral virtues are social (Avramenko 2011; Ward 2001), the nameless virtues are necessarily bound to our interactions with others. In other words, these nameless virtues speak to our habits of behavior in face‐to‐face encounters. This is especially so for the third nameless virtue—covered in Book IV, Chapter 6—that Aristotle says is like friendliness (philia). In Talking to Strangers, Danielle Allen (2004, 127) notes that although Aristotle calls this virtue friendliness, it “can be separated from the emotions of love and goodwill and be distilled into habits of resolving rivalrous self‐interest into consent in any context—whether friendly, commercial, or political.” Lombardini (2013) and Curzer (2012) suggest that this virtue, combined with the other nameless virtues, form something like political virtue, or the ethos of citizenship. This public ethos looks very much like what Teresa Bejan and others call civility (Allen 2004; Bejan 2011, 2017; Boyd 2006). But this unnamed virtue is not itself civility—it is one of the five dispositions that Aristotle regards as necessary, but not sufficient, for “civil” behavior toward others. As such, this nameless virtue is more complex and demanding than mere affability or decorum and more specific and nuanced than civility.12"
"10","Like the other unnamed virtues, philia pertains to “our associations with one another, both in living together and in sharing in speeches and actions” (1126b11–12). Philia, of course, means friendship, and two of the 10 books of the Nicomachean Ethics are devoted to this topic. The third unnamed virtue, however, is not friendship. It is only like friendship because “it is without the relevant passion, that is, the feeling of affection for those with whom one associates” (1126b22–24). Thus, the virtue that is like friendship arises even in the absence of affective bonds—it also pertains to passing acquaintances, fellow citizens, and even foreigners with whom we interact in our everyday social and political lives.13"
"11","This brings us to the substance of the third unnamed virtue. Aristotle writes that it pertains to the “speeches and actions” (logon kai pragmaton) we encounter in our associations with others (1126b13). In particular, the person with this virtue “will approve of (apodexetai) what he ought and in the way he ought, and similarly also disapprove (dyscheranei)” (1126b18–19). The verb Aristotle uses for “approval,” apodexomai, refers to that which we deem ethically praiseworthy or logically sound. For example, he uses the same word to render the approval of sound logic: “to accept (apodexesthai) the persuasive speech from a skilled mathematician” (1094b25–26).14 Similarly, the verb Aristotle uses for disapproval (dyscheraino) refers to ethical disapproval, or even moral disgust. The truly moderate person, for example, “does not take pleasure in those things that are particularly pleasant to a licentious person—rather, he is disgusted (dyscherainei) by them” (1119a12–14). Elsewhere, he tells us that “the serious person, insofar as he is serious, delights in actions that accord with virtue and is disgusted (dyscherainei) by those that stem from vice” (1170a9–11).15 It is clear, then, that the type of approval and disapproval Aristotle has in mind goes beyond matters of mere decorum or propriety, as Rackham's translation suggests.16 This virtue pertains to circumstances involving ethical approval and disapproval of substantial consequence.         "
"12","Moreover, this virtue involves more than just passive, or internal, approval or disapproval of the speeches and deeds we come across in daily life. Aristotle makes clear that the virtue entails certain external actions. It is for this reason that the third unnamed virtue can indeed be named. The third unnamed virtue pertains to how one should act in the face of serious ethical disagreement—the essential premise of toleration outlined in the introduction. The only notable difference in Aristotle's conception is his inclusion of ethical approbation. Whereas toleration is commonly associated only with cases of ethical disagreement in speeches and action, Aristotle suggests that the same virtue is at work when we agree with those we encounter. In other words, we can both agree and disagree in appropriate and inappropriate ways. To repeat Aristotle's description, the person with this virtue will “approve of what he ought and in the way he ought, and similarly also disapprove.” It is for this reason that this nameless virtue has a more proper name—toleration. Aristotle's toleration, therefore, is the moral virtue appropriate to engaging in ethical agreement and disagreement with others.         "
"13","According to Aristotle, toleration is the virtue that guides us to “associate with others in the way we ought” (1126b29). More specifically, toleration entails not only approval or disapproval of another's speeches and deeds, but also consideration of how our response will be received by the tolerated individual. It is for this reason that toleration is primarily “concerned with the pleasures and pains that arise in the course of our associations with others” (1126b31–32). To approve of another's conduct will provide pleasure, whereas openly disapproving will likely lead the other to feel some degree of discomfort or pain. According to Aristotle, toleration helps us decide when each response is appropriate and to what degree."
"14","Given the sensitivity of issues addressed by toleration, context is very important. The individual with this virtue “will act similarly in the case of both those he does not know and those he does know, of both those who are intimates and those who are not,” but with the important caveat that “he will also do what is suitable in each case” (1126b25–27). This passage acknowledges that toleration requires firm convictions but will also look different according to circumstance. For example, our response to ethically objectionable conduct by a stranger should be different than when the same act is committed by someone with whom we work, or by a family member. The virtuous individual “will also associate differently among people of worth than among people at random, just as he will associate differently also with those who are more or less known to him, and similarly in the case of other relevant differences, assigning to each what is fitting” (1126b36–1127a2). Aristotle's toleration, therefore, recognizes the practical limitations in our consideration of others and the ethical sensitivity required when dealing with matters that may be difficult or uncomfortable to address. In other words, he outlines a disposition, pertaining to matters of ethical disagreement (and agreement), that informs us whether another's convictions and practices are so false and bad that there are no positive reasons for putting up with them. If this is the case, and ethical disapproval reaches a certain threshold, toleration requires intervention that will likely cause psychological discomfort or pain."
"15","If this interpretation is correct, and Aristotle's third nameless virtue is, in fact, toleration, we can learn much more about the virtue by examining its operation according to Aristotelian principles. That is to say, like all moral virtues, toleration (1) can be understood as a mean between two extremes, (2) concerns an appropriate balance of pleasure and pain, and (3) is attuned to the particulars of the situation for its realization. In short, contrary to conventional wisdom, toleration is not merely the inverse of intolerance; it is a virtue that is the mean between two vicious deviations. The next section spells out these vices in more detail."
"16","For Aristotle, vices are either the excess or deficiency of a moral virtue. This section details both vices of toleration to demonstrate how it may become a vice in two distinct ways. First, when toleration is taken too far—in excess—it becomes universal praise, or what Aristotle calls obsequiousness (areskos). This vice pertains to “those who praise everyone with a view to pleasing them and oppose nothing, but rather suppose they ought not to cause pain (lupeo) to anyone they may meet” (1126b16–7). The word Aristotle uses for this vice, areskos, is relatively common among Greek authors. Plato, for example, uses the word to denounce the democratic soul in The Republic, “leading his own life in the way that pleases him” (1991, 557b, emphasis added). Aristotle, in his reflections on friendship, claims that “those who have many friends and fall in with everyone as familiars seem to be friends with no one—except as fellow citizens—and people in fact call these types ‘obsequious’ (areskous)” (1171a15–17). In other words, the obsequious person is shallow and not to be relied on in a proper friendship. Likewise, in matters pertaining to our social relations, pleasing others—instead of engaging the substantive issue at hand—is the overly tolerant person's aim.         "
"17","Thus, in everyday affairs, the obsequious individual always seeks to cause pleasure and avoid pain or discomfort in relations with others. This orientation is problematic, Aristotle explains, when circumstances do not warrant causing another pleasure on account of certain words and deeds. Some matters call for disagreement, not praise. Aristotle writes of the truly tolerant—the virtuous—person in disagreement:            "
"18","In all cases in which it is not noble, or is harmful, for him to contribute to [another's] pleasure, he will disapprove of doing so, and he will choose to cause them pain. If something would bring no little disgrace or harm to the person doing it, while opposing it would cause little pain, he will not approve but rather disapprove of it (1126b32–7)."
"19","In other words, in cases where the speech or deed is particularly ignoble or harmful, the virtue of toleration may require resistance and contestation, even in a manner that is embarrassing or painful for the other. It is important to note, however, that Aristotle does not justify causing discomfort for its own sake. He also does not endorse causing any form of physical pain. Instead, as detailed in the next section, the tolerant individual recognizes that virtue may require causing some psychological discomfort or mental pain on behalf of a greater good. Some speeches and deeds are so ethically objectionable that silence is not appropriate. Obsequious individuals, on the other hand, are not disposed to offer this resistance when necessary."
"20","In his account of this vice, Aristotle does not explain the motive animating this conduct, only noting that some act obsequiously out of a “supposed necessity” (oiomenoi dein) to avoid causing others pain (alupoi; 1126b14). From whence might this supposed necessity arise? One possibility is prominent social injunctions and expectations that impose such demands on the behavior of individuals seeking to conform or fit in. In other words, excessive toleration may arise from a particular kind of social pressure. On this point, it is important to recall that, for Aristotle, the vices associated with pleasure are more common than those associated with pain—cowardice is more prominent than rashness. If this is true, excessive toleration is more seductive than the more commonly recognized intolerance.         "
"21","As a final point on the vice of excess, Aristotle distinguishes between those who are merely obsequious and those who are obsequious for ulterior motives, namely, flatterers. Aristotle writes of the overly pleasant: “He who does so in order to gain some benefit for himself, in money and all that comes from money, is a flatterer (kolax)” (1127a8–10). Such instances of flattery, it seems, are an especially debased form of toleration. Whereas the obsequious individual may refuse to intervene out of ignorance or cowardice, the flatterer, necessarily, does so out of personal aggrandizement. The obsequious and the flatterer, therefore, are different. Although their actions may appear the same, the flatterer is distinguished from the obsequious individual by ulterior motives. Motive, then, is a crucial element of toleration.         "
"22","On the other end of the toleration continuum, we find the deficiency. Those deficient in toleration are what Aristotle calls surly and quarrelsome (dyskoloi kai dyserides). He does not distinguish between these terms as he does with obsequiousness and flattery. In fact, in the Nicomachean Ethics, each appearance of the word quarrelsome (dyserides) is paired with the word surly (dyskoloi) when describing this vice (1108a31, 1126b16, 1127a10). His use of surly (dyskoloi), however, is more telling. In Book VIII, he uses dyskoloi to describe older people and their aversion to new friendships (1158a2). This parallels Plato's use in the Laws, where he says the surly man is “ill humored and not at all gracious … more glum and, for the most part, more filled with complaints than a good man ought to be” (Plato, 1988, 792a–b), or later, where he suggests that the dyskolos man is just the sort of fellow nobody likes to deal with, at least not while sober: “To test a harsh (dyskolou) and savage soul from which tens of thousands of injustices come, is it safer to run the risks involved in making contracts or to get together with it at the festival sights of Dionysus?” (649e–650a). Thus, deficient toleration includes both closed‐mindedness and ferocity toward others. In contemporary language, to be deficiently tolerant is, at the very least, to be an argumentative jerk or, even worse, a foul‐mouthed bigot.         "
"23","Whereas obsequiousness involves universal praise and pleasure, those deficient in the virtue have few, if any, compunctions about causing psychological or emotional pain in others. In this vicious form, disapproval and difference open the way for malice and ferocity. For Aristotle, this is the wrong approach to causing pain because it does not have the good of the other as its end. He writes, “And while [the virtuous individual] chooses to contribute to the pleasure of others (synedynein) for its own sake and is cautious about causing others pain (lupein), he is guided by the consequences at stake—I mean if what is noble and advantageous may be greater” (1127a2–5). The tolerant individual must always keep the good of the other in mind, even in the most severe case of disagreement. Both the obsequious and the intolerant do not maintain this end of the virtue.         "
"24","What can the two vices tell us about the virtue itself? Three observations emerge. Most importantly, the virtue is concerned with the appropriate balance of pleasure and pain as they relate to individual flourishing. Both are important in understanding toleration. Second, the vicious individual is generally unconcerned with the nuance of context. Whereas Aristotle tells us that the virtuous person acts in the right way, at the right time, and to the right people, both the obsequious and surly individuals have little regard for the particulars of their encounters—they are inclined to be quarrelsome or obsequious in all encounters. If they happen to act appropriately because the context actually warrants their usual response, it is not virtue because, as Aristotle notes, virtuous actions involve deliberate choice and not mindless adherence to prescriptions (1114a20–25). Finally, insofar as toleration is principally concerned with pleasure and pain, it is with the pleasure and pain of concrete individuals, not abstract groups. Although certain aspects of group status and power relations are relevant considerations for the virtuous individual, the vices he outlines demonstrate that they are secondary to the particular interlocutor involved.         "
"25","Perhaps the most foreign of these observations is the notion that toleration may involve causing pain in others. As mentioned, recent efforts to transform toleration are predicated on a refusal to cause pain and suffering because causing pain is considered cruel. The claim, then, that pleasure is not the end of virtue—that is to say, that pain is sometimes unavoidable—rings discordant to the modern ear. The next section identifies how both pleasure and pain contribute to our understanding of moral virtue generally and to the virtue of toleration in particular."
"26","The chief argument of this section is that, for Aristotle, the correct relation to pleasure and pain for oneself enables the right relation to others’ experience of these sensations. In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle examines the nature and function of pleasure and pain in three places: II.3, VII.11–14, and X.1–5.17 This section examines passages from all three books to suggest Aristotle's consistent use of both pleasure (hedon‐) and pain (lup‐) and their relation to moral virtue in general and toleration in particular. Three principles of pleasure and pain emerge as immediately relevant. First, pleasure should not be the primary motive of virtuous action. Second, causing pain in others—through contestation or disagreement, for example—is sometimes necessary and good. Finally, causing pleasure and pain in others must be in the service of human flourishing, understood as pursuing the noble (kalo) and advantageous (sympheronti).         "
"27","Before outlining these principles in detail, it is important to define pleasure and pain generally. Although these terms take on a variety of meanings throughout Aristotle's Ethics, this analysis follows Frede (2006, 258) in understanding the terms as always adhering to the same general definitions. Namely, “they encompass a wide field of psychological states. Pleasure and pain designate any kind of positive or negative type of sensation, perception, feeling, mood or attitude.” In other words, pleasure and pain are the respective genera of positive and negative feelings associated with a host of moral and psychological sensations.         "
"28","To understand pleasure and pain for Aristotle, we must examine their function in the life of the virtuous individual—the standard for moral psychology in Aristotle's thought.18 This perspective reveals the first principle: pleasure should not be the primary motive of virtuous action. This does not mean that Aristotle disdains pleasure. He is clear from the opening of the Nicomachean Ethics that pleasure is inherent to the virtuous life. “The life [of those who love what is noble],” he writes, “has no need of additional pleasure, like a sort of added charm, but possess pleasure in itself” (1099a15‐19). The virtuous individual, in other words, is capable of fully appreciating the pleasure inherent in noble conduct.19 Aristotle is thus no Stoic; he does not denounce the enjoyment or pursuit of pleasure so long as it is the right kind of pleasure—namely, that which arises from right conduct.20"
"29","The difficulty arises, however, when pleasant sensations become the primary motive of conduct because pleasure is susceptible to significant perversion.21 Instead, Aristotle argues, virtuous conduct should involve three considerations—what is noble (kalo), what is advantageous (sympheronti), and what is pleasant (hedos). Among these, however, pleasure warrants significant attention due to its great potential to mislead. He writes, “In all these the good person is apt to be correct, the bad person to err, but especially regarding pleasure. For pleasure is common to the animals and attendant upon all things done through choice, since both what is noble and what is advantageous appear pleasant” (1104b33–1105a1). Pleasure, then, is not only a motivating force—like the advantageous and the noble—but also a by‐product, as it were, of the higher motivators. We are not to shun pleasure altogether because it naturally arises from virtuous action. Nonetheless, as a widespread motivating factor of action, shared even with animals, pleasure is the principle of ethical choice most susceptible to perversion. Because the noble and advantageous are themselves pleasant, pleasure may acquire a deceptive luster that blinds us to consideration of these higher principles. For Aristotle, virtuous individuals should aim at all three objectives, but pursuing pleasure should always be circumscribed by the noble and advantageous.         "
"30","How might this principle—that pleasure ought not be our primary motive for conduct—inform our analysis of toleration? The relevance is most evident in toleration's vices. Obsequiousness is often motivated by a desire to please others, or at least avoid causing emotional pain. This vice foregoes consideration of the interlocutor's nobility and advantage, often subordinating these goods to pleasant feelings. Quarrelsomeness, on the other extreme, demonstrates how the disregard for the pain of others is also wrong, as this attitude neglects the good of the interlocutor and focuses on pain alone. Aristotle condemns both vices—they prioritize pleasure and pain to the point of abandoning the useful and the noble. Causing pleasure or pain, in short, should not be the primary motive of tolerant behavior."
"31","The second principle of pleasure and pain is perhaps most difficult for modern sensibilities. Aristotle argues that causing others pain can be noble and advantageous. Regarding toleration, he argues that, under certain circumstances, it is virtuous to disapprove and contest another's convictions or conduct in a way that may cause pain. This perspective is not entirely lost on contemporary scholars of toleration. Recognizing the disapproval and intervention inherent to toleration, Tønder (2013, 13) observes that many recent scholars provide “neo‐Kantian” metrics for deciding when such contestation is appropriate. Aristotle agrees that some such threshold must be determined, but he provides an alternative to the neo‐Kantian calculation that Tønder describes. Instead of outlining abstract thresholds for contestation and intervention in cases of ethical disagreement, Aristotle invokes an illustrative analogy: Toleration is closely associated with philia because it resembles “the sort of person we mean by a fitting (epiekein) friend” (1126b22). A fitting or good friend is someone who not only praises our good actions, but also corrects us when we are wrong or misled. The good friend does not stand by while we hurt or dishonor ourselves. Instead, friends intervene and are willing to cause pain to lead us away from bad activity or false speech. The good friend is guided by a genuine concern for nobility or advantage that justifies intervention or contestation.         "
"32","Toleration, Aristotle suggests, operates analogously. When ethical contentions arise, we should, like the good friend, only cause pain in others if it aims at a greater good. This is complicated, however, by the fact that Aristotle's toleration is “without the relevant passion” of friendship (1126b24). Why should we hold this degree of concern for those with whom we have no affective relation? From whence will this concern arise? The concern motivating tolerant behavior, Aristotle explains, arises from the virtuous individual “as a result of being the sort of person he is” (1126b25). Although perplexing at first, his point is quite straightforward. To be virtuous, Aristotle suggests, necessitates a concern for human flourishing, both for oneself and others. True toleration is other‐regarding; it pursues the good of both the tolerator and the tolerated.22"
"33","The virtue of toleration, therefore, arises from a concern for the good of the other and the corresponding recognition that pain is sometimes necessary. This may include causing pain in the form of open disagreement and critique of others’ unjust, incorrect, or shameless actions or beliefs. To be clear, Aristotle counsels neither causing physical pain nor forcing someone to believe or act in a certain way. Instead, pain may be the consequence of contesting, even publicly, intolerable behavior. As jarring as this might be to certain sensibilities, Aristotle's tolerant person occasionally ought to disagree and contest even if it leads to pain or discomfort in others. For Aristotle, not all pain is cruel."
"34","This brings us to the third principle of pleasure and pain. As the previous two principles illustrate, the arbiter of pleasure and pain in social relations is the good of the other, expressed by Aristotle as pursuing the advantageous and noble. In the case of toleration, these concepts are essential for determining virtuous behavior. When deciding how to respond to objectionable behavior, Aristotle explains that the virtuous individual “is guided by the consequences at stake—I mean, if what is noble (kalo) and advantageous (sympheronti) is greater [than the pleasure or pain involved]” (1127a2–5). In other words, it might well be that the pleasure or pain caused by contesting objectionable behavior supersedes the “good” it intends. Consider the difference between addressing a concern with a colleague in a private versus public setting. Telling a colleague behind the closed door of one's office that his alcohol consumption is unprofessional or unethical is quite different from doing so in a full faculty meeting. The latter is likely to cause more pain than necessary and seems inconsiderate of the other's good. It is the task of the tolerant individual to weigh the relevant pleasures and pains and intervene only when these do not outweigh another's advantage or nobility. In other words, the central concern of toleration must be what is noble and advantageous both for the tolerant person and the interlocutor. Thus, Aristotle's understanding of toleration circles back to the end for which we study virtue in the first place: human happiness and flourishing. Virtue is not limited to our own pursuit of these ends; it necessitates genuine concern for others. To stand by while others bring disgrace or harm upon themselves or others is contrary to the flourishing at the heart of virtuous conduct.         "
"35","In sum, Aristotle provides a framework for recognizing that not all pain is cruel. On the contrary, just as rewards and pleasure can encourage habits conducive to human flourishing, non‐cruel pain has a role to play in relations with others. This is the case for the tolerant individual who may disagree or contest others in a way that may be uncomfortable or psychologically painful. Likewise, sometimes we must tolerate others when their speech makes us uncomfortable. Virtuous behavior, especially concerning agreement and disagreement with others in social interactions, requires the ability and willingness to mete out pleasure and pain in pursuit of the noble and advantageous. So long as individual flourishing remains the primary motive, causing appropriate pleasure and pain is a necessary capacity for the tolerant individual."
"36","If this article accomplishes anything, it is to provide a conceptual foundation to explain how toleration can become a vice. Whereas conventional understandings tend to construe toleration as a binary consisting of tolerance and intolerance, invoking Aristotelian virtue ethics introduces the problem of excessive toleration. By understanding it as a mean between two vices, toleration, like the other moral virtues, ceases to be a virtue when deficient or excessive. Uncovering toleration as the third unnamed virtue in Book IV, Chapter 6 of the Nicomachean Ethics allows for an examination of these vices. The deficient form—what Aristotle calls quarrelsomeness—is well known today under the moniker of intolerance. Taken to its extreme, this kind of intolerance responds to disagreement and difference with the unimaginable cruelty addressed by early modern thinkers and later by Judith Shklar (1989). Moreover, intolerance involves the improper comportment to difference in the form of bigotry, racism, or public humiliation. In either case, the aim of the intolerant person is not the good of the other. In the words of Aristotle, the intolerant do not pursue the noble and advantageous for others, the community, or themselves. Deficient toleration, it seems, requires little explanation from Aristotle.         "
"37","It is the excess of toleration that eludes most contemporary thinkers—a vice Aristotle calls obsequiousness or flattery. The excessively tolerant person, Aristotle tells us, responds to ethical disagreements with universal praise or by offering the pleasure required by social conformity. The inability or unwillingness to intervene when there are no positive reasons for tolerating a conviction or practice, or worse, when a conviction or practice is demonstrably harmful, is not toleration. It is a vice. To suggest, as some have, that toleration entails respect, praise, or even celebration of cultural practices that include such things as female genital mutilation, pedophilia, or misogyny entirely overlooks the good of human flourishing. In addition to the obvious necessity of contesting practices of physical cruelty and abridgment of individual rights, the excess of toleration is also debased when it concerns matters of civil and intellectual exchange. For example, to reject the free debate of contentious ideas on campus because it causes certain uncomfortable feelings is part and parcel of toleration taken too far. To disagree with someone, or to be disagreed with, might well be painfully uncomfortable, but this does not necessarily entail cruelty. This point may well elude the excessively tolerant person because, as we glean from Aristotle, the excessively tolerant tend to use pleasure and pain as the benchmark of appropriate action, rather than the advantageous and noble."
"38","As such, like the intolerant foul‐mouthed bigot, the excessively tolerant person is not concerned with human flourishing. Instead, his or her behavior arises from (1) an aversion to observing pain in others—an aversion that often manifests itself by avoiding uncomfortable conversations, criticism, or differences of opinion, even in the face of convictions or practices one finds abhorrent; or (2) a desire to praise everyone, hoping to please them. Acting with pleasure and pain as the primary motivator of decent human relations, the excessively tolerant person does not contest—or perhaps even respects and praises—convictions and practices that are so false or bad that there is no positive reason for tolerating them. Moreover, this person may even find cause to interfere with the virtuous person who has enough courage to intervene, and enough good sense to know when and how to do so. Armed with Aristotelian toleration, the virtuous person will understand that not all pain is cruel and pleasure is not the true end of toleration. This individual will know that in liberal communities, where the law permits all sorts of harmful behavior, excessive toleration might be as harmful as deficient toleration. Without such a principled foundation, the virtue of toleration can become a vice."
