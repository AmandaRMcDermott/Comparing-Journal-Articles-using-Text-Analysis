"1","In the last 15 years, political scientists have approached the question of how to accurately estimate models of compositional dependent variables (e.g., Katz and King 1999; Tomz, Tucker, and Wittenberg 2002). A compositional variable, V, consists of a row of vectors of J components. If we label each individual observation in time for the value of a particular part of the same composition as , we can describe a compositional variable as having four defining characteristics.1 First, each component of the composition must have a value between 0 and 1:            "
"2","From the properties displayed in Equations 1 and 2, it follows that any change in a single component be bounded by −1 and 1,            "
"3","In their discussion of the size and trend of the electoral advantage of incumbents in the United Kingdom, Katz and King (1999) introduced the recommendations of Aitchison to political science. They recognized the problems of applying standard regression models to data with strict bounded and additive constraints and recommended overcoming the limitations of ordinary least squares (OLS) by first transforming the data and then maximizing the likelihood of a multivariate t distribution (as opposed to an additive normal distribution). Additional work (Tomz, Tucker, and Wittenberg 2002) argued that the problems explained by Katz and King (1999) could be addressed through solutions that were less statistically complicated and less demanding for analysis of compositions with more than three categories (see also Jackson 2002 and Mikhailov, Niemi, and Weimer 2002). Tomz, Tucker, and Wittenberg (2002) instead proposed the evaluation of compositional data through the use of seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR), demonstrating that this method is as easy to use as OLS and can perform as well as or better than the Katz‐King approach. These efforts have greatly helped to shape the ways in which scholars deal with the estimation and interpretation of compositional models in static contexts. Despite this progress, the extant literature is largely silent on how to address the estimation and interpretation of models of compositional dependent variables in dynamic contexts.         "
"4","Political scientists currently model time‐series compositional dependent variables in a simplified fashion—they model the temporal dynamics of a single category of their compositional dependent variable compared to all other categories lumped together.6 This occurs in a wide range of subfields, but most prominently in analyses of political support and political budgeting. In dynamic models of political support (e.g., Lewis‐Beck 1997; Nicholson, Segura, and Woods 2002), researchers tend to model support for the party of the chief executive, thereby implicitly lumping support for all other political parties together. In dynamic models of political budgeting, researchers tend to model the proportion of spending on a single budget category (e.g., Lipsmeyer 2011; Stasavage 2005), implicitly lumping all other budgetary categories together. While these types of models can provide insights about what influences support or spending for one category, they cannot answer important questions about trade‐off relationships that lie at the core of our theories in political science. For instance, in a composition with three categories, it is interesting to find out whether an increase in independent variable  leads to an increase in category . But it is equally interesting to find out whether that increase in  leads to a decrease in , , or both.         "
"5","As seen in the work of Aitchison (1982, 1983, 1986), theories about shifts in compositions are best assessed not through absolute changes but through relative changes. If we expect an independent variable to have a positive or negative effect on one compositional category, what we are really observing is an increase or a decrease in the proportion of that category as compared to other pieces of the compositional pie. In other words, we need to move from theorizing about and modeling the impact of independent variables on the level or change in the level of one category of the dependent variable to theorizing about and modeling the impact of independent variables on the relative levels or relative changes in levels of dependent variable categories (Aitchison 1986). In theory, each independent variable can be associated with an expected positive, negative, or null relationship for each possible pairwise trade‐off between categories of the dependent variable. For example, in the case of a dependent variable with four categories (A, B, C, and D), each independent variable is linked to six pairwise trade‐off relationships (A/B, A/C, A/D, B/C, B/D, and C/D). When evaluated over time, these trade‐offs (or ratios) may vary depending on environmental shocks to the overall composition. Though the introduction of dynamic trade‐offs suggests a complicated framework, such an approach allows scholars to more accurately model the underlying causal relationships that exist in the real world. Without this type of analysis, models of the components of a political process that change over time will continue to be a poor representation of reality.         "
"6","Aitchison's (1986) suggestion of a log‐ratio transformation for compositional variables follows the logic that there is a one‐to‐one correspondence between compositional vectors and related log‐ratio vectors. Such transformations are mathematically easier to handle than ratios. Once they have been created, researchers can test theories about their variables of interest using standard unconstrained multivariate statistical models with the log‐ratio transformed variables as dependent variables. Interpretation of model results, then, involves the additional step of translating quantities of interest back into their original compositional structures. In models where the dependent variable is compositional, the use of a log‐ratio transformation makes much of the interpretation of model results very similar to interpretations of results from multinomial logit models. Researchers perform these log‐ratio transformations by selecting one category of the compositional variable as the baseline category, which we will identify as , and then dividing the value of the dependent variable for all other categories, , by the value of the baseline category, , and taking the natural log of each resulting ratio.7 Thus, for a compositional dependent variable  with J components and the chosen denominator category labeled as , we would calculate  logged ratios, which we label , such that            "
"7","In examining compositions over time, some of the logged ratios may be nonstationary. In fact, it is possible to have a mixture of stationary and nonstationary series for both the  and  series.8 As with any time‐series analysis, we recommend unit root testing to determine the order of integration for each individual series. As long as none of the  series have more than a single unit root, we propose that the best approach for modeling compositional time series is through error correction models (ECMs).9 ECMs estimate the rate at which the dependent variable returns to an equilibrium point after changes in independent variable values. As shown by De Boef and Keele (2008), these models are not limited to cointegrated series but can be used with stationary data much like an autoregressive distributed lag model. With ECMs, analysts directly estimate the short‐run effect of independent variables and their standard errors and also can determine long‐run effects through straightforward calculations. We see five benefits in using an ECM: the estimation of short‐ and long‐term effects, the ease of interpretation of these effects, the applicability to both integrated (as long as ) and stationary time series (), the ability to estimate ECMs with OLS, and the capacity to model multiple theoretical relationships in the same model. In situations where , the estimation of an ECM can be carried out with OLS.10 When , we follow the recommendation of previous scholars (Jackson 2002; Mikhailov, Niemi, and Weimer 2002; Tomz, Tucker, and Wittenberg 2002) in advocating the use of a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimation approach. This method, developed by Zellner (1962), allows for the estimation of equations that may have correlated errors. We estimate our ECMs using SUR for two main reasons. First, we do so because the dependent variable values, , are measured at the same time for the same spatial unit and must sum to 1; an overestimate of one constituent part results in an underestimate of another. Second, we argue that researchers should use the same regressors to model each compositional outcome of interest and, consequently, have reason to believe that contemporaneous correlation of the errors may be present.         "
"8","Thus, our modeling strategy is to test theoretical claims about compositional dependent variables with more than two categories in models with the following specification:            "
"9","The modeling strategy that we propose is appropriate for researchers who have a compositional dependent variable that meets the conditions laid out in Equations 1–4. They must also have measures of both their dependent variable and the independent variables that they view as theoretically causally related to their dependent variable over a sufficient number of equally spaced time points.13"
"10","The task of interpreting the estimates from models specified according to Equation 6 may at first seem daunting. There are, after all,  equations, and the number of parameter estimates produced is equal to , where K is the number of independent variables included in the model.14 To add to the complexity, all parameters are estimates of the marginal effect of the independent variables on logged ratios between pairs of categories of the dependent variable.15 In addition, the ECM specification means that each independent variable can have both a short‐ and long‐run effect on the dependent variable. While the voluminous raw results can be useful for making assessments about whether or not these individual pairwise marginal effects are statistically significant, we follow the growing convention in political science of making substantively meaningful inferences about the effects of independent variables through graphic displays of model‐based simulations (e.g., King, Tomz, and Wittenberg 2000).         "
"11","Using this approach, we begin by identifying scenarios that are of theoretical interest and then graphically viewing the resulting trade‐offs between the compositional parts of the dependent variable over both the short and long run. Although we can produce these graphical presentations either analytically or through simulation, we follow the strategy of building dynamic simulations (Whitten and Williams 2011; Williams and Whitten 2011, 2012).         "
"12","To conduct these simulations, we take the results from our seemingly unrelated regression error correction model to produce 1,000 parameter estimates using the Clarify program developed by Tomz, Wittenber, and King (2003). There is a wide range of different simulation scenarios that are of substantive interest. To obtain an initial assessment of our model results, we start with scenarios in which we only change the value of one independent variable and visually assess the impact that this has on the predicted range of values for each category of the dependent variable. To run these types of simulations, which we call “change from baseline simulations,” we set the lagged dependent variable to the sample mean for each category (). We also set the lagged independent variables to their sample mean values and set the values for each of the differenced independent variables to zero. Then, taking the predicted values of our dependent variable outcomes (relative to the baseline category), we add those values to the previous value of the lagged dependent variable, generate new predicted values for each category of the dependent variable, add those to the previous values, and repeat this for as many iterations as we want time periods in our simulation.16 At a chosen point in each simulation, we change the value of one independent variable. This change shows up first in the differenced value of that independent variable as the estimated short‐run effects of a change and then shows up in the lagged independent variable to produce long‐run effects, working through the estimated effects of the lagged independent variable and the adjustment parameters.         "
"13","To change our log‐ratio compositional predicted values back into the simulated proportions of the dependent variable, we use the following un‐transformation:            "
"14","One disadvantage to the types of dynamic simulations we propose is that they are somewhat conservative in terms of testing hypotheses about the marginal effects of an independent variable. This is the case because plots of confidence intervals for the predicted values of the dependent variable include total model error. As a result, any relationship that appears to be statistically significant in the resulting plots (when we see no overlap between a pair of confidence intervals) is statistically significant. But it is possible that a pair of confidence intervals that do barely overlap is still reflective of a statistically significant relationship.17 We thus recommend conventional statistical hypothesis testing to make precise p‐value type inferences about the effect of a particular independent variable on the trade‐off between two categories of the dependent variable. In addition, we recommend producing dynamic simulations in order to make assessments of statistical significance for the overall impact of changes in independent variables and for clearly communicating the main substantive implications of the complicated dynamic relationships from these models.         "
"15","To illustrate the utility of our modeling strategy, we provide two applied examples in which we are able to estimate changes in compositions over time. In each of these examples, we are able to test a richer set of theoretical propositions about trade‐offs across categories. The result is a substantial gain in terms of substantive inferences that extend beyond the comparison of a single trade‐off, as well as the ability to determine both short‐ and long‐term effects of changes in theoretically important independent variables."
"16","For a relatively simple applied example, we analyze monthly support for the three main parties in the United Kingdom during a six‐year period of Labour government from 2004 to 2010.18 While there is a substantial literature that examines the support for governing parties in the United Kingdom across time, we know of no other study that has modeled support across the three major political parties over time as trade‐off relationships. Instead, most studies implicitly lump the categories of vote intention into “government” and “opposition” by modeling support for the party of the prime minister over time (e.g., Clarke, Ho, and Stewart 2000; Clarke, Mishler, and Whiteley 1990; Sanders et al. 1987 ).19 While this is not an unreasonable modeling choice, it ignores important nuances in the competition between the government and the two major opposition parties.            "
"17","Beginning in the early 1980s, with the breakaway of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the Labour Party and the subsequent SDP‐Liberal Alliance, British politics became a three‐horse race. In order to accurately model individual‐level vote choice from survey data collected in the United Kingdom, most scholars have moved to multinomial logit or probit models (e.g., Alvarez, Nagler, and Bowler 2000; Whitten and Palmer 1996). These models estimate the marginal effect of changes in a particular independent variable on the trade‐off between pairs of categories of the dependent variable and are thus better representations of individual‐level choices between political parties. The modeling strategy that we propose makes an analogous move for the analysis of dynamic data on party support.            "
"18","From the broad set of theoretical models of party support in the United Kingdom, researchers have demonstrated that the valence model has the strongest explanatory power (e.g., Sanders et al. 2011) in analyses of both individual‐level cross‐sectional party support and over‐time aggregate‐level support for the party of the prime minister. According to the valence model, voters make use of straightforward heuristics to guide their decisions about which party to support. The key explanatory variables in these models are leader evaluations, partisanship, and evaluations of which party would be the best at handling the most important problem facing the nation. In a model of support for the prime minister versus all other options, the theoretical expectations from this model are straightforward—more positive evaluations of the prime minister and his or her party, as well as increases in partisan identifiers for the party of the prime minister are all expected to increase support. But in the real world, the dynamics of support for Labour are only part of the story. While both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives are competing with Labour, they are also competing with each other and there are clear differences between these two parties. In recent years, there has been some debate over whether the Liberal Democrats were to the left or right of Labour in terms of overall party ideology, but the Conservatives were clearly the major party on the right. The Conservatives are also the only other party to have provided prime ministers in the postwar era. We should thus expect most movements in our evaluative independent variables that are unfavorable to Labour to be translated disproportionately into gains for the Conservatives. Given the salience of the leaders of all three major political parties, we expect that the main driver of support for the Liberal Democrats will be evaluations of their leader. But it remains an open question as to whether more positive evaluations of the Liberal Democratic leader lead to bigger losses for the Conservatives or Labour.            "
"19","In Table 1, we present our theoretical expectations about the determinants of trade‐offs in support across the three main British political parties during the era from which our data were collected. Each row in Table 1 presents the expected relationships and the expected relative relationships for an increase in the relevant independent variable. For our first two independent variables, Labour and Conservative leader evaluations, our theoretical expectations are fairly straightforward. Holding all else constant, we expect that increases in the popularity of each party's leader will lead to increases in support for that party at the expense of each of the other parties. However, we expect that among these trade‐off relationships, those between Labour and the Conservatives will be the largest because these two parties are competing to be the largest single party in the nation and thus provide the prime minister. Holding all else constant, we also expect that increases in the popularity of the Liberal Democratic leader will lead to increases in support for that party at the expense of Labour and the Conservatives. There are, however, plausible rival theoretical expectations in terms of which of these trade‐off effects will be the largest. On the one hand, we might expect that an increase in the popularity of the Liberal Democratic leader would have a greater negative impact on Labour, since they are the closest party to the Liberal Democrats in terms of ideology. On the other hand, we might expect a greater impact on Conservative support because the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives are competing to be the largest party in the opposition.20"
"20","We have similar rival theoretical expectations for the impact of an increase in the percentage of UK citizens who are Labour Party identifiers. We expect that increases in national economic retrospective evaluations and the percentage of citizens identifying Labour as the party best on the most important issue will lead to gains in support for Labour at the expense of both of the major opposition parties, but that this will affect the Conservatives more because they are the other main contender for being the largest party. While the theoretical expectations presented in Table 1 are straightforward about the impact of key independent variables on party competition across time, note that standard models of support for the party of the prime minister could not test any of them.21"
"21","To test our theoretical expectations about what drives support across the three main British parties, we assembled monthly measures of all of the variables listed in Table 1. In Table 2, we present the estimates from a model with these independent variables.22 The first two columns of results display the estimated short‐run and long‐run effects of each independent variable on the logged ratio of support for the Conservatives to Labour, followed by the estimated effects for the logged ratio of support for the Liberal Democrats to Labour. Together, these four columns depict the results from a single estimation of the system of equations when we estimate our models with Labour as the baseline category. We estimated separately the results in the fifth and sixth columns with the logged ratio of support for the Liberal Democrats to Conservatives as the dependent variable from a specification in which support for the Conservatives was the baseline category of the dependent variable.23"
"22","As we can see from Table 2, the estimation of even a relatively parsimonious model yields a fairly extensive set of estimated nonlinear effects. From these results, we can make two general observations. First, when we compare the Conservative to Labour results with the Liberal Democrats to Labour results, it appears that these estimated relationships are, for many variables, quite different across equations. This indicates, first, that Labour losses (gains) do not evenly distribute across the two major opposition parties. Second, when we look at the Liberal Democrats to Conservative results, the main relationships that drive support between the opposition parties appear to be leadership evaluations. Neither of these observations would have been possible with standard time‐series models of support for the party of the prime minister.            "
"23","Because of the error correction model specification, each change in an independent variable has both short‐ and long‐run effects. The assessments of statistical significance for the estimated short‐run relationships involve straightforward tests on a single parameter estimate, but these assessments of the long‐run relationships are slightly more complicated tests given the multiple parameter estimates. From Table 2, we can see that the estimated effects are statistically significant at conventionally accepted levels in the expected directions for nine of the 12 short‐run and for eight of the 12 long‐run relationships. Together, these findings provide strong support for the expectations in the second, third, and fourth columns of Table 1. But any change in the value of an independent variable has multiple short‐ and long‐run effects on the relative shares of the categories of the dependent variable. For these reasons, we recommend the types of dynamic simulations, which we described earlier, for a more intuitive interpretation of our model results.            "
"24","In Figure 1, we depict the impact of a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of respondents who think Labour is the best manager of the most important issue during the ninth month of our simulated 20‐month period.24 As one would expect, this leads to an immediate increase in the support for Labour. More of this increase comes at the expense of support for the Conservatives, although there is also a slight decrease in support for the Liberal Democrats.25 In month 9, both the increase in support for Labour and the decrease for the Conservatives are statistically significant, but the decrease in support for the Liberal Democrats is not. In month 10, this short‐run increase in support for Labour is already decreasing, eventually converging on a level that is slightly, though not statistically significantly, higher than it was at the start of this scenario. Support for the Conservatives quickly rebounds and eventually rises above its value at the start of the scenario. Throughout the remainder of the scenario, support for the Liberal Democrats remains below its starting value, though this difference only is statistically significant in the long run.            "
"25","In Figure 2, we show a dynamic simulation of UK party support for a scenario in which there is a one standard deviation increase in the average evaluation of the Labour Party leader during the ninth month. This change has a dramatic impact on the political landscape in both the short and long run. First, we can see that the statistically significant gap between Labour and the Conservatives begins to close as support for Labour goes up and support for the Conservatives goes down. Over the long run, support for Labour rises to just under 40% and support for the Conservatives drops to just above 40%. Both are statistically significantly different from their starting levels of support. Support for the Liberal Democrats declines slightly and remains statistically significantly below its starting value for the remainder of the scenario. This dynamic simulation shows that gains for Labour come from both the Conservatives and as the Liberal Democrats.            "
"26","As expected in Figures 1 and 2, changes in public opinion that favor Labour translate into increases in support for the Labour Party. These inferences could have been obtained from conventional models of support for the party of the prime minister. In addition to these findings, we may also conclude that these increases in support for Labour come disproportionately at the expense of the Conservative Party. What about a rise in the evaluations of the Liberal Democratic leader? On the one hand, given the evidence that the Liberal Democrats are ideologically closer to Labour and possibly even to their left, we might expect their gains to come disproportionately from Labour. On the other hand, we might expect that any gains from such a rise would come disproportionately from the Conservatives, since they were the other major opposition party.            "
"27","In Figure 3, we present a dynamic simulation of UK party support for a scenario in which there is a one standard deviation increase in the average evaluation of the Liberal Democratic leader. As expected, the immediate impact of this change is an increase in support for the Liberal Democrats to around 25% and a decline in support for both Labour and the Conservatives. All of these effects are statistically significant. After an initial fall back toward its starting value, support for the Liberal Democrats plateaus at a level that is statistically significantly higher than it was before month 9. Interestingly, support for Labour quickly returns to its starting value, whereas support for the Conservatives levels off at a lower value that is statistically significantly from the beginning of the scenario. In summary, we find that an increase in evaluations of the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party has an initial short‐run impact on support for both of the other major parties, but ultimately it does the most damage to the electoral prospects of the other major opposition party, the Conservatives. None of these inferences about the dynamics of support for different opposition parties are possible from standard models of party support across time.            "
"28","Budgetary allocations provide a second example of commonly analyzed compositional variables. The use of budgetary data cross‐cuts subfields in political science, where it structures dependent variables at the national and subnational levels as well as within organizations. The bulk of scholarship in this area has had one or more of three theoretical foci: incrementalism, punctuated equilibrium, and/or the determinants of spending on specific policy areas."
"29","Incrementalism is prominent in the discussion of federal budgets. Made salient by Wildavsky (1964), this line of research argues that budgets tend to drift incrementally over time according to rational decision calculations. Policymakers look at budgets from the previous year and allow marginal shifts that are focused on specific program details as opposed to overall program resources and spending. These considerations allow budgets to grow (or at times, shrink) at a slow rate over time. The theory of punctuated equilibrium grew out of critiques that incrementalism failed to explain occasional occurrences of larger budgetary shifts (Jones, Baumgartner, and True 1998). Both approaches, however, tend to focus on changes in the absolute size of budgets and do not consider trade‐offs across budget categories.            "
"30","When researchers have studied the determinants of spending on specific policy areas, they have modeled spending on one policy area over time (e.g., Brown and Hunter 2004; Lipsmeyer 2011; Stasavage 2005) or spending on multiple single policy areas over time (e.g., Avelino, Brown, and Hunter 2005; Gerber and Hopkins 2011; Wlezien 2004). Researchers have used these models to test a broad range of theories about the forces that shape government budgets and policies, and implicit in most of these theories are ideas about trade‐offs across spending areas. This is particularly evident in theoretical discussions about defense spending that tend to focus on the famous guns versus butter trade‐off that asks whether there is a competition between defense expenditures and social spending (e.g., Whitten and Williams 2011). Despite ideas about trade‐offs across particular spending areas, most specifications model only one spending category at a time, effectively lumping spending on all other categories together.            "
"31","As an example of modeling the dynamic trade‐offs across more than two categories of spending, we analyzed annual data on budget authority from 1947 to 2009 in the United States.26 These budget records contain 20 government functions, each with multiple subfunctions.27 To simplify the categories for this example, we collapsed our dependent variable into five categories that sum to the total budget during each fiscal year: national defense, income security, social security, interest payments on the country's debt, and all other categories.28"
"32","We assembled a collection of independent variables that capture the different political, economic, demographic, and international forces that we theorized would shape trade‐offs across our five budget categories.29 To capture ideas about basic political representational relationships, we use a combination of dummy variables indicating partisan control of the presidency and the legislature, as well as the general policy mood measure developed by Stimson (1991). To measure the influence of economics and demographics, we include indicators of population and economic shifts. Finally, to measure the influence of international hostilities, we use a composite score of annual conflict involvement.30 Table 3 presents a summary of our theoretical expectations for the effect of an increase in each independent variable on the trade‐offs across budget categories.31"
"33","To test the theoretical claims summarized in Table 3, we followed the estimation procedure outlined above with four categories relative to a single baseline category.32 In Figure 4, we hold all of our continuous independent variables constant at their mean values (and the two political dummy variables at zero) and simulate the effect of a one standard deviation decrease in unemployment during the 10th year. This decline in unemployment leads to some substantial changes. The most dramatic shifts from this change are an immediate decline in relative spending on welfare and a gradual increase in relative spending on interest payments. The former is statistically significant in both the short and long run, whereas the latter takes two years to become statistically significantly different from its pre‐change value. In the short run, relative spending on defense and social security both increase, but these differences are not statistically significant. Spending on defense quickly goes back to its pre‐change trajectory, and spending on social security continues to rise over time. Note that post‐change spending on social security is significantly above pre‐change spending.            "
"34","In Figure 5, we display the simulated effects of a one standard deviation decrease in policy mood liberalism. This shift in policy mood leads to significant or borderline‐significant changes in almost every spending category.33 As expected, we see slight decreases in relative spending on welfare and “other” categories, with increases in relative spending on social security and interest payment. The biggest surprise in this scenario is the relative drop in spending on defense. Most budgeting models expect that all else equal, conservatives favor increased spending on defense. One exception to this is a recent argument (Whitten and Williams 2011) about the economic stimulus components of defense spending that the left tend to favor.            "
"35","We see evidence mildly supporting a guns versus butter trade‐off in Figure 6, where we simulate the effect of a one standard deviation increase in militarized interstate disputes. In this figure, the increase in the nation's involvement in international hostilities leads to a slight, though not statistically significant, relative increase in military spending. This leads to a decline in relative spending on welfare that does eventually become statistically significant.            "
"36","This example demonstrates how our modeling strategy meshes well with how we theorize about political budgeting. The utility of dynamic simulations such as Figures 4–6 is that we are able to view succinctly the evolution of the dynamics resulting from a change in an independent variable across all categories of the dependent variable. While observers of congressional budgeting describe a complicated process that involves trade‐offs across multiple dimensions, our modeling strategy allows us to build and test theoretical models that more closely reflect these political processes.            "
"37","Across a broad range of subfields, researchers theorize about political trade‐offs and what shapes them over time. By proposing an empirical strategy for testing theories about trade‐off relationships that shape compositional variables, we offer an opportunity to bridge the gap between these rich theories and the testing of the hypotheses that scholars derive from them. We have detailed the steps for estimating, presenting, and interpreting models of dynamic compositional variables and provided two examples from prominent political science literatures. In both cases, we have demonstrated that our technique produces a richer set of inferences than the current approach of modeling one category of a compositional dependent variable against all others as it moves over time."
"38","In the context of party support, we have been able to specify and test a broad set of theories about the competitive dynamics across multiple political parties. We found evidence that some variables shape the contest between the two largest political parties, whereas others affect the competition between opposition parties. In the context of political budgeting, we are able to model a complex set of trade‐offs that extend current theories. For instance, while previous researchers have theorized about a relationship between defense and welfare spending, most studies of this trade‐off over time have relied on models of defense spending versus spending in all other areas. Using our approach, researchers can model directly which variables drive policy trade‐offs across multiple spending categories."
"39","In future work, there are a number of important ways in which we will extend this approach to push models toward richer empirical inferences. As mentioned briefly above, we want to be able to enable our models to include cases for which one category of the dependent variable equals zero. We are also interested in exploring the set of issues that arise when we extend these models from time series for single spatial units to a pooled time‐series context. Throughout this article, we have likened the development of these models to moving from discrete choice binomial to more complicated multinomial logit models. We can see further interesting research possibilities that would result if we extended our models to include measures of changing characteristics of the categories of our compositions. This would be analogous to the extensions of inferences that resulted when researchers moved from multinomial logit models to mixed logit models (Glasgow 2001). The possibilities with this empirical strategy are numerous.         "
"40","While we have demonstrated the utility of our approach using two prominent applied examples, there are many additional areas in which this approach should improve our understanding of important political phenomena. These include studies of taxation policy, campaign emphasis, and media attention to particular issues. We argue that once researchers start looking for dynamic compositional variables, they will find them everywhere."
