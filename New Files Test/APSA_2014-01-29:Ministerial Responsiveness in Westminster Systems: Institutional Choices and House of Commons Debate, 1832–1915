"1","The history of the Westminster legislature is a long one (Maddicott 2010; Namier and Brooke 1964; Thorne 1986; von Gneist 1889), and scholars have paid special attention to the period between the First and Fourth Reform Acts (Cunningham 2001), during which the modern age of “democratic” politics in Britain came to be. Within this era, the most prominent focus has been on franchise extension and its effects (Acemoglu and Robinson 2000; Berlinski and Dewan 2011; Cowling 1967; Gash 1952; Lizzeri and Persico 2004), but our focus here is on endogenous institutional development. The seminal account in the latter literature is that of Cox (1987; though see also earlier efforts from Redlich 1908 and Fraser 1960), who contends that in the initial part of the Victorian period, the cabinet systematically removed backbench MP rights to delay government legislative activities or initiate their own business. Several authors note that, as early prerogatives disappeared, MPs found a new avenue for their energies: putting questions to ministers (Chester and Bowring 1962; Cox 1987; Hibbing 1988; Howarth 1956). Though less painful to the government than direct disruption of its business, such interrogative activities were not above reform.4 Some of these changes came via Speaker rulings, an example being the general ability to “close” debate after 1882 in response to Irish obstructionism (Rutherford 1914). Other changes, including the requirement to give notice of questions, arose from the Commons acting as a corporate body via its standing orders. The importance of these actions notwithstanding, it is the Balfour “railway timetable” reforms of 1902 that arguably created parliament's present arrangement. Introducing two sittings on the four working days of the week, Balfour cut down the time for questions to 40 minutes (previously, it was essentially unbounded) and moved (opposed) private business to the end of the session on any given day. The nature of questions themselves was also altered: MPs were limited to one supplemental question (formally, they could have as many as the Speaker believed were “in order”), and for oral answers, MPs were now required to give more notice than previously.         "
"2","It is not difficult to see why the cabinet would want to curtail the power of backbench MPs to raise their own business: it helped ensure that government business would always be reached. Exactly why other MPs agreed to these various losses in their prerogative and power is more puzzling. Yet agree they did; Chester and Bowring (1962, 67) note that the debate surrounding the proposed changes “was on the whole favorable to the Government” and that “most were convinced that something required [sic] to be done.” In the event, the relevant standing order (spread over multiple roll calls) saw “the Government having a comfortable majority of around 80 in each,” and, to the extent that there was criticism, it was over specifics connected with the timing of questions in the day, notice requirements, and whether all questions would receive an oral answer (Chester and Bowring 1962, 75). So, all things considered, the majority of Balfour's “original structure remained. Only in respect of Questions had he to make any major concessions”: in particular, the government failed to extinguish the uses of supplementaries in toto, and questions were to remain in a prominent place, prior to public business being reached (Chester and Bowring 1962, 84).5 Still, there is little doubt that the “railway timetable” represented restrictions on previous agenda power for the opposition, but that the opposition did not make a concerted, united attempt to defeat the proposals; only when it came to the opposition's inquisitorial powers was there a notable and successful effort to maintain the opposition's privileges.            "
"3","Cox (1987) makes a much cited and accepted argument to explain such acquiesence. In particular, he argues that the cabinet was uniquely ready to accumulate responsibility, cheered on by the most experienced members of the House, whereas backbenchers lacked any formal institutional protection of their rights. This makes much sense for the period prior to the 1880s, but once party‐discipline and government‐opposition voting became the norm, it is less plausible: put crudely, the opposition was sufficiently cohesive and disciplined to at least make trouble for the government's proposed reforms (even if informally—e.g., the Arlington Street Compact), yet seemingly did no such thing.            "
"4","One possibility is that the opposition found little to fear—and perhaps something to gain—in the proposals brought forward by Balfour. They, like all non‐cabinet MPs, would lose the ability to introduce (private) business. But by curtailing the possibility for dilatory debate and private business and by outlining a predictable schedule for questions and other forms of government scrutiny, the new proposals also tended to make it more certain that the opposition would have the opportunity to hold the government to account. Our contention is that what was given up in these centralizing reforms was less valuable to the opposition than what was gained—predictable opportunities to scrutinize the government."
"5","We think of opposition MPs as being broadly motivated by electoral concerns—both the desire to be reelected, at an individual level, and the desire to see the party win more seats and enter into government—and we think of different legislative activities as having different electoral benefits for MPs. Consider two distinct ways in which a given chunk of legislative time can be spent: first, a series of debates on issues raised by various MPs; second, a series of confrontations between government ministers and opposition MPs. Both types of activities give opposition MPs the opportunity to speak, which could win them electoral support if voters are impressed with their performance and care about their personal qualities. But devoting legislative time to confrontations between the government and opposition gives voters more information about whether the opposition is better suited to replace the government and lead the country. Clashing with the government could win opposition MPs electoral support if voters are impressed with their performance and care about the quality of the party in government. How the opposition prefers to spend legislative time thus depends on how well its MPs can perform, but also on what voters care about."
"6","The increasing party orientation of the electorate through the middle of the nineteenth century (Cox 1987) would have affected the relative electoral value of these different legislative activities: clashes between the government and opposition became more electorally consequential, and debates among MPs on the issues of the day less so, as voters increasingly ignored candidates' qualities and voted based on their perception of which party deserved to be in government. Our claim is that opposition acquiescence to the procedural reforms of the late nineteenth century is less puzzling once it is recognized that, given these well‐documented changes in the electorate, opposition MPs by this time found it more valuable to showcase their party's fitness to govern than to showcase their own fitness as parliamentarians and representatives. Put differently, as voters became less sensitive to MPs' personal qualities, opposition MPs would have recognized that it was more electorally valuable to spend legislative time searching for opportunities to embarrass the government than burnishing their own individual reputations. The opposition thus accepted (even embraced) procedural changes that sacrificed de jure “rights” that were “de facto” unhelpful in exchange for increased opportunities to publicly scrutinize the government.            "
"7","We suggest therefore that the centralization of government powers that took place in the late nineteenth century can be viewed as an institutional quid pro quo in which the government strengthened its grip on procedural control in exchange for giving the opposition more extensive and predictable opportunities to confront ministers. The opposition accepted that exchange because, given the priorities of the electorate, it had become more valuable to shore up their inquisitorial powers than to cling to other procedural powers that no longer offered substantial electoral benefits."
"8","The contours of our argument are consistent with statements made by Sir Henry Campbell‐Bannerman, then leader of the opposition, in his speech (HC Deb, February 6, 1902, vol. 102, col. 548–650) occuring at the introduction of Balfour's plans. Campbell‐Bannerman notes that introducing bills “is not now so important a function of the private Member as it was some twenty or thirty or forty years ago” and that the rise of the press has “taken away the necessity that then existed for an ample opportunity to private Members to introduce Motions for merely educative purposes.” He concedes openly that “the private Members have less and less chances of effective legislation; and the power to legislate falls more and more into the hands of the Government.” So, what was left and deserving of protection and extension was “the general right of the House to interrogate Ministers and discuss questions, and to inform the opinion of the country by so doing.” Campbell‐Bannerman thus recognizes that the opposition should focus on scrutinizing the government with an eye toward the next election rather than trying to wield its limited procedural powers to alter the course of legislation.            "
"9","Finally, he is quite explicit that motions that make the legislative process more efficient are reasonable, so long as they do not infringe on this opposition ability to hold the government to account:"
"10","               "
"11","We must take care that we do not, wittingly or unwittingly, exalt the power of the Executive and diminish the control of the House at large. Facilitate the progress of business as much as you like; make it as reasonable and as easy as you like; but do not do anything which will have the effect of placing the House of Commons more and more at the mercy of the Government of the day."
"12","Subject to assurances on the “the power of putting Questions and the power of moving the adjournment of the House,” Campbell‐Bannerman was certainly willing to listen to Balfour's proposals; he ends his speech with the claim that he has “not wished to speak with any acrimony or disparagement of the proposals of the Government, which do them credit, and above all the speech of the right hon. Gentleman who introduced them.” In this sense, there was sympathy and qualified support from the opposition, which we see as acquiescence to a new era of politics."
"13","Not every member of the opposition was as sanguine in the face of the reforms as Campbell‐Bannerman. Yet the words and identities of those disagreeing with Balfour are informative of themselves. For example, John Redmond (HC Deb, February 6, 1902, vol. 102, col. 585–95), leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, agreed with the notion of a “creeping paralysis” and claimed that he had “no objection whatever to rules calculated to facilitate the passage of good measures through this House.” His concerns were rather that the rules would not have their intended effects: that the government had set itself “an impossible task” since business would continue to expand while resources would be limited. Henry Labouchere (HC Deb, February 6, 1902, vol. 102, col. 601–607), radical MP for Northampton, was similarly unimpressed with details of Balfour's proposals, though he would “admit that some of them are very good” and that “something must be done to alter these old‐fashioned rules.” Intriguingly, Labouchere's principal concern was that question answering by ministers would now be “piecemeal,” rather than as part of a general (adjournment) debate at the end of the day.            "
"14","Our reading of the debates surrounding Balfour's proposals is that members of the opposition did not much object to the logic of reforms that would address contemporary “parliamentary anarchy” (James Lowther, MP for Thanet [HC Deb, February 6, 1902, vol. 102, col. 633–36]), nor did they make much noise about the eclipse of the individual rights of backbench MPs. What mattered to Balfour's critics was that the reforms protected the opposition's ability to hold the government to account: they would accept rationalization of procedure and centralization of power as long as the opposition's inquisitorial powers were maintained (and prioritized).            "
"15","Though Campbell‐Bannerman's words are in line with our claims, demonstrating the precise motivations of actors in making historical institutional choices is a difficult task. What we can undertake is a study of the effects of institutional change on the agents in question, and use this as a rough check of our theoretical priors. Again, we make no claims that this is a “test” of a theory, but we do believe such efforts are illuminating. If, in fact, the opposition acquiesced to reforms that centralized government power in the late nineteenth century in part because these reforms were accompanied by increases in the opposition's opportunities to question ministers, and more generally to draw them into adversarial debate, we have an obvious empirical prediction. In particular, we should be able to show that during this period, government ministers became more accountable or “responsive” to opposition MPs— not temporarily due to special circumstances like the rise of obstructionist practices by the Irish nationalists (see, e.g., Dion 1997, 200–214) or the Fourth Party (see, e.g., Ramsden 1999, 138–44), but rather in a persistent way.            "
"16","Since the goal is to examine the spoken interaction between executive and legislature, and to chart the “to and fro” of Commons discussion, we need speeches of members. Our speeches are organized in “debates” that are available through the Hansard archive.6 Note that a “debate” is a generic term for a sequence of utterances pertaining to the same subject at a particular time as demarcated by parliamentary recorders (and given a particular “tag” or label when marked up for external consumption) and includes open discussion, questions and answers, or other statements. Importantly, what is classified as a “debate” is entirely exogenous to our particular study and in a way that appears consistent over time. These data are the product of a large digitization of hard copy volumes of the parliamentary record, undertaken by the Information Services division of the House of Commons. The current article makes use of the third, fourth, and fifth series of parliamentary debates, which begin in October 1830 and run to March 1981, though here we focus on the period after the Great Reform Act of 1832 until the second year of the Great War. The actual speech data were downloaded as XML files, then parsed and transformed into a relational database using Ruby on Rails.7"
"17","In principle, each speech in the XML files is associated with a uniquely identified member of parliament. In practice, life was more difficult, since many speaker names in the XML files are ambiguous. We spent much effort disambiguating where possible, and by the end of our process had (uniquely) identified some 93% of speakers. We subsequently assigned party affiliation to the MPs and added information on their roles as cabinet ministers, including dates of service. Note that the data on speeches are organized within debates, within a given ministry—that is, by government—of which a given prime minister might have several while in office. In terms of designating “government” or “opposition” status, we designated any party that supported a government in roll‐call terms as being “in government,” whether or not they were formally in coalition and thus had cabinet representatives. In Supp Info B in the online appendix, we give complete details of our data collection process, and in Supp Info C, we give the full list of the ministries in our database.         "
"18","Our forgoing claim is that ministers became disproportionately more “responsive” to opposition MPs in the period of procedural change after 1880, and that this may explain why the opposition acquiesced to such reform. One possibility for measurement of such a concept, and that used by previous scholars (e.g., Cox 1987; Hibbing 1988), is to look at aggregate metrics like the number of questions in a given session. While no means unreasonable as a method for assessing the amount of business in the House, it is not ideal for our purposes, for at least three reasons. First, the aggregate number of questions does not tell us who asked questions or who answered them and is thus uninformative about the responsiveness of government to opposition. Second, the number of recorded questions need not be the same as the number of questions actually asked on the floor: first, some questions (for various reasons, including the fact that the asker was not in the chamber in a given day; Chester and Bowring 1962) were scheduled on the order paper but either not asked or not answered. More importantly, the order papers do not record the number of supplementals—that is, follow‐ups—asked by MPs of ministers. In earlier times—pre‐1902 reforms—there could be more than one of these, asked by different MPs. We presumably want to take account of these communications if we can. Third, we are interested in interaction most generally, and this extends beyond questions. That is, we want to also include the interplay between cabinet members and MPs in debates not specifically set aside as question periods.         "
"19","Our central behaviorial assumption is that when member A speaks directly after member B, A is responding to B.8 Below, we demonstrate the validity of this convention, but first we formalize the statistical model that this implies. We see each debate, however long, as a sequence of speakers. There is no requirement that any particular utterance be a substantive statement, and thus questions to cabinet members would fit within our framework. To simplify matters, outside of their ministerial, backbencher, or opposition role, we will not be directly interested in who makes the speeches—that is, we will drop any subscripts connoting specific individuals, such as Benjamin Disraeli with all his attendant features. What we will note in every case is the speaker's status as a government minister (each such speaker is denoted ), a government backbencher (), or an opposition member (O). This classification is mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive.9 Figure 1 illustrates our understanding of a (short) debate for modeling purposes.10 Note that the Os may be the same opposition member, or they may not: we make no distinction, mutatis mutandis for the minsters and government backbenchers.         "
"20","How then to model these debates? A simple way to proceed is to suppose that a debate sequence—as Figure 1—is a stochastic process, in which the random variables of interest are the roles of the speakers: , , or O. A further assumption we make is that the particular process in question exhibits the Markov property. That is, the current state, the realization of , , or O in the sequence, depends probabilistically only on the directly preceding state. Otherwise put, once the current speaker's identity (in terms of his or her role) is known, the next speaker's identity is independent of the identity of all speakers occurring before this one. We treat each speech by a new speaker—no matter its actual length—as a step in a discrete chain, and in our running example of an eight‐person debate, we have , where  is the tth speaker in the sequence.11 Furthermore, we commit to a time‐homogeneous (i.e., stationary) process in the sense that we assume that the probability of a debate moving from any particular role to another in the next stage (including to the same role) does not depend on the number of speakers who have contributed thus far.         "
"21","As usual with Markov chains, the probability of moving from state to state (here, role to role) is controlled by a transition matrix, P with typical entry . The goal is to estimate the entries of P, which for our application is            "
"22","The cells enclosed in boxes are those where most of our substantive interest will focus: the probability of a transition from opposition member to minister () and from government backbencher to minister ()         "
"23","There are several ways to estimate the entries of P. Anderson and Goodman (1957) give a maximum likelihood approach, which is consistent, though biased. Such a simple approach is unsatisfying, in part because it does not allow a data‐generating process that changes over time. In particular, we want to allow for debate‐specific variation, arising from different topics of discussion (or different formats, e.g., questions versus open debate), and ministry‐specific variation arising from different personnel who hold office during particular periods. Notice here that observations are nested: speeches occur within debates that occur wholly within ministries. This suggests that a hierarchical model (in the sense of, e.g., Gelman and Hill 2006) is called for, with random effects for levels such that we can relax the rather strong assumption of exchangeability of observations (see also Western 1998 for discussion).         "
"24","The specific techniques we use is a random slopes multinomial logit model with unconstrained covariance matrices for the relevant (i.e., ministry and debate) random effects.12 The fundamental logic of such an approach is easy to grasp: let the current state of the debate be  and suppose that we have the single predictor , which is simply the (identity of the) previous speaker. We use the first speech in a debate as the first value of the covariate x1; the identity of the second speaker becomes y1. Subsequently, this second speaker becomes x2, and the third speaker is y2; y2 becomes x3 and so on.13 We make this setup more obvious with Figure 2, where we show the way that a single debate (denoted d in the top row) would be rewritten in terms of x and y vectors.         "
"25","We obtain the entries of P via the predicted probabilities from the model: thus,  is the probability that we observe  given that ;  is the probability that we observe  given that , and so on. In the standard generalized linear setup (in the sense of McCullagh and Nelder 1989), these probabilities are straightforward to compute. Here, life is slightly more complicated by the random effects, which necessitate the use of a generalized linear mixed model. To fit this model, we take a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach and use Hadfield's (2010)MCMCglmm software package.14 Such an MCMC approach allows us to estimate the random effects directly, and from there obtain the auxiliary parameters—the predicted probabilities—we care about. All told, we can thus report estimated transition probabilities while allowing for both debate and ministry effects. In Supp Info E and Supp Info F in the online appendix, we give more precise details of our model and the fitting process. As a practical matter, we model only debates that are constituted of at least 10 speeches, which is a little over the mean number of speeches per debate for our data. We impose a lower bound in part to ensure that we are not attempting to model announcements of policy (such that there may be just one or two speeches) or debates where (for some reason) large portions are missing from the historical record. This leaves us with 18,032 debates (534,627 speeches) over the period under study.         "
"26","Our assumption is that when ministers speak after another member, they are in some sense “responding” to the previous speaker. We validated this claim in three ways. First, assuming that those who ask questions or make points generally receive (ministerial) answers, an implication of our position is that ministers ought, disproportionately, to be the last speaker in a debate. That is, if a debate consists solely of “question” followed by “answer,” it should be the MP answering—that is, the minister—who speaks last. The null hypothesis against which to test this assertion is that the last speaker is simply a random draw from the appropriate (multinomial) distribution, with characteristic probabilities given by the relevant proportions of the speaker type in the data. For example, if 14% of speeches are given by ministers in the data as a whole, but 30% of last speeches, we might suspect that ministers are indeed “responding.”"
"27","In Table 1, we present the relevant figures: the top row reports the proportion of speeches given in the data as a whole, and in the bottom row are last speeches. We conducted a χ2 test with the alternative hypothesis that at least one of the role proportions was not equal across the two scenarios, and we can reject the null on this basis (p < .01). We then combined the non‐ministerial categories into one and reran the test under the new null that this implied; once again, ministers were disproportionately more likely to be last speakers (p < .01). This is consistent with our claims that ministers “respond” to others when they speak.            "
"28","Second, we can look at speech “triples”: that is, speech sequences (within debates) consisting of three speeches. Dividing MPs into ministers or non‐ministers, we have a total of 23 = 8 possibilities: {minister, non‐minister, minister}, {non‐minister, minister, non‐minister}, and so on. Table 2 gives the relevant sums across the entire data series. Notice that {non‐minister, minister, non‐minister} is more than twice as common as {minister, non‐minister, non‐minister} and {non‐minister, non‐minister, minister}. If we consider the former to be our prototypical notion of a minister engaging with the Commons—that is, speaking between two non‐cabinet ministers, we have yet more evidence that our claims that ministers do indeed “respond” to others are correct.            "
"29","In Figure 3, we consider the time series (by ministry) of the “one‐minister” triples (rows 4, 5, and 7 in Table 2). In particular, we look at the share of these triples that {non‐minister, minister, non‐minister} contributes. As can be seen, this suddenly increases around the 1880s (around the time of Gladstone's third ministry). A natural thought is that as the state did more in the nineteenth century (see Cox 1987), ministers would be compelled to say more in the Commons, though they need not be in any kind of response dynamic. But if that were true, we would expect all the triples involving a minister to increase over time, and thus for the line to be flat across the entire period: clearly, it is not, and we have prima facie evidence that something else is going on.            "
"30","Third, we turned to two (independent) human coders and asked them to read debate sequences (around 500 in total) and comment on whether ministers were responding when they spoke after an MP. We give more details in Supp Info D in the online appendix, but the essential fact is this: reading a sample of speeches in which a minister spoke after a non‐minister, our research assistants (who had no prior knowledge of our measurement assumptions) consistently viewed the minister's speech as a response to the preceding speech; this proportion was consistent throughout the period we examine."
"31","To recap, we have estimates for the relevant entries to the transition matrix: these are in the form of (posterior) predicted probabilities for every ministry, for every debate. For any given ministry, we have a distribution of these probabilities, which can we efficiently summarize as a boxplot. For the transition of , that is, from an opposition member to a minister, Figure 4 presents our results. Each light [blue] box is a Tory ministry; each dark [yellow] box is a Liberal ministry. The solid vertical line to the right of the plot marks the (approximate) date of the 1902 “railway timetable” reforms. The solid line moving left to right is a lowess for the mean probability for the ministries in the data. On the same scale, Figure 5 does the same for the government backbenchers. There are several immediate observations: first, it seems that ministers are more likely to find themselves responding to the opposition than to their own (government backbenchers). This can be seen from the relative height of the mean (or median) lines, or from the fact that, in general, the high tails of the distribution of predicted probabilities in Figure 4 are more populated than for the same region in Figure 5. In terms of means, the probability of a minister responding to an opposition member (i.e., the probability that a minister speaks, conditioned on an opposition member speaking immediately prior) is 0.23 for the period under study, whereas for backbenchers it is 0.12. We can, of course, do formal tests: a t‐test (p<.01), Wilcoxon signed rank test (p<.01), and Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test (p<.01) all suggest that (on average) the probability of a minister responding to an opposition member is larger than the equivalent conditional probability for government backbenchers. We make use of these tests for all of our comparisons in what follows.         "
"32","A more subtle question concerns notions of the relative change in these differences. We first need to establish the nature of the time series in question. Recall that our claim is that as parties became party orientated, oppositions began to act as governments‐in‐waiting and probe cabinet ministers in the Commons. We would thus expect that any shifts in the relevant transition probabilities would not occur before the key reform acts that broadened the franchise in the middle of the nineteenth century (i.e., the Second Reform Act of 1868, and the Third Reform and associated Redistribution Acts of 1884–85). To check for shifts, we consider change points in the data. First, we examine the series on a ministry‐by‐ministry basis using the (multiple) structural break approach described in Bai and Perron (2003) and implemented by Zeileis et al. (2002), with standard defaults. Table 3 reports the results for both the time series—that is, ministers responding to both opposition and government backbench members—and in both cases, the best‐fitting model (by Bayesian information criterion) suggests one break. These occur in Gladstone's third ministry for the opposition time series and in Salisbury's second ministry for the backbenchers, occurring around the period 1886–89 (the median dates of those ministries).15 We can also report the mean probabilities on either side of the break(s): for opposition responsiveness, the probability increases from 0.15 to 0.31 (p < .01). For the backbenchers, the probability increases from 0.08 to 0.17 (p < .01). We can also see that, indeed, the (one) change when it came was between 1880 and the First World War: specifically, around 1885 in both cases. These changes do not appear to be a limited term effect associated specifically with either Irish nationalists or the Fourth Party: that is, the increase in response rates continue into the twentieth century, long after these groups had ceased their obstructionism. Finally, the (absolute) increase in responsiveness for opposition members is around 0.16, larger than the increase for backbenchers, at 0.09. Assuming normality, we compared the difference between the opposition and government backbencher time series with a t‐test (using the Gladstone ministry as the break): the difference in differences is significant (p < .01).16"
"33","To check the robustness of this timing result, we also ran mean segmentation (change point) tests on all the data, disaggregated out across time (so not grouped by ministry)—in the sense of Barry and Hartigan (1993)—and our findings are essentially unchanged: the change points are in the 1890s, and the change in ministerial responsiveness to the opposition is larger than for the government backbenchers.17 Although our break point findings are broadly consistent with our priors above, we note that 1902 is not estimated as the precise location with either technique. At least one reason for this is that the process of responsiveness is a noisy one, and it is, of course, conceivable that several other (more minor) factors are involved in driving the patterns we see—the next section considers some alternative explanations. More generally, the key result we take from this analysis is that whatever the consequence of the rationalizing reforms of 1902, it was certainly not a decrease in responsiveness. That is, even if it did not produce change itself, we can claim that the “railway timetable” was at the very least part of a codification of a new incentive structure for government and opposition.         "
"34","Above, we explained the opposition's acquiescence to centralizing reforms by showing a contemporaneous increase in government responsiveness to the opposition. There are, of course, other possibilities. One is that the opposition acceded because it would be pointless to attempt to defeat the government. A second is that the opposition knew it would benefit from the new agenda‐setting powers when it eventually won power. Although it is difficult to rule out either possibility, both stories raise a new puzzle: if it was not attempting ‘buy off’ of the opposition, why would the government become more responsive to the opposition than to its own backbenchers, and why specifically during the last two decades of the nineteenth century?         "
"35","One possible solution to this puzzle comes from noting that the government, along with the opposition, might wish to expose itself to more scrutiny during this period. To see this, recall that as per Cox's (1987) account, we contend that voters increasingly cast their ballots by considering MPs as parties of governing teams, rather than as individual legislatures. Learning about the quality of such a team in part comes from observing (e.g., via newspaper reports) the relative performance of the parties in government versus opposition clashes, but also by observing the extent to which governments made themselves available for such battles. The logic here is one of costly signaling (in the sense of Spence 1973) to a (by then) sufficiently party‐orientated electorate: low‐quality governments would hide from opposition probing in the Commons.18 Whether or not one views government responsiveness as a concession to the opposition, this could explain why governments would be willing to extend scrutiny rights.         "
"36","An alternative explanation focuses on the divergence between the interests of the opposition front bench (emerging as a distinct entity in the middle of our period; Turner 1969) and opposition backbenchers. Ultimately, it was those in the shadow cabinet who stood to play the most prominent role in any government scrutiny, and these same MPs would benefit most from centralized power once in government. Meanwhile, their backbench colleagues relied more heavily on the rights being surrendered (for personal status, or to accrue rents). But even if we see the reforms as the triumph of the front bench over the backbenchers, the basic mechanism is similar: backbenchers gave up prerogatives that did little to garner them reelection among party‐orientated voters, and they perceived that their futures depended on the ability of the shadow cabinet to prove their party's worth as a possible government. A different take on the front bench–backbench struggle is provided by extending Cox's (1987) “tragedy of the commons” logic: in particular, that the latter part of the nineteenth century was a chaotic period of fractious (especially Irish) obstructionism in which the cabinet and (mainstream) opposition recognized that government consolidation of power was a Pareto improvement for everyone other than the “permanent minority” (in Redmond's words). In this story, the opposition front bench seeks assurances that it will still be able to appeal to voters via scrutiny, while simultaneously gutting the ability of others to hold up this and other business.         "
"37","We provided a parsimonious quid pro quo account to explain an increase in government responsiveness that coincided with a consolidation of government procedural control. Other explanations are possible, and ultimately observationally equivalent given current data. Nonetheless, we wish to emphasize that all the alternative explanations have a single similar thread: the shift in the electorate toward party‐line voting and away from personalistic competition."
"38","The rights of minorities are a core concern of those interested in the organization of democracy (de Tocqueville 2004; Madison 2009; Mill 2006). This extends to electoral system choice and the way that legislatures are structured (Lijphart 1999; Powell 2000). Generally speaking, though majorities have much to gain from reduced minority rights, minorities themselves would prefer not to lose their prerogatives (Binder 1996; Dion 1997; Schickler 2000). In this article, we took this logic to the puzzle of the Westminster system. In particular, we asked under what circumstance would minorities (for us, oppositions) accede to reforms in which their rights are curtailed. Our argument was that, by the late nineteenth century, opposition MPs benefited little from de jure rights to initiate or amend legislation; this is because of well‐recognized changes in British politics over the previous several decades that made cabinets strong, parties cohesive, and voters party‐oriented (Cox 1987). Instead, oppositions focused on holding the executive to account: that is, they prioritized the garnering of regular and unfettered access to ministers. They sought to question them, to debate them, and generally to present themselves as a government‐in‐waiting to voters who cared above all about which party would better lead the country. We have shown via a historically important case that oppositions can act in rational ways when bargaining over future procedural rights, especially as electoral incentives change—an observation that should be of interest even to scholars not directly concerned with Westminster systems.         "
"39","We showed that ministerial responsiveness rose quickly between the 1880s and Balfour's “railway timetable” reforms at the turn of the twentieth century and remained high thereafter. While government backbenchers certainly found their inquiries more likely to be answered too, the biggest (absolute) increase is reserved for opposition members. That is, while their rights to contribute to legislation directly were reduced, their rights to be adversarial in the chamber were enhanced. We showed this using a (novel) Markov chain model of debate, and we estimated its parameters using Bayesian techniques relatively well known to political scientists. To undertake our project, we gathered a massive new data set—with information on approximately 7,000 MPs, a half million speeches, ministerial records, and more—that we plan to put in the public domain."
"40","We used a new metric of responsiveness that relies on sequences of speeches between members of different types, and we were able to validate our approach in several ways. In this sense, then, we have contributed to the political scientist's tool kit a new method for modeling debate. Scholars may be interested in applying this logic to legislatures with different institutional structures to see how, and why, rates of responsiveness differ from the Commons. There is also data for the post–Great War period in Britain that we do not utilize: it might be interesting to see how debate has developed into the modern era as the Labour party has replaced the Liberals, and as the evolution toward party‐centered elections has continued."
"41","As we noted throughout the article, precisely “testing” our theory of change is difficult: here, we simply have aggregate evidence broadly consistent with our claims. One possibility is to obtain a more precise measure of government agenda control: this way, we could statistically condition on the relative weakness of the opposition at any given time, and better understand the timing of changes to their rights. Finding such a measure is nontrivial, though the changing contents of the speeches over time might be a place to begin looking. Approaches using topic models (Quinn et al. 2010) might address such a concern: we would expect more subtle inferences about how and for what ministers were held accountable. This might help us understand the nature of policy competence, or perceived responsibilities over time and thus give us a sense of the way that the British state developed. We leave such efforts for future work.         "
