"1","Greene, Palmquist, and Schickler (2002) suggest that partisan identification is a form of social identity. According to Social Identity Theory (SIT) (e.g.,  Brewer 2007; Huddy 2001), individuals classify themselves and others whom they perceive as similar as belonging to an “in‐group” and classify those whom they perceive as different as belonging to an “out‐group.” People evince positive attitudes toward members of their group and negative biases against members of out‐groups. When individuals perceive group membership as important, they are more likely to agree with the prevailing opinion within their group—a form of in‐group bias—and disagree with opinions of members of the other group—a form of out‐group bias.         "
"2","If partisanship operates in new democracies just as it does in the United States, then we have good reason to expect in‐group party cues to increase support for policy issues among partisans. For example, someone who identifies with Party A shown a cue from Party A will be more likely to agree with that party's position than a partisan of Party A not shown that cue."
"3","Out‐group biases can also provide a basis for partisanship. Out‐group bias may promote partisanship if someone who identifies with Party A shown a cue from Party B grows more likely to agree with Party A's position than a supporter of Party A not shown a cue from Party B. Both in‐group and out‐group biases are rooted in universal human desires to delineate and maintain group‐ membership boundaries: individuals have incentives to accentuate intergroup differences by highlighting both in‐group similarities and out‐group differences (Brewer 1991; Hogg 2005).         "
"4","Some suggest that in‐group biases are relatively more important than out‐group biases (e.g.,  Brewer 2007; Zaller 1992). Because social groups serve as a key source of personal values (Conover and Feldman 1984), individuals assume that other members of their group share their goals and interpret the world similarly, at least with respect to issues that are important to their group's identity. In‐group biases can powerfully shape individual attitudes when group membership reinforces a positive social identity (Brewer 1991).         "
"5","However, Goren, Federico, and Kittilson (2009) and Nicholson (2012) suggest that out‐group cues can sometimes overwhelm in‐group biases. Nicholson hypothesizes that in‐group biases will matter most in uncompetitive, low‐stakes contexts. In contrast, in a competitive environment, individuals not only have incentives to agree with their own group but also face social incentives to disagree with an opposing group. In such situations, an opposing party's endorsement of a particular policy could reinforce attitudes even more than an in‐party's endorsement.         "
"6","In short, the salience of group membership and the levels of intergroup competition determine the extent to which cues shape attitudes as well as the predominance of either in‐ or out‐group cues. In the United States, scholars assume that partisanship exists in the sense that it reinforces a positive social identity for Democrats and Republicans.1 The competitiveness of the U.S. political system is also self‐evident, with only the two major parties standing a chance of winning major offices. However, in comparative perspective, particularly in new democracies, and in multiparty systems, the salience of partisanship is often lower, and the way that interparty competition impacts perceptions of each individual party is harder to interpret. Given this, we lack clear guidance regarding whether in‐ or out‐group cues should matter more. In the next section, we develop expectations about the power of partisan cues in Brazil.         "
"7","Brazil is now a stable democracy, and two parties have dominated presidential elections since 1994. However, its party system—the number and competitive dynamic between existing political parties—differs markedly from what we observe in the United States."
"8","To illustrate, consider two decades' worth of survey‐based observational evidence. Using polls from Datafolha (a large polling firm) since 1989, Figure 1 provides the proportion of Brazilian voters who identify with any party at all as well as the share who identify with the three largest parties: the Workers' Party (PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores), the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (PSDB, Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira), and the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB, Partido do Movimento Democrático Brasileiro).2"
"9","Party Identification in Brazil (1989–2010)"
"10","Note: Figure shows a moving average of levels of party identification, as computed by Datafolha. White vertical lines indicate presidential elections.                     "
"11","The figure reveals why scholars perceive mass partisanship as relatively weak in Brazil. The aggregate level in the electorate—about 40–45% in recent surveys—is below average in comparative perspective (Huber, Kernell, and Leoni 2005; Kitschelt et al. 2010). The three parties shown—PSDB, PT, and PMDB—are the only ones to have obtained more than 5% of partisan preferences on average over this time period.         "
"12","The PMDB has steadily lost ground since the 1990s. This may be explained by the fact that it is a loosely organized federation of state and local leaders who lead clientelistic electoral machines (Hagopian 1996). Because of its decline and because it has never led the government since redemocratization, we concentrate on the other two large parties.         "
"13","The PSDB—which held the presidency from 1995 to 2002 and has served as the main opposition party since—has never attracted more than a small slice of the electorate. It emerged as a breakaway faction from the PMDB in 1988 and has always been a resource‐rich party, dominated by experienced politicians from the state of São Paulo, Brazil's largest and wealthiest (Roma 2002). Today, despite winning two presidential elections, it remains largely a loosely organized federation of regional leaders and relies on these leaders' personal popularity and demonstrated technocratic effectiveness in government rather than on a coherent political vision. The party's appeal is concentrated among relatively educated and wealthy Brazilians, who tend to regard the PT as a party of inexperienced upstarts.         "
"14","Only one party—the PT—can claim a sizable proportion of the electorate as partisan supporters. Since its founding in the early 1980s, it has professed to be the party of “activist citizens,” engaging average Brazilians who want to change society, promoting greater participation in government and greater socioeconomic equality. It has consistently sought to develop and consolidate this partisan image, coupling a branding effort with an organizational development strategy that seeks to highlight the party's connection to individuals in civil society at the local level. The PT's deliberate efforts to cultivate an image have paid off. The party initially established itself as the main opposition party, then gradually increased its presence around the country, and has held the presidency since 2003. As Figure 1 reveals, since 1989, the proportion of Brazilians who call themselves petistas has grown from about 5% to about 25%.         "
"15","In a country where scholars do not expect mass partisanship to take root in the first place, one party's growth from zero in 1980 to 25% a generation later is remarkable. However, such growth does not necessarily confirm that partisanship—for the PT or for any other party—has the same causal force that it does elsewhere. The Datafolha question, for example, might not be capturing the psychological phenomenon of “partisanship.” And if that were true, Figure 1 might both overestimate the strength of partisanship in Brazil as well as be comparing Brazilian oranges to American and/or West European apples. Perhaps, as skeptics imply (e.g., Mainwaring 1999), partisan sympathies in Brazil—even for the PT—are not as strong as they are in long‐standing democracies. Can we determine whether party labels shape Brazilians' attitudes and behavior? Given what we know about Brazil's parties, and based in recent research on source cues, let us now articulate our hypotheses.         "
"16","We expect the labels of the PT and the PSDB to convey reference‐group information to partisans of these parties. That is, respondents who identify with either the PT or the PSDB and receive information about both parties' positions (“party cues”) should agree more with their respective party's positions when compared to partisans who do not receive such information (H1)."
"17","The PT is the most likely candidate among Brazilian parties to have cultivated partisanship similar to what is found in long‐standing democracies. It has a history of seeking to develop and consolidate its party label across the country (Hunter 2010; Samuels 1999) and of cultivating the party's connection to individuals in civil society at the local level. As Figure 1 suggests, petismo appears, at least at first glance, to provide a powerful form of social identity.         "
"18","The case for the PSDB partisanship is less clear but still present. On the one hand, the party has long highlighted its technocratic efficiency in government and has been popular among Brazil's better‐off citizens (Samuels 2006). On the other hand, it has a decentralized organizational structure (Roma 2006), and partly for this reason has never deliberately sought to cultivate a coherent collective public image beyond technocratic effectiveness. Although this image does represent a specific style of government, the PSDB's own leaders have acknowledged that it has failed to foster widespread affective ties to voters (Cardoso 2011). Still, many Brazilians fondly remember PSDB leaders' successful state administrations, and especially President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidency (1995–2002), which ended runaway inflation and brought Brazil's debt crisis under control, laying the foundations for subsequent economic growth.         "
"19","Building on recent research in the United States, we can also generate more specific predictions about the distinction between in‐ and out‐group cueing dynamics. The simplest and most likely mechanism behind any cueing effects in the Brazilian context is in‐group cueing. For in‐group cueing to exist, it is only necessary that voters' attachment to their preferred party be a substantively meaningful form of social identity; their feelings about other parties are irrelevant. We investigate whether in‐group cueing exists by examining whether PT and PSDB partisans' opinions are impacted when they receive information only about the position of their own party (H2)."
"20","Out‐group cueing, on the other hand, is a priori less likely in the Brazilian context because the fragmented multiparty system renders the notion of an “out‐group” unclear. In contrast to the United States, for instance, it is not obvious which of Brazil's many parties—currently, 19 have at least one seat in the legislature—individual partisans might consider an “out‐group.”"
"21","The key to assessing out‐group cueing effects—in Brazil or elsewhere—is not just the degree of fragmentation but the context in which the parties compete. Although many parties participate and win in local, state, and national legislative elections, only the PT and PSDB have effectively competed for the presidency since 1994, and they have served as the main government and opposition parties since then. This dynamic could provide partisans of these two parties with a concrete track record that would mark the “other” party as their main competition."
"22","Thus, if political competition drives the emergence of out‐group biases, and if partisans of the PT and PSDB see the other party as their main competitor for control of government, then partisans of those two parties should react not only to their own party's cue but also to the “other” party's cue (H3)."
"23","To be clear, if we find in‐group but not out‐group cueing effects, we would conclude that PT and PSDB partisans do not understand competition between their two parties to be as clearly defined as we have suggested just above. In short, while Hypothesis 2 examines whether partisanship is a meaningful form of social identity, Hypothesis 3 indicates whether the structure of political competition is well defined enough to generate out‐group biases. Hypotheses 2 and 3 represent two distinct causal pathways for cues to shape opinions."
"24","Finally, our depiction of Brazilian politics also has implications for nonpartisans, who comprise a majority of the electorate. Nonpartisans by definition cannot be subject to in‐group dynamics. However, examining nonpartisans can help us better assess whether party cueing effects work as scholars have supposed. The context of political competition in Brazil may, as Hypothesis 3 suggests, have created the conditions for out‐group cues to matter for partisans of the PT and/or the PSDB. However, we expect information about either party (or even about both parties) to have no effect on individuals who affirm no partisan identity (H4)."
"25","Though trivial at a first glance, this hypothesis, if true, rules out plausible and theoretically relevant alternatives. If we were to find, for instance, that nonpartisans react to (any) party cues, then our claim that partisan identity is a real and substantively important phenomenon would be jeopardized, as it would imply that no behavioral difference exists between nonpartisans and partisans. We might also, for example, discover that nonpartisans react negatively to information about the PT but not to information about the PSDB; this would suggest that perhaps a particular group's distinctive identity drives cueing effects and that out‐groups do not operate by strengthening one's own in‐group biases, as psychological theories suggest (Nicholson 2012).         "
"26","In any case, observational evidence provides preliminary support for our hypothesis. For example, statistical analysis of the microdata of the surveys used in Figure 1 reveals that since 1989, evaluation of the president's job performance is substantially higher among those who identify with the president's party than for those who identify with the main opposition party, with identifiers of other parties and non‐identifiers in between. Identifiers are also much more likely than others to vote for their own party's presidential candidate.3 These differences suggest that partisanship shapes voters' attitudes and actions just as one might expect. However, such findings cannot be taken as direct evidence of the causal import of partisan identification. Cross‐sections of observational data do not permit direct identification of causal relationships because they cannot account for potential endogeneity between partisanship and the behavior we observe or for potential reporting biases that might lead respondents to project consistency in answers to survey questions. Due to these limitations, we adopt an experimental approach to the question, allowing us to draw stronger causal inferences.         "
"27","To assess the power of party labels to shape attitudes in Brazil, we undertook two survey experiments where we employ party cues to manipulate information respondents have about the positions of the PT and the PSDB. One experiment was embedded in a national probability sample survey that employed face‐to‐face interviewing, and the other was performed on a convenience sample recruited through and conducted on the Internet."
"28","Each experimental item presented two polar positions on a given political issue and asked respondents to state which position they agreed with more. Respondents in the control group were told simply that “some” politicians supported one position, whereas “others” supported the opposing view. Respondents assigned to the treatment condition saw the two main party labels (PT and PSDB) attached to each position. This basic design, which we refer to as the “double‐cue” treatment, emulates research in American politics (Cohen 2003; Druckman, Peterson, and Slothuus forthcoming; Lavine, Johnston, and Steenbergen 2013; Levendusky 2010) and allows us to test whether information about the position of the two main parties shapes opinions of partisans of either the PT or the PSDB, partisans of other parties, and nonpartisans.            "
"29","In order to test whether in‐group and out‐group cueing effects differ, we introduced two additional treatment conditions. Respondents in these conditions were provided with only one party cue associated with one of the two positions, while the remaining position was attributed to “some” or “other” politicians, depending on the order in which the options were presented. As noted, in an extremely fragmented party system like Brazil's, it is not obvious who “others” might be. Combined with the double‐cue treatment, this “single‐cue” treatment allows us to investigate whether in‐group or out‐group cueing effects predominate, and to explore whether cues from either of Brazil's major parties impact the opinions of nonpartisans."
"30","In the face‐to‐face survey, we were able to field only a single experimental question and only in the double‐cue format. In the Internet sample, we fielded five items each with all four conditions. Table 1 shows the number of respondents in each condition in each survey. Note that in the empirical section that follows, we also occasionally pool all respondents who receive a treatment into a “some treatment” category.            "
"31","In both surveys, respondents were randomly assigned to different conditions. In the online version of the experiment, we randomized treatment assignment by respondent (to prevent respondents from learning about the different treatment conditions) and also randomized the order in which the experimental items were presented and whether they were presented before or after the party identification question."
"32","The questions, which are translated in full in Table 2, covered the following issues: the appropriate level of Brazil's minimum wage; the signing of investment protection treaties for direct foreign investment; regulation of exploration of offshore (“presalt”) oil fields; the acceptance of Venezuela into Mercosur, a free trade agreement; and government financing of private companies. This last question was the only one asked (in almost identical wording) in both the online and traditional versions of the survey.            "
"33","We did not use deception in any item; the policy positions attributed to each party correspond to that party's actual positions. The main reason for employing deception is to circumvent the limitations imposed by too high ex ante agreement between partisans and parties (i.e., to avoid ceiling effects) (Mondak 1993). Yet because four of our items addressed obscure issues, we were able to observe varying, and sometimes low, levels of agreement between partisans and their parties in the control group, even without the use of deception (see below).            "
"34","The obscurity of the topics also afforded us the opportunity to examine cueing in the absence of deeply held convictions. However, Goren, Federico, and Kittilson (2009) found that party cues can move voters' core beliefs in the United States, highlighting the potentially powerful causal import of partisan identity even where voters have strong priors on the issue. Therefore, we introduced one question with relatively high public salience—the minimum‐wage question. We chose this policy because the parties' positions on this question ran against what one might expect: the center‐left PT (which controlled the government) favored a lower value of the minimum wage, contradicting its historical position, whereas the center‐right PSDB, for tactical reasons, favored the higher value. Conveniently, this avoids conflating high baseline support (which would impose ceilings on possible effects) with strong convictions.            "
"35","Our subjects in the face‐to‐face survey were the 1,221 respondents to the last wave of the Brazil Election Panel Survey (BEPS), fielded in December 2010. Each wave involved interviews in respondents' homes, and respondents were chosen via a national probability sample. The survey contained a range of questions about parties, politics, and public policies, as well as the usual demographic questions. In the third wave of the survey, we presented a single experimental item to respondents after they were asked about party identification. As this was a pen‐and‐paper survey, respondents were randomly assigned to treatments a priori, within census tracts."
"36","Our second set of respondents comes from an Internet‐based survey. We recruited subjects for this survey by broadcasting advertisements on Facebook in Brazil between November 27 and December 25, 2011. Facebook had approximately 37 million users in Brazil at this time; advertisers can target Facebook ads at specific demographic groups, which in our case included all Brazilians 18 years or older."
"37","Basic ads on Facebook are simple: advertisers are given approximately 140 characters of text and can also include a small .jpg image. Following recommended best practices, we broadcast several very similar ads that used different figures and explored minor variations of the following text: “Win an iPad2! University researchers want your opinion. Fill out a ten‐minute questionnaire and you're eligible to win an iPad2 (1 in 3000 chance).” The ad would appear temporarily on the right‐hand side of a Facebook user's screen. Approximately 4.6 million Brazilians saw our ad, each an average of 9.5 times, and approximately 1 in 5,000 people who saw the ad clicked on it (for more information, see Zucco and Samuels 2013).            "
"38","A person who clicked on the ad would be taken to a new web page, where they would be asked to read a consent form. If they agreed, they would then start the survey, which took approximately seven minutes and contained demographic questions, questions on political participation and activism, a party identification question, and five experimental questions. We obtained a total of 3,286 valid entries, after eliminating multiple entries by the same respondent (identified by either repeat Internet Protocol or personal e‐mail address), anyone younger than 18 (as determined by their response to an age question), and anyone who did not answer the party identification question or at least one of the five experimental questions. The prize was delivered to the lottery winner in February 2012.4 The sample included respondents from every Brazilian state, from all age groups, and from varying socioeconomic backgrounds. The sample was younger, richer, and more male than the overall Brazilian population, but it drew from all relevant demographic groups.            "
"39","Figure 2 provides initial evidence to evaluate the hypothesis that party cues shift partisans' policy choices (H1). The figure shows the proportion of respondents in the control group who agreed with their own party on the issues (baseline agreement) and the comparable proportions of those who received the double‐cue treatment, as well as of those who received some cue (i.e., pooling respondents in the double‐cue treatment and single‐cue treatments).5 The double‐cue group and the pooled some‐cue group are alternative operationalizations of the treatment that are both consistent with Hypothesis 1.         "
"40","Effects of Party Cues on Partisans of the PT and the PSDB"
"41","Note: Figure shows levels of agreement between partisans and their own party, as well as effects of cues, for partisans of the PT and the PSDB. Items are ordered by baseline level of agreement with each party, so the ordering differs across panels. The 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals for a one‐tailed t‐test of the PT/PSDB conditions relative to the control group are also shown.                     "
"42","For the PT, partisans who received cues were always more likely to agree with their party. Out of the six items, this difference was significant at the 0.05 level in four and at the 0.1 level in one. For the PSDB, though partisans who received cues were more likely to agree with their party on four of the six questions, this difference was only statistically significant in three questions, and in one of these, it was significant only for the some‐cue pooled condition."
"43","The item fielded in the BEPS only allows for the comparison of the control group with that of the group receiving the double cue, as the question design in that survey did not include the single‐cue treatments. Effects for PT sympathizers are very similar on this question across the face‐to‐face and Internet surveys, but we found much larger effects in the BEPS for sympathizers of the PSDB than we found online. We attribute this result to the small number of PSDB sympathizers in the BEPS survey."
"44","The apparently relatively weaker cueing effects overall for the PSDB hinge on two features of our data. First, as reported in Table 1, statistical power in the case of the PSDB is limited by the smaller number of identifiers in both surveys. More importantly, the baseline level of agreement with the parties in the control condition varied considerably across questions and was very high in some cases. This was particularly true for the PSDB, for which baseline agreement with the party was in the vicinity of 0.80 in two questions. Given that cueing effects tend to disappear when agreement between partisans and their party is already high (e.g.,  Mondak 1993), it is striking that we obtain results as robust as those reported here.         "
"45","To make this point readily visible, the items in Figure 2 are ranked in descending order by the baseline level of support for each party's position. If we consider, for instance, only questions for which the baseline agreement with a party was below 0.6, we find that treatment effects were statistically significant in four out of five items for the PT and three out of four for the PSDB. Considering only the low‐agreement questions, the average double‐cue treatment effect across all questions is actually smaller for petistas (0.16) than for PSDB supporters (0.22). However, if we exclude the BEPS results, the average effects become almost identical—0.16 for supporters of the PT and 0.17 for those of the PSDB. This leads us to conclude that for similar levels of baseline agreement, it is likely that the effects of the PSDB label on sympathizers of the PSDB are similar to those of the PT label on its own sympathizers.         "
"46","The minimum‐wage item is particularly revealing. The PT had historically defended a higher minimum wage, but once in government, it was constrained by fiscal issues to back a smaller increase. The PSDB, as the main opposition, pushed for a larger increase to shame the government, but its stance reversed the position it held when in office. Surprisingly, for the United States, approximately 85% of partisans of both parties in the control group supported the higher value. While this left us no room to investigate cueing effects for the PSDB on this question, it created a very interesting scenario to evaluate the cueing effects on PT partisans. Even on an issue that should be close to the heart of most petistas, party cues in the “unexpected” direction are strong enough to change respondents' minds.         "
"47","In general terms, our results thus far echo findings from American politics that use the double‐cue design—that is, party labels have the predicted effects, shifting the opinions of self‐identified partisans. What is novel here is that we have uncovered such effects in a “third‐wave” democracy with an extremely fragmented multiparty system, where a priori expectations for the existence of cueing effects are lower."
"48","In‐ and Out‐Group Effects. The double‐cue treatment indicates that on questions where partisans tend to disagree with their party's position, seeing information on how the parties line up on the issue tends to move partisans toward “their” party's position. We cannot, from this result, conclude whether these effects are the product of in‐ or out‐group cueing. However, the fact that the pooled “some‐cue” group exhibits very similar results to the double‐cue group is preliminary evidence that the three different cueing treatments produce similar effects.         "
"49","Our research design, allows us to make additional inferences about the nature and effects of partisanship in Brazil, including whether the driving force behind this result is solely in‐group cueing or whether out‐group biases also play a role. The former is the more likely and simpler mechanism, in that it requires only an attachment to one's party. The latter is a more complex phenomenon, as it requires respondents to identify the other party as a competitor to their own."
"50","To this point, Figure 3 reports the effects of single‐party cues on partisans of the two main parties. As expected, the results suggest that in‐group cueing exists, for both parties (H2), and that their effects increase, as in Figure 2, as the baseline level of agreement with the party's position declines.         "
"51","Comparing Effects of In‐ and Out‐Group Cues"
"52","Note: Figure shows levels of agreement between partisans and their own party, as well as effects of cues, for partisans of the PT and the PSDB. Items are ordered by baseline level of agreement with each party, so the ordering differs across panels. The 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals for a one‐tailed t‐test between the PT/PSDB conditions and the no‐cue condition are also shown.                     "
"53","More interestingly, however, results also show some evidence in support of the presence of out‐group cueing effects (H3). The out‐group cues (darker bars) generally produce effects in the expected direction (to agree with one's own party more than the control group), and when baseline agreement with the party is low enough, the effects are also statistically significant.6"
"54","The figure also reveals visually that in‐ and out‐group cues tend to generate similar effects for both the PT and the PSDB. That is, the null hypothesis that the in‐ and out‐group cues produce similar effects can never be rejected at conventional levels of statistical significance. The absolute difference in the effects of PT and PSDB cues reported in both panels in Figure 3 is never larger than 0.13, the mean absolute difference is much smaller (0.05), and p‐values for these differences computed using bootstrapped standard errors are always greater than 0.50. In short, within each subpopulation and within each question, the effects of the three treatment conditions are statistically indistinguishable from each other.         "
"55","Out‐group cueing effects are particularly important because they can emerge only if respondents make sense of the structure of political competition. Our results suggest not only that partisan identification in Brazil is strong enough to generate in‐group bias for partisans of the two main parties but also that partisan competition between the PT and PSDB is sufficiently well structured so that knowing the position of the other party provides useful information to partisans of both parties, generating out‐group bias. Our design, however, does not allow us to identify precisely what determines the relative sizes of effects of in‐ and out‐group cues, a task we leave for future research."
"56","Effects on Nonpartisans. To the extent that partisanship is a real form of social identity in Brazil, we should expect party cues to have no effect on the attitudes of nonpartisans. If, however, nonpartisans are moved by PT or PSDB cues, it would imply that declaring sympathy for a party does not have a distinct effect on political behavior.         "
"57","Our hypothesis concerning nonpartisans (H4) is confirmed by the data. Figure 4 demonstrates that PT and PSDB cues produce largely negligible effects on nonpartisans, which are statistically significant (but still substantively small) in only a single case, in the direction of the PT's position.         "
"58","Effects of Party Cues on Nonpartisans"
"59","Note: Figure shows effects of receiving a single or double cue on the agreement of nonpartisans with the position of the two main parties (PT on the left, and PSDB on the right). Items are ordered by baseline level of agreement with each party, so the ordering differs across panels. The 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals for a one‐tailed t‐test relative to the control group are also shown.                     "
"60","It is logically possible, though statistically implausible, that some nonpartisans (or partisans of other parties) are systematically moved in one direction while others are systematically moved in the other, and the null average effects we report in that figure are a product of aggregation of these conflicting significant effects. There are infinite ways in which one could disaggregate the data to examine potential heterogeneity of effects in different subpopulations. Yet without a compelling theoretical reason, it is unclear which disaggregations, if any, should be examined."
"61","In any case, the results in Figure 4 provide a fairly strong null result because treatment effects on nonpartisans are estimated with much higher precision than on partisans due to much larger sample sizes. We interpret these findings as suggesting that nonpartisans, in sharp contrast with partisans, simply do not receive much useful information from the labels of Brazil's two main parties.         "
"62","Overall, our experiments provide strong support for our hypotheses. In the absence of information about their parties' positions, many partisans do not naturally agree with their party on a range of policies. Yet when told about either their own or the main rival party's position—or both—Brazilians who identify with the PT or PSDB tend to line up behind their party (H1). Because the PT and PSDB are real social groups of like‐minded citizens, and because the two parties have competed for and alternated in power for almost 20 years, party cues lead to both in‐group (H2) and out‐group attitude change (H3). However, because nonpartisans are neither attached to nor in direct competition with PT or PSDB, those two parties' labels do not generally shape their opinions (H4). In short, the PT and PSDB labels convey information to sympathizers about the issues and generate group cohesion at the mass level."
"63","This article is part of a relatively new effort to bolster scholarly understanding of the origins and impact of party identification by using evidence derived from experimental methods in relatively newer democracies. Our results confirm that the concept of partisan identification can travel to disparate political contexts and suggest that scholars should continue to explore the different sources of partisan biases. Our results also deepen understanding of the Brazilian case and provide proof of concept of a novel and low‐cost way to conduct survey experiments in comparative perspective."
"64","First, given that limits on our ability to derive causal inferences about partisanship from observational data are well known, applying experimental methods beyond the U.S. and European cases offers tremendous opportunities to put the concept of mass partisanship on surer conceptual footing. Results in this article clearly establish that learning information about parties' positions affects partisans' attitudes in Brazil, but such information has no effect on nonpartisans. Identifying with a party, in short, is meaningful enough to induce partisans to try to reduce cognitive dissonance (Brewer 1991). By implication, partisan identification in a relatively young democracy with a highly fragmented party system is fundamentally the same phenomenon as in more mature democracies, even those with less‐fragmented party systems.         "
"65","Second, our study also begins to unpack the way that partisan identification operates in different political contexts by presenting evidence that both in‐ and out‐group cues can provide partisans with meaningful information. Our results strongly suggest that when group membership matters, in‐group biases push individuals to adopt their group's position out of a desire to conform. They also suggest that out‐group biases can shape individuals' attitudes when the intergroup dynamic is sufficiently competitive. For the most part, it appears that PT and PSDB partisans are just as able to map the policy space after receiving information about their party's opponent as they are after receiving information about their own party's position. This is an important finding, because in the contemporary U.S. context, out‐group cues may be stronger than in‐group cues (Nicholson 2012). However, in multiparty democracies, it is not always obvious who the main competitors are. Our results suggest that even a modicum of structure in the landscape of political competition can help partisans make sense of the policy space. In short, our findings support predictions from social psychology that if group membership is a salient form of political identity, members will seek to accentuate intergroup differences.         "
"66","Third, the article contributes to debates about Brazilian politics by showing that although the aggregate level of mass partisanship in the electorate is comparatively low, partisanship can still be meaningful. The PT and PSDB have very different historical trajectories, so our findings suggest that there is more than one way to cultivate partisan attachments in a complicated partisan electoral context such as Brazil's. We do not, however, wish to make too much of the finding that the PSDB cue has the predicted effect. It is one thing to note that the PSDB label can shape voter opinion just like the PT label can, but for all practical purposes the importance of the PSDB label pales in comparison to the PT label simply because it has meaning for only a tiny slice of the Brazilian electorate."
"67","Finally, these conclusions were obtained by the first—to our knowledge—survey experiment to have used an online social network (Facebook) as a source of subject recruitment. This approach should help popularize experimental research in comparative politics because of its low cost and because it facilitates rapid data collection. This implies, of course, that most of our results are drawn from an unrepresentative sample. However, the online sample more closely resembles the overall population than commonly used samples of college students, and results from the BEPS—drawn from a nationally representative sample—are compatible with, if not identical to, the results from the online experiment. The relative consistency of our results across two distinct political contexts (an election campaign versus a “normal” year) and two distinct testing environments lends credence to the view that we have captured a real and substantively important phenomenon and also that social networks are a promising medium in which to conduct social‐scientific research."
"68","Conventional wisdom expects partisanship to be weakly sedimented in newer democracies in general and in Brazil in particular. Yet despite the absence of social cleavages and an institutional environment that privileges political individualism and discriminates against cohesive parties—and even though Brazil's two main parties have converged on the political center, agree on many of the issues, and have allied with a confusing array of parties, party labels for the PT and PSDB have the same effects scholars find for parties in older democracies (e.g., Brader and Tucker 2012). Our results suggest that in multiparty systems, the intensity and pattern of interparty competition matter for the strength of party labels (e.g., Nicholson 2012). Future research should explore the relative strength of in‐ and out‐group partisan biases in greater detail.         "
"69","By establishing the existence of cueing effects in a least likely case, our study places the generalizability of the concept of partisan identification on more solid theoretical foundations. Even when adversaries are weakly defined, a modicum of structured political competition can lead to the emergence of in‐ and out‐group biases in which voters use party labels to structure their political attitudes and behavior. In any case, the agenda for experimental research on partisanship in comparative perspective remains wide open."
