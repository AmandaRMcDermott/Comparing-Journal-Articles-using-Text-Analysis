"1","Macrolevel characterizations of the issue‐definition process have generally recognized both the temporal stability characterizing most issues, as well as the periodic punctuations that occur through time for some issues (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Cobb and Elder 1972; Kingdon 1995). That is, systemwide definitions of most issues remain relatively constant through time, reflecting a stable social and political equilibrium. However, occasionally for some issues the equilibrium is disturbed and a new definition emerges which dramatically propels a matter to active consideration on the public's agenda. While macrolevel characterizations of issue definition have adequately described these characteristics, they have not adequately explained the stability and punctuations that occur periodically through time. We argue that explaining these characteristics requires a microlevel theory of issue definition.         "
"2","Of course, there is a relationship between the macro and micro perspectives. Fundamental to the issue‐definition process is how a condition is perceived by both society and individuals. The prevailing social interpretation of a condition represents a collective understanding by individuals of a condition across the system. However, it does not necessarily consist of a simple linear aggregation of individual interpretations. Rather, individual interpretations can be substantially out of sync with the prevailing social interpretation (Huckfeld and Sprague 1995; Kuran 1989, 1991, 1995; Lohman 1994; Mutz 1998; Noelle‐Neumann 1984; Wood and Doan 2003).         "
"3","We argue that the nature of information processing by individuals can explain both stability and change in the issue‐definition process. Information abounds within policy systems for most issues. However, all information also has a range of ambiguity. Individuals generally lack the cognitive skill, time, resources, and will to capture, assimilate, and interpret all information and its relative certainty (Simon 1947). As a result, they engage in unfocused information processing, or what Herbert Simon called “satisficing.” Individuals process information through a filter that depends on past assessments, ideology, background, social cues, and the continuing intrusion of new signals from the information environment (Zaller 1992). Trust in various actors and processes also plays a role in stability and change, especially in areas of potentially strong conflict (Leach and Sabatier 2005). Thus, microlevel factors tend both individual and system‐wide issue definition toward stability. Past assessments, ideology, background, and perceptions of social forces are relatively constant through time for most individuals, producing stability. As a result, it is only through the introduction of new information that punctuations occur in the issue‐definition process.         "
"4"," Jones and Baumgartner (2005) make a similar argument by concluding that in the absence of full and certain information people engage in “disproportionate” information processing. That is, they attend to and interpret information about issues through a filter that gives the most weight to personal biases and less weight to objective criteria. Indeed, they argue that there are no objective criteria, since all information contains a zone of ambiguity. Attempting to make sense of an issue in an uncertain information environment, people generally define an issue in a manner that most closely aligns with their own predispositions. This means that individuals do not always respond proportionately to the strength of a signal impinging from the information environment. According to Jones and Baumgartner (2005), this feature produces stability in systemwide issue definition through time. It takes an information signal of significant strength and an appropriate alignment of individual biases to produce the punctuations that occur periodically across the system through time.         "
"5","Similarly, Wood and Doan (2003) develop a mathematical model of issue stability and punctuation that focuses on individual preferences, but places greater emphasis on social forces. Their argument is that equilibrium in systemwide issue definition occurs as a result of the aggregation of individual preferences and strong incentives to follow a prevailing social interpretation. Feedback from a prevailing social interpretation may cause individuals to conform to an issue definition that is substantially out of sync with their innate predispositions for substantial periods (see also Huckfeld and Sprague 1995; Kuran 1995; Mutz 1998; Noelle‐Neumann 1984). Norms and expectations glue the individual to the dominant beliefs of the community. However, when the preferences of a substantial number of individuals are out of sync with the prevailing social interpretation, an informational signal of even small magnitude can tip the system across a threshold to a different equilibrium interpretation. Under this model, an informational signal that is quite small can produce a cascade of change across an increasing number of individuals until a new systemwide issue definition is achieved.         "
"6","Again, the information‐processing theory proposed here and elsewhere posits that people process information about issues through a filter that generally induces stability. In the absence of full and unambiguous information, individuals rely on cues in formulating their definition of issues. As observed by Hogwood and Gunn, “we each create our own ‘reality,’ and this is nowhere more true than in the way we identify problems or issues, and interpret and relate them to our mental map of some larger situation” (1984, 109). Individuals evaluate incoming information about issues through a social lens that can color or even black out the importance of that information. Their assessments are rooted in values, ideology, culture, history, trust, and a prevailing social interpretation. All of these factors are relatively fixed and likely produce path dependence in individual‐issue definition. Since issue definition at the macrolevel is a type of aggregation of individual‐issue definitions, stability and path dependence become features of the system.         "
"7","However, occasionally information will enter the filter that is of sufficient strength or character to produce change in how individuals assess an issue. New information can affect issue definitions gradually, such as with the case of the environment from the 1940s to the 1970s (Jones 1975; Sabatier 1988). New information can also produce dramatic punctuations as events occur which sharply alter people's understanding of existing information (e.g., Love Canal and hazardous wastes, Three Mile Island and nuclear power, the Clarence Thomas hearings and sexual harassment). If the issue is technical, new scientific evidence may arise that fundamentally alters people's understanding of a problem's importance or impact.         "
"8","New information may also alter an individual's perception of the social forces surrounding an issue. People naturally prefer their issue assessments to conform to those of the community around them. Past research has suggested that feedback from a prevailing social interpretation may cause individuals to conform to evaluations that are out of sync with their true evaluations for substantial periods (Huckfeld and Sprague 1995; Kuran 1989, 1991, 1995; Lohman 1994; Mutz 1998; Noelle‐Neumann 1984; Wood and Doan 2003). However, if individuals holding preferences that are out of sync with the community perceive that community preferences might be changing, then an appropriate signal can cause them to adjust their positions in the direction of the perceived change. Perceptions of change in the prevailing social interpretation can lead to bandwagon effects across individuals and cascading shifts in issue definition across society. In these ways change in microlevel issue definitions can lead to sharp punctuations in macrolevel issue definition through time.         "
"9","At least three testable propositions flow from the information‐processing theory of issue definition discussed above. First, the manner in which an individual defines a public policy issue should depend strongly on a set of relatively fixed factors that include values, ideology, culture, history, background, and perceptions of social forces. These stability‐inducing factors are fundamental to the information‐processing filter that produces an individual's predispositions."
"10","Second, the more uncertain the knowledge and information environment surrounding an issue, the more likely it becomes that an individual will rely on these base factors (rather than information) for defining the issue. Conversely, as individuals possess greater knowledge and trust in information surrounding an issue, they should become more likely to define the issue in a manner consistent with the information."
"11","Third, an information signal of sufficient strength can produce punctuations in individual‐issue definitions regardless of the individual's predispositions and knowledge. Information signals producing punctuations can relate directly to the issue itself, or they can somehow alter an individual's interpretation of the social forces surrounding the issue."
"12","Together these three propositions frame a model of how information interacts with personal characteristics to create the conditions for tipping a stable policy equilibrium point to a new policy position. We diagram that model in Figure 1.         "
"13","                 A Model of Information Processing and Policy Punctuation                      "
"14","In evaluating our information‐processing theory of issue definition we designed and implemented a national public opinion survey.2 The primary focus was on one dimension of the issue‐definition process, people's assessments of problem severity for various issues facing the nation and world.            "
"15","The early part of the survey instrument contained questions intended to evaluate the general nature of the issue‐definition process for individuals across multiple issues. The latter part of the survey instrument was devoted to the more specific issue of global warming. We emphasized to survey interviewers the need to maintain a broad focus early on and to give respondents no hint that the survey instrument would later turn toward global warming. Our purpose in this design was to establish a base model for particular predispositions and information that are important to the issue‐definition process for individuals. The general model developed from the first part of the survey served as a baseline for later models specific to the issue‐definition process for global warming. Additionally, the uncontaminated responses to questions early in the survey were pretest controls for embedded experiments at the end of the survey intended to test the third proposition above."
"16","Data for our study were from a national telephone survey of adults in the United States conducted from July 13 to August 10, 2004.3 Interviews were conducted in English, with the average interview taking about 37 minutes. Using the American Association for Public Opinion Research outcome rate calculator, the response rate was 37% and the cooperation rate was 48%. Overall, 1093 interviews were completed, resulting in a sampling error of plus or minus 3%.4"
"17","We began the survey with a series of open‐ended questions to identify what particular issues Americans considered important. Specifically, we asked a set of questions similar to the Gallup most important problem series as follows: “In your opinion, what are the three most important issues facing the nation (world) currently (in the future), starting with the most important?” Responses to these open‐ended questions were classified into standard categories such as terrorism, the economy, health care, education, the environment, global warming, etc. All total, respondents identified issues that were classified into 42 distinct categories. From these responses we concluded that terrorism, the economy, health care, and poverty were considered most important by Americans. Given our interest in global warming, we also included this category in subsequent analyses. Roughly 10% of Americans listed global warming as a serious issue currently facing the nation and world, while 25% viewed global warming as a serious issue facing the nation and world in the future.            "
"18","Having identified this subset of issues, we narrowed the questioning to focus on people's level of concern for these and other issues. We asked the following."
"19","                              "
"20","Now, I'd like to list some specific issues that concern people. On a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating completely unconcerned and 10 indicating extremely concerned, rate these issues on how worried you are about them right now."
"21","On a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating completely unimportant and 10 indicating extremely important, rate the following issues on how important you think they are likely to become over the next 50 to 100 years."
"22","Thirteen issues were listed for respondents for both questions, including terrorism, the economy, health care, poverty, global warming, Social Security, genetically modified foods, globalization of the economy, energy, the environment, education, government debt, and pollution. The ordering of these issues was randomized for each respondent and across questions by computer. Also, the scale was repeated when necessary by the interviewer to encourage valid responses."
"23","We used the responses to these questions for the five issues identified above as dependent variables for our research report. Note again that the five issues chosen for analysis were extracted from the longer list of 13 issues based on the initial open‐ended questions. Note also for reference below that respondents had no idea at this stage that we were interested in these particular issues or that they would be questioned later about global warming. This is important to our research design because the early responses occurred in the context of a more general assessment of the level of concern for multiple problems. The responses here also serve as a pretest response for our subsequent embedded experiments on how new information and social forces affect the issue‐definition process."
"24","Our theory suggests that people process information about issues through a filter containing a range of variables relating to their predispositions. Thus, we included in the analyses a series of variables identifying each individual's political, economic, and social orientation. The variables included in the analyses were Ideology, Party Republican, Income, Age, Religion Conservative, Race White, Gender Female, Children, the interaction of Gender Female and Children, Education College, and General Science IQ. Specific questions asked of respondents along with variable definitions are in Appendix Table A1.            "
"25","Ideology and Party Republican capture an individual's primary politically relevant beliefs and their effect on the issue‐definition process. Viewed from the perspective of the “guns versus butter” trade‐off, it is widely understood that conservatives and Republicans prefer guns over butter, while the opposite is true for liberals and Democrats. Thus, we expect conservatives and Republicans to be more concerned about terrorism since this is a guns issue. In contrast, liberals and Democrats should exhibit greater concern for the economy, health care, and poverty since these are butter issues. Liberals and Democrats should also be more concerned about global warming."
"26","Income reflects an individual's need‐based orientation toward the issue‐definition process. Lower income should produce greater concern for such issues as the economy, health care, and poverty. Poor people are more concerned about losing their income, receiving adequate health care, and dropping into poverty. Conversely, we expect higher‐income individuals to be less concerned about these issues."
"27","Age and Religion Conservative capture separate dimensions of an individual's temporal orientation. Young people tend to be more oriented toward the present. They are often more concerned with matters of pleasure and entertainment than they are with serious issues facing the nation and world. In contrast, older people tend to be more deliberative of the news and future of the nation and world. Further, Age may also have a need‐based component. Older people have more difficulty finding comparable work if they lose their jobs and also have greater health care needs. Thus, older people should express greater concern across all issues, but especially for those issues that affect their material welfare."
"28","Religion Conservative should produce less concern about the problems of the nation and world. This is because fundamentalist religious groups teach that an individual's future lies in heaven and not their worldly existence. This implies that individuals who identify themselves as religious conservatives should exhibit less concern about all issues."
"29","Race White and Gender Female capture innate differences in viewpoint associated with racial and gender differences. Whites should be less concerned about issues such as the economy, health care, and poverty. These individuals are often better off financially and have better access to health and social services. In contrast, African Americans and Hispanics are more susceptible to economic downturn, experiencing higher unemployment and greater relative income loss. Also, poor health care and poverty are more pressing for these groups."
"30","Similarly, Gender Female should also affect predispositions toward various social issues. Men are also generally more concerned with “guns” issues, while women are more concerned about social issues and protecting their children. These predispositions should translate into greater concern by men for terrorism and by women for the economy, health care, and poverty."
"31","Education College and General Science IQ measure an individual's relative sophistication in evaluating various issues. The college educated generally have a larger knowledge base and inclination toward learning about issues. General Science IQ is a scale measuring people's understanding of basic science concepts. As individuals' education and General Science IQ increase, we expect them to have greater sophistication in evaluating science‐based issues such as global warming and perhaps health care."
"32","We measured information that respondents had about each of the issues using two variables. First, we created a scale that we named Information Sources for the number of different information sources an individual could name for each issue. Individuals were asked to list in open‐ended fashion the sources of information they used in understanding each issue. The number of information sources given by respondents ranged from 1 to 7 and varied across issues. Our expectation is that the more information sources an individual could list, the more information the individual should possess about an issue. This should produce a clearer mental image of the issue and less reliance on predispositions in issue definition."
"33","Second, we asked respondents to rate themselves on a scale from 0 to 10 on how well informed they consider themselves on each issue. Greater Self‐Reported Knowledge of an issue implies that people should have a clearer mental image of the issue. One could argue that this measure of self‐reported knowledge could be contaminated by dual causality. That is, people may say they know more about an issue because their level of concern for the issue is high. However, we attempted to minimize this potential effect by manipulating the context of the question and through randomization. The five issues under analysis were part of a longer list of 13 issues. We also randomized the issues so that the order of issues did not correspond with the original question and differed across respondents."
"34","This section reports a statistical analysis evaluating the various potential components of the general information‐processing filter applied by individuals for the five policy issues."
"35","There were missing values for several of the independent variables discussed above. Specifically, some respondents did not report their annual income, and a few did not report their age and ideology. Therefore, we performed Bayesian multiple imputation using Gibbs sampling to restore missing observations and enable analysis of complete data.5 The results reported below are pooled regression coefficients and t‐statistics from five separate datasets with missing values replaced by imputed values.         "
"36","Again, the dependent variables are people's levels of concern for terrorism, the economy, health care, poverty, and global warming. Because the sample size is large, t‐statistics greater than 1.96 indicate statistical significance at the two‐tailed 0.05 alpha level. Results were highly robust to the exclusion of variables and split sample analyses. Tables 1 and 2 report the results for respondents' level of concern for each issue, now and in the future.         "
"37","Ideology is coded from (1) strong liberal to (7) strong conservative. The coefficients are statistically significant for all issues in Table 1 and four of five issues in Table 2, but differ in sign. The variations in sign confirm our expectation that conservatives are more concerned about “guns” issues such as terrorism, and liberals are more concerned about “butter” issues such as the economy, health care, and poverty. In addition, liberals are more concerned about global warming.         "
"38","Party Republican is statistically significant for two issues, poverty and global warming. Of course, partisanship is collinear with Ideology, so this result demonstrates only the marginal difference for Republican partisanship. The significant negative coefficients in the fourth column show that Republicans are less concerned than Democrats about poverty by about 0.67 to 0.56 points on the 10‐point scale. The fifth column shows they are less concerned about global warming by about 0.60 to 0.75 points on a 10‐point scale."
"39","Across both tables, Income relates to people's level of concern for health care and poverty now and for the future. However, it does not predict their level of concern for terrorism, the economy, or global warming. Although the relationship is not uniformly significant, higher income results in decreased concern for health care and poverty. This is consistent with expectations since those with higher income have less reason to be concerned about these issues."
"40","The results for Age are ambiguous, suggesting response instability. In Table 1 where the issues are framed in a current context, Age covaries positively with people's level of concern for terrorism and health care. However, in Table 2 where the issues are framed in a future context, age does not covary with people's level of concern for these issues. Also, Age does covary positively with people's level of concern for global warming when framed in a future context, but not when framed in a current context.         "
"41","Religion Conservative exhibits a negative effect for nine of 10 categories in Tables 1 and 2. The effect is statistically significant for four of the five issue categories in Table 1 and three of the five in Table 2. The average coefficient shows that individuals with fundamentalist orientations are less concerned than others about these various conditions by about 0.30 on a 10‐point scale. As discussed above, fundamentalist religious groups place less emphasis on their present‐day worries and more on their future in heaven. Therefore, this result is consistent with the assumed fundamentalist mindset.         "
"42","Race White is negative for nine of 10 issue categories in Tables 1 and 2 and statistically significant for six of the 10 categories. Whites are less concerned than nonwhites across all issues, and along different temporal orientations. Controlling for other factors, the average coefficient reveals that whites are less concerned by about 0.40 points on a 10‐point scale. This is a large effect, suggesting a significant disparity in how people of different racial backgrounds define policy issues.         "
"43","Interestingly, Education College and General Science IQ show consistently negative effects across all regressions in both tables. Education College is statistically significant for four of five categories in Table 1 and two of five categories in Table 2. General Science IQ is statistically significant for three of five categories in Table 1 and three of five categories in Table 2. Thus, the college educated and those with higher General Science IQ exhibit less concern about the issues generally. As noted above, these individuals tend to have a larger knowledge base and more inclination for analysis of issues facing the nation and world. These factors appear to soften their tendency to worry about various issues.         "
"44","Information Sources is consistently negative in both tables, but statistically significant at conventional levels only for terrorism. An individual's reliance on more information sources about terrorism apparently reduces their level of concern."
"45","Finally, an individual's Self‐Reported Knowledge of an issue is significantly positive for all analyses. Moreover, there is a very strong association between what people claim to know about an issue and their level of concern for that issue. This effect strongly suggests that knowledge of an issue produces greater concern for the issue. However, we caution for reasons discussed above that this effect may be associative rather than causal.         "
"46","The results reported above strongly support the first proposition in our model that issue definition at the individual level depends on a set of base factors that are relatively fixed and stable through time. Ideology, partisanship, income, religion, and social orientation are all important to the information‐processing filter. The second part of our survey focused on global warming and asked questions that were more relevant to the second and third propositions above.         "
"47","The second proposition concerns whether an individual's reliance on cues and predispositions for issue definition depends on an individual's knowledge and the certainty of the information environment. Deficient knowledge and ambiguous information should lead to greater reliance on cues and predispositions. Conversely, strong knowledge and information should lead to less reliance on cues and predispositions in the information filter."
"48","We asked a sequence of questions about global warming to enable evaluating this proposition. First, we asked three global warming science questions to determine what respondents actually knew (as opposed to Self‐Reported Knowledge above) about global warming (see Appendix Table A1). Responses to these questions were summed into a scale called Global Warming IQ. The scale ranged from 0 to 3, indicating the correct number of responses to the global warming science questions. Controlling for predispositions, greater understanding of the science of global warming should produce greater information clarity and potentially more concern for the issue.            "
"49","Second, we asked respondents to describe how clearly they thought scientists understand global warming. Authoritative information should crystallize an individual's interpretation of a condition. As the individual becomes more trusting of the science of global warming, there should be less of a tendency to rely on cues and predispositions. This question was a scale called Science Unclear. The scale ranged from very clear understanding (1) to very unclear understanding (4). Controlling for partisanship and ideology, as individuals said that scientists have a clear understanding of global warming, we expect them to be more concerned about this issue."
"50","Third, we asked a pair of questions relating to an individual's personal experience with and attentiveness to global warming. If individuals process information based on personal experience, then there should be less reliance on cues and predispositions. Additionally, individuals attentive to an issue should possess more and clearer information about the issue. Thus, we asked respondents to react to the following statements. “My life is directly affected by Global Warming and Climate Change.” And, “I often stop and think about Global Warming and Climate Change.” These variables were labeled respectively Personal Experience and Attention. Both questions were a scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. Controlling for partisanship and ideology, both Personal Experience and Attention should produce greater concern by respondents."
"51","A final issue‐specific factor that should affect people's assessments of global warming is their participation in social networks attentive to the issue. As individuals perceive those in their social network to be concerned, then they should be more concerned about global warming. We attempted to get at this effect by asking respondents how concerned people in their social network are about global warming and climate change. The responses were a scale ranging from not concerned at all (0) to extremely concerned (10). This variable was called Social Network Concerned."
"52","We regressed the level of concern for global warming on the issue‐specific variables discussed above. We also included all of the earlier independent variables in the model as a baseline against which to test effects from these issue‐specific variables. Note that the dependent variables in these regressions were the same as those reported in the last columns of Tables 1 and 2. We report only the results for the issue‐specific variables to conserve space and avoid repetition. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 contain the results.            "
"53","Global Warming IQ had a positive and statistically significant effect on people's level of concern. As people become more informed about the science of global warming, they become more concerned about the issue. Knowledge and information about a condition clearly alter people's judgments beyond their innate predispositions."
"54","Confirming this effect, the response to Science Unclear is also statistically significant in both equations. The negative coefficient signifies that when people thinkscientists don't have a very clear understanding of global warming, then they become less concerned about the issue. The implication is that the clarity of the information environment is an important factor in people's interpretation of issues. We shall explore the importance of information to the issue‐definition process further below in the embedded experiments."
"55","Personal Experience and Attention are both positive and statistically significant in both analyses. The more personal the experience, the more concerned they are about the issue. And, the more attentive the individual, the more concerned they become. Thus, information from personal experience and attention make people more likely to assess an issue as serious."
"56","Finally, Social Network Concerned is positive and near statistically significant for the first equation, but nonsignificant for the second equation. This result is suggestive, but ambiguous concerning how people respond to social pressures. Again, we shall explore the effect of social pressures on individual assessments of objective conditions below in the embedded experiments."
"57","At the end of the survey, we included two experiments to gauge the effect of introducing new information on people's assessments of global warming. These experiments are intended to evaluate the third proposition above that an information signal of sufficient strength or character can produce punctuations in individual‐issue definitions, regardless of the cues and predispositions working on individual assessments."
"58","Past research (Huckfeld and Sprague 1995; Kuran 1989, 1991, 1995; Lohman 1994; Mutz 1998; Noelle‐Neumann 1984; Wood and Doan 2003) has suggested that feedback from a prevailing social interpretation may cause individuals to conform to an evaluation that is out of sync with their true evaluations for substantial periods. However, perceptions by individuals that the prevailing social interpretation is different than they had thought, or changing, can lead to bandwagon effects and sudden shifts across the entire system. While this hypothesis has been put forward in aggregate‐level studies, it is an individual‐level phenomenon that has not been examined with individual‐level data.            "
"59","To evaluate the extent to which individuals respond to information that they are out of sync with the prevailing social interpretation, we split the sample into three parts. Individuals in each subset of the sample were presented the following scenarios."
"60","                              "
"61","Now, suppose that I told you that the percentage of Americans viewing global warming as a very serious problem is now around [40%/60%/80%]. Using a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no concern and 10 representing extreme concern, how concerned would you be about global warming if you were told that [40%/60%/80%] of Americans view Global Warming as a serious problem?"
"62","Percentages in brackets were randomly assigned to each one‐third of the sample. In other words, different subsets of the sample were asked to evaluate global warming under a perception that a minority of Americans felt the condition is very serious, a majority felt it is very serious, and a supermajority felt it is very serious."
"63","If the prevailing social interpretation is important to individual evaluations, then we should see systematic differences across the subgroups in their level of concern for global warming. Furthermore, people's evaluations should change with respect to their responses to the similar question in the early part of the survey. Note that people's responses in the first part of the survey about their level of concern for global warming now serve as a pretest control for the effect of the treatments. Early in the survey, respondents had no idea they would be questioned later about global warming. Furthermore, the earlier question was nested in a general framework in which respondents were asked about their level of concern for 13 different issues."
"64","Results from this embedded experiment are reported in the first two columns of Table 4. The average level of concern for global warming in the pretest responses was 6.25 on a 10‐point scale, while the average level of concern associated with responses to the question above was 6.10. The t‐test for different pretest/post‐test means is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Thus, the average level of concern by respondents was about the same or slightly lower than that registered in the early part of the survey.6"
"65","However, there were significant differences across groups in response to the different treatments. We regressed people's post‐test level of concern on indicators for the different treatment groups. The coefficient for the Constant in the first column of Table 4 represents the response of the group receiving the 40% treatment. Their average level of concern for global warming was significantly below the sample mean at 5.76 on a 10‐point scale (p‐value = 0.04). Thus, those perceiving that only a minority of Americans viewed global warming as a serious problem softened their interpretation of the condition relative to the average pretest response.            "
"66","The Medium Treatment group was more concerned about global warming than the 40% group by about 0.44. This change was near statistical significance with p‐value 0.056. The average level of concern by the Medium Treatment group was 6.20 (5.76 + 0.44 = 6.20) on a 10‐point scale. Thus, the group receiving the 60% treatment was about as concerned about global warming as the average initial responder early in the survey."
"67","The High Treatment group was more concerned about global warming than the 40% group by about 0.58. This change was statistically significant with p‐value 0.014. The average level of concern by the High Treatment group was 6.34 on a 10‐point scale and slightly higher than the pretest mean. Thus, those perceiving that a supermajority viewed global warming as a serious problem altered their interpretation of the condition significantly relative to the 40% group and somewhat with respect to the average pretest response."
"68","We can also directly assess pretest/post‐test differences of individuals by including their initial responses early in the survey in the regression analysis. The regression in the second column of Table 4 includes each individual's initial level of concern about global warming in the first phase of the survey. An advantage of this approach is that it also serves as a check on randomization. If the results in the first column were due to randomization failure and chance instead of the treatments, then the treatment indicators would be nonsignificant with the pretest responses included in the equation. The results in Table 4 show that responses were due to the treatments and even larger than those indicated in the first column. Controlling for their initial responses, the Medium Treatment group was more concerned than the 40% group by about 0.56, and the High Treatment group was more concerned than the 40% group by about 0.68. Both effects are highly significant with p‐value less than 0.01. Thus, the social forces experiment shows unequivocally that individuals can be strongly affected in their issue assessments by information showing they are out of sync with the prevailing social interpretation.

"69","Do individuals significantly alter their interpretation of issues based on new information about the issue? The second embedded experiment addressed this question. Note that this experiment came after the social forces experiment and all other questions on global warming. This sequencing is intended to avoid contamination to prior questions."
"70","We split the sample into two parts. Individuals in each part of the sample were presented the following scenarios."
"71","                              "
"72","Now, suppose I told you that the scientific research community has produced definite evidence that over the next 100 years the earth's temperature will rise by [2 degrees/5 degrees] Fahrenheit, polar ice caps will recede and sea levels will rise by as much as [6 inches/1 foot], storms will become more frequent, and sun protection will be a requirement for outdoor activities. Using a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no concern at all and 10 representing extreme concern, how concerned would you be about global warming if scientists released this information?"
"73","The alternatives in brackets were randomly assigned to each half of the sample. The alternative scenarios of 2 degrees temperature and 6 inches sea level rise versus 5 degrees temperature and 1 foot sea level rise were based on scientific assessments of well‐known climate scientists."
"74","Note also that the question above contains more information than the two scenarios. Respondents in both groups were told of definite evidence of temperature and sea level rise, polar ice caps melting, increasing storms, and the need for sun protection over the next 100 years. Therefore, it is also important to distinguish between differences in responses from the pretest to the post‐test, and not just the two treatment groups.            "
"75","We regressed people's post‐test level of concern for global warming on indicators for the two treatment groups. The coefficient for the Constant in the third column of Table 4 represents the response of the group receiving the 2 degrees temperature/6 inches sea level rise treatment. Their average level of concern for global warming was 7.14 on a 10‐point scale. This was not significantly different from the post‐test sample mean of 7.23. The High Treatment group increased their level of concern for global warming by only 0.15 over the base. Again, this change was not statistically significant and little different from the sample mean. The regression reported in the fourth column of Table 4 repeated the analysis using the pretest response as a control variable. The results from both regressions show definitively that people in the separate groups did not respond differently to different information sets about global warming.            "
"76","However, it is revealing that there was a large difference between the pretest and post‐test means of the respondents' levels of concern. The prior experiment showed no statistically significant difference in pretest and post‐test means for people's level of concern for global warming. However, the second experiment registered a large statistically significant change. The average level of concern for global warming in the pretest responses was 6.25, while the average level of concern following the introduction of new information was 7.23. This is almost a point higher on a 10‐point scale and strongly significant. These results suggest a very large response by respondents to the new information provided in the questions. Obviously, presenting respondents with definite scientific evidence about temperature and sea level rise, polar ice caps melting, increasing storms, and the need for sun protection altered their mental image of global warming. This altered mental image in turn significantly changed respondents' interpretation of the issue of global warming.            "
"77","Past theory and research on issue definition have used macrolevel theories of how issues come to be defined as public problems and ultimately achieve agenda status. However, this study of issue definition at the individual level suggests that macrolevel theories can benefit from considering microlevel perspectives. Past theory has described the temporal stability that characterizes most issues, as well as the periodic punctuations that occur through time for some issues. However, macrolevel theories have not adequately explained these characteristics of the issue‐definition process.         "
"78","We theorize that the nature of information processing by individuals can explain both the temporal stability and periodic punctuations that occur through time in individual‐ and system‐level issue definition. Information abounds within policy systems for most issues. However, all information also has a range of ambiguity. Individuals generally lack the cognitive skill, time, resources, and will to capture, assimilate, and interpret all information and its relative certainty. As a result, they rely on cues and predispositions in forming judgments about policy issues. Individuals process information through a filter that depends on values, ideology, background, social forces, and the continuing intrusion of new signals from the information environment. Since systemwide issue definition is a type of aggregation of individual‐issue definitions, these microlevel factors lead both individual and systemwide issue definition toward stability. However, the introduction of an information signal of appropriate strength or character can upset the path‐dependent process to produce punctuations in individual and systemwide definitions of issues."
"79","We applied our theory in developing a model that linked information signal strength, information certainty, and individual characteristics to issue emergence. Using a survey and two embedded experiments, we evaluated two aspects of the issue‐definition process: the role of people's assessments of problem severity and individuals' background characteristics in identifying the important issues facing the nation and world. Analysis of the survey confirms that individuals rely significantly on cues and predispositions in forming their judgments across multiple issues. Political, economic, and social differences across individuals covary systematically with how they define such issues as terrorism, the state of the economy, health care, poverty, and global warming. Focusing specifically on global warming, we also showed that individuals' knowledge and information certainty affect their propensity to evaluate a condition as serious. As information becomes more certain, people become more definitive in their judgments."
"80","We then tested the social networks aspect of the model. Using two embedded experiments, we also illustrated the mechanics of punctuations in issue definition at the individual level. The results of the embedded experiments show that when individuals perceive their own definition of an issue to be out of sync with that of the community, a reaction occurs. They uniformly move in the direction of the social forces surrounding the issue. Additionally, presenting survey respondents with definitive evidence about temperature and sea level rise, polar ice caps melting, increasing storms, and the need for sun protection significantly altered their assessment of the severity of the condition."
"81","Using both a broad focus on multiple issues and a specific focus on a single issue, this study has moved toward a better understanding of the issue‐definition process for individuals. Such understanding is crucial for developing better theories and knowledge of agenda setting generally. Issue definition is the initial phase of the agenda‐setting process and a necessary condition for agenda entry. Moreover, in a democratic society understanding how individuals behave is an important requisite for understanding how the system behaves. Thus, understanding individual interpretations of the myriad issues that continuously impinge on the system is an important precursor to understanding what may be on the public agenda in the future."
