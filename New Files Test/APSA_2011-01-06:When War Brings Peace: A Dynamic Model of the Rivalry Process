"1","Studies of rivalry traditionally fall within two broad camps based upon the focus of the analysis. The first set explains rivalry behavior based upon exogenous (structural) factors to the rivalry, while the second group focuses on endogenous change. The dominant structural model of rivalry is the Punctuated Equilibrium (PE) Model (Diehl and Goertz 2000). The PE Model is based on the assumption that dyadic relations are struck by political shocks (e.g., civil war) that alter the relationship between two states. Once hit by a shock, states quickly move into a rivalry. Once formed, rivalries are resilient, requiring another shock to displace it. However, shocks will not always cause termination; instead, political shocks only create the opportunity for peace. The PE Model only claims shocks can alter dyadic relations by altering the environment; exactly how these changes alter behavior is not specified.         "
"2","In contrast to exogenous approaches, evolutionary models view rivalries as driven by state interactions and focus on the behavior of the dyad members. According to evolutionary models, rivalries are not born: they are slowly created. The first endogenous theory focuses upon the accumulation of a history of hostility and the outcomes of interactions between states (Hensel 1999). As states begin to view each other with more hostility, the rivalry deepens, making future conflict more likely. Feelings of hostility grow as more conflicts occur, creating a feedback loop that drives the evolution of the rivalry. Along with dyadic history, Hensel (1999) also argues that if a conflict ends in a compromise, the dyad is less likely to grow more hostile compared to a stalemate. While Hensel (1999) includes dispute severity in his discussion, the primary focus of the theory is on dispute outcomes and not the influence of the conflicts directly.         "
"3","Instead of focusing on conflict outcomes, Maoz and Mor (2002) argue that rivalry behavior is driven by a combination of state preferences and capabilities. A rivalry will continue if a state is unsatisfied with the status quo and has the capability to change it. Based upon the combination of preferences and capabilities, states in a dyad will face a different strategic environment. The rivalry evolves over time as past outcomes accumulate and the dyadic history alters the strategic interaction between states (shifting from conflictual to cooperative games).         "
"4","The CAR Model builds upon past efforts by modeling the long‐term dyadic relationship. Instead of focusing on the strategic choice facing state leaders, the CAR Model seeks to capture the environment within which states and their leaders interact and how the trajectory of the relationship changes based on state actions. Second, the CAR Model incorporates the multidimensional relationship between rivalry, dyadic conflict, and domestic politics. Instead of focusing on one relationship (e.g., rivalry and domestic politics), the model incorporates the multiple, and sometimes contradictory, relationships between all three components. By including these three parts, the CAR Model provides a detailed picture of the rivalry relationship."
"5","In order to represent the relationship between the rivalry components, I construct a dynamic model of rivalry. The dynamic modeling approach is ideal for the goals of this research. First, dynamic models are designed to capture relationships over time, a key part of rivalry research. Second, “dynamic models can nicely combine different pieces of information together to form a more complete story” (Kadera and Morey 2008, 154). One of the goals of this research is to create a synergy between different studies, which have separated the conflict‐rivalry and rivalry‐domestic politics aspects of the research agenda. Employing a dynamic model allows me to aggregate these many relationships to demonstrate how rivalry, dyadic conflict, and domestic political change are interconnected. Instead of focusing on a subplot, I attempt to link many rivalry subplots together in order to tell a new and more detailed story.         "
"6","Consistent with the dyadic feature of rivalry, the model begins with two states, x and y. First, the variable H captures the hostility history in the dyad.1 The central component of rivalry research is the idea that history matters (Diehl and Goertz 2000; Thompson 2001). When forming foreign policy, states do not base their decisions solely on current events. Instead, state actions are partially determined by the long‐term relationship with another state. H captures this effect and represents the sense of grievance (Richardson 1960) that two states have toward each other. A positive value ofHmeans states share hostile feelings and view one another as rivals. As H increases, feelings of hostility intensify. Negative values of H imply friendship.         "
"7","Conflict between two states generates grievances and animosity: the heart of rivalry. In order to model this sense of grievance, I assume that the accumulation of past actions defines a dyad's history (Crescenzi and Enterline 2001). Intuitively, acts of violence increase feelings of hostility as they impose financial and human costs. Thus, as conflict increases, so should H. Cooperation, on the other hand, reduces animosity and builds feelings of friendship. The equation for H captures this dynamic by incorporating the level of conflict, C, for each state.            "
"8","The second component of the model is C, which is the level of conflict directed by the actor toward the target. I construct C as a variable, allowing it to fluctuate over time. While rivalries are highly conflictual, conflict is not constant over the entire span of the rivalry. Unlike H, the value of C can vary between states, so I model the value of Cx and Cy separately.         "
"9","Building on past research (Kadera 2001), I design the conflict equations so they can fluctuate between high or low levels of conflict and cooperation. Positive values of Cx and Cy represent conflict, while negative values signify cooperation. The construction of the conflict equation assumes that the level of conflict a state targets at another is driven by three factors: the dyad's history, the behavior of the other state, and public opinion. As a dyad's history is marked by increasing levels of violence, it will drive a state to be more conflictual. Further, a state will respond to acts of violence from a rival with even more violence. Finally, the more internal support there is for conflict, the more violent a state will become; however, a lack of public support will limit the actions a state takes. The construction of the conflict equation for each state follows the same basic logic, so the discussion below only details the equation for state x.             "
"10","α, β, and σ are positive parameters and Sx is the level of public support for conflict in state x (discussed below). Since the focus of this article is on dyadic conflict and rivalry termination, I discuss the model assuming all of the variables are equal to or greater than zero. The first component, αH, portrays changes in x's conflict behavior as a function of dyadic hostility. In other words, the history of the dyad helps determine the current behavior of the members (Hensel 2001). As H increases, the rate of change in Cx will increase. If H is positive, the change in Cx will be in the direction of more conflict; however, if H is negative, αH will act as a restraint.         "
"11","States do not react solely to feelings of grievance; they also respond to the actions of the other state. Specifically, violence begets violence (Hensel 1999, 2001; Kadera 2001; Richardson 1960). The second portion of equation (2), βCy, incorporates the current level of conflict from state y. As state y becomes more conflictual (Cy increases), the rate of change in conflict for state x will increase. If state y is cooperative, this will reduce the level of conflict.         "
"12","Finally, domestic political support also influences conflict levels. The final piece of equation (2) incorporates domestic politics through the support term σCxSx. If the selectorate opposes conflict (Sx < 0) and state x is currently acting conflictually, the support term decreases the state's conflictual activity. If the state's domestic political environment supports conflict (Sx > 0) and there are already conflictual policies in place, the state becomes more conflictual than historical grievances and current provocations would suggest.         "
"13","The final component, S, represents the domestic attitude regarding conflict. A positive S represents support for conflict (hawkish), while negative values indicate dovish states. Sx and Sy vary in magnitude, with small positive values meaning moderate support. While there are many forces that influence public opinion, the model incorporates two aspects relevant for rivalry. First, when the population feels threatened by another state and that state acts aggressively, public support for conflict will increase. People will support actions to deal with the threat. The greater the threat and the more hostile the state acts, the greater the level of public support. However, as a country experiences the cost of conflict, support will decline. The equation for Support (S) captures both of these dynamics.         "
"14","The first force acting on S is the behavior of the other state. Conflict, under the right conditions, rallies public support for a state's foreign policy (Stein 1980). The first part of equation (3) captures this rally effect as a function of state y's conflict and the dyad's hostility history. Past research (Mitchell and Prins 2004) finds that a rally only occurs when citizens feel threatened; here H captures this feeling of danger.             "
"15","Conflict, however, does not have a one‐way relationship with support. As costs increase, public support drops (Gartner and Segura 1998). The second piece of equation (3), ν(Cx + Cy), adds the deflationary effect of conflict costs. I model the costs as the sum of the conflict state y targets at state x and the conflict x targets at y. The costs for actions by state y are easily understandable as destruction of life and property. However, x's level of conflict also imposes costs on x, particularly economic and social costs. Conflict forces states to redirect investment from economically and socially beneficial projects to military preparedness (Goertz, Jones, and Diehl 2005). Thus, equation (3) captures the cost imposed by state y and the price of preparing to fight.         "
"16","With the construction of the model complete, this section explores the complex relationship between dyadic conflict and rivalry termination. In order to study the model's implications I conduct 60 numerical simulations, with each simulation employing randomly generated initial conditions for each of the five variables (H, Cx, Cy, Sx, Sy).3 The simulation process demonstrates how the variables interact by calculating all past and future values from an initial starting point (t = 0) for the system of equations.         "
"17","After calculating the values for each set of initial conditions, I plot the results. The plots map the trajectory, or movement over time, of the variables. Once all of the simulations are complete I sort them into groups based on patterns of behavior. By comparing across the groups, general relationships in the behavior of the equations emerge. Seeing the same pattern leading to the same outcome across simulations allows a cause and effect relationship to be hypothesized."
"18","Figure 1 provides an example of the simulation process. Figure 1 (left) shows the fluctuation in the conflict levels (Cx and Cy) and joint hostility (H) over the simulation. The change is support (Sx and Sy) is graphed on the right. This represents one complete simulation. In this simulation a rivalry is ongoing, H is positive, and the dyad experiences conflict (Cx and Cy rising sharply) around t = 0.4 After the conflict, the rivalry continues as H remains positive.5 The spike in conflict causes support in each state to drop sharply; however, once the conflict ends, support slowly rebuilds. While conflict costs had the expected effect of reducing support, it only produced a short‐term decrease; it was unable to permanently alter support for conflict.         "
"19","                Example Simulation Output"
"20","From the 60 simulations we learn that conflict can cause rivalry termination; however, the relationship is complex.6 The impact of dyadic conflict on the future of the rivalry is conditional upon the characteristics of the individual conflict. The more concentrated (rate of cost accumulation) (Levy 1983) a conflict is, the more likely a rivalry is to terminate.            "
"21","To demonstrate the relationship between conflict and rivalry, Figure 2 plots the results from two simulations. These simulations serve as ideal types for demonstrating the behavior of the model; the rivalry in simulation A continues after the conflict, while in simulation B the rivalry terminates. Why is this the case? In short, low‐concentration conflicts do not affect domestic support to the same level as high‐concentration conflicts, allowing rivalries to continue.            "
"22","                Conflict and Rivalry Termination"
"23","To demonstrate how conflict can lead to termination I construct three plots for each simulation. The first plot shows the levels for Cx, Cy, and H while the second plot graphs the support for conflict (Sx and Sy). In simulation A the dyad experiences a conflict shortly after t = 0 (Cx and Cy both increase) and then hostility (H) increases after the conflict. Support for conflict (Sx and Sy) drops quickly in each state but begins to rebuild. In simulation B there is a similar pattern, a sharp conflict around t = 0 and rapid drop in support. However, in simulation B public support remains negative (against conflict) and H declines to zero.7 In short, in simulation A the round of conflict leads to a deepening of the rivalry while in simulation B the conflict leads to rivalry termination. The question is why one rivalry ends while the other continues. This is even more puzzling since we can see from the plots in the first column of each simulation that the total conflict magnitude (Cx + Cy) and the maximum conflict level (max Cx, Cy) is greater in the case of the rivalry that did not terminate. The size of the war on its own is not the key.            "
"24","In order to distinguish the two cases, I add a third plot. The third column in Figure 2 plots the rate of change in conflict for each state ( and ). In this case, high positive values represent a fast rise in conflict, while large negative values correspond to a sharp drop in conflictualness. The larger the overall swing, high positive and low negative values, the faster a state moved to maximum violence and then back. This captures not only how violent a conflict becomes but also how long it takes, or the concentration of violence. Slow‐building conflicts (Vietnam) or ones that endure for a long time (Iran‐Iraq) have lower rates of change, while short and violent conflicts (Gulf War) score higher.            "
"25","In simulation A, state x has a very high rate of change (moving from 400 to almost −500), while state y is more moderate (200 to −200). In simulation B, both state x and y experience high rates of change in conflict (about 300 to −300 for each). In simulation B both states quickly become very aggressive, while in simulation A state y is more moderate in its behavior, rising to maximum conflict levels much slower (smaller value of ). Thus, the fighting is spread over a shorter time in simulation B as both states quickly move to maximum conflict and therefore each state feels the pain of fighting quickly. The conflict in simulation B is very concentrated, while the fighting in simulation A is more dispersed over time.            "
"26","The disparity in concentration levels has a different impact upon public support. In both of the simulations, state x and state y suffer a drop in support. However, in simulation A, state y does not experience as deep a drop as support only turns moderately negative. This smaller drop has important implications. First, facing only moderate opposition to conflict, a state is able to maintain higher conflict levels than it would if it faced stronger opposition (equation 2). Second, while the immediate fighting is over, the rivalry has not abated. The feelings of hostility are still strong and increase the level of conflict between the two states. If public opposition is not strong enough to overcome the rivalry stimulus, the dyad will experience another round of conflict, which maintains the sense of hostility in the dyad (equation 1). With time the rivalry rebuilds in intensity, often surpassing the previous hostility and conflict levels.            "
"27","In Figure 2 we see two different scenarios played out. In simulation A, support in y does not drop low enough to overcome the rivalry history. Support in both states starts to slowly rebuild and the dyad suffers another conflict after a brief pause in fighting.8 In simulation B, where the concentration of conflict drove both support levels down significantly, strong opposition to fighting shields both states from the influence of the rivalry. With neither state targeting the other, the rivalry terminates as past conflicts fade and no new disputes emerge to maintain the grievances between the states. Only when both states lack the desire to continue fighting does the relationship have the time necessary to allow hostility to decline.            "
"28","These results demonstrate what is evident when all the simulations were examined together; in order for conflict to lead to termination, both participants must experience a high level of concentration. The simulations show that a long period without conflict is necessary for a rivalry to terminate. The absence of conflict allows past grievances to slip from memory. The strong opposition in both states, caused by concentrated conflicts, keeps each side from conducting military operations. If, however, strong opposition to conflict is lacking in either rival, the rivalry will rebuild; thus, each state must experience a highly concentrated conflict for a rivalry to achieve termination. It is the state least affected by a conflict which determines what impact a war will have on the future of a rivalry. This leads to the following hypothesis:            "
"29","               "
"30","H1: As the lowest level of concentration from conflict increases, the probability of rivalry termination increases.                     "
"31","The simulations of the CAR Model demonstrate the complex relationship between dyadic conflicts and rivalry termination. Highly concentrated conflicts reduce support for future fighting. If the effects of conflict are too spread out, support will not drop enough, as the horrors of war do not permanently turn people toward peace. The cost of fighting must overcome the pull of past hatred in order to lead to peace."
"32","The dependent variable in this study is rivalry termination. In order to measure rivalry, I adopt the modified version of the conflict density approach, which incorporates issues as well as temporal proximity to determine when a rivalry exists (see Klein, Goertz, and Diehl 2006). Rivalry termination occurs when a dyad surpasses 10–15 years without a dispute. This rivalry definition leaves open the possibility that two states could stop fighting without solving the root issue that caused the rivalry (Bennett 1997). Thus, there could be a weak peace where tension remains but military conflict is avoided. This is an important distinction that should be kept in mind when reading the results reported below. While the lack of issue settlement is a weakness, these cases do pose a challenging test for the theory. If the concentration of conflict is positively associated with the cessation of active military conflict while the original issue remains unsettled, it means that high‐concentration conflicts can bring peace, absence of active conflict, even when the original stimulus for competition is still present. In these cases, concentrated fights would be overcoming the hostility developed during the rivalry and the continued motivation for fighting from the unsettled issue. Applying this definition, a total of 1,205 rivalries are identified, 915 isolated and 290 full rivalries (Klein, Goertz, and Diehl 2006, 340).         "
"33","Using these data, Terminate is coded 0 for every year a rivalry is ongoing and 1 the year the rivalry ends. I code the rivalry as terminated in the year of the last dispute, assuming the number of years has passed without another conflict. Cases where no conflict has occurred but the minimum number of years has not passed are censored observations. The risk set includes only those dyads that are experiencing an ongoing rivalry.         "
"34","The primary independent variable in this study is Concentration. A measure of concentration should distinguish between long conflicts with low costs and short conflicts with high costs. Ideally, weekly or monthly fatalities figures would be available. With these data one could calculate the rate of change. However, such data exist only for a small sample of conflicts, pointing to the need for a different measure of Concentration. In order to develop a broad measure of the concentration of fighting, I follow work by Levy (1983) and Morey (2009) in creating Concentration by dividing the total number of battle deaths by conflict duration. Battle deaths provide a proxy for the overall level of violence in a conflict, and dividing by the length of the fighting controls for how quickly fatalities accumulate. While not a perfect replication of the first derivative, this procedure forms a strong proxy for the theoretical deduction from the model and is replicable for all conflicts. Data for Concentration are drawn from Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2006). The simulations show that the lowest concentration between dyad members is the key to termination. To capture this, I first calculate the concentration of a conflict for both states. However, the variable Concentration takes the value of the lowest level experienced in the dyad. In years where there are no fatalities, Concentration is 0.         "
"35","To thoroughly test the deduction, I control for a series of variables associated with competing explanations of rivalry termination found in the literature (Kadera and Mitchell 2005; Ray 2003). First, I included two variables, World War I and World War II, to control for systemic shifts that can lead to rivalry termination (Diehl and Goertz 2000). Both variables take on a value of 1 for the 10 years following the respective war. It is expected that rivalries should be more likely to terminate following a global war.         "
"36","As the level of hostility in a rivalry increases, the feelings of animosity should make termination more difficult. To control for this I include the variable Hostility, which is measured using Crescenzi and Enterline's (2001) International Interaction Score (IIS). IIS measures the relationship between states using past dyadic interactions. Also, territorial conflicts are seen as more dangerous than disputes over other issues and should decrease the probability of termination (Bennett 1998). I include the variable Territory, coded 1 if a dyad experiences a territorial dispute, as defined in the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data.         "
"37","Hensel (1999) finds that how conflicts end helps determine future behavior. Conflicts ending in stalemates are more likely to cause future conflict. To control for this, Stalemate is coded 1 when conflicts end without any clear victor according to the MID data. Conflicts ending in settlements reduce rivalry pressure, since both sides have some minimal level of cooperation. However, negotiated or imposed settlements could have different effects. I code two variables from the MID data to capture these relationships. First, Imposed is scored 1 if a conflict ends with one side compelling an agreement. Second, Negotiated is labeled 1 if diplomatic negotiations produce an agreement.         "
"38","Widespread evidence exists regarding the pacifying effect of joint democracy. To determine if a dyad is democratic, I use the Polity IV (Marshall and Jaggers 2000) dataset and code Joint Democracy 1 if both states are greater than 6 on the polity score.         "
"39","Thompson (2001) argues that if one state possesses a power advantage, the weaker state cannot pose a threat. To measure the influence of the balance of power, I include Power Ratio. To calculate the amount of power each state possesses, I use the Correlates of War National Material Capabilities (v 3.02) dataset. To construct Power Ratio, I divide the score of the weaker state by the stronger; as Power Ratio nears 1, dyad members are nearly equal in strength.         "
"40","Greater distance between states reduces the probability that goals would overlap enough to continue a rivalry. To control for these factors, I include the variable Distance, measuring the miles between state capitals (in thousands); contiguous cases are coded as 0. Finally, to control for the differences between major and minor powers, I include the variable Major Powers, coded 1 when both dyad members are major powers (Singer and Small 1972).         "
"41","Since I can only measure rivalry termination within discrete intervals, years, I employ a discrete‐time event history model. This approach allows me to model the hazard of an event occurring conditional upon the covariates and the continued survival of the rivalry (Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 2004, 73). Specifically, I employ a Logit Model.9 To control for temporal dynamics I add two variables, Rivalry Years and Rivalry Years2 (Carter and Signorino 2007). Rivalry Years measures the number of years since the rivalry began; Rivalry Years2 is the number of years since the rivalry started squared. All errors are clustered by rivalry.         "
"42","The results in Table 1 provide strong evidence that concentrated conflicts lead to rivalry termination (H1). The first column includes all rivalries while the second column excludes isolated rivalries. Finally, column 3 excludes rivalries with the five most concentrated conflicts to ensure the results presented are not the function of a few extreme cases.10 Looking at Table 1, Concentration is positive and significant in all models. As the concentration of conflict rises, the probability of rivalry termination increases. Moving Concentration from its minimum to maximum value increases the odds of rivalry termination by 91%, controlling for the influence of the other variables (using the results in column 1). This is a large shift in the likelihood of termination and is comparable in magnitude to the effect of the Second World War.         "
"43","To provide a more nuanced view of the effect of concentrated conflict on rivalry behavior, Figure 3 plots the probability of termination for various values of Concentration.11 The dashed line represents the predicted probability for varying levels of concentration while holding all other variables at their mean or modal values. The solid lines represent the 95% confidence interval. When Concentration is 0, the probability of termination is near 0 (≈ .035). When Concentration reaches 300, the probability of termination has grown to 20% and steadily increases. To provide perspective, I have included the location of four conflicts according to the level of concentration. Not surprisingly, dyadic fighting associated with world wars produces two high‐concentration cases. But not all conflicts lead to high concentration; the Soccer War and the Franco‐Prussian War both generate low concentrations. Unsurprisingly, neither the Soccer War nor the Franco‐Prussian War led to rivalry termination.         "
"44","                Concentration and the Probability of Rivalry Termination                      "
"45","Note: Cases provide examples of where select conflicts fall on the measure of Concentration. Predicted probability of termination may differ based on the value of other variables.                     "
"46","Looking at the other variables in the model, there are few surprises; most of the variables perform as theory would lead us to expect. Rivalries between major powers last longer, while rivalries between democracies are generally shorter. Conflicts over territory are likely to lead to longer rivalries, and as a dyad approaches power parity termination becomes less likely."
"47","The results also provide evidence that increased hostility levels make rivalries harder to end; however, the finding is not robust across samples. With all rivalries included and when outliers are excluded, Hostility is negative and significant. However, when isolated rivalries are excluded, Hostility becomes insignificant (and positive). It may be the case that the negative effect of joint hostility has an upper bound, beyond which the effect of increasing hostility does not influence state behavior. It may also be the case that since the sample in Model 2 is made up of the most conflictual rivalries that they have found ways to insulate themselves from declines in the hostility level, allowing the rivalry to continue.12"
"48","The findings in Table 1 provide support for the PE Model (Diehl and Goertz 2000), but only mixed support for the Evolutionary Model (Hensel 1999). Regardless of specification, major systemic shocks increase the probability of termination. In fact, the shock associated with World War II has one of the largest substantive effects, increasing the odds of termination by 63%. Consistent with the Evolutionary Model, negotiated settlements are positively related with terminating rivalries. However, imposed settlements and stalemate outcomes are also associated with termination. It may be the case that the effects of stalemates and imposed settlements change once a rivalry is underway, increasing tension in nonrivalry dyads while working to remove support for fighting once a rivalry has formed.         "
"49","These results provide substantial support for the CAR Model. As the concentration in conflict increases, a rivalry weakens, creating an opportunity for states to escape their conflictual past. Conflict can have a substantial influence on rivalries ending, under the right conditions."
"50","To demonstrate the varying impact of the concentration of conflict on rivalry behavior, this section examines a single rivalry. This detailed examination allows a focus on the behavior of the rival states that is not possible in a large‐N analysis. For this investigation I have selected the second Greco‐Turkish rivalry (1866–1925), which is an important case because the ethnic/religious differences and the conflicting territorial ambitions of the two states make it a hard case to explain: given that neither of these points of contention change, why did the rivalry terminate? It is also an ideal case because Greece and Turkey engaged in multiple disputes during the rivalry. Overall, the rivalry follows the predictions of the CAR Model."
"51","The first major engagement of the rivalry is the First Greco‐Turkish War (1897), nominally fought over the treatment of Christians within Turkey. However, a series of disputes concerning Turkish rule over Crete dominated relations prior to the war (Woodhouse 1986). Greece launches one attack against Turkey directly and another against Crete. The offensive into Turkey is a disaster, and fighting on Crete is halted when the major European powers occupy the island. A defeated Greece is forced to cede land to Turkey and pay an indemnity. The war is short but produces a low concentration of conflict (3.52), as casualties were light.         "
"52","Following the war, public support within Greece declines and King George I is almost forced from power despite his prewar popularity (Clogg 1979). Despite battlefield failures and stern peace terms, public opinion did not turn against conflict with Turkey for long. After the war a period of calm forms, but Greece still sought territorial expansion and “below the surface emotions still seethed” (Woodhouse 1986, 186). The low concentration of fighting reduced support in the shortterm, but it was not enough to move the states toward peace.         "
"53","There is a pause in conflict postwar; however, pressure starts to rebuild as the nationalist Eleftherios Venizelos becomes prime minister of Greece in 1910 after a military uprising. Venizelos’s rise to power strengthens the hawkish party within Greece and sets the stage for future fighting. Realizing that Greece could not face Turkey alone, Venizelos helps create the Balkan League; Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria agreed to jointly fight Turkey."
"54","In 1912 the First Balkan War starts when the Balkan League attacks Turkey. The combined league armies gain quick success (Edib 1930), compelling the major powers to intervene to ensure the survival of Turkey, and after two months Turkey accepts an armistice. The armistice is short lived as the Turkish government is overthrown and fighting renews. However, Turkey fares no better and surrenders a second time. The allied intervention keeps the war short and while the fighting is more intense than in 1897, the concentration is still low (12.59).         "
"55","Venizelos’s popularity soars postwar as Greece nearly doubles its population from territorial gains (Clogg 1979). Despite these gains, Greece emerges still dissatisfied with its relationship versus Turkey (Woodhouse 1986, 192). Territorial ambitions played a role in the rivalry, but even impressive gains did not satisfy Greece. The war has a profound influence on Turkey as a nationalism separate from the Ottoman legacy forms. Turkey begins to westernize, especially militarily, as they begin to rebuild and prepare for future conflict (Edib 1930, 128). The prowar party came out of the war weakened but not destroyed and Turkey starts preparing for the next war. Similar to 1897, one state is temporally weakened and unable to quickly return to conflict, but neither state is permanently dissuaded from continuing the rivalry.         "
"56","Greco‐Turkish relations take a backseat to global events after the First Balkan War. While Greece and Turkey fight on opposite sides during the First World War, direct conflict is limited. The importance of the First World War is that it set the stage for the next dyadic war. The Second Greco‐Turkish War (1919–22) starts when Greece attempts to gain possession of Turkish territory promised to them by the western allies in the Treaty of Sevres. The war initially goes well for Greece, and they make deep inroads into Turkey. As the war continues, Turkish forces reorganize and reverse all Greek gains. The fighting in the Second Greco‐Turkish War is more intense, and both sides suffer badly (including attacks on civilians). Using conservative estimates the Second Greco‐Turkish War produces a concentration five times larger than the 1897 war; other estimates would lead to a concentration 20 times the first war.13"
"57","The Second Greco‐Turkish War has severe consequences. The war marked the end of the sultan legacy in Turkey and the rise of Kemal Ataturk, who ushers in broad reforms and moves to further westernize Turkey. In Greece the war serves to “administer both a profound physical as well as psychological shock” that has “profound repercussions on the domestic politics of Greece” (Clogg 1979, 118). While the war is ongoing, there is a military coup in Greece forcing King Constantine to abdicate and eight high‐ranking political and military leaders are removed. With these events the domestic environment within each state shifted drastically.         "
"58","Along with the profound domestic changes within each state comes a realization that the long‐term competition must end. To achieve peace Greece and Turkey agree to a population exchange, removing ethnic Greeks or Turks from the territories of the other state (Clogg 1979, 120). In essence, each state gives up historic claims to territory controlled by the other in order to remove a source for future conflict. This drastic step is only made possible by changes brought about within both Greece and Turkey by the concentrated costs associated with the Second Greco‐Turkish War. Absent these costs it would have been politically impossible for a leader in either state to propose a mass population swap. However, after the concentrated costs of the war each side is willing to make immense sacrifices to prevent future fighting.         "
"59","This brief discussion of the second Greco‐Turkish rivalry highlights patterns anticipated by the CAR Model. After low‐concentration conflicts, public support declines; however, this only dimmed the rivalry for a short time. Despite suffering devastating defeats and ceding territory over the course of the rivalry, neither state was deterred long term. This pattern changes after the Second Greco‐Turkish War, which brings about drastic domestic political changes in each state. The war itself did not solve any issues nor remove either state's ability to fight; instead, it created a desire in both parties for a lasting peace. With Greece and Turkey simultaneously feeling the shock of war, they were able to complete a peace agreement that would have been impossible without the domestic shift caused by the concentrated war. Consistent with the theoretical argument of this article, many conflicts in the Greek‐Turkish rivalry allow the competition to continue; however, once the concentration from the fighting increased, an opportunity for peace emerged. War can end rivalries, under the right conditions."
"60","This article was motivated by a desire to create a general model of the rivalry process. The model is unique in that it clearly connects the separate conflicts that form a rivalry. Instead of viewing the conflicts as isolated, the model demonstrates how dyadic engagements combine to form a different, and distinctively hostile, relationship. Rivalries may be hot hands, but they also develop hot tempers that alter the way states behave. Understanding these relationships is an important part of understanding patterns of international conflict."
"61","Deductions from the model help to solve an ongoing puzzle within rivalry research: can dyadic conflicts lead to the end of a rivalry? The answer is yes, if the fighting is concentrated enough to reduce domestic support for future conflict within both states. As the level of grievance rises, states become insulated as the general public is more willing to support conflictual foreign policies. Once this occurs, only a concentrated conflict will deflate public support enough to allow hostilities to permanently end. These findings were only made possible by integrating rivalry, domestic politics, and dyadic conflict into one model."
"62","The findings regarding the role of public support and the conflict concentration create connections with research on war costs and public opinion. Research has found that temporally and geographically diffuse costs and the ability to distribute the costs of fighting form insulative barriers that allow states to maintain hostilities since the negative effects of war are not felt uniformly (Gartner and Segura 1998; Gartner, Segura, and Wilkening 1997; Koch and Gartner 2005). However, a high‐concentration conflict would overcome these temporally distributive barriers. These studies suggest that a concentrated conflict creates a surge of casualties that would have dramatic negative influence on support for incumbent leaders and war policies. Thus, high concentration seems likely to overcome the main obstacles that keep war casualties from translating into a national desire for peace. The CAR Model also points to two new directions for research on public opinion and war. First, while recent works have found many domestic factors that insulate public opinion, there may be a need to focus on international variables, specifically the level of hostility. If there is a high level of animosity between a state and its adversary, this might allow a leader to frame casualties as an investment instead of an expenditure (Sullivan 2008), creating another barrier to the pacifying influence of casualties. Second, work should continue on how trends in casualties influence public opinion (Gartner 2008). While not the same, an increasing trend in casualties would be associated with an increase in conflict concentration. Who a state fights and how quickly costs accumulate could be important factors in understanding the influence of war on public opinion.         "
"63","Further, these results have interesting implications for research on mediation. First, within the mediation literature there is a persistent question of when international efforts should be made to help end conflicts. Regan and Stam (2000) find that mediation is most successful early in a conflict or late. However, the simulations from the model suggest that early mediation is only likely to be successful in situations where states do not share feelings of hostility. In cases with high animosity, public support for conflict is likely to be high, making it difficult for a leader to make any concessions. Thus, early mediation may only be a viable option in nonrivalry situations. Further, in cases with high feelings of hostility, it may be necessary to wait longer in order for conflict costs to erode public support enough to make conflict cessation possible. Thus, the model potentially supports Regan and Stam's (2000) finding and offers future direction for refining the issue of when to intervene.         "
"64","On the other hand, we also need to think about how mediating an individual conflict will influence the course of a rivalry. Can we call mediation a success if it halts one conflict but in the process sets the stage for several subsequent larger wars?Greig (2001) states that long‐term peace requires fundamental changes in how rivals behave, and one of the best indicators for success is whether mediation is initiated by one of the rivals. However, initiating mediation is often unlikely to occur given the risks to a leader's tenure (Colaresi 2004). Given these results, can mediation help resolve rivalries? As is the case with mediating an individual conflict, mediators need to choose the right time to intervene in a rivalry. If joint hostility is high and public support for continued fighting is strong, mediation and peacekeeping are unlikely to succeed. Even worse, as discussed in the Greco‐Turkish case, interventions may make true resolution more difficult by suppressing the level of a conflict and never allowing rivals to feel the full cost of their policies. But if international efforts are attempted after high‐concentration conflicts, the decline in support in both states will open a window for termination and long‐term peace. Following such a policy will call for discipline from the international community since it will mean foregoing involvement in many conflicts, despite the human costs, until they are ready for a lasting peace. However, with careful application of effort, the international community could successfully aid in terminating rivalries and truly help limit the level of international violence.         "
