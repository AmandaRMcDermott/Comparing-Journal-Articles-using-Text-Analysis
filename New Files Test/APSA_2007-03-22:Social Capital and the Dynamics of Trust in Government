"1","A substantial body of work has developed around the topic of trust in government. The literature begins in the 1970s as political scientists attempted to explain the first large decline in trust. Since trust reached a new nadir in the early 1990s, there has been a spate of new work. Given this work, what can we say causes trust to move over time?"
"2","The actions of political leaders and perceptions of government performance are most often identified as potential precursors to trust. Economic stewardship is typically identified as a leading cause of trust: when citizens are dissatisfied with economic performance, distrust of government ensues, but when prosperity abounds, so will trust (Chanley, Rudolph, and Rahn 2000; Citrin and Green 1986; Citrin and Luks 2001; Feldman 1983; Hetherington 1998; Lawrence 1997; Miller 1991). The actions of incumbent leaders and evaluations of government institutions are also thought to be critical to levels of trust. In particular, the actions of Congress and the president appear to have a formative influence on how trusting the public is of government (Chanley, Rudolph, and Rahn 2000; Citrin and Green 1986; Citrin and Luks 2001; Craig 1993; Erber and Lau 1990; Feldman 1983; Hetherington 1998; Miller 1991; Williams 1985). The actions of Congress and the president are crystallized in scandals, and the media focus on those scandals is seen as another contributor to national levels of trust (Chanley, Rudolph, and Rahn 2000; Orren 1997). Others have identified crime as yet another contributor to trust (Chanley, Rudolph, and Rahn 2000; Mansbridge 1997; Pew 1998). And more recently, Keele (2005a) demonstrated that government performance affects trust relative to evaluations of the political process.         "
"3","While this literature is fairly extensive, the findings are easily summarized by saying that trust is a reflection of government performance. The performance of Congress and the president and how well they manage the economy, control crime, and avoid scandal are a large part of what causes the public to trust or distrust the government. So one thing we might say that we know about trust is that various aspects of government performance are important to perceptions of trust."
"4","Running through this work is a sense that trust has some other additional cause that is reflected in broader social and cultural trends. Some authors have suggested that perhaps social capital is the wider social phenomenon which affects trust (Brehm and Rahn 1997; Putnam 2000). Social capital is comprised of civic participation and trusting attitudes. Social capital has been found to be important for economic development, educational attainment, lower crime rates, and government performance (Brehm and Rahn 1997; Coleman 1988; Fukuyama 1995; Knack 2002; Putnam 1995a, 2000). While many early studies of social capital were of communities and individuals, recently the focus has shifted to the effects of declining social capital (Costa and Kahn 2001; Paxton 1999; Putnam 1995a, 1995b, 2000). Under the social capital thesis, trust is a reflection of civic activity and the attendant attitudes of social trust that are learned in civic life, and if social capital has declined this may account for the decline in trust. So we might be able to say that besides government performance, we also suspect that social capital is an important cause of trust in government.         "
"5","But questions about the linkage between social capital and trust abound. The little empirical evidence we do have is with microlevel data and as such can tell us nothing about any possible covariance over time between the two concepts (Brehm and Rahn 1997). Moreover, Mansbridge (1997) argues that measures of voluntary associations do not coincide with movements in trust. Finally, both social capital and trust in government embody trusting attitudes, so trust in government could be causally prior to social capital.         "
"6","Importantly, if social capital is an antecedent of trust, its marginal contribution given the known effects of government performance may be minimal. However, the other possibility is equally real; the well‐documented effect of government performance may diminish once we account for the covariation between trust and social capital. Or instead perhaps each has a separate effect on trust. At present, who can say? Thus, there is still much we have to learn about trust in government and its antecedents. What follows is a macrolevel theory that will allow us to understand the mechanics between these three concepts."
"7","I start with a simple individual‐level theory of trust and government performance. Here, the link between trust and government performance is grounded in basic concepts of democratic representation and accountability. I assume that each citizen grants decision‐making power to an elected politician under an implicit contract that the representatives will accomplish goals of good policy, peace, and sound economic stewardship."
"8","As voters evaluate whether a politician is meeting his or her expectations, trust plays a role in this evaluation. Critically, an everyday definition of trust encapsulates how trust operates in the evaluation of politicians. In everyday life, we trust someone when we have evidence that we can depend on the character and ability of that person.2 This definition of trust readily extends to voters and incumbent politicians. A voter will trust his or her representative if he or she has evidence that the politician has the integrity and capacity to meet the voter's expectations. Therefore, to earn the voter's trust, a politician must demonstrate that he or she has the capability to fulfill the goals he or she was elected to accomplish.         "
"9","By implication, micro trust is based, at least in part, on a simple performance evaluation. While positive performance will increase trust as it will be evidence of ability, poor performance will decrease trust as it will be evidence of a politician's inability to perform."
"10","The implications of individual‐level decisions to trust based upon government performance, however, are manifest at the macro level. If trust is a product of government performance, trust's response to performance must come over time. The variation in performance that we care about occurs across time. We are interested in whether the variation in government performance from one point in time to another causes a change in trust over time. In any microlevel analysis, government performance is constant, and the variation we observe will result from differing voter misperceptions of performance (Kramer 1983). Thus, any cross‐sectional covariance between government performance and trust will be contaminated with perceptual errors and must be treated with skepticism.         "
"11","Given our interest in the relationship over time between trust and performance, the performance theory of trust generates two empirical expectations. First, if trust is a function of government performance, then knowing past government performance should improve our prediction of trust from the history of trust itself. Second, if trust responds to performance, an information stream that fluctuates given the actions of government, then macrolevel trust should exhibit the same short‐term movement as government performance. Therefore, trust should register the frequent gaffes and triumphs of government over time. This forms the dynamic expectations for trust under the government performance thesis: trust should have some component that frequently changes in response to government performance."
"12","So far all the references to government performance have been generic. Considering performance more specifically, we might assume that actions of Congress and the president constitute an important part of government performance as these two branches are elected to serve the voters' interests. In particular, these two branches are held responsible for economic prosperity. Moreover, scandals and high amounts of crime are obvious signs of performance failures. Of course, all this mirrors closely what we find in the trust literature. Therefore, some part of trust should be attuned to the regular give and take of presidential and congressional politics and quickly reflect each branch's failures and successes. I next turn to why we might expect the more elusive process by which citizens engage in civic life to also have an important but different effect on trust."
"13","Social capital is a broad concept thought to affect many aspects of society. Social capital refers to the social connections, networks, and interpersonal trust that occur in communities (Putnam 1993, 1995a, 1995b, 2000). Specifically, social capital has two aspects. The first is the level of civic engagement in a community, state, or nation, and the second is interpersonal trust, or the willingness to ascribe benign intentions to others. Citizens who participate in civic activities meet more people and learn interpersonal trust from interacting with them (Brehm and Rahn 1997; Putnam 1993, 1995a, 1995b, 2000). Each dimension of social capital should contribute to levels of trust in government.         "
"14","The micro foundations for the relationship between social capital and trust in government are well established (Brehm and Rahn 1997; Putnam 1993, 1995a, 1995b, 2000). I briefly review them here. Being involved in civic activities, many of which involve engagement with government or groups that are attempting to influence government, connotes a belief that there is some chance of bringing about social change or control through the established political process. Citizens who are not engaged in civic activity are likely to feel a lack of political influence, which causes feelings of powerlessness that fuel cynicism and distrust toward political and social leaders, the institutions of government, and the regime as a whole (Putnam 2000). Therefore, citizens who have withdrawn from civic life harbor a hostile orientation toward government leaders and institutions. Moreover, civic engagement teaches interpersonal trust, and individuals with low levels of interpersonal trust are equally mistrusting of people and institutions. Thus, the interpersonally distrusting citizen projects his or her misanthropic tendencies onto government (Brehm and Rahn 1997; Lane 1959; Moore, Lare, and Wagner 1985; Putnam 2000).         "
"15","But to consider that social capital exerts some causal influence on trust in government must beg the question of whether instead social capital is influenced by trust as some micro work contends (Brehm and Rahn 1997). It seems entirely plausible that trust in government will influence civic activity, since it may require some level of trust in government to participate in activities that engage political institutions. Moreover, while mistrust of other people may generalize to institutions including government, it may be that trusting government and people are not empirically distinct at the macro level as each is an indicator of a general attitude of trust. Given these questions of causality, the first step in the analysis that follows must be to test that social capital is indeed exogenous to trust in government.         "
"16","Critically, the macrolevel linkage between trust and social capital may be stronger than the microlevel linkage. We might expect microlevel data on civic engagement to contain large amounts of measurement error. Survey items on civic acts such as working for the school board are particularly prone to recall effects. By aggregating over a large number of micro measures, much of the measurement error will cancel out. Only with less noisy macro measures of social capital might we be able to observe any statistical relationship between social capital and trust in government."
"17","More importantly, while social capital can be a property of individuals, it is really a property of aggregated units be they communities, states, or nations. Even Brehm and Rahn (1997) define social capital as primarily an aggregate concept. As such, we can examine two different forms of variation in social capital. The first is the variance across aggregated units. The difference between the level of social capital in Maine and Nevada is an example of variation across aggregated units. We can also examine the variation over time in social capital within a single unit: has the level of social capital changed over time in the United States? Given the aggregated nature of social capital, microlevel searches for an association between trust and social capital may be entirely misleading. A microlevel study cannot capture either of these two different forms of variation in social capital. Only by using a macro design can we really expect to find an association between social capital and trust in government. The macro design captures the aggregate nature of social capital, but also incorporates the temporal nature of variation in social capital.         "
"18","If trust does respond to the movement in social capital over time, there should be an implied dynamic between these two processes. The dynamic between trust and social capital should be quite different than the dynamic between trust and government performance. Instead of trust responding to the rapidly changing stream of information and perceptions that make up government performance, trust is reacting to a social process. Given that social capital is the combination of decisions to engage and the trusting attitudes that result from such engagement, the longitudinal movement in social capital should be gradual. Therefore, any effect that social capital has on trust should occur over the long term and not be contemporaneous as we expect for government performance. In short, we should expect the effects of government performance to be mostly contemporaneous, while social capital and trust should vary around a common level in the long run."
"19","Attention to the dynamics of these three processes allows us to develop a more holistic understanding of how trust operates. While trust may react to both government performance and social capital, it should respond to each differently. Trust should respond to changes in performance immediately, but it should also respond more slowly over time to social capital. The dynamics also imply that the effect of social capital should be more potent than that of performance. If the effect of performance is predominantly a short‐term effect, then its effect will be transitory beyond short‐term fluctuations. But if social capital dominates the long‐term trend in trust, it would suggest that the decline in social capital has caused the decline in trust over the last 40 years."
"20","To summarize, we have two separate but interlocking explanations for the behavior of trust. First, as the public perceives government performance improving (or worsening), trust will increase (or decrease). The statistical relationship should be positive as better performance should indicate an increase in trust, and trust will frequently fluctuate as performance changes. Second, a decline in social capital should also erode trust and affect the long‐term movements in trust without affecting trust contemporaneously. What remains is to perform a statistical analysis that will precisely estimate the relationship between government performance, social capital, and trust. Before performing the analysis, I outline the specific measures used focusing on the measure of trust."
"21","To analyze trust's dynamic response to its predictors requires longitudinal data with close intervals between observations. An annual or biennial time series of trust will not adequately reveal whether trust responds in the short term to government performance. The challenge is to obtain a time series that will capture any short‐term reaction trust might have to government performance. To that end, I constructed a trust in government time series with nearly 200 administrations of nine different survey questions from the data archive at the Roper Center for Public Opinion. Using Stimson's (1991)“recursive dyadic dominance” algorithm, I am able to form a quarterly trust time series and assess how well the different survey questions tap the same underlying trust construct. A number of researchers have used Stimson's method to construct time series measures of public opinion (Chanley, Rudolph, and Rahn 2000; Durr, Gilmour, and Wolbrecht 1997; Durr, Martin, and Wolbrecht 2000; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Freeman et al. 1998; Keele 2005b; Kellstedt 2000).         "
"22","Stimson's method produces a loading—interpretable as a correlation—that allows the analyst to assess how well different survey items measure the underlying construct. Table 1 reports the loading between the survey items and the trust in government construct.         "
"23","All nine survey items are highly correlated with the underlying trust construct; the lowest loading is a high .73 with most items loading at .9 or higher.3 The items also explain over 87% of the variance, which indicates that the measurement model fits the data well. With the data available I am able to produce a quarterly time series, which starts in the early 1970s. The quarterly time series is scaled from 0 to 100 with higher values indicating higher levels of trust.4Figure 1 displays the yearly trust time series.         "
"24"," Quarterly Trust in Government, 1970–2000                      "
"25","The quarterly time series allows us to see a fine‐grained picture of the short‐term movement in trust. Trust reaches a low point around the Watergate scandal in 1973 but rebounds during the Ford and Carter administrations before declining again. During the Reagan administration, trust maintained levels nearly 20 points higher than during the lows of the previous decade. After a sharp decline in the early 1990s, trust again climbed throughout the Clinton era but is never as high as it was in the 1980s. The quarterly time series provides evidence that trust moves in the short term, but this movement could be random fluctuation. The statistical analysis will assess whether changes in government performance are responsible for these short‐term movements when the long‐term trends in social capital are controlled for."
"26","I use six different measures to capture public perceptions of government performance.5 To measure economic performance, I use the Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), a set of survey items that tap public perceptions of economic prosperity.6 To measure the performance of government institutions, I use presidential and congressional approval. The presidential approval measure comes from the Gallup and CBS/New YorkTimes surveys. The congressional approval measure is an extended series of the survey aggregates used in Durr, Gilmour, and Wolbrecht (1997).7 To measure public perceptions of crime, I use the proportion of respondents who identify crime as the “Most Important Problem.” I also test whether congressional and presidential scandals, as evidence of performance failures, affect trust. Scandals are operationalized as dummy variables. Each scandal is a dummy variable with a one in the quarter the scandal started and a zero in all other quarters. The dummy variable for the Watergate scandal is slightly different with ones from the second quarter of 1973 to the third quarter of 1974 and zeros in all other quarters.8 The scandals included and the quarter in which each occurred are as follows: Watergate, 1973:2–1974:3; Koreagate, 1977:1; ABSCAM, 1980:1; Iran Contra Affair, 1986:3; Jim Wright Scandal, 1989:2; Keating 5, 1990:4; House Bank Scandal, 1991:3; White House Travel Office, 1993:2; Whitewater, 1994:2; Filegate, 1996:2.         "
"27","Social capital is operationalized with a measure of civic engagement and a measure of interpersonal trust. Both measures are public opinion time series that are developed and detailed in Keele (2005b), but I provide some description of these measures since they are central to the analysis. Notably, Keele finds that measures of interpersonal trust do not scale well with measures of civic engagement, and this leads him to create measures of each to capture social capital. Both time series are constructed from public opinion survey items using the Stimson algorithm.         "
"28","The civic engagement time series includes indicators of four types of civic participation: participation in community organizations, participation in politics and public affairs, volunteering, and informal socializing. The time series is designed to directly measure Putnam's conception of social capital (Putnam 2000). Examples of common indicators in the series are whether the respondent has been an officer of an organization, wrote to a member of Congress, or spent time doing volunteer work. The interpersonal trust time series is primarily comprised of three items first developed for use in the NES but later adopted by a number of commercial polling organizations. One of these items asks respondents whether most people can be trusted, while another asks whether people try to take advantage. Keele (2005b) demonstrates that each measure of social capital scales well and behaves as expected in empirical analyses. Both measures are plotted in the next section, where the reader can see the general decline in both over the last 30 years.         "
"29","Finally, as a control in the statistical analysis, I also include a measure of macropartisanship. Macropartisanship is a measure of the level of Democrats relative to Republicans over time (MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1989). The reason I include macropartisanship as a control is that Chanley, Rudolph, and Rahn (2000) find some evidence of a covariance over time between trust and macropartisanship. But more importanly, Keele (2005a) demonstrates that party identification has important links to trust at the micro level as well.         "
"30","Prior to more complicated statistical analyses, I conduct a much simpler visual analysis. With time series data a visual inspection of the variables in question often provides a useful intuitive test: do the measures in question appear to move together over time? If the measures of social capital and trust in government appear to move together over time, it would provide some nominal evidence for a linkage between the two concepts. In Figure 2, I plot interpersonal trust, civic engagement, and trust in government.         "
"31"," Trust in Government and Social Capital, 1970–2000                      "
"32","The visual pattern is striking particularly between interpersonal trust and government trust. The two measures move together quite closely in the period under observation. While there is little quarter to quarter movement in civic engagement, the movement of trust in government also tracks the course of civic engagement. The evidence from a rough visual analysis certainly suggests that the three measures covary. I next turn to a set of statistical tests to assess the theory."
"33","Before I can consider the more subtle questions of the relative dynamic effects of government performance and social capital, I must clear up the questions surrounding the causal mechanics between trust and social capital. Thus, I present the evidence for a theoretically critical question: does trust in government affect, in any way, the two indicators of social capital?"
"34","To answer this question I rely on a standard Granger causality test, a statistical technique well suited to the present line of inquiry (Freeman 1983; Freeman, Williams, and Lin 1989). The test is quite simple: a standard partial F‐test is used to determine whether past values of one series affect subsequent values of another series. I perform two Granger tests. In the first, I test whether trust in government Granger causes civic engagement, and in the second, I test whether trust in government Granger causes interpersonal trust. In each Granger test if we are unable to reject the null, we infer that trust is a proximate cause of civic engagement and interpersonal trust.9"
"35","The results appear in Table 2. The two cells in the table represent an estimated equation testing whether trust Granger causes the two components of social capital. The p‐values associated with each equation appear in the cells of the table. If the p‐values are below the standard 0.05 threshold, we infer that trust in government Granger causes either interpersonal trust, civic engagement, or both. In the first equation, I test whether trust in government has any effect on interpersonal trust. Since the estimated p‐value is .90, this clearly indicates that trust does not Granger cause interpersonal trust. In the second equation, the estimated p‐value is .88. Again we are able to reject the null, which indicates that trust does not Granger cause civic engagement. These results make the task at hand much simpler. They imply that I can model the relative effects of government performance and social capital on trust in a simple recursive system.         "
"36","The primary concern in the selection of the statistical model is the need to capture both short‐term shifts in trust while accounting for the movement in social capital. The theory suggests that social capital, as a dynamically slower process, should dominate the long‐term trends in trust, while short‐term shocks will be a function of performance. To analyze the differing long‐ and short‐term contributions of social capital and government performance, I use single‐equation error correction models (ECMs). ECMs have separate parameters for contemporaneous effects and long‐term equilibrium effects.10 The ability to estimate long‐ and short‐term parameters in error correction models is particularly important, since I expect to observe government performance having an immediate effect on trust, while social capital has an effect on trust that occurs not immediately but instead over future time periods.         "
"37","A bivariate single‐equation ECM may be written as follows and helps illustrate why an ECM is particularly suited to the theoretical question at hand:             "
"38"," Equation 1 relates current changes in Yt to both the changes in Xt and the degree to which the lagged levels of Yt and Xt are outside of their equilibrium relationship. Here, current changes in Yt are a function of current changes in Xt and the degree to which the two series were outside of their equilibrium in the previous time period. Specifically, β1 captures any immediate effect Xt has on Yt and is often referred to as a contemporaneous effect. In other words, if the first difference of a variable included in the model is statistically significant, then Xt has a short‐term effect on the dependent variable. The β3 parameter is referred to as the equilibrium effect of Xt on Yt and is the effect that occurs over future time periods and is often referred to as the long‐term effect that Xt has on Yt. If the parameter for a lag of one of the independent variables is significant, then that variable has a long‐term effect on Yt. Finally, the long‐term effect occurs at a rate dictated by the value of β2 (Bannerjee et al. 1993).11"
"39","The expectation from theory is that government performance should have statistically significant short‐term effects, while social capital should have statistically significant long‐term effects. In the practical context of the statistical model, I expect that the first differences of the performance variables should be statistically significant, while the lagged values of social capital should be significant. I also allow that perhaps social capital has a short‐term effect as well while performance may have a long‐term effect. To that end, I include both lagged and differenced terms for each. The estimating equation then takes the following form:             "
"40","The error correction coefficient, lagged trust in the model, indicates that equilibrium errors are corrected at the rate of 35% per quarter. More generally, this is the rate at which long‐term levels of trust move in response to a change in one of the predictor variables. Therefore, trust responds to equilibrium errors relatively quickly, leaving 65% of the disequilibrating shock present after two quarters, 42% after three quarters, 27% after four quarters and so on. This error correction rate implies that it takes a little over two years for 95% of the errors from a disequilibrating shock to be corrected."
"41","As expected, the short‐term parameters for both the Index of Consumer Sentiment and congressional approval are significant. Interestingly, the effect of government performance is not completely transitory since both congressional approval and the economy influence the long‐term level of trust as well. The effect of government performance is both subtle and blunt. First, trust quickly updates when performance changes, but the memory of that change lingers to ensure that trust is more than “what have you done for me lately?” That the effect of performance is not completely transitory is reassuring. If the electorate simply forgot past performance, the government would not be accountable for past performance beyond a single quarter."
"42","While I did find that both presidential approval and crime were significant in bivariate regressions, they are not significant in the full specification. For crime, this implies that while it may embody some sense of general government performance, the actions of Congress and the health of the economy better capture the public's sense of what contributes to a trustworthy government. Given that presidential approval has been purged of its economic component, the model implies that the president only contributes to trust insofar as the public holds the president responsible for the economy. Also the results support those of Feldman (1983), who found that many respondents have Congress in mind when they answer trust in government questions. This may be due to the fact that for many respondents Congress serves as a placeholder for the federal government in general, while the president is a distinct personality. As Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse (1996) note, when people are dissatisfied with the government in general they tend to blame Congress. So the results, here, also suggest that approval of Congress serves as a fairly general indicator of satisfaction with government that then affects trust in both the short and long run.         "
"43","The indicators of social capital are also important determinants of trust as both civic engagement and interpersonal trust have large, significant effects. However, the effects of social capital are very different from those of performance. Civic engagement and interpersonal trust only affect the long‐term equilibrium of trust. Thus, if we observed a large increase in social capital, there would be no immediate effect on trust. Over subsequent quarters, however, the level of trust would reequilibrate and subsequently move higher as well.13"
"44","To more fully explore the dynamic pattern of the effects, I plot the lag distributions for the effects of Index of Consumer Sentiment, congressional approval, interpersonal trust, and civic engagement. The lag distribution is the amount trust changes each quarter in response to a one‐point increase in the independent variable. The lag distributions for each variable are in Figure 3. The dynamic component of the theory is clearly confirmed in the figure. For both ICS and congressional approval, the bulk of the effects occur immediately. In contrast, the effects of civic engagement and interpersonal trust do not take hold until t+ 1 and then are distributed across approximately the next eight quarters. The dynamic expectations from the theory are fully confirmed. The effect of performance is largely contemporaneous, while social capital dominates the long‐term component of trust. Moreover, the effects of social capital appear to be much larger than those of performance. To further explore this point, I next compare the relative magnitudes of the effects of performance and social capital.         "
"45"," The Dynamic Effects of Performance and Social Capital: Change in Trust Over Time After a One‐Point Increase in Covariate                      "
"46","To compare the size of the effects, I calculate the long‐run multipliers for the variables of interest. The long‐run multiplier is the total long‐ and short‐run effect on trust for a one‐point increase in the independent variable.14 I also calculated the standard error for each long‐run variable using the Bewley transformation (Bannerjee et al. 1993). The results are in Table 4.         "
"47","While all of the long‐run multipliers are statistically significant, the effects of social capital are quite powerful as they are the largest in the model. A one‐point increase in civic engagement will increase trust 0.72 points, while a one‐point increase in congressional approval will increase trust 0.24 points. An increase of one point in ICS increases trust 0.07 points, while an increase in interpersonal trust will increase government trust 0.28 points. A concerted increase in both measures of social capital will increase trust one point, while a concerted increase in performance will increase trust 0.31 points. The substantive impact of social capital, then, is far greater than that of performance. Performance undoubtedly causes the frequent fluctuations we observe in the trust time series, but it appears to be social capital that is driving the downward trend in trust."
"48","As such, the debate over performance versus civic disengagement and misanthropy, at the macro level, is a false dichotomy since both explain how trust moves over time. Comparing the two in the same model allows us to understand that it appears to be the decline in social capital that is responsible for the current stagnation in trust in government. The model also suggests that while performance may be responsible for temporary increases in trust, without some change in social capital, trust will not return to the levels witnessed in the 1950s and 1960s."
"49","So what have we learned? The basic statistical results are straightforward. First, trust is an evaluation of politicians and their management of the economy and responds immediately to any changes in government performance. But trust also reflects the lessons learned in civic activity and feelings of personal misanthropy. While changes in social capital will not register an effect on trust immediately, the effect on trust is substantively important."
"50","As such, the statistical results provide us with insight into what trust can tell us about the political climate and public response to popular governance. The early 1990s provide a particularly instructive case of how trust, as it embodies both performance and social capital, operates within the macro polity. Let's recall some of the events of the early 1990s that reflected on government performance at the time. Of course, economic prosperity suffered as the economy dipped into a stubborn recession, and George Bush's presidential approval ratings declined as attention shifted from the Gulf War to domestic politics. Moreover, congressional popularity suffered as a series of scandals did little to bolster the image of Congress. With declines in several government performance indicators, it is little wonder that trust suffered."
"51","But trust was particularly low. In fact, trust reached its nadir as less than 35% trusted the government in 1994. That trust was so low is less surprising given that civic engagement and interpersonal trust both dipped during the same time period. But the movement of trust in the late 1990s is also instructive. In the late 1990s, the United States experienced robust economic growth and the popularity of Congress recovered. Trust, however, increased during the late 1990s but not by much. Of course, there has not been any reversal in the slide of social capital, so it is not surprising that the rebound in trust has not been greater despite the change in government performance."
"52","Scholars have long debated what caused the slide in trust from the 1950s to today. Many explanations have been offered, but all have been found wanting. Social capital provides the best evidence yet. First, it declined over the same period. Second, the evidence, here, demonstrates that social capital exerts a powerful effect on trust. So while poor government performance undoubtedly contributed to the slide, the loss of social capital must have been decisive. The slide in social capital also explains why trust has never rebounded. Of course, we cannot rule out that trust was unusually high in the postwar period, as there is some evidence that is the case (Bennett 2001). Moreover, our indicators of social capital do not stretch back in time past World War II, so again we are truly unable to say that perhaps trust was artificially high in the post‐war period. But it would appear that without some resurgence in social capital, especially civic engagement, we cannot expect trust in government to return to its previous levels.         "
"53","As Hetherington (1998) demonstrates, without trust it is difficult for political leaders to succeed. Challenges such as social security, terrorism, and global warming are all issues that the government must confront in the future. Without trust, it becomes all the more difficult for leaders to confront and address these looming issues. Without some return to civic engagement, it is unlikely that leaders will have the trust of the public to solve these problems.         "
"54","Any time series analysis must answer questions about the properties of the dependent time series. Trust in government does not have the correct properties to be integrated as economists define that term. Given that the series is bound between 0 and 100 it cannot grow without bound. Of course, with limited sample sizes we can have series that appear to be integrated or be what are called near‐integrated and are still prone to the problem of spurious relationships (De Boef and Granato 1990). As such, I conduct a battery of tests for whether trust is nonstationary. It is also possible that trust is a fractionally integrated process (i.e., I(d), 0 < d < 1). I also test for this possibility. The tests I use initially are the DF‐GLS test (Elliott, Rothenberg, and Stock 1996) and the KPSS test (Kwiatkowski et al. 1992). The results from both tests indicate that trust is nonstationary. For the DF‐GLS test the test statistic for the first lag is −1.262 and the 5% critical value is −3.007. For the KPSS test, the critical value for the 0 lag is 0.744 and the 5% critical value is 0.146. Given the downward direction of trust over the period, I conducted both tests with a trend included. However, conducting both tests without a trend left the results unchanged. Finally, I test for the possibility of fractional integration through estimating d, the fractional integration parameter. To estimate d, I used Robinson's Gaussian semiparametric estimator and found the estimate of d to be 1.03 (s.e: 0.077) (Robinson 1995). It would appear that trust is downward trending enough to appear nonstationary. De Boef and Granato (1999) argue that ECMs are the appropriate choice in political data with long memories. Therefore, the ECM provides not only a close theoretical fit, but is also appropriate given the empirical time series properties of trust.            "
"55","The Granger causality tests presented in the text are simply bivariate relationships and do not test for causality in a fully specified model. To correct for this, I estimated a VAR and conducted the Granger tests within this context. In doing the VAR analysis, I could have treated the performance measures and scandals as exogenous or treated the scandals as exogenous. The latter method seems best since it will mean that the models are more fully specified, which is the concern I am trying to address. (The results were the same either way). The results from the Granger tests for the VAR analysis are unchanged."
