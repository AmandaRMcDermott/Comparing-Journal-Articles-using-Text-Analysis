"1","As mentioned, we use Howell's (2003) unilateral politics framework as a starting point in specifying competing models of executive action. Both our analysis and Howell's highlight presidential agenda setting and the strategic interaction involving Congress and the judiciary. Our competing models then differ from one another in how the president employs delegated discretion.         "
"2","We first briefly describe common elements in our models, which are largely consistent with, but more general than, what Howell (2003) explicitly or implicitly assumes in generating his hypotheses.4 We then build in additional, reasonable assumptions to each model to obtain new results and to derive rigorously hypotheses that differ from previous studies.         "
"3","Common features include players, utility functions, game sequence, and assumptions for some parameters, which are all common knowledge. Players include the president (P), the chamber median (Mc), the veto override pivot (V), the filibuster pivot (F), and the judiciary (J), whose ideal points are respectively denoted as p, mc, v, f, and j.5 We consider a unidimensional policy space where ideal points are real numbers. We assume that each player i has symmetric single‐peaked preferences with ideal point  over policy outcome . Without loss of generality, assume a Republican president. For more concise results with little sacrifice of generality (as it is almost always true post–World War II), we assume that the president is more extreme than the override pivot (i.e., that ).6"
"4","The game sequence (Figure 1) has three stages: (1) presidential unilateral action, (2) a pivotal politics game (legislative process), and (3) the court's override decision.7 Initially, Nature (N) randomly selects a status quo, q, and an exogenous presidential discretion level relative to it, t. To make our models more general than their predecessor, which assumes a normal distribution around mc, we assume that q comes from a continuous distribution whose mean is around mc, whose support covers all real numbers, and whose probability density function, , is weakly decreasing as q moves away from the mean (i.e., a single‐peaked distribution peaking at the chamber median). Discretion comes from a general probability distribution, and the values of q and t are revealed to all players before their decisions. The president moves first and possibly chooses a unilateral action from a set of policies between  and , subject to some additional, model‐specific, constraints to be specified later.         "
"5","In the second stage, Congress can respond to presidential action in a pivotal politics legislative game. Kreh‐biel's (1998) preference‐based pivotal politics game is played in the first two models and, given that a majority party is key for constraining unilateral action, a variant of this game with a majority party as a negative agenda setter is played in the third. Regardless of the specific pivotal politics game, the president will take advantage of the possibility that Congress will have trouble moving some status quos at the second stage by shifting the status quo to a more favorable point within the EGI.         "
"6","In the third stage, the judiciary ensures that the president's unilateral action does not overuse his discretion. If P moves q beyond this level, the court overrules the action and returns policy to the initial status quo.8 To reiterate, except for the more general assumption about the status quo distribution and implicitly incorporating bicameralism, our model setup is thus far consistent with what Howell (2003) explicitly or implicitly assumes.         "
"7","However, given our goal of assessing the extent to which unilateral action constitutes presidential power, we go beyond this framework by constructing three competing models, each differing on how it assumes the president can use t to shift q: P can either move q in whichever direction he chooses (the unilateralism model), only toward the chamber median (the chamber compliance model), or only toward the median of the majority party in Congress (the partisan compliance model).9 We can then directly derive hypotheses and evaluate which of these models best corresponds to the relevant data.         "
"8","Howell (2003) is the first scholar to employ each of the three discretion assumptions to some extent in his discussions, derivation of results, and generation of hypotheses. Assumptions regarding limits on discretion toward the chamber and majority‐party medians are, respectively, utilized to generate hypotheses on congressional fragmentation (i.e., the president will be more likely to issue a significant EO with a more fragmented Congress) and divided government (i.e., the president will more likely issue an EO under unified government). However, as implied above, given that these hypotheses are generated or derived from different assumptions and that a coherent theory cannot be deductively built on somewhat contradictory assumptions, testing these hypotheses is equivalent to examining different theories. This is particularly relevant given our interest in presidential power, as each assumption has profoundly distinct implications for power arising from unilateral action. Thus, we examine which model corresponds closer to the data by deriving hypotheses from competing theories relying on a single discretion assumption. In doing so, we derive new hypotheses for each model demonstrating heretofore unappreciated relationships that may impact unilateral action.         "
"9","To facilitate characterizing our results, like previous delegation models (e.g., Epstein and O'Halloran 1998), we assume that the exogenous discretion level is selected from a uniform distribution between zero and . Both to rule out any unreasonable distribution of discretion and for parsimony, we assume that , where  is twice as large as the minimized distance between the chamber median and the filibuster pivot over Congresses. Allowing larger  will not qualitatively change our results.         "
"10","For all three models, we derive an ex ante equilibrium‐expected probability of presidential unilateral action, denoted as , integrating the equilibrium probability of such action over all possible status quos q and discretion levels t.10 In other words,  captures the expected likelihood that the president acts unilaterally at a given game's outset before learning q and t. With  for each model, we then generate corresponding hypotheses.         "
"11","The unilateralism model is most consistent with unilateral action equaling executive power. Assuming that the president can move q both rightward and leftward subject to the discretion constraint implies that unilateral action is a powerful tool for setting agendas and moving status quos closer to the president's ideal point. This assumption meshes well both with assertions that the president is greatly advantaged given that Congress suffers from collective‐action problems and that the judiciary is quiescent (Macey 2006; Moe and Howell 1999), and with the assumption in delegation models (e.g., Epstein and O'Halloran 1998) that, since determining the enacting coalition's precise will and its implication for presidential discretion is often problematic, the president can move q in either direction. However, as shown below, even under this model, the president, anticipating congressional and judicial responses and attempts to override presidential action, acts strategically by preempting them, exploiting legislative fragmentation, or being inactive. In this sense, political environment and institutional constraints still bind presidential action, as argued in Deering and Maltzman (1999), Krause and Cohen (1999), and Howell (2003).            "
"12","We solve the game to derive a subgame perfect equilibrium and . By backward induction, the judge in the third stage ensures that the president does not overuse delegated discretion. In the second stage, Mc can essentially move the status quo previously untouched by the president or the new q established by unilateral action wherever she prefers, subject to the constraints imposed by F and V. The resulting EGI, bounded by the filibuster and override pivots, consists of status quos which no players in this stage can successfully alter. This interval's length reflects the disadvantage that Congress, unlike the president as a unitary actor, suffers from and the extent to which it is divided or fragmented.            "
"13","The president's first‐stage decision is key. Figure 2(a) graphically depicts when the president acts unilaterally in this stage. N randomly draws q on any point on the horizontal line. If q is interior to the EGI, P can move q anywhere within the interval, as fragmented congressional preferences will make counteracting his move impossible. Therefore, P unilaterally pushes q as close as possible to the EGI's left boundary (i.e., to v) with probability one, regardless of what t is drawn. Similarly, if q is located between the override pivot and the chamber median's reflection point on the override pivot (i.e., ), P adjusts policy closer to v to preempt mc from moving q too far away from his ideal point.11 Finally, there are status quos, indicated by the thinner bold line, where P prefers to act only when the t drawn is sufficiently large, by either moving q closer to his own ideal point than Mc would prefer or preempting the median from moving q too much.            "
"14","Presidential Unilateral Action under Three Competing Models"
"15","Note: f, v, p, mc, mp, and q denote the ideal points of the filibuster and override pivots, the president, the medians of the chamber and the majority party, and the status quo, respectively.                        "
"16","Note that, given both the lack of correspondence between the EGI and status quos with positive probabilities of action and the different probabilities of actions, a larger EGI does not generally result in a higher ex ante probability of unilateral action. For instance, in Figure 2(a), for the same EGI length (i.e., the interval between f and v), the longer the distance between the mc and v, the longer the boldest line. Hence, since EGI sides may have independent, distinct effects on , following past practice by employing the EGI as a predictor is misleading.12 As such, and per Proposition 1, everything else equal, unilateral action is more likely the larger the right EGI tail's length (i.e., the further v is from mc).13 The same relationship holds for the left EGI tail. Note that effects are not constant but always positive, and which EGI tail's effect is larger depends on q's distribution and mc's location relative to f and v.            "
"17","Based on these results, we derive the following hypotheses:               "
"18","The first hypothesis stems from the likelihood that a new president whose party differs from his predecessor's typically has more electoral mandates to address or needs to override EOs issued by his predecessors. In other words, while the distribution of status quos may remain the same, the number of issues rises, increasing total expected unilateral actions.14"
"19","Hypotheses A2 and A3 go beyond past research (notably Howell 2003). To reiterate, EGI length captures neither additional effects of the distance between the median and the right boundary of the interval nor subtle effects stemming from the relative locations of the chamber median and the filibuster and override pivots. Our hypotheses are a function of how each EGI side independently and distinctly impacts .            "
"20","As mentioned, this model differs from the unilateralism model in assuming how the president can use t to move q. It captures a world where either the courts attempt to represent contemporary legislative intent in the form of the legislative median or, per conventional wisdom, Congress has various mechanisms to impact the president and the executive branch (which have become even more prominent in the age of gridlock): among them, appropriations riders, manipulating legislative scheduling, blocking appointments, and using legislative vetoes (despite their supposed illegality; see, e.g., Berry 2008). Thus, we assume that P can move q only toward mc (which, to reiterate, is Howell's approach in generating his fragmentation hypothesis).            "
"21","Put differently, this model makes the intuitive assumption that presidents may hesitate to move policy from the chamber median, usually situated in the middle of the ideological continuum, toward his own, typically more extreme, ideal point. The reason behind such executive caution is the potential for costs or actions mitigating an order's effectiveness that is not picked up by the unilateralism model.15 These costs and actions are not necessarily the product of a statute moving q but may be in the form of other decisions that may or may not be directly related to the policy at hand. Rather, they are a function of “the exploitation of extra‐statutory tactics [that] . . . often necessitates informal accommodation” (Smith, Roberts, and Vander Wielen 2009, 305) as a prominent textbook description puts it—or a judiciary that effectively checks the chief executive by enforcing legislative intent. Consequently, presidents may feel compelled to bargain with Congress and ultimately adjust the policy embodied in the EO, or they may anticipate what congressional action will be and defer moving some q that would be shifted if a real‐world Congress could only pass legislation. Because at least tacit approval is required, this suggests that unilateral actions provide the president with less influence than has often seemingly been suggested but is consistent with what many involved in the process claim to witness.16"
"22","More precisely, the difference between the unilateralism and chamber compliance models in terms of  rests on status quos where P prefers employing delegated discretion to shift policy further away from mc in the first model. As Figure 2(b) illustrates, these status quos are located between mc and v, so that P's moving policy closer to v would sabotage the median's interests. Since the president is worse off if he moves these q's in the other direction, he takes no unilateral action in equilibrium.            "
"23","Straightforwardly following from Proposition 2, the first two unilateralism model hypotheses—regarding a new president's impact and the relationship between the chamber median and the filibuster pivot—still hold. However, in contrast to Hypothesis A3, the relationship for the chamber median/override pivot distance is indeterminate in the chamber compliance model. As Figure 2(b) shows, increasing distance between mc and v both increases the distance between v and the median's reflection point (i.e., ), the segment where P surely acts unilaterally, and lowers the probability density for these status quos given our assumption about q's distribution. The former raises , the latter lowers it. Hence, effects may be minimal, positive or negative, e.g., a status quo distribution overwhelmingly centered around mc may lead to a larger right EGI tail actually reducing .17"
"24","The partisan compliance model replaces mc from the chamber compliance model with the ideal point of the majority‐party median, denoted ,18 in constraining presidential unilateral action, while the chamber median remains the legislative‐stage agenda setter.19 The rationale for assuming that , who is the majority‐party median, constrains discretion is analogous to that for the chamber‐median assumption, i.e., extrastatutory tactics used as checks by the legislature or, implicitly, via judicial decisions. The major difference, consistent with myriad claims of congressional party influence (in particular, with negative agenda power; e.g., Cox and McCubbins 2005), is that the party, not the chamber, median is the key player constraining t, which Howell (2003) assumes in deriving his divided government hypothesis. The substantive importance of substituting party for chamber median hinges on the preference difference between the two.         "
"25","For consistency, we also assume that the party median exercises negative agenda‐setting power in the pivotal politics game. The resulting EGI expands and is bounded by f and  under unified government and by  and v under divided government, as the majority‐party median prevents the chamber median from moving any q located between these two medians toward the latter's ideal point.         "
"26","As Figures 2(a) and 2(c) display, under unified government, is actually roughly comparable to that in the unilateralism model. , which now constrains how the president can use t, has an ideal point so similar to the president's that P's discretion, while bounded by Congress, is essentially unconstrained regarding which direction the status quo is moved. Additionally, P can take advantage of a more fragmented Congress (i.e., with an expanded EGI) by moving previously unalterable status quos. Thus, P essentially moves q where the party median would prefer it as an agenda setter.         "
"27","Strikingly, as Figure 2(d) illustrates, P is unlikely to propose unilateral action under divided government. When q is between  and v, the president, accounting for the majority median's preferences and opposition (or facing the court acting in this median's interest if it is interpreted as representative of the enacting coalition), will be restrained from moving q closer to P. This highlights both that unilateral action may correspond to weak presidential power and that parties, rarely explicitly addressed in the executive action literature, may be crucially important.         "
"28","Two features in this model should be emphasized. Divided government's effect, displayed in Figures 2(c) and 2(d), is not driven by the majority party's negative agenda power in the legislative stage, as Deering and Maltzman (1999) implicitly argued, but by its veto or bargaining power over presidential discretion, the assumption distinguishing this model from the first two.20 Additionally, divided government's dramatic effect is partly triggered by the preference difference between p and  under unified and divided government. Presidential unilateral action serves the majority‐party median's interests far more when p and  are very similar (i.e., under unified government) than when such preferences are quite diverse (i.e., under divided government). Put differently, even when the president would be greatly benefited by unilateral action, he must obtain the majority‐party median's tacit approval, as this median's welfare must increase with unilateral action.         "
"29","Based on Proposition 3 (appendix), we derive the following hypotheses.            "
"30","The first hypothesis is analogous to those for the initial two models. The second integrates the potential importance of legislative parties and divided government, irrelevant for the earlier models, and can hold only when assuming that  constrains presidential action. The condition for this hypothesis is typically found empirically. While this hypothesis has been proposed and tested elsewhere (Howell 2003; Mayer 1999), our derivation differs, and we make the theoretical assumptions and mechanism producing the effects of unified government more transparent and precise.21 For instance, while previous studies suggest congressional support drives unified government's effects, we deductively demonstrate how a majority party's tacit approval for the president exercising his discretion results in these effects.         "
"31","Conversely, the third hypothesis is novel, indicating that the interaction between unified government and the right or left EGI tail's length positively increases , with the right EGI now defined as the distance between  and mc. Detailing how the effects of factors related to the entire or partial EGI are conditioned by whether government is unified highlights the importance of developing individual models with consistent assumptions. It also underscores how, under the current model, Howell's two hypotheses—fragmentation and divided government—cannot hold simultaneously, no matter how we adjust our assumptions.         "
"32","An overriding issue is linking unilateral action to presidential power. While our models all assume Congress can constrain presidential unilateral action by passing legislation and that courts can enforce discretion, they have different implications for this relationship."
"33","In the unilateralism model, the president can act freely within the discretion limit without constraints. Any attempt by a legislative pivot to override a unilateral action will be stalled by another pivot. As Figure 2(a) shows, the president can move almost all status quos in any direction without overt or tacit approval of any other political actors. Unilateral action is thus equivalent to presidential power to an extremely high extent given our definition.         "
"34","By contrast, presidential power stemming from opportunities for unilateral action is substantially undercut in the chamber and partisan compliance models, as the president cannot use discretion to move a status quo without the overt or tacit approval of a critical actor in Congress, be it the chamber or majority‐party median. How much the president's expected utility rises from unilateral action is largely a function of the preference divergence between the president and this critical actor, as the latter constrains presidential use of discretion."
"35","To measure the president's expected utility increase from unilateral action, for each model we compare the president's utility relative to a counterfactual where only a pivotal politics game, i.e., the second stage of our game, is played and no unilateral action can occur. Proposition 4 (Appendix A) demonstrates that the partisan compliance model with unified government boosts the president's gain the most, followed by the unilateralism model, the chamber compliance model, and the partisan compliance model with divided government, with the president profiting little from unilateral action in the partisan compliance model with divided government. Moreover, assuming that divided government's likelihood is not too low (more than 50% of the time post–World War II), we can establish under some fairly reasonable circumstances that the president's gain is the largest in the unilateralism model and the least in the partisan compliance model.         "
"36","While Proposition 1 confirms our intuition that the key difference in the unilateral action assumption in the three models has profound implications for presidential gains, the president's increase in expected utility does not necessarily correspond to power given its definition. The president's gain from unilateral action is not agreed to by Congress or the courts in the unilateralism model, whereas it is in the chamber and partisan compliance models. Stated differently, the unilateralism model, which seemingly best corresponds to presidential influence and the insights of theoretical efforts such as Deering and Maltzman (1999), Krause and Cohen (1999), Mayer (2002), and elements in Howell (2003), implies the most presidential influence. Nonetheless, if the chamber or partisan compliance models, which highlight how overt or tactic approval may be required for presidents to act unilaterally, hold empirically, we must reassess the power associated with unilateral action.         "
"37","Examining hypotheses is crucial for understanding which of our models best conforms to the data and how much presidential influence unilateral action entails. As discussed, in making inferences about influence, most previous studies seemingly assume that the unilateralism model is correct, while inferences about the power of unilateral action would be dampened considerably if either the chamber or partisan compliance model holds empirically.         "
"38","To test the derived hypotheses, our analysis principally focuses on the number of significant EOs by Congress from the 80th to 107th Congresses, although we report results where the yearly number of EOs is the unit of analysis.         "
"39","As mentioned, our dependent variable requires distinguishing insignificant from significant EOs, which has either not been done or been done rather simply in the presidential unilateralism literature. A measure such as the New York Times front page (i.e., Howell 2005) is inherently subjective, somewhat arbitrary, and potentially influenced by idiosyncratic factors. Even if multiple sources are used (e.g., Mayer 1999 and Mayer and Price 2002, which measure significance over a subset of EOs from five sources by rating any mention by one source as significant), possibilities such as raters using different thresholds for significance and problems such as missing data for various periods remain unaddressed.            "
"40","To deal with these concerns, we develop a new IRT variant extending Johnson and Albert's (1999) hierarchical item response model by accounting for potential biases of 19 raters (e.g., major national newspapers or top legal journals) judging whether an EO is significant. This measure produces a continuous significance score for each EO issued after 1947. The resulting scale requires no arbitrary significance threshold, allowing us to see whether empirical results vary by thresholds distinguishing insignificant from significant EOs. Thus, in our analysis, we adopt continuous threshold levels, ranging from extremely low to quite high (with a maximum threshold of 2, as only 63 EOs exceed this level from 1947 to 2003, so going higher is of little interest).            "
"41","Given space constraints, we sketch our approach here, with a more detailed discussion reserved for our online Appendix C. Specifically, we start with Johnson and Albert's (1999) Bayesian hierarchical IRT model that Clinton and Lapinski (2006) apply to legislative significance. As the latter articulate, this model is useful because exogenous information for objects whose latent traits (e.g., ability or significance) are being estimated can be incorporated. This is especially beneficial when a majority of objects, such as legislation (or, in our case, EOs), will be mentioned by few raters if the distribution of raters’ thresholds is skewed high. If the included information is correlated with objects’ latent traits, introducing additional information can substantially help distinguish underlying traits.            "
"42","However, one remaining problem with this approach is that each rater may possess attributes impacting his or her evaluation of the object whose latent traits are being estimated. This feature is critical, as, without controlling for raters’ potential biases toward certain characteristics of objects, estimating underlying latent traits will be biased in a manner akin to omitted variable bias. Thus, for instance, if the Wall Street Journal focuses on macroeconomic issues, it will use a lower threshold for including related EOs than for orders covering other concerns, and not dealing with such predilections can lead to bias. As such, we extend the Johnson‐Albert model by incorporating exogenous explanatory variables to control for rater attributes. Thus, in estimating EO significance, we provide information about the nature of raters, specify the explanatory variables for significance that we use for these raters, and detail the exogenous variables incorporated.            "
"43","We utilize a variety of rater sources: historical overviews of EOs, national newspapers, general news magazines, politics and policy–focused magazines, and top law reviews (see online Appendix D for the full listing). For exogenous variables incorporated for estimating significance, we measure whether an EO is (1) policy oriented (Warber 2006); (2) in the first 100 days of a president's term; (3) after November 1st of a president's term; (4) by a Republican president; (5) during a period of divided government; (6) during a presidential transition; (7) related to routine administration matters (Warber 2006); (8) related to domestic issues; (9) employed to create a new government organization; (10) during a presidential election year; and (11) during a congressional election year.22 If such variables are relevant, they will help distinguish the significance level of EOs that have no, or only a small number of, rater mentions; if they are not important, estimates of EO significance will be unaffected except for slightly more variance. As mentioned, we include explanatory variables which will mitigate the negative impacts of any rater biases. For example, following Howell (2003, 2005), for the front page of the New York Times the average number of articles appearing in these front pages is added to control for its varying threshold over time. For the Wall Street Journal, we believe two issues—macroeconomics, and labor, employment, and immigration—tend to obtain more attention.23"
"44","To summarize, we analyze EOs issued from 1947 through 2003, totaling 3,513 EOs. There are 19 raters, 10 explanatory variables for raters, and 11 exogenous variables for significance. We run MCMC for each of these models for 100,000 iterations, the first 50,000 of which are thrown out. We save results for every 100th iteration.24"
"45","Figure 3 displays estimates of EO significance generated by our model. Scores range from −.994 to 3.491, with mean 0 and variance 0.677. As expected, a substantial percentage of EOs have little significance, with others being comparatively quite significant. The five EOs with the highest significance scores are EO 10925 (Kennedy's establishment of a committee on equal opportunity), EO 10340 (Truman's seizure of the steel industry), EO 12356 (Reagan's tightening of national security information disclosure, reversing a trend toward easing such disclosure), EO 12333 (Reagan's rule for CIA discretion for spying and the banning of political assassinations), and EO 11615 (Nixon's wage and price controls). These are certainly intuitively significant, as all were dealing with widely debated policies that were central to debates at their time of issuance.25"
"46","Our results (see online Appendix E) strongly demonstrate that both having a hierarchical structure for significance and controlling for rater attributes are beneficial. Comparing our model's estimates with an IRT model without a hierarchical structure shows that incorporating exogenous variables for significance substantially distinguishes the significance of less frequently mentioned EOs. This is especially pronounced for significance scores lower than 1. Most exogenous variables are quite important for establishing significance (online Appendix F), with the dummy variables for whether the EO is policy relevant, is at the beginning of a presidential term, and creates a new government organization all especially significant. Introducing explanatory variables for raters also proves fruitful in discriminating significance levels. Interestingly, relative to adding the hierarchical structure, these control variables affect EO significance levels more evenly. The maximized difference is .25, and the mean difference is about .05."
"47","Overall, then, controlling for rater attributes boosts the reliability of our dependent variable.26 Rather than include rater attributes ad hoc as independent variables in explaining the number of significant EOs, our method makes it possible to control for them directly in estimating the level of significance. Moreover, given our suspicion that some media raters focus more on some issues than others, controlling for such attributes is important. Once we do so, significance estimates of many moderately significant EOs change and the discrimination ability of some raters improves. Thus, we improve upon significance measures relative to past research in that we have more confidence in our measure, and this measure is continuous.            "
"48","For independent variables, we eschew variables just because they have been put in one empirical study or another. Our sample size is too small for such a litany,27 and doing so is inconsistent with testing our competing theoretical models. In other words, we focus on theoretically derived hypotheses and the variables that they suggest including.            "
"49","Regarding variables specifically derived from our competing models, we include for all three models a dummy variable for first term, scored 1 if a new president's party is different from his predecessor's in his first term and 0 otherwise (online Appendix G provides descriptive data for all independent variables). For the unilateral and chamber median models, we also include the length of the right and left EGI tails. To ensure comparability among chambers and across Congresses, we use common space scores to determine the ideal point of the filibuster and override pivots and the chamber medians (Poole 1998).28 To reiterate, the right EGI tail is the interval between the median and the override pivot closer to the president, while the left tail is that between the median and the filibuster farther away from the president. These two variables are correlated at −.285. Whether the right EGI tail has a positive or null impact on the dependent variable is key for distinguishing whether the unilateralism or the chamber compliance model performs better empirically.            "
"50","As discussed, for the partisan compliance model, the key variable is divided government, which we measure as a dummy variable. We also include the interaction term between unified government and the left and the right EGI tails, but each of these variables is substantially correlated with divided government (at an absolute value greater than .89).29 Moreover, given our model sample size and that there are only 10 Congresses with unified government, we have a limited ability to examine the interaction of unified government with EGI tails.            "
"51","Tables 1 and 2 display negative binomial regression results for our three models.30 To show our findings concisely, we only present results with discrete significance thresholds and mention any discrepancies between such thresholds (results are very much continuous). One pronounced pattern is that the first‐term variable is almost always significant and correctly signed. From this vantage point, all three models receive support. However, support for the universalism model is undermined, as the right‐tail EGI coefficient is sometimes significant but always wrongly signed. The same is true of the left‐tail EGI, the main variable for the chamber compliance model. As such, neither model receives much support.            "
"52","By contrast, as Table 2 shows, the partisan compliance model receives very strong support.31 As divided government and the interaction terms between unified government and the EGI tails are extremely correlated with one another, for each threshold, we first present results without the interaction terms and then with them. Except for thresholds exceeding 1.65, without the interaction terms divided government always has the predicted negative effect on significant EOs with statistical significance. Holding all other variables constant, divided government decreases the expected number of EOs around 30%, except for thresholds exceeding 1.5. Beyond the latter threshold, the effect gradually diminishes. Note that, as discussed with respect to the so‐called evasion hypothesis, while previous studies also find significant evidence that divided government dampens EO production, our analysis is distinguished in that we find this relationship virtually regardless of EO significance threshold.            "
"53","When we include interaction terms, holding the mean of the two EGI tails constant, divided government's effect is negative and statistically significant up to a threshold of 1.5.32 The joint test on divided government and the two interaction terms between unified government and the left and right EGI tails rejects the null hypothesis that these three variables simultaneously equal zero (the sign of the first interaction is always correct while that of the second one is not), except for thresholds over 1.05. Due to serious multicollinearity, the sign of the interaction term between unified government and the left‐tail EGI is seemingly wrong, but it becomes consistent with our theoretical expectation once we drop the extremely correlated variables.33"
"54","Overall, the partisan compliance model receives much stronger empirical support than the chamber compliance and unilateralism models.34 Admittedly, the partisan model tends to do worse with very high significance thresholds, suggesting that there either is just not enough variance in the dependent variable or the model is limited in explaining very significant EOs.            "
"55","Nonetheless, our results strongly suggest that presidential unilateral action is not as indicated in the unilateralism model. This is striking, given that presidential unilateral action has so often been depicted as resulting in unilateral power. Our findings clearly reject this presumption and, instead, imply that so‐called presidential lawmaking involves bargaining and reaching agreement with other actors. In the context of previous literature, our results are in the spirit of consistent findings rejecting the evasion theory and make such results no longer appear anomalous."
"56","It has become fashionable among political scientists and legal scholars to assert that presidential power has been underappreciated, that the importance of the chief executive's constitutional position and the tools of influence that go with it are not fully recognized. While we agree with the general point that institutional position is key and that presidential influence should be seen as stemming from the strategic context in which the chief executive operates, our analysis suggests that we should be careful in how we assess power. When we specify models based on different assumptions about discretion, we find subtle relationships that we did not previously recognize and competing hypotheses. Empirical analysis points to only one model receiving strong support."
"57","Thus, when it comes to unilateral acts, the amount of power—the ability to move the status quo without some form of approval from the other key political players—that goes with unilateralism should not be overstated.35 A model including responsiveness to legislative party medians does best in explaining significant acts. This implies that the underlying process generating executive orders is more akin to separation‐of‐powers bargaining than a president acting, daring others to respond—with Congress unable to mobilize due to collective‐action problems or policy gridlock and the courts generally compliant—and winning most of the time.         "
"58","Our findings do not mean that the president is never powerful. There may be specific occasions where the chief acts in an unconstrained manner akin to the unilateralism model. But they suggest that in the larger scheme, other political actors, notably legislative parties or their surrogates in the courts, typically must acquiesce. Perhaps this should not surprise us, given both acknowledgment in the mainstream Congress literature that legislators have abilities to impact outcomes that go beyond passing a statute to move a status quo directly and the great emphasis in recent years on parties within Congress, including analysis specifically highlighting the importance of parties in producing legislative outputs (Chiou and Rothenberg 2003).         "
"59","Clearly there is room for additional work. There are obvious potential theoretical extensions and uses of our new EO significance measure. Also, as our third model does not explain the EO data when very high significance thresholds are adopted, we may want to consider theoretically and empirically whether these EOs are characterized by a different underlying process than other EOs. Finally, qualitative analysis investigating what negotiating actually does or does not go on over unilateral acts with our theoretical alternatives in mind would be illuminating; it would be interesting, reviving Neustadt in a sense, if we could ascertain whether some chief executives seem better at bargaining along these lines than others."
