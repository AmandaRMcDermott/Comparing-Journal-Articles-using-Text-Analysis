"1","Conceptually, we can distinguish between electoral environments where the “personal vote” is important and those where party labels dominate. As Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina write, “A representative highly sensitive to local concerns can be locally responsible and nationally irresponsible. Pork barrel projects are the classic example. … [T]he parochial pressures institutionalized in single‐member districts must be offset or overridden by some formal or informal mechanisms. Examples of formal mechanisms include cabinet governments and restrictions on private member bills. An example of an informal mechanism is a strong party system” (1987, 209–10).            "
"2"," Nielson puts the intuition this way: “The personal vote, where politicians pursue votes based on their individual popularity that they heighten through promises of pork and patronage, makes politicians beholden to narrow constituencies and relatively indifferent to national policy goals. The personal vote thus undermines public‐goods production. On the other hand, votes aggregated at the level of the party have a greater chance of motivating politicians to pursue nationally oriented public‐goods policies. Party leaders, charged with attending to the collective electoral prospects of their rank‐and‐file members, have a much greater stake in national policy outcomes, including the provision of public goods. In party‐centered systems they can discipline back‐benchers in a joint pursuit of collective welfare” (2002, 11).            "
"3","To formalize this intuition, let α≥ 1 denote a legislator's relative preference for distributive versus public goods; a higher value of α indicates that the legislator weights distributive goods more heavily in his or her utility function. The value of α is determined by several different factors, one of which is the degree to which politics is personalistic rather than party oriented. To the extent that political parties have weak organizations, and campaigning and elections are candidate centered, α will be higher. Candidates who cannot rely on parties will value distributive spending more highly because it provides a way to secure the personal vote directly (e.g., Ames 2001) or indirectly via increased campaign contributions (e.g., Samuels 2002). Under these circumstances legislators put more weight on distributive spending that flows to their districts. If political parties have strong organizations and are important sources of campaign resources for candidates, legislators will put less weight on distributive spending, leading to lower values of α.8"
"4","The mechanism by which strong parties alter α can be understood by considering an electoral production function f which translates distributive goods (zi), support from the party benefitting all candidates (r), candidate‐specific support from the party (ri), and other inputs such as candidates' campaign spending and policy positions into an election outcome. Assuming that  and , then a decline in party support will increase the value of distributive goods that can be used for credit claiming—i.e., increase α. (Support here need not be financial; it also includes the value of the party “brand,” voter mobilization, and other activities of the parties that benefit a candidate.) Of course, the strength of an opponent's political party may cause a legislator to demand more distributive spending to fend off a challenger with strong party support. However, this effect is unlikely to be very large, since legislators are unlikely to be able to alter levels of distributive spending very quickly in the presence of a strong challenger. Moreover, the incumbent's party is likely to devote considerable resources to close races, and a party can more easily reallocate resources than a legislator can redirect distributive spending. What about intraparty competition? Competitive primary elections reinforce our theory. If party organizations are strong, then one thing they can do is prevent primary challengers from emerging. If parties are weak, then incumbents will need to rely more on distributive spending to fend off primary challengers. Our analysis, therefore, applies to situations where one party dominates the landscape but lacks strong party organizations, leading to frequent primary competition—as in the South during much of the twentieth century.            "
"5","The idea that redistribution and/or distributive spending are traded off against other electoral resources is well established in the theoretical literature on elections. For instance, a series of models studying the targeting of redistribution to swing voters or partisan voters emphasizes the trade‐off between distributive spending and policy in influencing voters (e.g., Cox and McCubbins 1986; Dixit and Londregan 1995; Lindbeck and Weibull 1987). Others, like McGillivray (2004) and Golden and Picci (2008), argue that the strength of parties will influence whether close seats or safe seats are targeted for redistribution in single‐member districts, with strong parties targeting redistribution to marginal seats; we do not model this here.9 Of course, many other factors go into the determination of α.10 We are interested in how changes in party strength influence α and, in turn, equilibrium behavior. All that we require for α and party strength to be related is that distributive spending and party organization are both electoral resources and that distributive spending can serve as a substitute for the electoral benefits of a strong party organization. If distributive spending confers direct electoral benefits on legislators in the form of vote share, then as parties get weaker and party support declines, the benefits from distributive spending will be more valuable to legislators, all else equal.11 As a result, the value of a given dollar of distributive spending, relative to public goods spending, increases. This is captured by a higher α. Whether this effect is large or small is an empirical matter.            "
"6","Let N be the total number of citizens in a state or country who are partitioned into n odd and equally sized districts, with m =N/n denoting the number of citizens in each district. There are two types of goods—a pure public good that benefits all districts, and a distributive good that benefits a single district. Let X be the total amount spent on the public good. The public good provides a benefit of b(X) to each citizen, where b′ > 0 and b < 0. Let zi be the per capita amount spent on distributive goods in district i; this spending only benefits the citizens of district i. Let z= (z1, …, zn) be the vector of per capita distributive spending, and let  be the total amount spent on distributive goods. Then the total cost of public spending is c(X +Z), where c(0) = 0, c′ > 1, and c″ > 0, accounting for the deadweight costs of taxation. We also assume that c′ (0) < N b′ (0) (otherwise, spending on the public good is always undesirable) and that deadweight costs are not so great that citizens and legislators prefer no distributive spending even when costs are shared across districts. Assume that all costs are divided equally among citizens. Begin with the assumption that legislators maximize the payoffs of citizens in the district; we relax this assumption below when we incorporate party strength into the model.            "
"7","The total payoff to the citizens in district i is               "
"8","The total payoff for citizens in all districts is                "
"9","This model is set up so that only public goods are produced at the social optimum, defined here as the (X, z) that maximizes (2).12 Intuitively, the presence of distributive goods increases the costs of providing public goods, leading to underprovision of the latter. Since taxation entails deadweight costs, the costs of providing distributive goods in this model always exceed the benefits. Although distributive goods are not provided at a social optimum, legislators and voters prefer a positive level of distributive spending because the costs of distributive goods are spread out across all districts.13 Cost‐sharing makes distributive spending relatively more attractive. Because some positive level of distributive spending is optimal for each district and deadweight costs of taxation are present, the cost of providing the public good will increase, leading the legislator to prefer a smaller‐than‐socially‐optimal public good. These relationships are summarized as follows:14"
"10","Remark 1 The socially optimal division of spending is for all funds to be allocated to the public good and none to distributive projects.               "
"11","Remark 2 Legislators prefer public goods that are smaller than socially optimal and distributive projects for their district that are larger than socially optimal.               "
"12","Now, let z−i denote the vector of per capita distributive spending in all districts other than district i, and let  be total distributive spending in all districts other than i. The payoff to legislator i is               "
"13","As a thought experiment, suppose that each legislator could unilaterally select the project for his or her district. Now consider the action of one legislator who does the same and also selects the size of the public good. This “universalistic” setup is similar to that in Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen (1981), except with the addition of a public good and a weight on distributive spending. As legislators weight distributive projects more heavily, they will naturally demand more of them and, in turn, demand less of the public good. The net effect is to increase total spending because, overall, the benefit of the combined public and distributive good has increased, while the costs of taxation have remain unchanged. Conversely, as distributive goods are de‐emphasized, spending will decline, for the same reasons. This result establishes an alternative explanation for why strong parties may dampen the tendency toward overspending implied by a norm of universalism.            "
"14","Remark 3 Under a norm of universalism, as party organizations in the electorate become stronger, legislators collectively will select smaller amounts of distributive projects for their districts and larger public goods benefiting all districts. The net effect of these changes is to reduce total spending.               "
"15","It is straightforward to show that the same type of result holds in a bargaining setting. A legislature L must select a vector consisting of a public good X and a vector of distributive projects z, defined above. The game is an infinite‐horizon bargaining model with the following structure, similar to that in Baron and Ferejohn (1989). The legislature operates under a q‐rule, . A randomly chosen agenda setter proposes a public good and distributive projects as part of an omnibus bill. Bargaining proceeds under a closed rule, which means that no amendments are allowed. If the bill passes, the game ends. If it fails, a new agenda setter is chosen to make a new proposal. The game continues until a bill passes, with 0 < δ≤ 1 accounting for delay in bargaining. Let v be the continuation value of the game for a legislator offered a project by the agenda setter.            "
"16","The equilibrium concept is subgame perfect Nash in stationary strategies, where players must take the same actions at every node in which the game is structurally identical. This means that in every period, the same equilibrium offers will be made."
"17","We are interested in answering three questions: (1) What are the effects of changes in party strength on public goods spending? (2) What are the effects of changes in party strength on distributive spending? (3) What are the effects of changes in party strength on total spending?"
"18","Proposition 1  In the stationary subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the game, total spending is decreasing in party organizational strength in the electorate, spending on public goods is increasing in party organizational strength, and spending on distributive goods is declining in party organizational strength.                "
"19","The motivation for this proposition is as follows. As party strength in the electorate increases, legislators will demand less of the distributive good at any price.16 This has a downward effect on distributive spending. Because of the deadweight costs of taxation, this makes the public good relatively less expensive, leading legislators to demand more of the good. The net effect is to reduce spending because the impact of a change in party strength has a large, direct impact on demand for distributive projects by changing their benefits, while it has a smaller, indirect effect on public goods spending by reducing the deadweight costs of taxation. The agenda setter, in constructing proposals, wishes to secure a larger public good and less distributive spending, since he is able to build a coalition more cheaply in this way once the value of distributive spending declines. Absent any conception of party strength, the public good is inefficiently small in the equilibrium, while the distributive good is inefficiently large. Party strength moves both the size of the public good and the size of distributive spending in a more efficient direction. Two additional results are worth noting.               "
"20","Remark 4 As the size of the majority required for bill passage increases, spending on distributive goods decreases, spending on public goods increases, and total spending decreases.               "
"21","Intuitively, as the coalition required for bill passage increases, more of the costs are internalized by the agenda setter, who has to take into account the welfare of coalition members in constructing optimal proposals. In fact, unanimity rule achieves the optimal outcome when legislators are perfectly patient. The reason is that under unanimity rule the agenda setter fully internalizes the welfare of all legislators and is therefore acting as if he or she is the social planner. Of course, the advantages of unanimity rule for efficiency may be counteracted by other considerations, such as holdup costs in bargaining, especially with imperfect information about preferences."
"22","Remark 5 Changing the number of districts has no effect on total spending on distributive goods, spending on public goods, or total spending, as long as the proportion of votes required to pass a proposal (q/n) is unchanged.               "
"23","This follows directly from the first order conditions of the proposer's maximization problem. Increasing the number of districts would have effects if the majority threshold (q) was held fixed, but it seems more reasonable to think of q/n as fixed.17"
"24","In sum, whether examining individual legislator preferences, adopting a decision‐theoretic approach, or using a bargaining model, party strength limits distributive spending, increases spending on worthwhile public goods projects, and reduces spending overall. We now turn to U.S. state spending and federal aid data to examine the impact of party strength empirically."
"25","We focus on one of the comparative statics from the second section, studying the impact of party strength on the total size of state government spending and federal aid to the states.18 The analysis proceeds in two ways. One emphasizes cross‐sectional variation in party strength across states. The other takes advantage of over‐time variation in strength within states, using panel analysis and, as a first cut, differences‐in‐differences (DD) estimation.19 The cross‐sectional analysis focuses on the time period 1957–1970, and the analysis leveraging over‐time variation utilizes the time period 1957–2000.20 Our specifications rely on ordinary least squares with year and state fixed effects employed, as appropriate. To address heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation in the data, we use clustered standard errors with clustering by state in all but the DD analysis (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004).21"
"26","To the extent that parties are well organized, they are better positioned to provide the sorts of electoral resources that substitute for distributive projects. At the state level, this should lead to lower government spending. At the federal level, this should lead to lower levels of aid because the members of Congress from that state can rely more on party support.22"
"27","There are many ways to measure party organizational strength. Our conception of party strength is not related to the parties' relative positions in the legislature, so straightforward measures such as seat shares will not be used except as controls. We wish to focus, instead, on measures that are related to “parties in the electorate” and “parties as organizations” rather than “parties in government” (Key 1964). We measure the capacity of parties as electoral organizations using an analysis of the historical record.         "
"28","Party organizational strength within the legislature may be correlated with party organizational strength outside of the legislature. To the extent that this is the case, our measure of party electoral strength may also be tapping party legislative strength. We deal with this in two ways. First, we include measures of strong party organizations in legislatures as a control variable in some specifications, showing that the inclusion of such variables does not change the impact of party electoral strength. Second, we show that states with strong parties in the electorate tend to receive lower levels of federal aid, suggesting that members of Congress do not seek out as much aid for their states since doing so is not as important electorally if parties provide resources. By focusing on decisions made within Congress, we are able to hold party strength in the legislature constant with year fixed effects.23 Combined, these checks support the claim that the measure of party electoral strength is tapping the impact of electoral, and not internal legislative, party strength.         "
"29","The variable Party Organization is based on the comprehensive study by Mayhew mentioned in the introduction. As Mayhew writes, “[L]ocal party organizations of several kinds have decisively declined since the 1960s in their ability to influence nominating processes for local, state, or national office, bringing to an end practices in some cases a century or more old. The 1950s and 1960s were a golden age of sorts for American local organization. … All [party organizations] fared very badly in the 1970s, largely losing out to candidate organizations that introduced capital‐intensive campaigns” (1986, 329–30). Mayhew classified 13 states as having very strong party organizations during the 1950s and 1960s based on his reading of the historical literature, taking into account elements of party organizations such as their autonomy, internal structure, role in candidate nominations, and reliance on material rather than purposive incentives. While the scores are therefore somewhat subjective, they represent a massive amount of work and the synthesis of a vast literature.            "
"30","We define Party Organization = 1 for states with TPO scores of 4 or 5 (CT, DE, IL, IN, KY, MD, MO, NJ, NY, OH, PA, RI, WV), and Party Organization = 0 otherwise. In the analysis for 1957–2000, we set Party Organization = 0 for all years after 1970, in keeping with Mayhew's observation that electoral party organizations in the states essentially collapsed post‐1970. In the next section, we present evidence justifying this approach. Endogeneity of party strength is not a concern here because the decline of parties is largely orthogonal to fiscal decision making.            "
"31","The unit of analysis is the state. We use data for 46 states. Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states for some of the years in the dataset, Nebraska has a nonpartisan unicameral legislature, and Minnesota had a nonpartisan legislature for a large fraction of the time period under study."
"32","In the analysis of federal aid, the dependent variable is the log of total real federal aid per capita in 1970 dollars, adjusted using consumer price index (CPI) deflators (Ln Fed Aid Per Capita (State+Local)). In the state spending analysis, the dependent variable is the log of total real state plus local general expenditures per capita in 1970 dollars, adjusted using CPI deflators (Ln State Spending Per Capita (State + Local)). As a robustness check, we also use state‐level‐only spending in our analysis (Ln State Spending Per Capita (State‐Only)). We have also run this analysis using levels of instead of logs of financial variables; we indicate in the results section whenever the results are affected by using alternative measures.            "
"33","We also include standard control variables in the analysis. These include income (Ln Income Per Capita), population (Ln Population), population density (Ln Density), percent elderly (Elderly), percent school age (Schoolage), the share of state legislative seats held by Democrats (Dem Leg Seat Share),24 the average Democratic vote share in the state over the past 10 years (Avg Dem Vote Share), presence of divided government (Divided Govt), a dummy for southern states (South), the number of seats in each state legislative chamber divided by 100 (Upper House Seats and Lower House Seats) (Gilligan and Matsusaka 1995, 2001), and a dummy indicating whether a state has the direct initiative (Initiative) (Matsusaka 1995).25 In the specifications with state spending as a dependent variable, federal aid (Ln Fed Aid Per Capita (State + Local)) is also included as a control. We omit this variable from some specifications as a robustness check.            "
"34","In some specifications we also include a measure of party organizational strength within the legislature for the 1950s and 1960s (Legislative Party Strength). During part of this time period, Zeller (1954) conducted a survey of experts in state politics and constructed a measure of party cohesion in the legislature. We use this measure for the time period 1957–1970, coding it 1 if Zeller identified the state as having strong parties, and 0 otherwise. (We lack a reliable measure of legislative party strength after 1970, so we only use the Zeller measure in the pre‐1970 period.) Seventeen states have strong parties in the legislature. Of the 46 states in our sample, 10 states are categorized differently by Mayhew and Zeller.            "
"35","State spending, population, and income data are from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Government Finances, and State Government Finances databases. Other demographic variables are taken from the decennial census and imputed for years between censuses. Data on the distribution of legislative seats, chamber sizes, and convention rules are from Burnham (1985) and The Book of the States (various years). Data on citizen initiatives are from the Initiative and Referendum Institute. The election data used in the analysis are taken from a large number of sources—secretary of state reports, state manuals and blue books, and in some cases newspapers (see Ansolabehere and Snyder 2002 for details).            "
"36"," Mayhew (1986) argues that most, if not all, strong party organizations declined sharply by the mid‐1970s. There is other evidence consistent with Mayhew's claim. First, split‐ticket voting increased markedly during the 1960s and 1970s, and on into the 1980s. Even more interestingly, split‐ticket voting increased noticeably more in the states that had strong party organizations compared to other states. An examination of aggregate electoral data and the American National Election Studies (ANES) confirms this.         "
"37","For the ANES analysis, we examined respondents' vote choices for president, governor, U.S. senator, and U.S. House representative. We define a “split ticket” as a case where a respondent reported voting for a Democrat for at least one of these offices and Republican for at least one of these offices in the same year. The variable is zero for all respondents who reported voting for at least two of these offices (and therefore could have split their ticket) and either reported voting only for Democrats or only for Republicans."
"38","For the aggregate voting analysis, we use state‐level data on all statewide offices up and down the ballot—president, governor, U.S. senator, as well as down‐ballot offices such as lieutenant governor, attorney general, state treasurer, secretary of state, and state auditor. We define the average level of “ticket splitting” as the standard deviation of Democratic vote share across all available offices in a given state in a given year.26"
"39","The results are shown in Table 1. Regardless of the measure used, the estimated amount of split‐ticket voting is higher in the post‐1970 period than in the pre‐1970 period. But the growth in split‐ticket voting is much more impressive in the states defined as having strong party organizations pre‐1970. In these states the fraction of split tickets rose from 20% to 34%, and the standard deviation measure grew from .029 to .073. In the states defined as having weak parties in both periods, the growth was more modest: a split‐ticketing increase from 26% to 31%, and a standard deviation increase from .052 to .080. Also, in the pre‐1970 period the gap in split‐ticket voting was quite large and in the expected direction, with significantly lower levels of split‐ticket voting observed in states with strong party organizations. For the standard deviation measure, the average gap between the groups closed in the second period, leaving a small and statistically insignificant difference. For the ANES measure the difference reversed, and the (formerly) strong party states appear to have slightly higher levels of split‐ticket voting in the second period; this difference, though, is dwarfed by the over‐time differences.27"
"40"," Table 2 presents the results of the federal aid analysis. We present several specifications. The first includes only year fixed effects and income. The second adds additional controls. The third adds population density. The final specification adds the Zeller measure. Table 6 presents the results of a specification with all control variables included.            "
"41","For the period 1957–1970, the estimated coefficient on Party Organization is substantively and statistically significant in the simplest specifications (columns 1 and 2 of Table 2). The coefficient becomes statistically and substantively insignificant, however, once population density is added to the specification. Strong party organizations and machines emerged especially in urban areas in the northeastern United States, and these areas were not as powerful politically in Washington as were rural (mostly Southern) areas for much of this time, when committee‐centered politics was the norm (e.g., Rohde 1991; Shepsle 1989). For instance, in 1964 a disproportionate share (71%) of major committee chairs were from rural areas (Wolfinger and Heifetz 1965), and there is strong evidence that their influence directed significant federal funds, especially agriculture spending, to rural areas (McCubbins and Schwartz 1988). Another reason states with dense urban areas tend to receive less aid on a per capita basis may be related to costs. It is often cheaper to provide the same level of goods and services in urban areas than in areas with widely dispersed groups of individuals. Therefore, the same task can often be accomplished with less funding. In sum, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of party organization and population density without variation within states. We explore this further in the next section along with additional interpretations.            "
"42","The coefficient on Legislative Party Strength is marginally statistically significant, even with population density included.28 The point estimate implies that states with strong parties in the legislature received about 11% less aid than states without strong parties in the legislature.29 One reason for this effect might be that legislators in these states were spending less at the state level and therefore were not eligible for as much federal aid, since much federal aid is explicitly or implicitly in the form of matching grants.            "
"43","The results presented in Table 3 show that TPO has a statistically and substantively significant effect on spending. Spending is about 7% lower in states with strong party organizations during this time period. The full specification appears in Table 6.            "
"44","The result is robust in the pre‐1970 period to the inclusion of the Zeller measure of legislative party strength, suggesting that TPO is tapping electoral party organization. In fact, Legislative Party Strength is not statistically significant in the spending analysis, whether Party Organization is in the specification or not. While parties in legislatures may very well act as a restraint on spending, our results show that what happens outside of the legislature is also important. These results strengthen the extant empirical work linking parties and government spending.            "
"45","We now consider the longer period, over which party organizations across the country have declined in strength. As a first cut, we collapse the data and conduct a simple differences‐in‐differences (DD) analysis. With a complete set of controls included, the estimates imply that states which moved from strong parties to weak parties in the 1970s experienced an 18% larger increase in federal aid than states that had weak parties in both time periods. Similarly, states which moved from strong parties to weak parties in the 1970s experienced a 4% larger increase in spending than those that had weak parties in both time periods."
"46","The results of a full panel analysis are similar to the differences‐in‐differences findings. Table 4 shows that party organization has a negative and statistically significant effect on aid to the states. States with strong parties in the electorate receive about 20% less aid than states with weak parties. This result is similar to the 1957–1970 analysis when density is not included as an independent variable. The result is robust to state fixed effects—which when combined with year fixed effects is another form of DD—as the final column in Table 4 indicates. Table 6 provides the results for all variables.30"
"47"," Table 5 shows that states with strong party organizations spend at least 4% less than those states with weak party organizations.31 This negative relationship is robust to state fixed effects, as column (5) of the table shows. (Full results are available in Table 6.) When we omit the federal aid variable in the full analysis with state fixed effects, the effect increases to 9%. Including the federal aid variable sharply reduces the estimated impact of party organizational strength in part because aid is itself affected negatively by party strength. Without federal aid in the analysis the party strength variable is doing “double duty,” accounting for both the direct effect of party organization on spending as well as its indirect effect via changes in aid. Thus, the specification that includes federal aid is probably conservative, understating the total effect of party strength.         "
"48"," Mayhew (1986) was one of the first scholars to point out the possible link between spending and party strength, and probably the first to show how strong the relationship is empirically. It is important, therefore, to compare our argument and analysis with his.         "
"49","Mayhew discussed five possible explanations for this relationship: (1) “in regimes infused by traditional organization the inherent impulse to generate ambitious governmental programs is likely to be relatively weak. This is true for two reasons: the sorts of people attracted to organization politics are relatively unlikely to have much of a program‐building bent, given party incentive structures; and the particularism required for organizational maintenance may tend to crowd out other kinds of government activity”; (2)“interest groups of a program‐building inclination (some unions, for example) seem to have a hard time exercising influence in a milieu of traditional organization”; (3)“the evident relative issuelessness of electoral politics in organization environments” leads to smaller government, while “an electoral politics built on raising and addressing issues may promote government action”; (4)“the patronage needs of traditional organization inhibit the installation of a professionalized bureaucracy, and thereby fend off the rationalizing and also expansionary impulses of bureaucracy that are likely to generate both expenditure and revenue in a governmental setting”; (5) traditional party organizations carry with them “a distinctive American tradition… of politics as a spectator sport with a deep pessimism … about the potential positive use of government” (Mayhew 1986, 292–95).         "
"50","Explanations (2) and (4) are related. Explanation (4) refers to the type of bureaucracy that is likely to emerge when strong parties engage in patronage hiring compared to one in which a professionalized bureaucracy emerges. Measures of employment and salaries are available for the time period under study, but determining whether large numbers of employees represent a professionalized bureaucracy or a patronage machine is not possible. However, the strength of a bureaucracy is closely tied to the interest group environment of a state. If interest groups are unsuccessful in securing the creation of large programs, which may occur in strong party states (Explanation 2), this will be reflected in part by a weak bureaucracy that is not centered around program creation and maintenance. The Zeller (1954) study referenced above includes a measure of interest group strength in a state. Of the 45 states with both measures of electoral party strength and interest group strength available, only one (KY) has both strong electoral parties and strong interest groups and nine are weak on both grounds. Therefore, there is a very strong negative connection between the strength of interest groups (and perhaps, by extension, the bureaucracy) and the strength of parties. This relationship is consistent with our argument.         "
"51","Explanations (1), (3), and (5) all suggest that areas with strong electoral party organizations will tend to produce politicians who lack ambitious programs for using government to solve perceived social problems. That is, they should produce fiscally conservative politicians who typically prefer a small government that does not try to do much, not liberals with large, sweeping agendas. We can test this by examining the average ideology of legislators elected from states with strong versus weak party organizations. Within party, we should see a significant positive correlation between organizational strength scores and conservatism.         "
"52","As a modest first step in this direction, we study states' representatives and senators in the U.S. Congress. We use Poole and Rosenthal's (2007) DW‐NOMINATE scores to measure ideology. These are computed from roll‐call voting records and are among the most widely used measures in the congressional literature. The range of scores is −1 to +1, with −1 being the most liberal score and +1 being the most conservative. Paralleling the analyses above, we estimate a simple cross‐sectional specification for members elected from 1956 to 1970, as well as a DD specification over the entire period 1956–2000. We control for party in both specifications."
"53","In the interest of space we summarize the results very briefly. In the cross‐sectional analyses the estimated coefficients on Party Organization are −.014 for representatives and −.011 for senators—these are both statistically and substantively insignificant. In the DD analysis the estimated coefficient on Party Organization is −.015 for representatives and .009 for senators—again, these are statistically insignificant and substantively trivial. Thus, both the cross‐sectional and DD results show no significant differences between states with strong party organizations and other states. This contradicts the main thrust of explanations (1), (3), and (5).         "
"54","This article has offered a new understanding of how and why strong political parties change the preferences of legislators for distributive spending versus public goods. While much of the literature on parties and spending in the United States has focused on the role of parties in the legislature, we have shown how the environment outside the legislature, especially the electoral situation, can have a significant impact on decisions made inside the legislature. Moreover, party organizational structure outside the legislature may be one of the more important aspects shaping how the electoral environment affects legislator behavior. To summarize our perspective, legislators in political parties that offer significant resources in elections receive a smaller return on distributive spending, since the “personal vote” and credit claiming are less important than in a world with weak parties. This has the direct effect of reducing the demand for distributive spending and the indirect effect of increasing the demand for spending on public goods benefitting all districts, with a net effect of producing lower and more efficient spending. Using data from 1957–2000, we demonstrate that U.S. states with strong parties have consistently spent less than states with weak parties. We also find some evidence that during this time period, states with strong party organizations received less in federal aid, consistent with the idea that members of Congress from strong party states felt less of a need to bring aid back home.

"55","Our model and empirical findings for the United States fit naturally into a large comparative literature that provides both intuition and a substantive foundation for connecting party organizations and government spending. This literature focuses on individual countries as well as cross‐national data analyses and theoretical explorations.32 The single‐country studies provide evidence of the link between pork and party strength. For instance, Keefer and Khemani (2009) use data from constituency development funds in India to show that legislators in party strongholds are less likely to secure pork for their constituents. The theoretical and cross‐national literature, which typically focuses on the influence of party fragmentation, electoral systems, and federalism, reinforces the link between parties and spending. For instance, Rodden (2005) shows that countries in which the same party has tight control of national and subnational governments tend to spend less because party cohesion prevents subnational governments from behaving irresponsibly in anticipation of a federal bailout.         "
"56","The formal and empirical results presented in our article, together with the larger comparative literature, suggest promising directions for future work. For example, we need tighter comparisons across electoral systems, perhaps case studies exploiting changes within countries. We also need more objective measures of party organizational strength that are comparable over time. In addition, our article raises new substantive questions. Does stronger party organizational structure in the electoral environment translate into greater party cohesion in legislative voting? Our current model cannot address this, but one could imagine a model in which weights on taxation and/or the benefits of public goods, influenced by party, could have such an impact."
