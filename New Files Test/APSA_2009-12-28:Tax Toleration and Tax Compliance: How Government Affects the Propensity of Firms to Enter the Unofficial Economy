"1","Consider private firms endowed with fixed stocks of capital  and variable labor requirements in two nonexclusive modes of potential production: official production yielding declared output yo that is subject to taxation, and unofficial production yielding undeclared output yu that evades taxation. Lo denotes labor employed officially and Lu denotes labor employed unofficially. Assume that wage rates w are the same for all workers but that an employer's labor cost in official activity is (1 + tw) · w, where the labor tax rate tw subsumes the formal payroll tax rate tL and regulations on officially employed labor RL that impose costs that are functionally equivalent to conventional labor taxes.4 k denotes the fraction of its capital that the firm allocates to official production and (1 − k) is the fraction allocated to unofficial production.5 A firm's total output ytotal is the sum of its official output yo and its unofficial output yu .  ytotal may be comprised of separate production chains operating independently at different locales in official yo and/or unofficial yu mode, or by parallel operation of the two modes at one venue.

"3","Production of unofficial, untaxed output yu can take no benefit of government institutional services. In principle, yu and yo denote goods and services of the same kind and quality. However, in order to employ capital and labor underground and avoid confiscation of unofficial output by omniscient bureaucrats, firms pursuing unofficial operations must engage in corrupt transactions with enforcement officials—tax authorities, health and safety inspection agents, construction site inspectors, and so forth.9 Inputs of bureaucratic corruption are therefore necessary for a firm to produce and market unofficial output. The quantity of those inputs is denoted by units of “C.” Unofficial production technology has the same parameters and functional form as official technology:            "
"4","By contrast to some previous studies that view corruption and bribery as forces driving firms out of official production into the underground economy,10equation (2) is based on the idea that the “grabbing hands” of corrupt bureaucrats serve as “helping hands” allowing firms to exploit profitable opportunities by producing unofficially.         "
"5","A profit‐maximizing firm needs to decide how much labor to employ officially and unofficially,11 how to distribute its capital stock between the two production modes, and how much corruption to buy from corruptible bureaucrats.12 Firms are price takers and output prices are normalized to 1 so that revenue is coterminous with output. The firm maximizes net revenue π by solving the problem            "
"6","In any given jurisdiction corruption is supplied monopolistically by a representative public official (a “bureaucrat”) who is responsible for enforcing the tax code and other regulations. The enforcement bureaucrat is assumed able to accurately detect a firm's unofficial activity but is willing to overlook it if compensated sufficiently by illegal payments.13 The bureaucrat receives a salary equal to S. If involved in corrupt transactions and not caught, the bureaucrat enjoys additional income from bribes equal to m · C. If discovered to be selling corruption, the bureaucrat loses employment and pays a fixed penalty P. The bureaucrat's expected income E(yb) then is               "
"7","The probability θ is determined by an exogenous (unmodeled) mechanism exposing corruption               "
"8","The bureaucrat's problem is to set a price m per unit of corruption that maximizes expected income (4), subject to (5) and the firm's demand for corruption. The optimal solution to the bureaucrat's problem yields the supply relation16"
"9","Along with institutional services B directly affecting productivity of official activity, national realizations of μ,  S, and P comprise important aspects of a country's broader institutional capacity. If that broader national capacity were introduced explicitly and indexed by  then B,  μ,  S, and P would be constituent components. B and {μ, S, P} are treated as structurally distinct even though they generally will be correlated positively by virtue of an underlying common national determinant  left outside the model's formal setup to economize on notation.18 Indeed there is some gain in so doing because focusing on components of  like B and {μ, S, P} allows theoretical analysis later in this section of specific proximate demand‐ and supply‐side determinants of unofficial activity and tax evasion, and at the same time it does not detract from the empirical analyses reported in the third section.            "
"10","Assume that the firm has perfect information about the bureaucrat's supply schedule in (6). For given positive values B,  t,  tw,  μ,  S, and P, the firm's maximization program in (3) admits two solutions: (1) an interior solution where the firm allocates capital and labor to both official and unofficial production, and (2) a corner solution where labor and capital are allocated wholly to official production. In the first case the firm enters into corrupt transactions with bureaucrats in order to protect its unofficial output, whereas in the second the firm has no incentive to evade taxes and produce unofficially, and thus has no need of C.19 The two cases are now considered sequentially.            "
"11","When the firm finds it optimal to produce in both modes simultaneously (k < 1), the profit‐maximizing levels of output are               "

"15","When a firm is willing to pay a price per unit of C exceeding the minimum price  acceptable to enforcement bureaucrats, an active market for corruption will exist with equilibrium (m*, C*).                        "
"16","In addition to defining conditions for the existence of a corruption market, equation (11) has important implications for the impact of profit taxation on tax compliance and the unofficial economic activity. Solving (11) for the profit tax rate on the left side shows that unofficial production emerges when               "
"17","When the profit tax rate facing a firm is below its toleration threshold, the value of tax evasion in the underground economy is outweighed by a combination of the cost of corruption necessary to produce unofficially and profitable opportunities in taxable activity where production benefits from government‐supplied institutional services. Consequently when , unofficial production and corruption are nil, and firms comply fully with the tax code. Formally, this case represents a corner solution to the firm's problem in (3) with k = 1,  yu = 0, and C = 0. Total output (ytotal) at the corner is               "
"18","An implication of the equilibrium results is that it is possible for government to impose high rates of profit tax without triggering large diversions of resources to underground production and large‐scale tax evasion if political authorities are able to raise B,  μ,  S, and P enough to create even higher thresholds of tax toleration for most firms. This connection of tax compliance and tax toleration among firms in the model is comparable to the concept of “fiscal exchange” between citizens and government developed in studies of tax compliance among individuals. High tax compliance and positive perceptions of fiscal exchange arise when taxpayers regard the tax system as fair and responsive to citizen preferences, financing government programs delivering personal benefits and public goods citizens approve of. (See, for example, Alm, Jackson, and McKee 1993; Cummings et al. 2005; Feld and Frey 2007; Pommerehne, Hart, and Frey 1994; Pommerehne and Weck‐Hannemann 1996; Roberts and Hite 1994; and Schloz and Lubell 1998.) Yet the correspondence is far from perfect. As mentioned earlier, firms inherently are less susceptible than individuals to behavioral pressure from moral sentiments. The anguish of bad conscience may weigh upon individuals; rational calculations of the bottom line drive the firm.            "
"19"," Figure 2 depicts the pattern of a representative firm's production choices as the profit tax rate t varies around a fixed threshold of tax toleration . The constituents of t (the profit tax rate proper , and regulations on official producers RF) are of course core policy instruments in any national political economy. Total output in Figure 2 cumulates the firm's official and unofficial production.            "
"20","                 Optimal Output Levels as the Profit Tax Rate Varies                         "
"21","Official output yo decreases and unofficial output yu increases monotonically as the tax rate t rises above a firm's tax toleration threshold . Consequently the official output share yo/(yo + yu) decreases, but the firm's total output ytotal = (yo + yu) may expand or contract, depending on the initial condition of t. At  all production is official, and at t = 1 all production is unofficial.                        "
"22","In the graph region where  (to the left of  on the horizontal axis) all of a firm's production is official; ytotal = yo. As t rises above the threshold , firms begin to find unofficial activity profitable and they produce yo and yu simultaneously. The response of production decisions to increases of the profit tax rate among firms perceiving  and, consequently, already evading taxes to some degree, is composed of direct and indirect effects. Tax rate hikes directly depress marginal returns on labor and capital in official production, which by itself prompts firms to shift resources to unofficial activity—k falls and yu rises (equation 8). Higher underground production, however, requires bigger inputs of corruption, and the associated upward shift in demand for C prompts an upward adjustment of the price m (equation 6) in the corruption market, which mutes the increase in unofficial activity ultimately induced by a higher t (equations 7–8).21 Nonetheless, in the range , higher tax rates unambiguously lead to equilibrium increases of yu and decreases of yo and, therefore, to decreases in the share of official output in a firm's total production.22"
"23","The effect of changes to profit tax rates on a firm's total output, ytotal = yo + yu, depends on t's initial condition. As suggested by Figure 2, in the range  an increase in t induces a decline in official output that more than offsets the corresponding rise of unofficial output, thereby contracting the firm's aggregate production.23 The reason is that when profit tax rates are relatively high, firms tend to be heavily engaged in unofficial production and to be paying high prices for the big quantities of corruption required to sustain the large scale of underground operations. As a result, increases to already high tax rates yield only modest expansions of the firm's unofficial activity, and these are more than offset by contractions of its official output. Hence the firm's total output declines. At lower initial tax rates, however, the firm's aggregate output may well increase due to increases of profit taxation because the tax‐induced expansion of its unofficial production exceeds the associated tax‐induced contraction of its official production.24 The implications for international patterns in macroeconomic performance depend on the distribution across countries of national rates of profit tax t in relation to firm‐specific levels of tax toleration . And the implications for government objectives in various countries—for example, maximization of aggregate official output or perhaps even aggregate income altogether, official plus unofficial—depend on national distributions of firm‐specific tax toleration in relation to the common tax rate facing all firms in a country.25"
"24","Now consider how movements in tax toleration affect a firm's optimal production decisions. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the effects of changes in tax toleration originating with an increase to institutional services B and with an increase to the effectiveness of corruption exposure μ, respectively. Recall that B is a principal determinant of the demand for corruption, whereas μ is a key variable affecting the supply side of the corruption market. Along with the demand‐side variable tw and the supply‐side variables S and P, the availability and quality of institutional services and the effectiveness of corruption detection are potential policy instruments that could be used by national authorities to influence tax toleration, and through that route tax compliance and underground production.            "

"26","An increase in B raises a firm's threshold of tax toleration from  to . Optimal production decisions under  are shown by the black graph lines and under  by the grey graph lines. At any given tax rate t, the rise in  prompts the firm to produce more official output yo, and less unofficial output yu. The increase of yo always exceeds the decrease of yu, and so total output ytotal rises along with the official output share yo/(yo + yu).                        "

"28","An increase in μ raises a firm's threshold of tax toleration from  to . Optimal production decisions under  are shown by the black graph lines and under  by the grey graph lines. The increase of tax toleration induced by higher μ prompts less unofficial and more official production among firms with . However, the decline of yu is bigger than the rise of yo, and so although the official output share yo/(yo + yu) rises, total output ytotal falls. Production choices of firms with  are not affected by changes in μ.                        "
"29"," Figure 3 graphs how firms' profitable production possibilities shift owing to an increase in B raising tax toleration from  to  with other outside variables held constant. The enhancement of B induces all firms to increase official output (equations 7 and 14). Moreover, firms initially operating to some degree unofficially whose tax toleration threshold is pushed above the profit tax rate by improvement to institutional services (firms with  will cease producing underground. Firms already active underground whose new toleration threshold remains below the profit tax rate (firms with ) will continue operating unofficially, but will reallocate some resources out of unofficial production to official production. Hence both official output yo and the share of official output in total output  increase with improvements to B. And although transaction prices for corruption m will adjust downward in response to the across‐the‐board decline in demand for corruption, in equilibrium both the level and the price of corruption will be lower in the wake of the expansion among all firms of both official and total production.26"
"30"," Figure 4 illustrates the output effects of an increase in the effectiveness of the corruption exposure mechanism μ that raises the firm's threshold of tax toleration from  to  with other outside variables again held constant. An increase in μ contracts the supply of corruption, which induces higher official production and lower unofficial production among all firms with initial condition . By contrast to B, however, μ is not a factor of production and it therefore exerts no influence on the output decisions of firms with initial condition , that is, among firms initially active wholly in the official economy. In this sense the carrot of improved institutions has wider impact than the stick of improved detection of corruption because the former affects the behavior of all firms.            "
"31","Moreover, unlike the case of improvements to institutional benefits, which always raise total as well as official production, improved detection of corruption does not yield higher total output because the ensuing decline of the firm's unofficial output exceeds the growth of its official output. Intuitively, the explanation of this result may be described by the following sequence of events. The heightened probability of being caught and punished for selling corruption brought about by an increase to μ leads income‐maximizing enforcement bureaucrats to require higher unit prices m to supply given quantities of corruption. More expensive corruption reduces firms' demand for inputs of C necessary to produce unofficially without affecting the marginal products of inputs to official production. With lower unofficial production and higher exposure probability, the quantity of corruption decreases and its price increases. In the new environment firms will tend to transfer some of their resources to official production, but only to the extent that additional official profits compensate for the unofficial profits forgone due to higher costs of corruption. Firms that in the first instance were evading taxes will sometimes even find it profitable to exit the underground economy completely (firms with ). Yet like firms that remain to some degree in the underground economy under , the expansion of official production among exiting firms will not fully compensate for loss of unofficial output. Consequently, among firms initially located in the range  increases to μ yield rises in the official share of output but declines in aggregate output.27"
"32","From late 1999 to mid‐2000 the World Bank sponsored interviews with managers of more than 10,000 enterprises in 80 countries covering the main regions of the world—the World Business Environment Surveys (WBES 2000).28 The interviews dealt, among other things, with managers' perceptions of the operational difficulties posed by taxation, government regulations, corruption of public officials, functioning of the judiciary, and access to financial services. The surveys also obtained reports about the degree of tax compliance among firms. The WBES data make possible rough empirical tests of key implications of the model concerning (1) some direct determinants of firm‐level toleration of taxation, and (2) direct and indirect determinants of the share of total output declared officially and subjected to tax among firms.         "
"33","Empirical analyses were undertaken for a subset of the enterprises sampled. First, because the model pertains to the behavior of private firms, the public sector firms surveyed are excluded. Second, enterprises in African countries are excluded because in that region the data were obtained predominately from mail surveys, rather than from in‐person interviews which were undertaken everywhere else. Postal survey data are far less reliable than the personal interview data.29 Finally, the usable sample was reduced further due to missing data for one or more variables in the multivariate analyses. Sample attrition from this source included all Middle Eastern countries. All told, the regression analyses ahead are based on a common sample of personal interview responses from managers of 3,686 firms distributed over 55 countries.         "
"34","A central message of the model is that a firm's propensity to produce officially and pay taxes is driven by the gap between its tax toleration  and tax rate t. Let i be an index for firms and j an index for countries. Because the profit tax rate subsumes conventional country‐level rates , and regulations on official activity which generally impact individual firms in different ways , profit tax rates are firm‐specific: . Similarly, because the labor tax rate subsumes conventional national payroll rates , and labor regulations  which generally affect firms in different ways, labor tax rates are firm‐specific: .            "
"35","The expression defining  in (13) indicates that tax toleration is affected negatively by payroll tax rates  which determine the relative wage costs in official as compared to unofficial production and vary over firms in every country, and is affected positively by institutional benefits Bij which likewise vary over firms in every country. Tax toleration is also positively affected by two variables that we could not measure: total wage costs in unofficial production wij, and corruption price minima  which vary over firms (owing to firm‐specific visibility effects embodied in the detection parameter μij) in various countries (owing to national salary levels Sj and malfeasance penalties Pj). However, some of the positive effects of wij and μij(Sj + Pj) on tij will be picked up by the size of firms' capital stock , a variable that is well measured by the WBES.  positively affects tax toleration by increasing the visibility of corruption and its exposure μij, which in turn raises corruption price minima  also will tend to raise wages wij via so‐called efficiency wage policies associated with large, capital‐rich firms. Through those indirect channels  will exert positive effect on tax toleration. But the direct effect of  on  in (13) is negative.30 Consequently the net effect of a firm's capital stock on tax toleration is ambiguous. The functional relations in terms of observables are               "
"36"," Tax toleration  is measured by the following WBES question: “Please judge on a four point scale how problematic are high taxes for the operation and growth of your business” with ordered response categories 1 =‘major obstacle’ 2 =‘moderate obstacle’ 3 =‘minor obstacle’ and 4 =‘no obstacle’.31 The aim is to tap an underlying continuum running from low to high values of firm‐specific tax toleration. A potential deficiency, however, is that when toleration is genuinely low (because taxation is in fact perceived to be a major problem), firm managers may nonetheless reply “no obstacle” because they are easily able to evade taxes by shifting operations underground, thereby conflating the concept of tax toleration with acts of tax evasion and weakening the observed connection between the two. Although serious in principle, this fundamental source of measurement error is not likely to be quantitatively important because the incidence of negligible toleration registered by the interviews is so low: only 9% of responses fall in the “no obstacle” category, whereas fully 58% of firm managers regarded taxes as a “major obstacle” with another 22% perceiving taxes as a “moderate obstacle.”32"
"37"," Institutional services Bij are measured by the WBES question “Please judge on a four point scale how problematic are these different regulatory areas for the operation and growth of your business” for items pertaining to access to financial services, functioning of the judicial system, and customs procedures. The response options for each item are again scaled 1 =“major obstacle” to 4 =“no obstacle.” A composite index of Bij was constructed by taking the arithmetic average of the scale values across the three items, yielding 10 exclusive ordinal categories running from 1 to 4 by increments of one‐third.            "
"38","A composite measure of regulations on official activity imposing burdens on official producers , which are analogous to conventional profit taxes, was constructed in the same way as Bij by averaging the 4‐point scale responses to “how problematic are” questions dealing with business licensing, environmental regulations, fire and safety regulations, and foreign exchange regulations. The resulting composite variable for  had 13 exclusive categories running from 1 to 4 by increments of one‐fourth. Labor regulations affecting officially employed labor , which are akin to conventional payroll taxes, were measured by 4‐point scale responses to the same question regarding perceptions of problems created by government labor regulations.            "
"39"," Capital assets of firms  are measured by the WBES question asking managers to “estimate [the value of] your firm's fixed assets—land, buildings, equipment.” Common responses in the country surveys fall into 10 categories ranging from less than 250,000 USD to 500,000,000 USD or more. Though truncated at the upper end, these data supply good calibration of physical capital stocks.            "
"40","The WBES data provide no defensible empirical measure of —the minimum price of corruption necessary to induce enforcement officials to overlook unofficial production and tax evasion among firms in various countries—or for other combinations of μij,  Sj, and Pj that affect equilibrium corruption prices and production decisions. As noted earlier, some corruption price effects will be picked up by  because the visibility and exposure of corrupt transactions are likely to increase with firm size.            "
"41","Measurement of remaining variables in (15) is more straightforward. The corporate tax rate  is measured by the top marginal tax rate on corporate profits in each country for year 2000,33 and the payroll tax rate  is measured by social security contribution rates for year 1999.34 Descriptive statistics reported in Table 1 show that among variables varying by i and j, within‐country standard deviations are 1.4 to 2.0 times the magnitude of between‐country standard deviations, implying that firm‐specific characteristics affecting those variables are generally much more dispersed than country‐specific attributes.            "
"42","The WBES data also allow empirical tests of the model's implications concerning determinants of tax compliance as registered by the share of output declared officially and subject to tax. Figures 2–4— and the associated theoretical analyses—implied that the share of taxed, official output in total output  is negatively related to the gap between tax rates tij and levels of tax toleration , where  is in turn a function of the outside variables on the right side of (15). The measurement metrics of tij and  are incompatible, so direct computation of tax gaps is infeasible. The model nonetheless implies the following pattern of empirical relations:35"
"43"," Tax compliance as revealed by the official share of total output  is measured by responses to the WBES question “Recognizing the difficulties many enterprises face in fully complying with taxes and regulations, what percentage of total sales would you estimate the typical firm in your area of activity reports for tax purposes?”36 The response options common to all countries in the analysis fall into seven categories with irregular intervals ranging from “< 50%” sales reported up to “100%” sales reported.37 Descriptive statistics in Table 1, computed from midpoint values of the seven “% sales reported” categories, show that the standard deviation around the mean value of 78% is more than 1.4 times higher within countries than between them—a pattern similar to the dispersions of other variables varying across firms and countries. Since all firms sampled were legally registered, it appears that simultaneous activity in the official and unofficial economy is a quite common state of affairs, a result consistent with a central feature of the theoretical model developed in previous sections.            "
"44"," Table 2 reports three ordered logit regressions implied by the testable implications of the theoretical model. With one exception (Institutional Services in the first regression), independent variables are specified in logarithms. Coefficient estimates therefore represent effects of proportional movements in each independent variable on the probabilities of various categorical responses implied by the ordered logit estimator. Those specifications implicitly assume that the ordinal independent variables can be treated as interval—an assumption supported by standard Wald and likelihood ratio tests showing that inclusion of a separate dummy indicator variable for each linearly independent ordinal category adds no explanatory power to what is delivered by the single (“interval”) log‐variable specifications.38"
"45","Model (1) pertains to the determinants of Tax Toleration  summarized by equation (15) and the top‐left part of (16). All determinants of  in the regression are highly significant statistically and have signs consistent with the underlying theoretical model,39 apart from log Payroll Tax Rate which is correctly signed but has a p‐value of only 0.2. More important, the substantive effects implied by the ordered logit regression coefficients are large. Institutional Services B exerts the biggest influence on Tax Toleration. B is also the only independent variable in Table 2 requiring ordinal representation by dummy indicator variables for response categories. Recall that B scale values range over 10 ordered categories spanning 1 to 4 by increments of one‐third. Coefficients of the indicator dummies increase monotonically with the scale values but to conserve space only estimates for the lowest B = 1.33 and highest B = 4.0 scale categories are reported in Table 2. (B = 1 is the omitted category. It includes 2% of the 3,686 cases and its effect is absorbed by the logit cut‐point constants.)            "
"46","To gauge magnitudes, consider a maximal improvement to the Institutional Services index from B = 1 to B = 4 holding other variables constant at their means. Computations using estimates for Model (1) indicate this enhancement to B would lower the probabilities a representative firm would perceive taxes as a major obstacle () by 0.55 or as a moderate obstacle () by 0.06, while raising the probabilities of taxes being viewed as a minor obstacle or no obstacle at all () by 0.14 and 0.46, respectively. Those are big tax toleration effects.            "
"47","The impact of shifts in log Labor Regulations is less dramatic, yet also sizeable. A maximal shift (from the perception that labor regulations are a major obstacle to no obstacle) decreases the probability that taxes would be regarded as a major obstacle by 0.25, and increases the probabilities of responses in the moderate, minor, and no obstacle categories by 0.11, 0.08, and 0.06, respectively. The impact of increases to a firm's log Capital Assets are on balance positive but much weaker than other independent variables, perhaps because the direct and indirect effects already described tend to offset one another. Computations show that in order for an increase in  to have as much effect on Tax Toleration as the shift in ln   RL discussed above, a typical firm would have to experience a sea change in its capital endowment—from next to nothing all the way up to the measured maximum of a half‐billion U.S. dollars.            "
"48","Regression Models (2) and (3) investigate the determinants of Tax Compliance  as measured by the WBES interview data on % Sales Reported to tax authorities. Model (2) is the reduced form of the causal relations sketched in equation (16). Model (3) is the structural form. In both models independent variables are interacted with a binary variable LT identifying firms whose managers to some degree perceive taxes as problematic for business operations: LT = 1 when , or 3 (taxes pose “major,”“moderate,” or “minor” obstacles); LT = 0 when  (taxes pose “no obstacle”). The latter firms, which comprise 9% of the sample, are the ones depicted in Figure 2 as located to the left of . The theoretical model implies that among those firms Tax Compliance is not affected by the relative magnitudes of log Corporate Tax Rates and log Tax Toleration in structural form (Model 3), or by the relative magnitudes of ln   tF and the determinants of  in reduced form (Model 2).40 Test statistics reported in the bottom part of Table 2 demonstrate that the restrictions to the ordered logit regressions imposed by the LT interactions—namely F′ (·) = 0 at —cannot be rejected with any confidence.            "
"49","Estimation of the reduced‐form ordered logit model for Tax Compliance yields highly significant and substantively big effects for log Institutional Services and log Corporate Tax Rates, small and significant effects for log Capital Assets,41 and insignificant effects for the Regulations and Payroll Tax Rate variables ln   RL,   ln   RF, and ln   tL. As was true for Tax Toleration, perceived usefulness of Institutional Services exerts great influence on Tax Compliance. For example, a maximal improvement to ln   B, with other variables held at mean values, decreases the probability a typical firm's Tax Compliance would fall in the bottom category (0–50% Sales Reported) by 0.40, whilst increasing the probability of full Tax Compliance (100% Sales Reported) by 0.46. A maximal increase in ln   tF (from log 15% to log 45.5%) also has big effects. Computations show that an escalation of Corporate Tax Rates of this magnitude lowers the probability of full Tax Compliance by around 0.62 and raises the probability of all other categories, with much of the shift (0.23 probability points) heaped at the bottom 0–50% range of Tax Compliance.            "
"50","The theoretical structure summarized in equation (16) asserts that a firm's threshold of tax toleration encapsulates the effects of the institutional environment and other reduced‐form independent variables on a firm's incentive to remain in the official taxed economy, as opposed to operating underground. Model (3) estimates that structure directly with an ordered logit regression of Tax Compliance on  and ln   RF alone. The results strongly support the prediction that increases to log Tax Toleration positively affect Tax Compliance, thereby offsetting at least to some degree the negative effects on Compliance exerted by Corporate Taxes and Regulations. Taken together, the empirical results are broadly supportive of the underlying theory about how quality of governance affects the propensity of profit‐maximizing firms to remain in the official taxed economy, as opposed to evading taxes and producing underground. Indeed, the correspondence of theory and evidence appears particularly strong in view of the noisy, interview‐based measurements of the model's key variables.            "
"51","The central implication of theoretical and empirical results in this article is that markets for corruption arise and big migrations out of legal production into the underground economy occur when large numbers of firms perceive taxes as not “worth paying”—an unfortunate circumstance that was summarized in terms of profit taxes imposed on producers in the official economy relative to firms' thresholds of tax toleration. Tax toleration is driven by firm‐specific appraisals of the availability, quality, and usefulness of government services supporting official activities, by taxes and regulations on officially employed labor, by the compensation of enforcement authorities, and by the effectiveness of detection and punishment of bureaucratic malfeasance. Because most of those determinants differ across firms, tax toleration and tax compliance vary among producers facing the same rates of conventional profit taxation and operating in the same national political‐institutional environment."
"52","Firms without much intrinsic need of government institutional services will likely always be tempted to produce unofficially and evade taxation unless tax rates are negligible or corruption prices are extremely high. The latter would tend to be the case when enforcement authorities are handsomely compensated, when they stand high chances of being caught selling corruption, and when they are stringently penalized for any malfeasance discovered. Though government policy clearly can affect such supply‐of‐corruption variables, it can do little to influence the appetite for tax evasion among firms that inherently have little or no interest in official institutional services, no matter how well tuned and accessible those services might be. Yet such firms are likely to be small (and in many cases single‐person operations, like the home‐cleaning help engaged unofficially by many readers of this article) and at the margins of many economies."
"53","Most big players in an economy potentially take great productive benefit of formal institutional services, and their propensity to remain in the official, tax‐paying economy can therefore be influenced by government efforts to build and sustain institutions of quality. Firms with substantial intrinsic need of services will tend to develop high tax toleration, if appropriate institutions are in place. Government fiscal policy is then less constrained—with high tax toleration, relatively high taxes on official productive activity may be imposed without great fear of inducing a mass exodus of tax‐paying producers into the black economy."
"54","Heterogeneity of tax toleration among firms has implications for the aggregate effects of policies targeted on the scale of the shadow economy and tax evasion. Depending on how many and to what extent firms within a country have incentive to produce underground and evade taxation, policies regarding profit taxation and the employment conditions of enforcement bureaucrats may create trade‐offs between containment of tax evasion and the overall level of economic activity. For instance, strengthening incentives of enforcement officials to remain honest reduces bureaucratic corruption and unofficial economic activity at the cost of depressing total output among evading firms, without affecting the productive activity of nonevading firms. If the economy is dominated by firms with low thresholds of tax toleration, then higher bureaucratic salaries and better corruption detection mechanisms may yield only modest expansions of official production and contractions of total output. Casual observation of the situation in many developing countries, and some developed ones too, suggests that stamping out unofficial economic activity would on the whole depress aggregate income and economic well‐being."
"55","The likely effects of policies addressing tax evasion by lowering profit tax rates are more ambiguous. In developing countries, where many firms are likely to be small and heavily involved in unofficial activity, reduction of profit tax rates will help reduce underground production, raise tax compliance, and increase national output. Profit taxation policy, however, exerts less impact in countries where many firms operate on the border of their tax tolerance, in the sense that their tax toleration threshold is lower than but close to the statutory tax rate. In such cases the first‐order effects of reductions to profit tax rates would tend to shrink aggregate income."
"56","Yet the model implies that a trade‐off of a smaller underground economy at the cost of lower aggregate output does not arise with policies that affect institutional services and taxes and regulations on officially employed labor. Such policies influence all firms in the economy because they affect the productivity and profitability of factors deployed in official production. Government‐supported institutions directly benefiting production, for example, have the advantage of giving tax‐evading firms incentive to reduce their unofficial operations, while also inducing higher levels of output among all firms in the economy, regardless of their location on the continuum of tax compliance. This theoretical implication may help explain the strong positive correlation between indicators of institutional quality and estimated levels of total and official aggregate national output reported in many macrolevel empirical studies."
"57","Our firm‐level analysis rightly treated institutional benefits and taxes as unconnected outside variables because any particular firm would correctly perceive a choice to evade taxes and regulations by producing unofficially as having negligible impact on the government's resources and its capacity to deliver services from which the firm might profit. However, in the macro political economy those variables are intimately connected, if only because public institutions of high quality require commensurately large investments of public revenue raised by taxation.42 In principle a virtuous circle is possible in which high taxes and high tax compliance coexist amicably because important producers are anchored firmly in the official economy, supplying the tax revenues required to build and sustain well‐functioning institutions that underpin high toleration of taxation.
