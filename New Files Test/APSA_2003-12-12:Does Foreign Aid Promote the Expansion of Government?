"1","Despite registering a significant slowdown in the post‐1992 period, foreign aid flows expanded considerably over the course of the last four decades (OECD 2002). Whereas per capita aid to low‐ and middle‐income nation averaged $29.62 during the 1960s, by the 1990s that figure had risen to $75.90 (measured in constant U.S. 1995 dollars). As indicated by Figure 1, the average ratio of aid to GNI expanded from 4.4 to 10.8% over the same time period, underlining the growing magnitude of the international aid effort and the corresponding increase in the dependence of the world's less industrialized nations on external loans and assistance. For individual countries, such as Guinea‐Bissau, Mauritania, and Nicaragua, this dependence had achieved truly remarkable levels approximating more than 40% of gross national income and 100% of total state expenditures by the end of the 1990s (World Bank 2001).         "
"2"," Official Aid Flows to Lower and Middle Income Nations                      "
"3","The growing importance of official aid flows has gone hand in hand with the expansion of conditionality‐based aid and lending programs, increased donor coordination, and enhanced pressure for market‐oriented policy reforms. Beginning in the 1980s, aid donors and official creditors began to make loans and grants more conditional by coordinating their lending with the IMF and World Bank. This shift coincided with efforts to promote the so‐called “Washington Consensus”: an orthodox program of structural adjustment involving privatization, trade and financial liberalization, fiscal discipline, deregulation, and related policy reforms that was designed to reduce the role of the state in the economy (Williamson 1994, 26–28). Components of this program have long been associated with the flow of external assistance, but since the early 1980s orthodox reforms have been incorporated into an increasing array of aid programs, including those focused upon goals other than economic stabilization and adjustment. Even the poverty alleviation programs drawn up under the World Bank Group and IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative conform to this propensity. While explicitly recognizing that successful implementation revolves around state capacity and local commitment, these programs routinely speak to the importance of “strengthening private sector growth and development,”“reducing the deficit,”“removing regulatory impediments,”“fostering the contestability of markets within the banking sector,” and related elements of the orthodox agenda (e.g., Ethiopia 2002; Guyana 2002; Nicaragua 2001; Uganda 2002).         "
"4","The success of the orthodox adjustment enterprise remains very much open to question. Despite the growing magnitude of the official aid effort, the expansion of conditionality, and the increased coordination of international donors, the progress of policy reform has been slow, uneven, and punctuated by numerous breakdowns and reversals. Countries hailed as “successes” have often registered only marginal progress in policy reform or relapsed into “failure,” provoking new releases of aid to encourage the implementation of the prescribed orthodox remedies. Fiscal problems have contributed directly to many of the more spectacular of these breakdowns, including Brazil (1998), Russia (1998), and Argentina (2002)."
"5","By the 1990s, international observers had begun expressing widespread disillusionment with the track record of official development assistance. According to William Easterly, a former senior advisor at the World Bank, adjustment lending resembled “the heedless giving to the hopeless” (2001, 115). Pointing out that in the 1980s alone, the IMF and the World Bank gave an average six adjustment loans to each nation in Africa, five to each nation in Latin America, four to each Asian nation, and an average of three to the nations of Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Easterly argues that there has been too much lending with too little adjustment, mainly because the lending process has not created the right incentives for either lenders or recipients to restore growth. Echoing the conclusions reached by Bauer (1972, 133–34) more than thirty years ago, Easterly suggests that aid only generates significant achievements when it is channeled to countries with the “right” policies (2001, 102–03).         "
"6","A recent World Bank study reviewing the African experience reaches a similar conclusion (Devarajan, Dollar, and Holmgren 2001). Noting that official aid flows can sustain both good and bad policies, the authors argue that the capacity of aid to generate positive results revolves around variables operating at the national rather than international level. Hence aid supporting a “country‐owned development strategy” can lead to growth and poverty alleviation, but efforts to impose reforms from the outside as a quid pro quo for assistance are regarded as ineffectual or unsustainable. With a few exceptions (e.g., Landau 1990) as well as some qualifications with respect to the definition and impact of “good” policy (e.g., Lensink and White 2000), other research analyzing the impact of foreign assistance programs of the IMF, World Bank, and other donors echoes these conclusions regarding the conditional effects of aid (Burnside and Dollar 2000; Dollar and Svensson 2000; Kahler 1992; Killick 1998; Mosley, Hudson, and Horrell 1988; Mosley, Subasat, and Weeks, 1995; Mosley, Harrigan, and Toye 1995; Schwalbenberg 1998; Van de Walle 2001; White 1997; World Bank 1998).         "
"7","The broader body of literature on market‐oriented policy reform places a similar emphasis upon the importance of the domestic determinants of policy choice. The propensity of governments to undertake reforms that limit the expansion of the state in favor of the private sector are thus seen as dependent upon such variables as political leadership, regime type, bureaucratic expertise, electoral cycles, crisis conditions, societal consensus, political polarization, institutional arrangements, and party system fragmentation (Drazen and Grilli 1993; Grindle and Thomas 1991; Haggard and Kaufman 1995; Haggard and Webb 1994; Williamson 1994). For the study of government spending, the obvious implication is that no systematic link can be drawn between external financial support and fiscal outcomes. To the extent that policy revolves around variables operating at the domestic level of analysis, high levels of development assistance can be associated with either the expansion or reduction of government size as well as with highly variable results in terms of other sets of policy reforms. Hence whereas the multilateral institutions as well as their more strident critics continue to operate on the assumption that official aid flows can foster market‐oriented policies, that assumption runs up against a growing body of empirical evidence suggesting that aid programs have limited and/or highly variable consequences.         "
"8","Research focused on the study of government spending around the world fails to offer a clear alternative perspective on the impact of aid. In the first place, most empirical studies of government spending have neglected the issue of international transfers, focusing instead on domestic “supply and demand” variables to account for variations in government size. Inter alia researchers have thus explored the impact of demographic structure, country size, wealth, federalism, ethnic fragmentation, and trade exposure on government spending (Easterly and Levine 1997; Garrett 1998; Persson and Tabellini 1994; Rodden forthcoming; Rodrik 1998), without considering the impact of foreign aid. Second, the few studies that have explicitly addressed the fiscal consequences of foreign aid have failed to address other determinants of public sector size, creating considerable uncertainty regarding the broader meaning or significance of their findings. Third, the available research also offers highly varied readings of the nexus between aid and spending.         "
"9","Studying eight major aid recipients over the 1972–87 period, Khilji and Zampelli (1994) conclude that aid is channeled to the private sector in the form of tax relief and has little impact on public sector expenditures. Feyzioglu, Swaroop, and Zhu (1998), who suggest that aid is highly fungible at both the aggregate and sectoral level, find that aid increases government spending and investment along with tax relief in a sample of 38 nations. The latter results are relatively consistent with Heller's (1975) seminal contribution as well as other recent research (e.g., Franco‐Rodríguez and Morrissey 1998). Drawing on five‐year and decade‐averaged data for a broad set of nations for the 1971–90 period, Boone (1996), on the other hand, reports that aid increases the size of government without affecting tax policy or augmenting investment. Pack and Pack's (1990) study of Indonesia points to yet another pattern: aid leads to both increased expenditures and increased taxation. Still other research suggests that the effects of aid are highly variable. In their studies of aid effectiveness, for example, Mosley, Hudson, and Horrell (1987) and Pack and Pack (1993) argue that the impact of aid is conditioned by its importance as a source of public revenues and/or the preferences of public sector decision makers, who may variously opt for tax reduction or the expansion of expenditures. Cashel‐Cordo and Craig's (1990) study of fiscal performance in 45 countries over the 1975–80 time period arrives at a similar conclusion regarding the varied impact of aid; however, they argue that its effects are conditioned by the behavior of donors rather than recipients. In short, prior research on the relationship between aid and government spending fails to establish a solid basis for challenging the dominant conclusions of the broader body of literature on aid and policy reform.         "
"10","Whatever the limitations of prior research, the central shortcoming of the literature concluding that aid has a limited or highly variable impact is less empirical than theoretical. Particularly in light of the significant contributions of public choice theorizing to the study of the politics of public finance (Brennan and Buchanan 1980; Levi 1998; Olson 1993), the notion that augmenting the resources of government from the outside may reduce or have no systematic effect on government size is intrinsically implausible. The reason is that the political costs and benefits of expenditures financed by external resources and those funded by domestic taxation or revenue generation differ significantly. Revenues raised domestically involve political costs—costs that may be expected to attenuate the political propensity of leaders to expand public spending in order to reward their followers or otherwise enhance their chances of political survival. With external grants and loans, however, the nexus between public spending and domestic revenue generation evaporates, bolstering incentives for increased spending. From this perspective, the so‐called “orthodox paradox,” which points to the pivotal role of the state in the process of market‐oriented reform, offers a weak rationale for linking official aid with state retrenchment. The political calculus governing decisions about public spending and revenue generation is more likely to mean that external grants and loans are translated into the expansion of the state.         "
"11","The logic is identical to that underpinning the distinction between common pool resources and locally generated revenues in the literature on fiscal federalism. As suggested by prior research (Grossman 1989; IADB 1994; Rodden 2002, forthcoming; Shadbegian 1999a,b; Stein 1999), fiscal decentralization may augment or reduce overall governmental size, depending on the incentives it creates for state or local governments to rely on grants and transfers from the central government as opposed to own‐source revenues. The greater the dependence on the former in relation to total revenue sources, the greater the propensity for government expansion. At issue is the so‐called “flypaper effect,” which means that federal transfers to lower levels of government are not offset by equivalent reductions in subnational taxation (Dougan and Kenyon 1988; Hines and Thaler 1995; Holcombe 1996; Strumpf 1998). Thus decentralization funded by local taxation may be associated with reduced public sector spending, but decentralization financed by intergovernmental grants and transfers tends to lead to the budgetary growth of the overall public sector. Since high levels of dependence on external revenue sources also decrease the incentives for citizens to monitor governmental performance, corruption, waste, and rent seeking may increase apace, resulting not only in larger but also more inefficient public sectors (Brautigam 1992; Knack 2001).         "
"12","In addition to these problems flowing from the weakness of the link between spending and taxation, high levels of dependence on external resources may also foster moral hazard problems. Again the logic shaping the budgetary performance of subnational political units is of immediate relevance. Facing the need for budgetary cutbacks, subnational governments funded by intergovernmental transfers may fail to adjust on the assumption that the resulting costs will be absorbed by the center in the form of debt relief or new transfers. As evidenced by the experience of Argentina and Brazil over the past twenty years, the outcome is likely to be further expansion of the public sector and mounting fiscal problems at all levels of government. In a similar vein, nations heavily dependent on external grants and loans might be expected to respond to budgetary shortfalls or growing debt burdens by appealing for increased external assistance and debt write‐offs, which reduce the incentives for austerity and prudent policy formation."
"13","The plausibility of these arguments as applied to the international system is emphasized by the mounting levels of indebtedness of lower‐ and middle‐income nations. Despite the increased flow of external assistance, the long‐term debt of lower‐ and middle‐income nations has increased dramatically over time, from $62.6 billion in 1970 to $1998.7 in 2001 (World Bank 2002, 189). The predictable outcome has been an extensive series of debt relief programs, including the HIPC initiative, which was launched by the World Bank and the IMF in 1996 as a major new program of debt forgiveness for heavily indebted poor nations. Also noteworthy are special bailouts, such as the $43 billion loan agreement the IMF negotiated with Indonesia in 1998 (Bullard, Bello, and Mallhotra 1998) or the IMF‐led loan packages totaling $48 billion that were extended to Argentina between December 2000 and August 2001 (Kahn 2000, 2001). With a few notable exceptions (e.g., Gopinath 2001), the tendency has been to see the need for such relief and rescue programs less as a function of the moral hazard associated with multilateral involvement than of problems specific to the economy of particular countries at particular points in time. The presumption that external resource flows undermine incentives for prudent policy management offers a more economical and theoretically compelling explanation.         "
"14","The theoretical perspective outlined above is likewise consistent with the unsuccessful track record of adjustment lending. Rather than attribute the pervasive pattern of failure to rent‐seeking behavior, weak executives, bureaucratic incompetence, interest group pressures, lack of political accountability, or other sets of variables operating at the domestic level of analysis, it seems more productive to begin with the assumption that attempting to reduce the role of the state by externally augmenting its financial resources entails a fundamental contradiction. That assumption dovetails into early orthodox critiques of international assistance, which argued that aid impedes economic development by bolstering governmental power and resources relative to more productive private sector activities (e.g., Friedman 1970; Bauer 1972, 1984).         "
"15","The subsequent analysis evaluates the connection between aid and government size on the basis of systematic comparative evidence. Building on the arguments outlined above, the analysis takes as its central point of theoretical departure the assumption that international development assistance creates incentives favoring the growth rather than restraint of Leviathan. The central hypothesis is that the higher the level of dependence on international assistance, the greater the propensity toward government expansion."
"16","To assess the impact of development assistance on government size, the subsequent empirical analysis draws upon a data set covering the 1970–99 time period in 120 nations—the universe of middle‐ and lower‐income nations for which appropriate data on government expenditures is available. The key dependent variable is government size, which I measure in terms of the ratio of government expenditures to GDP as reported by the World Bank (2001).3"
"17","The independent variable of principal theoretical interest is aid dependence, which I assess on the basis of three separate indicators of official development assistance: aid as a percentage of GNI, aid as a percentage of government expenditures, and aid as a percentage of imports (also as reported by the World Bank 2001). All three indicators cover concessional loans, grants, and technical cooperation and assistance (minus repayments) extended by official agencies of the members of the Development Assistance Committee and multilateral institutions. Although they capture different conceptions of aid dependence, it may be noted that the indicators are strongly correlated (r = .809 for the ratios of aid to government expenditures and gross national income, .786 for the ratios involving imports and expenditures, and .662 for the ratios of aid to gross national income and imports).         "
"18","Since the goal of the analysis is to estimate the impact of foreign assistance, it is important to control for other variables that may affect government spending. Guided by established models of government expenditure (Bradbury and Crain 2002; Oates 1985; Shadbegian 1999a,b; Owings and Borck, 2000), six additional independent variables are included in the statistical analyses. First, because prior research draws an inverse relationship between the burden of government and country size arising from economies of scale in the provision of public goods (e.g., Shadbegian 1996, 1999b; Owings and Borch 2000; Bradbury and Crain 2002), I control for population. Second, because government spending, particularly health care and social security, tends to respond to demographic structure, the analysis also takes into account variations in the dependency ratio as measured on the basis of the percentage of the population that is 65 years of age or older. The third control variable is trade dependence, which is measured as exports plus imports as a percentage of GDP in accordance with the conventions established by prior research. The assumption guiding the inclusion of this variable is that international exposure tends to generate greater pressures for government spending (Alesina and Wacziarg 1998; Rodrik 1998). Fourth, since prior research also points to the potential relevance of per capita GDP, that variable measured in constant U.S. dollars also enters into the analysis. Fifth, to address the potential impact of increased taxation, revenue windfalls, and other changes in domestic government resources upon spending patterns, the analysis controls for the ratio of government revenues to GDP as measured in terms of all central government revenues from taxes and nonrepayable receipts (excluding grants). Finally, to assess the possibility that indebtedness shapes government spending, the model also controls for the ratio of the debt service to exports. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the data are drawn from the World Bank (2001).         "
"19","For theoretical reasons, the statistical estimations rely upon an error‐correction model similar to that utilized in other recent research on government spending (e.g., Iverson and Cusack 2000; Rodden forthcoming):            "
"20","Rewriting the model in the form in which it is actually estimated yields the following equation:            "
"21","Given problems of heteroskedasticity and contemporaneous correlation of errors across countries that are common to cross‐sectional time‐series research designs, the model is estimated on the basis of OLS with panel‐corrected standard errors (PCSEs; see Beck and Katz 1995). The estimations have also been adjusted for panel‐specific patterns of autocorrelation. The results obtained via other methodologies are discussed below, together with alternative specifications of the base model involving the inclusion of regional dummy variables, yearly time dummies, and other additional control variables. Although the relative strength of the coefficients varies with the estimation technique, the variable of principal interest (aid dependence) retains a positive and statistically significant relationship with the dependent variable (change in government expenditures) across different models and alternative estimation techniques.         "
"22"," Table 1 presents the statistical results for the model outlined above for the 1970–99 period as a whole. The first three rows of the table provide the estimates for the long‐run or permanent effects of official development assistance on government spending. The next three rows include the estimates for the short‐term effects. Finally, the results for the control variables, including the lagged ratio of government expenditures to GDP, are shown at the bottom of the table along with relevant diagnostic statistics.         "
"23","The coefficients for the long‐term effects of aid on spending are consistent with the theoretical arguments outlined above regarding the impact of aid dependence. All of the indicators of aid dependence are positive and statistically significant. The analysis thus suggests the existence of a long‐run equilibrium relationship between aid and government spending. Drawing upon the error correction version of the model presented above, it can be estimated that any shock to this equilibrium relationship will be corrected at the rate of .73% per annum for Model I estimating the impact of the ratio of aid to GNI, .62% for the equation Model II involving the ratio of aid to government spending, and .76% for the third model estimating the results for the ratio of aid to imports.5 Aid dependence is thus translated predictably into increased government spending over the long run.         "
"24","Interpreting these results in terms of hypothetical changes in aid is relatively straightforward. Starting in an equilibrium state and holding all other variables constant, a one‐standard‐deviation increase in the ratio of aid to GNI will be translated over the long run into a 2.9% increase in the ratio of government spending to GDP. As suggested by the significance of the coefficient on aid, the impact is larger for the ratio of aid to government spending. On average a one‐standard‐deviation increase in the ratio of aid to government spending would lead to nearly an 18% increase in government spending as a percentage of GDP. The figure for the long‐run increase in government spending associated with the model for aid as a percentage of imports is also impressive. Assuming again a one‐standard‐deviation increase in the value of aid, government spending over the long run could be expected to increase from a mean value of 14.2% of imports to 24.5%. The clear implication is that countries highly dependent on international aid are less likely to control the expansion of government than other nations."
"25","With respect to the other independent variables, the coefficients for both changes and lagged levels of revenues are statistically significant and consistent with theoretical expectation in all three of the base models. The impact of the remaining control variables is mixed and largely insignificant. None of the coefficients assessing the impact of trade exposure, for example, is statistically significant, contrary to the literature suggesting that trade promotes the expansion of government. Similarly, the coefficients for levels and changes in population, the dependency ratio, and debt are insignificant. In accordance with prior research, Model III offers some evidence for linking per capita income levels with government spending; however, changes in per capita wealth are negatively linked with the growth of spending, suggesting the predominance of countercyclical spending patterns in lower‐ and middle‐income nations."
"26","How robust are these findings?Table 2 is designed to address this question by exploring the sensitivity of the estimates to alterations in the conditioning set of variables and case base. Building upon prior research in political economy (Quinn and Wooley 2001; Fölster and Henrekson 2001; Levine and Renelt 1992), I utilize a variant of Leamer's (1983) extreme‐bounds analysis (EBA) to assess whether the coefficients for aid presented in Table 1 stand up to sequential changes in the list of right‐hand side variables.         "
"27","The EBA analysis entails a series of estimations of the following form:            "
"28","To summarize briefly, the results for lagged aid and the subsequent growth in government expenditures shown in Table 2 are highly robust to the inclusion of additional variables to the base models. The inclusion of dummy variables for Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East does not reduce the coefficients of central theoretical interest in any of the three models, nor are any of the regional dummies statistically significant. Likewise, the results stand up well to the sequential inclusion of a dummy variable for the post‐1980 period, yearly dummy variables, country dummy variables, Polity IV codings for lagged democracy and changes in democracy, and a dummy variable separating low‐ from middle‐income countries (coded 1 for the latter and 0 for the former). The single exception to these results involves the coefficient for the ratio of aid to GNI, which becomes insignificant with the addition of country dummy variables to the base equation. Simultaneously adding variables for the lagged level and change in Polity IV ratings together with the post‐1980, low income, and regional dummy variables likewise generates limited change in the principal coefficients of interest.6"
"29","The coefficients for aid are also relatively insensitive to major changes in the case base. Restricting the analysis to the post‐1980 period, when the emphasis of the official aid community shifted heavily toward conditionality‐based lending, market‐oriented reform, and increased donor coordination, does not produce major changes in results. Likewise, confining the analysis to low‐income countries only affects the significance of one of the three aid coefficients, despite the major reduction in the case base. Furthermore, the results do not reflect variations in absorptive capacity. While prior research has suggested that aid starts to have reduced or negative effects at high levels (Dalgaard and Hansen 2001; Hansen and Tarp 2001; Lavy and Sheffer 1991; Lensink and White 2001; White 1997), two of the three aid coefficients remain statistically significant after removing all of the cases falling below the mean lagged level of aid. Finally, the results are not driven by outliers. With the highest variance cases removed, the estimated coefficients on aid all gain in strength as does the overall fit of the three models as assessed on the basis of adjusted R2.         "
"30","Alternative estimation techniques also point to the robustness of the statistical findings. OLS with robust standard errors clustered by country provides variance estimates that are inefficient but robust in the sense that they address panel‐level heteroskedasticity as well as correlations among the observations of each panel. The resulting coefficients for aid are similar to those presented in Table 1, except more statistically significant in the case of the coefficient for aid/GNI and weaker (but still significant) in the case of the coefficient for aid/expenditures. Random effects linear models that adjust for AR(1) disturbance represent a second alternative mode of estimation that address potential concerns about robustness associated with unbalanced panels with unevenly spaced observations. The estimations derived from the latter are fully consistent with the finding that aid fosters increased government spending. The coefficients for aid are all stronger and significant at the .001 level. Third, to offer a further check on potential problems resulting from missing observations, the results have also been reestimated on the basis of the Arellano‐Bond Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, which utilizes first differencing to produce an instrumental variables estimation employing the lagged independent variables (Arellano and Bond 1991). While trade emerges as a stronger and consistently significant influence on the growth of government in these estimations, the results with respect to aid are relatively consistent with those reported above. The only aid coefficient that fails to achieve a .01 or better level of statistical significance is that for the aid/GNI ratio.         "
"31","Finally, with respect to possible alternative theoretical interpretations of the results, the three base models were reestimated with changes in the ratio of capital spending to GDP as the dependent variable. After controlling for the same set of variables incorporated in the models presented in Table 1, none of the coefficients for lagged aid levels or changes in aid levels is statistically significant. Thus it possible to rule out the idea that the expansion of government expenditures associated with aid dependence reflects a tendency toward increased infrastructural investment rather than current spending. With respect to the possibility that the growth of government expenditures reflects increased spending on high priority areas such as health and education, the data are too limited and fragmentary to draw strong conclusions. Nevertheless, the coefficients for aid suggest no impact in the case of health spending and a limited to negative impact for education spending.7"
"32","The preceding results for government spending are consistent with the so‐called “flypaper effect,” which means that increased transfers of resources result in increased spending rather than equivalent reductions in taxation. To assess the impact of aid transfers on revenue generation more directly, Table 3 presents estimates for error‐correction models of tax collection. To the extent that aid is associated with both increased expenditure and increased tax effort, it can be presumed that aid is not being diverted into unproductive government consumption and/or siphoned off to the private sector (Mosley, Hudson, and Horrell 1987, 626). Increased spending combined with reduced tax effort, on the other hand, tends to imply the possibility of just the opposite. Precisely how these different patterns of governmental response affect poverty, growth, or other macroeconomic outcomes is a separate question, which cannot be addressed within the confines of this analysis. Presumably, however, development gains are more likely to be achieved when aid is associated with increased or even constant tax effort rather than reductions in local revenue generation.         "
"33","The impact of aid on taxation is assessed in Table 3 on the basis of three models that parallel those presented in Table 1. Although all three of the coefficients for lagged aid are negative, only one is statistically significant, implying that aid bears only a weak relationship to revenue effort. Accordingly, the evidence suggests that aid, like federal transfers to subnational governments, fosters increased spending rather than offsetting reductions in taxation. Limiting the regressions to the post‐1980 period of increased orthodoxy, conditionality, and donor coordination, on the other hand, suggests the possibility of a more perverse pattern of fiscal response. The negative coefficient for aid/imports becomes statistically significant at the .001 level, and the coefficient for aid/expenditures approaches the .05 level (.07).         "
"34","Although the results are not presented here, it may be noted that the estimations for overall revenue generation for the 1970–99 period conform to the same pattern. Aid dependence is negatively linked with the growth of state revenues, with the coefficients for lagged aid negative and statistically significant in two of the three estimated models. Two‐stage least‐squares estimation, with the change in expenditures modeled as a function of lagged expenditures, changes in revenues, lagged aid, and changes in aid, yields somewhat different results, but the coefficients for the indicators of aid dependence remain negative and statistically significant in two of the three models."
"35","As indicated by Table 4, the findings again remain robust even with the analysis limited to the post‐1980 period. The coefficients for aid and changes in aid consistently point to a negative relationship between aid and revenue generation, with two of the three lagged indicators of aid statistically significant at the .05 level or better. Moreover, the negative coefficient for the change in aid/GNI suggests that aid operates as a negative incentive for revenue generation over both the short and long run. Aid thus ends up being a substitute for rather than a complement to revenue effort.         "
"36","These findings with respect to revenue generation strengthen the meaning and significance of the linkage between aid and government spending by suggesting that aid is translated into both increased private and public sector consumption, rather than investment in developmental goals. While the positive impact of aid on government spending might theoretically be associated with constant or even increased revenue‐raising effort, as routinely anticipated by program agreements between the international financial institutions and recipient nations, the results presented here point to the problem of aid fungibility. High levels of aid dependence have failed to create strong incentives for governments to marshal new resources for developmental aims: instead, aid has simultaneously fostered the growth of government spending and the reduction of revenue effort. Given that fiscal reform, involving reduced spending and/or increased revenue generation, is a goal routinely incorporated into aid programs, including those focused principally on poverty reduction, these findings underline the contradictions built into contemporary programs of developmental assistance."
"37","Prior research has repeatedly questioned the capacity of development assistance programs to promote market‐oriented policy reforms or otherwise achieve their intended objectives. The slippage between goals and outcomes has been mainly attributed to variables operating at the level of the domestic political economy rather than to the policy goals or practices of the donor community. Taking as its theoretical point of departure the literature on fiscal federalism, this article develops and tests an alternative perspective, which suggests that external assistance systematically generates incentives and opportunities for the expansion of government spending."
"38","The findings with respect to government expenditures are consistent with theoretical expectation. Over the 1970–99 period, as well as the more limited 1980–99 period of increased development orthodoxy, aid dependence fostered the growth of government in middle‐ and lower‐income nations. Aid thus emerges as an important determinant of government size that has been seriously neglected in prior research. Indeed, for middle‐ and lower‐income nations, aid has a stronger impact on spending than most standard explanatory variables, including per capita income, trade openness, population size, and age structure."
"39","The findings of this study also have significant implications for the study of foreign aid. The positive relationship between aid and state spending is consistent with prior qualitative research suggesting that aid enhances the ability of politicians to channel funds to their supporters but creates weak incentives for policy change (Van de Walle 2001). At issue, however, is not merely the potential wastefulness or inefficacy of aid programs, but the tension between external assistance and contemporary developmental thinking. Given the emphasis that the development assistance community has placed upon the reduction of the role of the state in the economy, the positive nexus between aid and state size calls into particular question the effectiveness of aid as an instrument of market‐oriented reform.         "
"40","Expanding the analysis to consider the revenue side of the equation strengthens the inferences that may be drawn about the impact of developmental assistance programs. The results of this study indicate that aid fails to create incentives for the mobilization of public resources on behalf of development; on the contrary, aid dependence is linked with reduced revenue generation. The implication is that aid dependence fosters more aid dependence, rather than the realization of the developmental goals sought via development assistance."
"41","To the extent that economic investment and growth revolve around the reduction of the role of the state in the economy, as suggested by neoorthodox economics, the contradictions embedded in aid programs may be even more profound. By creating incentives for the expansion of the state, aid can be seen as fostering rent‐seeking behavior at the expense of productive economic activities. From a market‐oriented perspective on development, foreign assistance thus represents a largely futile and self‐defeating enterprise."
"42","For the analysis of the impact of aid on politics in low‐ and middle‐income nations, the implications of the preceding analysis are also anything but optimistic. Underlining the broader theoretical relevance of the literature on public finance, the findings point to major parallels between external aid and intergovernmental grants and transfers. By weakening the nexus between expenditures and taxation, both tend to promote the expansion of the public sector. The implication is that external assistance may generate other problems that parallel those associated with the intergovernmental transfer of resources, including reduced political accountability and the emergence of moral hazard problems. The recent political history of Argentina, in which intergovernmental transfers attenuated electoral accountability and policy responsibility at the provincial level of government at the expense of the national adjustment effort, offers ample illustration of the potential costs."
"43","From a policy perspective, the obvious question is how can the contradictions between the purposes of development assistance programs and their consequences be resolved. Recognizing the tension between the two may represent an important step toward the development of more effective aid programs. Neoorthodox policy prescriptions calling for fiscal reform and the reduction of the state role in the economy have been incorporated into aid programs involving nations in which the ratio of government spending to GDP is minuscule in comparison with the advanced industrial nations. Likewise, prescriptions for state retrenchment routinely find their way into a broad array of aid programs, including those whose central purpose is defined as poverty alleviation, producing contradictory messages and unimplementable programs. Making state‐building (as distinct from “good governance”) a central goal of development assistance might help to effect a more productive alignment of goals and outcomes."
"44","Given the entrenchment of neoliberal policy perspectives in the leading donor institutions, however, state building is unlikely to become a central priority. The dilemmas confronting the development assistance community are thus profound. Given the tragic disparity between the living standards of citizens in the advanced industrial nations and other parts of the world, normative as well as practical pressures for the continuation of some form of international assistance will remain considerable. At the same time, the evidence presented in this article suggests that aid may produce not only ineffective but counterproductive effects. Channeling aid to countries with “good policies” does not obviate the difficulty: aid systematically undermines “good policies,” as defined by the prevailing economic wisdom, and fosters aid dependence."
"45","The obvious conclusion is that a broader rethinking of the political economy of development is overdue. If aid is not an effective instrument of development, as suggested not only by this article but much prior research, then efforts to address the imbalances between the developed and less developed regions of the world might prove more effective and more consistent with market‐oriented perspectives on development if they relied less on resource transfers between governments and official agencies and more on economic exchanges among private actors. Removing the barriers to trade in textiles and agricultural products that have been erected by the advanced capitalist nations would be a useful start. Such barriers, including tariffs, quotas, and subsidies, disproportionately disadvantage private‐sector producers in the less industrialized nations, reducing export earnings in countries such as Mali by amounts that do not begin to be covered by official aid transfers (Oxfam 2002). As recently emphasized by World Bank President James Wolfensohn, the $50 billion spent on development assistance annually pales in comparison with the $350 billion that wealthy nations are spending on agricultural subsidies each year (Andrews 2002). Given the magnitude of the resulting market distortions, the developmental gains that could be realized by applying the logic of free markets to the architecture of the international trading system far outstrip anything achievable on the basis of official development assistance.         "
"46","These policy considerations to one side, the central implications of this study for future research are straightforward. Any effort to explain variations in government size around the globe needs to address the issue of aid flows. Similarly, future research on the impact of aid needs to take step back from the study of broad macroeconomic outcomes to consider the question of government spending and revenue generation."
