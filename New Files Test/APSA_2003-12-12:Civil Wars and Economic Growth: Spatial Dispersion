"1","To derive the reduced‐form growth equation for the estimations, we utilize a Solow (1957) neoclassical growth model that is augmented to include human capital (Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992) and a civil war influence. Such models employ a production relationship for which diminishing returns (i.e., decreasing marginal product) apply to each input as it is varied in isolation. Constant returns to scale hold so that as all inputs are varied proportionately, output changes by the same proportion. That is, a doubling of all inputs leads to a doubling of output.         "
"2","The augmented Solow growth model hinges on two components: a neoclassical production function and capital transition equations. The production function relates income per capita, y(t), to physical capital (i.e., machines, plants, residential structures, and equipment) per capita, k(t), and human capital per capita, h(t). Labor is in the denominators of the income and the capital input terms, since everything is in per capita terms. Technological change is embodied in the improvement in labor effectiveness. The capital transition equations—one for physical capital and one for human capital—indicate that the growth of physical or human capital equals the share of income saved, sk and sh, and devoted to augmenting physical or human capital less a composite labor term that detracts from capital per capita formation. This composite labor term equals the sum of the growth in labor (n), labor's enhanced efficiency (g) from technological change, and capital depreciation (δ). Anything that bolsters labor—labor growth or its improved efficiency—increases the denominator of capital per capita, and so reduces its growth and that of income per capita. Depreciation or the gradual wearing down of capital through use or age also limits capital growth.         "
"3","Based on a series of substitutions involving the production function and the transition equations, we can derive an equation for the long‐run steady‐state growth of income per capita (gr):1"
"4","Migration can be easily incorporated into the model by merely replacing composite labor terms with (m+n+g+δ), where m is the growth of labor due to migration. For example, the inflow of refugees from a nearby civil war can lead to in‐migration and may adversely affect income per capita growth. Migration may, however, bolster growth if the migrants bring in human capital, so that sh increases.         "
"5","From a theoretical perspective, civil wars can adversely affect income per capita growth at home through a number of avenues. First, a civil conflict can destroy physical and human capital. Second, by disrupting trade flows and day‐to‐day marketing activities, civil wars can inhibit growth. Third, civil wars may divert the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) owing to heightened perceived risks of investors. Because FDI is an important source of savings that finances investment in LDCs, a fall in FDI results in reduced growth. Heightened instability and risks will also limit investment at home and cause a flight of savings abroad. Fourth, civil wars redirect government expenditures from productive social overhead capital (e.g., roads, schools, and bridges) to less productive defense spending. Fifth, such wars may cause the internal displacement of people as their homes either come under rebel control or are destroyed, so that income per capita is adversely influenced. Sixth, civil wars often result in the breakdown of the health infrastructure leading to a lack of medical care, less clean drinking water, and reduced sanitation, all of which have negative consequences on economic activities and growth."
"6","There are analogous considerations that may reduce income per capita and its growth in countries in proximity to those experiencing an internal war. Propinquity may result in collateral damage to infrastructure and capital from battles fought in neighboring states, especially when battles are close to the border. Neighboring states must allocate resources to secure their borders from rebel incursions, which direct resources away from more productive activities. Refugee inflows may stretch a government's resources thin, while increasing population growth, which can reduce income per capita. Negative spillovers are anticipated to be greater for nations close to many civil wars—e.g., central Africa. The diffusion is apt to be beyond immediate neighbors owing to regional economic integration and regional multiplier effects (Easterly and Levine 1998). In fact, these regional multiplier effects can lead to negative economic consequences resonating through reduced trade and reinforcing flights of capital. Thus, economic impacts may even increase further from some conflicts as nearby countries reduce trade with others in the region, and potential investors brand even nonneighboring countries as poor investment risks. As countries in a conflict‐ridden region contract their economic activities, the multiplier can amplify the civil‐war induced downturn at relatively great distances from the conflict. Sufficient time may, however, enable an impacted country to erect a firewall to insulate its economy from the harmful effects of nearby long‐running conflicts.         "
"7","In terms of Equation (1), there are four potential channels—human capital, physical capital, labor growth, and an intercept shift—by which civil wars can influence income per capita growth in other nearby countries. Tests are conducted to identify the channel. By testing for an interaction between the civil war spillover measure and human capital, we can determine whether the channel is going through the latter. For physical capital, we add an investment equation that partly depends on civil war spillovers to ascertain if this is the channel. To investigate the labor growth avenue, we first introduce the civil war spillover measure as a proxy for migration in the labor term in Equation (1) and then estimate the resulting equation. When the impact of nearby civil wars is just a country‐specific influence, its effect can be captured by an intercept term. A nonlinear joint test between the migration‐based and the intercept‐based estimates identifies the appropriate channel.         "
"8","The point of departure for the empirical work is Equation (1). For a particular starting point (time = 0) and observation period (time =t), we can parameterize the model as:            "
"9","We are interested in presenting both long‐run and short‐run growth estimates of Equation (3). In the former, the growth of income per capita is for 35 years (1961–95) and better represents the long‐run convergence to a steady‐state level as specified by the theoretical model. For the short run, Equation (3) forms the basis for the estimates but involves five‐year observational periods, so that the long‐run steady‐state assumption, used to derive the model, is less likely to hold (see Burnside and Dollar 2000; Forbes 2000).         "
"10","Time‐series data that facilitate measurements of gr, y0, invest, school, and netlabor are readily available. Income per capita (y) is measured as the real GDP per capita in constant dollars and is available in the Penn World Tables Mark 5.6 (PWT) for the years 1960–92 and from the World Bank (http://www.worldbank.org/research/growth/GDNdata.htm) after 1992. To distinguish the various years, we attach the last two digits of the year; thus, y60 is the measure of income per capita in 1960. Growth rates are obtained as the difference in the natural logarithms of the ending and beginning incomes per capita for the period. The average investment share (invest) is the arithmetic average of the investment shares over all years in the period. Annual population growth (n) is computed as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the ending value to the starting value divided by the number of years. For example, the annual growth of labor for 1961 to 1995 is ln(pop95/pop61) ÷ 35. Both the annual investment shares and the population data are from PWT 5.6, and the corresponding updates are from the World Bank.         "
"11","Human capital accumulation (school) is measured by the percentage of the population older than 25 that has attained secondary school (see Barro and Lee 2000). Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992, 418) indicate that the human‐capital‐augmented growth model may rely on either the rate of human‐capital accumulation or the level, but that some care must be exercised in interpreting the coefficients. Thus, our model corresponds most closely with their Equation (12). The attainment data is available quinquennially with the last two digits of the year identifying the year, so that school60, for example, denotes the attainment in 1960.         "
"12","With data on y0, invest, school, netlabor, and economic growth, the parameters of Equation (3) are easily estimated. Unlike Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) and others, who are interested in testing the theoretical relationship between the independent variables and growth, we take this economic structure as given and look for additional factors, in particular, civil war, that may directly affect long‐run and short‐run economic growth. In a standard economic application, such factors are generally lumped into the catchall error term. Our goal is to offer estimates of the growth effects on the war‐torn country and its neighbors by augmenting the model with measures of civil war.         "
"13","We apply two alternative measures of the presence of a civil war during the observational period: (i) a (0, 1) dummy indicating whether or not a country or its neighbor(s) experienced a civil war (civilwar and neighbor_civilwar, respectively); and (ii) the number of months, if any, that a country or its neighbor(s) experienced a civil war over the observational period (tmonths and neighbor_tmonths, respectively). The data on tmonths come from Collier and Hoeffler (2002) and are fully described in their appendix. Essentially, they offer an update to the Correlates of War Project (Singer and Small 1993) through most of the 1990s.         "
"14","The construction of the neighbor_civilwar and neighbor_tmonths variables is particularly interesting. Generally, we want these measures to reflect the existence and duration, respectively, of civil war in “neighboring” countries. The issue is how to define neighbor. We employ three different definitions. In the first, two countries are neighbors if they share a common border; i.e., mere contiguity. The second definition builds on the first (contiguity) by making an allowance for the length of the common border. The third is based on the actual distance, using closest approach, between nations. If two countries are within some stated distance, then we define them to be neighbors. This distance‐based definition is implemented for distances of 100 km, 300 km, and 800 km.4"
"15","These definitions provide the basis for computing weighted averages of the civil war measures (civilwar and tmonths) in neighboring nations. As an example of how we compute the various measures, consider a hypothetical country called “A” that has three contiguous neighbors “B,”“C,” and “D,” two neighbors (“E” and “F”) that are not contiguous but within 100 km, and three neighbors (“G,”“H,” and “I”) that are farther away than 100 km but within 300 km. Next, assume that in the sample period under study, there are months of civil war as follows: A = 0, B = 0, C = 24, D = 6, E = 0, F = 36, G = 0, H = 12, and I = 48. Using the contiguity definition of neighbors, our measures would be:            "
"16","As an alternative to simple contiguity, we also consider a contiguity definition of neighbor that includes the length of the common border. Let the common borders between A and B, A and C, and A and D equal 200 km, 300 km, and 500 km, respectively. Using the border lengths, we have:            "
"17","Our third‐neighbor definition is based on distance between countries. If we define a neighbor to be any country within 100 km, then country A has five neighbors (B, C, D, E, and F). Thus, our measures would be            "
"18","Expanding the reach to 300 km does two things. First, country A will have three additional neighbors. Second, we are using the weighted average to define the measures, so that the denominator in the weights will increase, thereby giving less weight to any neighbor's influence. (Understanding this is essential for interpreting the estimated coefficients presented below.) In our hypothetical example, neighbor_civilwar will change to 5/8, while neighbor_tmonths will change to 15.75.         "
"19","There are at least two reasons that, a priori, we may anticipate greater economic consequences from civil wars as the distance measure of neighborliness increases. First, there may be more civil wars as the reach is extended. More wars make for greater potential economic impacts. Second, there are more avenues at enhanced distances for the economic spillovers to reach a specific country. For example, a reference country may have six contiguous neighbors, none of which have a civil war. Under contiguity, our spillover measure is then zero. Extending the reach to 300 km, we may find a civil war in a country that is contiguous with, say, three of the reference country's immediate neighbors. As these neighbors are negatively affected by the civil war, the reference country is also negatively influenced through all of them. This type of regional multiplier suggests that the economic spillovers may be more pronounced when “neighbors” encompass not only contiguous, but also more distant neighbors. The appropriate distance to capture these spillovers is an empirical question that can be answered by trying alternative distances and finding the one with the most significant outcome.         "
"20","To find the border lengths between all contiguous countries in our sample, we consult the CIA Factbook (2000), which gives border lengths as of 2000. In cases where a country's borders changed over the observational period (e.g., Yugoslavia), the country is dropped from the respective period. The borders in the CIA Factbook are irrelevant for some countries prior to 1990 because of subsequent division of the country. To include these cases in the early observational periods, we used the independent states definitions in Gleditsch and Ward (2000) and various paper atlases to reconstruct the geography (in terms of border lengths) of the countries during the sample period. Thus, the number of observations per sample period is not necessarily the same.5 For distance, we use the raw distance matrices, developed by Gleditsch and Ward (2000), which provide the minimum distance between all pairs of countries up to 950 km.         "
"21","With data on civilwar, tmonths and the various definitions of neighbor_civilwar and neighbor_tmonths, we can simply insert combinations of these variables as regressors in Equation (3) and then test variations of the model.         "
"22","We first present the long‐run estimates, followed by the short‐run estimates."
"23","In Table 1, estimations for variants of Equation (3) are displayed for the world sample of 84 countries over the 1961–95 period. There are ten variants of the model that allow for the five alternative calculations of spatial average and the two measures of civil wars. The primary economic determinants of economic growth (invest, netlabor, and school) as well as the initial level of income per capita (y0) enter every specification and are remarkably robust to the different specifications of the civil war effects.6"
"24","Because the dependent variable in each regression is the growth of income per capita over the 35‐year period, the estimated coefficients reflect the contribution of that variable to long‐run economic growth. For example, investments in physical and human capital are both positive and significant influences on the long‐run growth of per capita income, while the measure for the growth in the labor force net of depreciation and augmentation is a negative but insignificant long‐run influence. The investment coefficient is approximately 0.5, indicating that a unit change in the natural logarithm of invest would have an influence of approximately one‐half of a percent in economic growth, hardly an intuitive measure. In order to gain more intuition on the size of the marginal investment effect, we calculate the derivative of gr with respect to invest as:               "
"25","The estimates on y0, the initial level of GDP per capita, suggest that (in the limit) we should see convergence in income per capita because countries with smaller initial levels of per capita income tend to grow faster. This finding implies that countries whose economies are devastated by a civil war may tend to grow faster after the conflict is over.            "
"26","The estimates on the dummy variable civilwar indicate that regardless of the representation for the spatial diffusion, the presence of a civil war causes about a 0.17 fall in per capita income growth in the home country. Given the overall mean growth of 0.55, this implies that the (conditional) mean growth falls by 0.17/0.55 = 31% owing to civil war. The estimates on the duration measure (tmonths) are never statistically significant, so that civilwar appears to be the better measure in terms of goodness of fit. This is a surprising result that we investigate in detail below.            "
"27","One of our primary concerns, the spatial reach of spillovers from civil war, can be analyzed by comparing the five sets of models in Table 1, which only differ by the construction of the measures of civil war neighboring nations. Looking first at contiguity, we see that neither the spatial average of neighbor_civilwar nor the spatial average of neighbor_tmonths is statistically significant at conventional levels. This same finding is observed in the border lengths measures and when neighbors are defined as countries within 100 km. However, with the 300 km definition and even more so with the 800 km definition of neighbors, the consequence of civil war in neighbors appears to have a strong negative effect on home‐country economic growth. Using the R‐squares as a benchmark, the best fit of the data appears in the 800 km model, consistent with the notion that the effects of civil wars can reach significant distances with time. This is a striking and novel result that demonstrates the importance of expanding the distance measure of neighbors to capture the regional multiplier and the inclusion of more wars.            "
"28","The 800 km estimated coefficient on neighbor_civilwar (−0.4228) implies that a unit change in the neighbor_civilwar term is associated with a 0.4228 decline in long‐term economic growth; i.e., a decline that practically equals the average increase in growth of 0.55 for the sample. Some care, however, must be exercised when interpreting this coefficient. Owing to its construction as a spatial average, the range is the unit interval so that a change of one unit is a radically large change. There are two additional ways to analyze this effect. The first is to use an elasticity measure. For the 800 km models, the mean of neighbor_civilwar and gr are 0.29 and 0.55, so that the elasticity is approximately −0.23, indicating that neighborhood consequences and the reach of civil war can be quite substantial. Recall that the elasticity of school was approximately 0.42; hence, the magnitude of the spillover effect is a little over one‐half the size of the effect of schooling.            "
"29","A more intuitive way to study the size of the neighbor_civilwar effect is to calculate the predicted impact from an additional civil war in a neighbor. The advantage of this approach is that we can then compare the neighbor effect directly to the own‐country effect. By construction of the neighbor_civilwar, the effect of an additional civil war in a neighbor will depend on the estimated coefficient and the number of neighbors. For example, using 100 km to define neighbors, the average number of neighbors is approximately four, making the average weight in the spatial average 0.25. If we assume an additional civil war in a neighbor, the neighbor_civilwar term would increase by 0.25. The predicted change (point estimate) on gr would be the estimated coefficient (−0.18) times the change neighbor_civilwar (0.25); i.e., −0.18 × 0.25 =−0.045. With the reach expanded to 300 km, the average number of neighbors is approximately five, so that an extra civil war in a neighbor would change neighbor_civilwar by 0.20. The corresponding coefficient from Table 1 is −0.2556 so that economic growth is predicted to fall by 0.2556 × 0.20 = 0.051, slightly larger than the estimate in the 100 km model. In the best‐fitting model (800 km), the average number of neighbors is approximately eight so that an additional civil war in a neighbor yields an increase in neighbor_civilwar of 0.125. With an estimated coefficient of −0.4228, the predicted decline in economic growth is 0.4228 × 0.125 = 0.053, again a slight increase from the previous model. In the 800 km model, a civil war at home is associated with a decline in economic growth of 0.1648, while an additional civil war in a neighbor is associated with a decline of approximately 0.05 or about 30% of the home‐country effect.            "
"30","As discussed earlier, there is some question about how civil wars in neighboring countries influence economic growth. The specifications presented in Table 1 assume that the influence is direct through an exogenous country‐specific effect. To test for indirect avenues, we estimate other specifications that allow the civil war spillover (based on the 800 km definition) to work through invest, netlabor, or school. For the first indirect pathway, we estimate an auxiliary regression with the natural logarithm of invest as the dependent variable and civilwar and neighbor_civilwar along with the natural logarithms of netlabor and school as the independent variables:               "
"31","A second indirect pathway for civil wars in neighboring countries to influence economic growth is through migration. All else equal, migration should decrease economic growth by increasing netlabor. To test this hypothesis, recall that netlabor=n+ 0.05. If neighbor_civilwar causes in migration, netlabor will be augmented accordingly. A simple model that allows for this possibility is a redefinition of netlabor to be               "
"32","The third avenue that we examine allows for migration into a country to depreciate the human capital stock. In this case, we form a specification that includes the neighbor_civilwar interacted with the school term. The interaction term allows the growth returns to schooling to change depending on the size of the influence of neighboring civil wars. Once again, we uncover no statistical evidence in favor of the interaction term.            "
"33","The results of these three sets of tests support that the observed negative growth effects of nearby civil wars arise from factors such as uncertainty and the direct disruption of economic activity, rather than from the dilution of the population's human capital, enhanced population growth from migration, or significant decreases in the long‐term investment ratio. Thus, the estimates of Table 1 are supported.8"
"34","Curiously, the performance of civilwar relative to tmonths seems to indicate that the simple existence of civil war, either at home or in neighbors, is the relevant factor in explaining the impacts of civil war on long‐run economic growth. Recognizing that the influence of tmonths may be more complicated than the simple linear model underlying the results presented in Table 1, we tested other specifications of tmonths. The results are presented as Model (1) in Table 2, where we have replaced the continuous variable tmonths with dummy variables (DV) that categorize duration into three groups: duration of a year or less (TM12), more than a year but not more than four years (TM < 48), and greater than four years (TM > 48). The duration of civil wars in neighbors (within 800 km) is classified in exactly the same fashion. In terms of home‐country civil war, the coefficient estimates indicate that the significant effect is for wars of fairly long duration, while in terms of neighbor civil wars, relatively short wars appear to be the most important factor. This eventual insulation from the harmful economic consequences from a nearby civil war is indicative of the erection of a firewall. Such firewalls are not feasible against a home‐grown civil war.            "
"35","That longer civil wars have a greater influence on the host country's long‐run economic growth than shorter wars is intuitive. Because we compute the growth over a 35‐year period, a country may be able to recover from the economic consequences of a brief civil war early in the sample period. More insight on this timing factor is gained by looking at Models (2) and (3) in Table 2, where we consider when the civil wars occur in terms of the first or second half of the sample period. In Model (2), tmonths since 1976 (TM76‐95) is quite significant in stark contrast to the tmonths' results presented earlier in Table 1. Similarly, in Model (3), the important determinant is a civil war in the second half of the sample period. There is no evidence that these temporal distinctions provide additional insights into the relationship between neighbors' civil wars and long‐run economic growth, confirming our prior finding that just the existence of civil war in neighbors matters. When the war drags out over a long period of time, the war's effects will diminish as the nation insulates itself.            "
"36","The results in Table 2 suggest that we may gain substantial insights into the relationship between civil war and economic growth by looking at shorter time periods. In Table 3, we display variations of Equation (3) where the variables are defined over five‐year time periods. With 35 years of data, we have seven five‐year periods starting with 1961 for the 84 countries in the long‐run sample. Additionally, data from countries that had a missing value in either 1961 or 1995, but not in other years, are included, making for 626 observations.9 Because countries are observed over several five‐year periods, the short‐run dataset is referred to as a “panel dataset.” There are ten variants of the model displayed in Table 3, accounting for the spatial transmission processes, where the dependent variable is the five‐year growth of income per capita. Time fixed effects were included in all of the models but are not displayed to conserve space. The qualitative conclusions about the role of initial income per capita, investment in physical and human capital, and net increases in the labor force are essentially the same in the short run as in the long run. Unlike the long‐run estimates, the expected negative impact of the netlabor term is significant in the short run. In terms of civilwar and tmonths, the short‐run estimates appear to confirm the long‐run findings that the mere presence or absence of a civil war, and not its duration, offers the best measure and that the spillovers from civil wars in neighbors reach to 800 km.            "
"37","Civil war is a negative and significant influence on short‐run income per capita growth in Table 3, with the coefficient estimate of approximately −0.05; i.e., the five‐year growth in per capita real GDP is expected to be 0.05 less if there is a civil war in that country during the five‐year period. Given that the mean five‐year growth is approximately 0.06, countries that experience civil war are predicted to have close to zero economic growth. In contrast to the long run where we found that a civil war over the 35‐year period would cause growth to fall by about 31% of the sample mean, we find that a civil war causes short‐run growth to decline by almost 85% (0.05/0.06) of the sample mean. This result is sensible and illustrates a fundamental characteristic of the growth process: over long periods of time, an economy can recover, even catch‐up to the average, from a disruption like a civil war.            "
"38","The spillover effect of nearby civil wars shows up with the distance representation and is strongest at 800 km just as in the long‐run case. For the worldwide sample, the diffusion of the negative economic influence is quite far, thereby suggesting that dispersion is fairly rapid owing to regional multiplier effects. This concurs with the results of Table 2. The spillover point estimate (−0.094) is substantially smaller than in the long run. The spatial average‐number civil wars in any given five‐year period is also much smaller (0.12, compared to 0.29 in the long run) because there are fewer civil wars in neighbors in any given five‐year period when compared to the entire 35‐year period. Thus, the implied elasticity of neighbor_civilwar in Table 3 for the 800 km model is −0.19, which is somewhat less than the long‐run model, thus implying that spillover effects may take longer than five years to have their full impact on economic growth. The implied marginal impact of an additional civil war in a country within 800 km is approximately −0.012 (=0.125 ×−0.094). Compared to the effect of a civil war at home (−0.05), we see that a neighboring civil war influence is approximately 24% of the home‐country effect, thus confirming that the spillover effects may take longer than five years to reach their maximum impact.            "
"39","Additional tests with the short‐run dataset confirm our findings from the long run that civil war in neighboring countries does not seem to alter significantly the investment ratio, the growth returns to schooling, or the relationship between netlabor and economic growth.10 The auxiliary investment regression, including fixed effects for time and country, shows that neither the civilwar nor the neighbor_civilwar coefficient is a significant determinant of the five‐year investment ratio. Recall that in the long‐run auxiliary model civilwar was negative and significant. Evidently, the short‐run period of five years is not long enough for home‐country civil war to change the investment ratio. Forming the joint model with neighbor_civilwar entering directly and indirectly in the netlabor term [Equation (10)], we again find that the estimate for θ (0.10) is statistically insignificant from zero (t‐ratio = 0.42), suggesting that migration does not explain the short‐run negative consequences of civil war in neighbors. Similarly, the interaction of school and neighbor_civilwar is insignificant with a point estimate of 0.072 and t‐ratio = 1.10.            "
"40","The estimates displayed in Table 3 seem to suggest that tmonths is insignificant. Following the analysis developed for the long‐run model, we investigate this by looking at classifications of tmonths. As displayed in the top third of Table 4, we define three classes: civil wars up to one year (TM12), more than a year but not over two years (TM < 24), and longer than two years (TM > 24). Using these classifications instead of tmonths in the 800 km model, we get the coefficient estimates as displayed under Model (1) in Table 4. The coefficient on civil wars up to one year in length is strongly significant and with approximately the same magnitude as the civil war dummy variable in Table 3. Additionally, the coefficient on the classification for civil wars more than a year but not over two years, while not significant, is of approximately the same magnitude. The magnitude falls substantially for civil wars greater than two years. The coefficients on the neighbor civil war terms display a similar pattern; i.e., the one‐year duration measure is significant and of approximately the same magnitude of the next longest classification. For wars greater than two years, the magnitude is substantially less.            "
"41","These patterns suggest that we test combining the first two classifications and dropping the third for a more parsimonious specification. This requires four restrictions: (1) the coefficient on TM > 24 equals 0, (2) the coefficient on NeighborTM > 24 is greater than 0, (3) the coefficients on TM12 and TM < 24 are equal, and (4) the coefficients of NeighborTM12 and NeighborTM < 24 are equal. The F‐statistic for testing these restrictions is 0.49. With four degrees of freedom in the numerator and 609 degrees of freedom in the denominator, the p‐value for the statistic is 0.74, suggesting that we fail to reject the restrictions. The estimates from the parsimonious model are presented in the Model (2) column of Table 4, where the definition of TM024 captures civil wars up to two years in length. This specification is actually “better” in a best‐fitting sense than the model with the civil war dummy variable and suggests that even in the short run, there is some economic robustness with respect to lengthy civil wars both at home and in neighbors. We can test for this notion by including lagged values of the civil war measures in the model. If the economic effects persist, then we would expect to see significant lagged values. However, as shown in the Model (3) column of Table 4, there is no evidence that consequences of civil war persist past the current period. Like the long‐run results, firewalls take about two years to erect, and nations can recuperate from the ravishes of civil wars.            "
"42","By representing neighbors with a distance matrix, we are better able to display significant civil war influences on growth from civil wars in nearby, but not necessarily adjacent, countries in the short and long run. These civil war influences on income per capita growth are quite substantial. For example, a country that experiences a civil war and also has the misfortune to be nearby other countries with civil wars is apt to experience negative annual growth instead of their typical positive growth. Thus, policies to bring peace to civil‐war‐torn countries have a return not only for the conflict‐ridden country, but also for its neighbors. The spatial diffusion of these detrimental influences peaks at 800 km owing to the inclusion of more wars and regional multiplier influences where economic impacts are enhanced through trade and other factors. The presence of such collateral damage indicates that policy makers may wish to consider foreign aid in countries some distance from a civil war, because growth‐inhibiting consequences can diffuse widely."
"43","When quantifying these civil war influences, we find that a civil war at home can reduce a country's growth by 31% in the long run and by 85% in the short run. This difference in impact highlights how time allows an economy to repair itself. Moreover, each additional nearby civil war can lower growth by approximately 30% of the host‐country effect in the long run and by 24% of the host‐country effect in the short run. Thus, a country in a region with three or more civil wars may be equally impacted as a country experiencing a civil war. The temporal analysis indicates that countries successfully erect firewalls within a couple of years to limit these negative consequences to their growth from nearby civil wars. In contrast, the host country experiences greater harm as the war drags on. Within the sample period, the timing of the war is crucial, because nations rebound from the devastation once the civil war ends. Wars occurring in the second half of the long‐run period have a significant impact on growth in contrast to wars occurring in the first half of the period."
