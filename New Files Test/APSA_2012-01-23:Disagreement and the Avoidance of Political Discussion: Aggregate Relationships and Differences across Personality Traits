"1","For some time, researchers have noted that people tend to have similar attributes and views, including political views, to those with whom they regularly interact (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Finifter 1974; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1987, 1995; McPherson, Smith‐Lovin, and Cook 2001; Mutz 2002b). Evidence of such homophily—“birds of a feather flocking together”—in social networks suggests that even if politics (or any topic for that matter) is discussed, new information may not be acquired because people are only sharing like‐minded views. There is also evidence, however, that political discussion networks are not strictly homogeneous (Huckfeldt et al. 1995; Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2002; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995). In fact, there is some evidence to suggest that political homogeneity may not be the norm in many networks (Huckfeldt, Mendez, and Osborn 2004).         "
"2","Evidence of heterogeneity in political discussion networks most often rests on measures of candidate preference/vote choice (e.g., Huckfeldt, Mendez, and Osborn 2004; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1987) or party identification as reported by respondents and their discussion partners (e.g., Huckfeldt and Mendez 2008).8 When diversity is measured in this fashion, people appear to have relatively diverse networks, which suggests people will be exposed to a range of opinions. However, we know little about the extent to which people talk to their discussion partners about politics when they disagree with them. If people tend to avoid discussing subjects they disagree about, the potential for a diverse network to lead to sustained exposure to alternative views will not be realized. Huckfeldt and Mendez's (2008) analysis of a sample of over 1,000 registered voters in the Indianapolis, Indiana, and St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan areas provides some evidence that an individual discusses political matters less frequently the more disagreement there is between her and her discussion partners (also see Mutz 2002b, fn. 9). Based on this previous work, we expect the relationship between reported agreement on a topic, such as politics, and the frequency of discussion of that topic to be positive in our national sample of registered voters.         "
"3","Are some people more affected by disagreement (and therefore less willing to discuss politics in the face of it) than others? Our survey included questions used to measure an individual's underlying personality traits, which we discuss in the next section. There is some evidence from previous work on political discussion networks that individual‐level preferences other than personality traits may help determine the extent to which an individual discusses politics. In particular, Mutz's (2002a, 2002b) work on the effects of “cross‐cutting” (i.e., heterogeneous) social networks demonstrates that a person's level of awareness of opposing political views is predicted by the interaction between her or his level of exposure to dissonant political views and her or his “civil orientation toward conflict” (this individual characteristic is measured as the combination of an individual's [1] preference for social harmony and [2] conflict orientation; Mutz 2002b, 118). According to this account, exposure to cross‐cutting political views via discussion results in greater awareness of opposing views, especially for those individuals who value social harmony but are also willing to have a spirited discussion. By contrast, we investigate how disagreement and an individual's general personality dispositions (apart from politics) shape exposure to disagreement in the first place. In this way, our analysis complements Mutz's work by offering insight into the dynamics of initial exposure to potentially informative opposing viewpoints.         "
"4","The particular personality characteristics we consider as potentially explaining both a willingness to discuss different topics and whether to do so in the face of disagreement are measures of the Big Five traits. Although there is no fully comprehensive way to conceptualize and measure an individual's personality, a strong consensus has emerged in psychology that a Five‐Factor Model (FFM) provides an appropriate and comprehensive way of measuring a person's dispositional personality traits (see, e.g., John and Srivastava 1999; McAdams 1995). These dispositional traits—Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability (sometimes referred to by its inverse, Neuroticism), and Openness (to Experience)—are thought of as variations in basic individual‐level tendencies (McCrae and Costa 1996) and are defined in greater detail below. The Big Five appear to be rooted in genetic factors (Bouchard 1997; Plomin et al. 1990; Van Gestel and Van Broeckhoven 2003) and are highly stable through the life cycle (Caspi, Roberts, and Shiner 2005; Costa and McCrae 1992; Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann 2003; but see Srivastava et al. 2003).         "
"5","An additional benefit of examining Big Five personality traits is that, from a theoretical perspective, these dispositional traits are broad, general orientations that are thought to shape individuals’ responses to the vast array of stimuli—political and nonpolitical alike—that people encounter in the world. Thus, the Big Five stand in contrast to many other measures of personality that have been used to predict political outcomes. For example, Hayes, Scheufele, and Huge (2006) find that individuals who score higher on a Willingness to Self‐Censor scale (see Hayes, Glynn, and Shanahan 2005a, 2005b)—i.e., individuals who are “more influenced by the climate of opinion when choosing whether or not to voice an opinion” (Hayes, Scheufele, and Huge 2006, 259)—are less likely to take part in public political activities (e.g., to attend a political meeting). An individual's willingness to self‐censor is conceptually much closer to the amount and type of discussion an individual engages in than the much broader Big Five traits.         "
"6","Despite their breadth, research finds that Big Five traits predict an array of attitudes and behaviors, from job and school performance to alcohol and tobacco consumption, to musical tastes and the way we dress, and to our overall health and a variety of other behaviors and attitudes (see, e.g., Goldberg 1993; Gosling 2008; Graziano and Eisenberg 1997; Hogan and Ones 1997; John and Srivastava 1999; McCrae 1996; Ozer and Benet‐Martinez 2006; Paunonen and Ashton 2001; Watson and Clark 1997). The strength and robustness of findings from research applying the FFM has led to a great deal of enthusiasm among researchers and, recently, the Big Five have also been shown to predict a number of political outcomes. Most notably, there is a great deal of evidence that Big Five traits (Openness and Conscientiousness in particular) are associated with party identification and political ideology (Carney et al. 2008; Gerber et al. 2010; Gerber et al. 2011a; Mondak and Halperin 2008). There is also some evidence that Big Five traits are associated with voting for particular parties or candidates (Caprara, Barbaranelli, and Zimbardo 1999; Caprara et al. 2006; Rentfrow et al. 2009; Schoen and Schumann 2007), various participatory acts, such as voter turnout (Gerber et al. 2011d; Mondak 2010; Mondak and Halperin 2008; Mondak et al. 2010), and political interest and knowledge (Gerber et al. 2011b; Mondak 2010; Mondak and Halperin 2008).         "
"7","To our knowledge, only a few previous studies have examined the relationships between an individual's Big Five traits and the frequency with which that individual engages in political discussion (see Hibbing, Ritchie, and Anderson 2010; Mondak 2010, chap. 4; Mondak and Halperin 2008), and no work has examined the relationships between the Big Five and the frequency with which an individual discusses other topics in comparison to politics. However, there is also other related work on the Big Five or other individual‐level characteristics and social networks. For instance, using an innovative research design that leverages the random assignment of college students to a dorm roommate, Klofstad (2009) finds that the positive association between “civic talk” (discussion of politics and current events) and “civic participation” is more pronounced for individuals who are predisposed to engage in civic talk (measured by the individual's amount of civic discussion and participation in high school).            "
"8","In addition, a few researchers have investigated how the Big Five are linked to various aspects of social networks. Mondak et al. (2010) measure the relationships between the Big Five traits and social network size. They find that Openness and Extraversion are positively associated with the size of an individual's social network and that Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are negatively associated with social network size. They also find that low levels of Agreeableness and high levels of Extraversion strengthen the relationship between social network size and exposure to cross‐cutting political discourse (also reported in Mondak 2010, 119). These results suggest that personality traits may condition the relationship between level of reported agreement with a frequent discussion partner and the frequency with which politics is discussed, a topic we investigate directly below. (In other words, personality traits may condition both who is in one's social network [Mondak et al. 2010] and whether and how frequently politics is discussed with a particular discussion partner.)            "
"9","Building on this prior work, we present several hypotheses regarding the relationships between the Big Five and what people discuss. These hypotheses are based on the nature of political discussion (e.g., it can be contentious), psychologists’ descriptions of the Big Five traits, the results reported in Hibbing, Ritchie, and Anderson (2010), Mondak (2010, chap. 4), Mondak and Halperin (2008), and (where appropriate) other related work.9 We discuss each trait separately and offer a specific prediction for how it should be associated with the frequency of political discussion.10"
"10","Extraversion is defined by “the degree to which a person needs attention and social interaction” (Costa and McCrae 1992, 9). Extraverts are active and assertive, while their counterparts (introverts) are more reserved. This need for social interaction may drive those scoring high on Extraversion to discuss a variety of topics, including politics, more frequently than those scoring low on this trait. The prior work on personality and political discussion is largely supportive of such a prediction. For example, Mondak and Halperin (2008) find Extraversion to be positively associated with the frequency of political discussion in each of their three survey samples.11 Therefore, we expect Extraversion to be positively associated with the frequency of political discussion.            "
"11","Agreeableness is defined by “the degree to which a person needs pleasant and harmonious relations with others” (Costa and McCrae 1992, 9). Individuals scoring high on Agreeableness tend to be compassionate, good‐natured, and eager to cooperate, while those scoring low on Agreeableness are hardheaded and skeptical. Given that individuals scoring high on Agreeableness are eager to cooperate, we expect them to be less likely to discuss contentious topics, such as politics. Mondak and Halperin (2008) find mixed evidence for this expectation (also see Hibbing, Ritchie, and Anderson 2010; Mondak 2010, chap. 4): In one of their samples, Agreeableness is negatively and statistically significantly associated with the frequency of political discussion; in the other two, it is statistically insignificant.            "
"12","Conscientiousness is defined by “the degree to which a person is willing to comply with conventional rules, norms, and standards” (Costa and McCrae 1992, 9). Those scoring high on Conscientiousness are well organized and goal‐oriented, while those scoring low on Conscientiousness are easygoing and careless. We do not have a strong expectation for how Conscientiousness will relate to the frequency with which a person discusses politics. We might expect those scoring high on Conscientiousness to discuss politics more frequently if they view it as a social norm that should be followed. Alternatively, it is difficult to imagine a person who is easygoing and careless being unwilling to discuss politics, so we might expect there to be no difference in the frequency of political discussion between those scoring low and high on Conscientiousness. Mondak and Halperin (2008) find small and statistically insignificant associations between Conscientiousness and the frequency with which a person discusses politics in two of their samples; in their other sample, they find a positive association between Conscientiousness and frequency of political discussion (also see Hibbing, Ritchie, and Anderson 2010). Conversely, Mondak (2010, chap. 4) reports negative associations between Conscientiousness and political discussion. Given both the lack of clear theoretical arguments and the uncertainty in previous research, we do not offer a prediction for Conscientiousness.            "
"13","Emotional Stability is defined by “the degree to which a person experiences the world as threatening and beyond his/her control” (Costa and McCrae 1992, 9). The more emotionally stable are secure, hardy, and relaxed under stressful conditions, while their counterparts, the more neurotic, tend to be anxious, sensitive, and easily upset. Those scoring high on Emotional Stability report being more interested in politics and are more politically knowledgeable (see Gerber et al. 2011b). They are also less likely to regard interpersonal or politically conflictual interactions as threatening (Antonioni 1993; Gerber et al. 2011d). Therefore, we expect Emotional Stability to be associated with greater frequency of political discussion.12"
"14","Finally, Openness is defined by “the degree to which a person needs intellectual stimulation, change, and variety” (Costa and McCrae 1992, 9). Those scoring high on Openness tend to have broad interests and to be imaginative, while those scoring low on this trait are more practical and traditional. The need for intellectual stimulation and variety may drive a person scoring high on Openness to discuss politics more frequently because it is a topic that can challenge people to think about alternative opinions. Moreover, there is evidence that more open individuals are more politically interested and knowledgeable (see Gerber et al. 2011b; Mondak and Halperin 2008). Mondak and Halperin (2008) and Mondak (2010, chap. 4) also find a positive and statistically significant association between Openness and frequency of political discussion in all three of their samples. Therefore, we expect Openness to be positively associated with frequency of political discussion.            "
"15","In addition to direct relationships between the Big Five and the frequency of political discussion between a respondent and her discussion partner, the Big Five may also moderate the relationship between reported agreement on politics and the frequency of political discussion (between the respondent and her discussion partner). Recall that we expect the relationship between reported agreement on a topic, such as politics, and the frequency of discussion of that topic to be uniformly positive. The clearest theoretical basis we have for expecting Big Five traits to moderate this relationship is for Agreeableness. Compared to those scoring low on Agreeableness (individuals who are more “hardheaded” and “competitive”), we expect those scoring high on Agreeableness (individuals who are more “eager to cooperate”) to be less comfortable with disagreement and, thus, less likely to discuss political matters with people they disagree with."
"16","We also expect individuals scoring high on Emotional Stability (who are more “relaxed under stressful conditions”) to be less repelled by disagreement compared to individuals scoring low on Emotional Stability (who are more “sensitive” and “prone to feelings that are upsetting”). Similarly, we expect the assertiveness that is characteristic of individuals scoring high on Extraversion to result in these individuals being more willing to engage in political disagreements. In other words, we expect less emotionally stable, less extraverted, and more agreeable individuals to be more averse to political disagreements and, therefore, particularly unlikely to discuss politics if they disagree with others. By contrast, we do not have clear hypotheses for how Conscientiousness or Openness will moderate the relationship between agreement on political matters and the discussion of politics.            "
"17","Our primary survey data come from the 2007–2008 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project (CCAP; Jackman and Vavreck 2009). The CCAP is an Internet‐based survey conducted by YouGov/Polimetrix that uses a combination of sampling and matching techniques to approximate a random digit dialing sample. (See Section 1 of the online supporting information for further details on sample construction.) The final weighted CCAP sample is nationally representative of registered voters in the United States. All the descriptive statistics and analyses presented below use the sampling weights provided by YouGov/Polimetrix. The CCAP was fielded as a panel survey with five waves before the November 2008 election (the pre‐election waves) and one post‐election wave. Our questions about respondents’ discussion networks were part of the October (or, last pre‐election) wave of the study, and were completed by 682 respondents.13 Demographic characteristics, including the Big Five, were collected in December 2007, except where otherwise noted. See Section 2 of the online supporting information for a complete list of variables, including question wording and coding rules for each variable. In addition to the CCAP survey, we conducted a follow‐up survey in February of 2011 (N = 1,235), which was also fielded by YouGov/Polimetrix (details about question wording in the follow‐up survey are in Section 2 of the supporting information). The data from this follow‐up survey provide a way for us to more carefully examine several issues related to the measurement of discussion frequency and to investigate the robustness of several of our findings. We note some of the key findings from this survey in the text and discuss the results in more detail in Section 4 of the supporting information.         "
"18","The discussion networks battery that we placed on the CCAP permits us to document the frequency with which people talk about a variety of topics and their perceived level of agreement with their discussion partner on the same topics. We do so for the respondent's (1) familial (“Which person in your immediate family do you talk with most frequently?”) and (2) nonfamilial (“Who, outside of your immediate family, do you talk with most frequently?”) network.14 In the case of the nonfamily network, respondents were asked to list the first name of their three “most frequent conversation partners.” One name was then selected at random for the respondent to answer the discussion frequency and topic agreement questions. We note that this generator therefore yields a range of discussion partners, from the most frequent partner one‐third of the time to the third most frequent—a more “distant” person—one‐third of the time.15 After giving the name of a person, respondents were then asked how often they talk with that individual (“Daily or more than daily,”“A few times a week,”“Once a week,” or “Once a month or less”). Following this, respondents were asked, “How often do you talk with [name] about each of the following topics?” (“Never,”“Rarely,”“Sometimes,” or “Often”) and then “Do you think that [name] agrees with your viewpoints on these topics?” (“Mostly agrees,”“Agrees and Disagrees,”“Mostly disagrees,” and “Don't know/Don't talk about”). These questions were asked about seven topics, which appeared in a grid in the following order: (1) “Family/kids/spouse/dating,” (2) “Work,” (3) “God/religion,” (4) “Sports,” (5) “Food,” (6) “Current events/politics,” and (7) “TV/entertainment/celebrities.”            "
"19","The name generators used in this study have two features that might affect which of the respondent's discussion partners are elicited. First, the name generators were designed to identify respondents’ frequent discussion partners. As expected (and as Figure 1, discussed in more detail below, shows), respondents did report frequently discussing a variety of topics with these discussion partners. Second, although we did not specifically ask people to name individuals with whom they discuss “important matters” or “political matters” as is typically done in prior work (see, e.g., Klofstad, McClurg, and Rolfe 2009), our name generator nevertheless did identify (frequent) political discussion partners. We were able to assess this because after the full battery described above was completed, we asked respondents who they “talk with most frequently about politics and current events” and less than 6% of respondents reported someone other than a person they had already named.16 Thus, even though we did not ask for respondents to identify people with whom they discuss political (or important) matters, our name generator appears to have successfully identified these individuals at a high rate.17"
"20","                (a) Average Frequency of Discussion, by Topic. (b) Average Agreement, by Topic"
"21","Before conducting a more detailed statistical analysis, we first show the relationship between disagreement and frequency of discussion. For each of the seven topics, Figure 1 displays the average Frequency of Discussion (Panel A), which ranges from zero (“never”) to three (“often”), and average Agreement (Panel B), which ranges from –1 (“mostly disagrees”) to 1 (“mostly agrees”). (See Table A in the supporting information for a complete set of summary statistics.) Three aspects of these figures are noteworthy. First, politics was the most talked about topic among family members (gray bars; all differences between politics and other topics significant at p < .05 except family [p = .252]) and a close second to work among nonfamily members (white bars; all differences between politics and other topics significant at p < .05 except work [p = .243]).18 Second, although people talk to their family members more than their nonfamily members about each topic (i.e., the gray bars are higher than the white bars for each topic; all within‐topic differences are significant at p < .05), there is remarkable consistency between family members and nonfamily members in terms of which topics are most frequently discussed. For example, sports are by far the least talked about topic, with religion and entertainment also talked about infrequently compared to politics, work, and family. Third, average levels of agreement on topics are, for the most part, closely related to their average frequency of discussion. The lowest levels of agreement are for sports and entertainment, which are discussed relatively infrequently compared to the other topics. Work and family receive the highest levels of agreement and are discussed frequently.            "
"22","For the purpose of the analysis that follows, we create a variable for both relative discussion frequency and relative agreement for each frequent discussion partner (family and nonfamily). These measures account for the total amount of talking or agreement the respondent engages in with her discussion partner. Specifically, for each topic we subtract the average on all other topics from the respondent's score on that topic to create, for example, measures of Relative Frequency of Political Discussion and Relative Agreement on Politics. We use these measures of relative discussion frequency and relative agreement because they account for individual‐level measurement error in response to the questions. For example, some respondents could say “agree” (or “disagree”) for every topic because their impression of agreement differs from other respondents. The relative measures serve to scale the responses for each individual relative to their baseline (average) evaluation.19"
"23","To measure the Big Five traits, we used the Ten‐Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann 2003). A number of batteries have been developed to measure the Big Five trait domains, with each consisting of a list of adjectives (e.g., “temperamental”; Goldberg 1992) or phrases (e.g., “Sometimes I do things on impulse that I later regret”; Costa and McCrae 1992) and asking the respondent to rate how well each adjective or phrase describes the individual whose personality is being rated (typically the respondent). Researchers then use these ratings to calculate scores for each of the Big Five traits. While there are a variety of instruments that can be used to measure the Big Five, ranging from brief batteries of 10 items (such as the TIPI) to batteries that use dozens (Big Five Inventory [BFI]: John, Donahue, and Kentle 1991; Mini‐Markers: Saucier 1994; NEO‐Five‐Factor Inventory [NEO‐FFI]: Costa and McCrae 1992) or even hundreds (NEO‐Personality Inventory‐Revised [NEO‐PI‐R]: Costa and McCrae 1992; International Personality Item Pool [IPIP]: Goldberg et al. 2006) of items, the TIPI is ideal in the survey context because its length and speed of administration make it feasible where longer batteries, such as the BFI or NEO‐PI‐R, are not. Additionally, Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann compared the performance of the TIPI to much longer tests and found that TIPI scores are highly correlated with those obtained from longer instruments (2003, see Tables 6 and 9). Responses to the TIPI also appear to capture meaningful across‐individual variation in personality traits even when measured in explicitly political surveys and appear to be unaffected by political events (Gerber et al. 2011c).20"
"24","The TIPI asks respondents to report whether “I see myself as” characterized by a series of 10 trait pairs (e.g., “Extraverted, enthusiastic”) using a 7‐point scale ordered from Disagree Strongly to Agree Strongly. Each Big Five trait is measured by responses to two trait pairs, with one trait pair for each trait reverse scored to mitigate problems of acquiescence bias. Responses to these 10 questions are used to score a respondent's personality for each of the Big Five traits. In the analysis presented below, each Big Five trait is standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1."
"25","In our simplest model specification, we regress Relative Frequency of Discussion (for a given topic) on Relative Agreement (on that same topic) and a vector of controls.               "
"26","To test for the direct effects of personality on the frequency of discussion for these seven topics, we add our measures of the Big Five to the equation (1) specification:               "
"27","Then, for our analysis of the differential effect of personality by relative agreement on the topic, we extend the equation (2) specification by interacting Personality with Relative Agreement.               "
"28","One potential concern with the equation (3) specification is that it assumes that the associations between personality and frequency of discussion vary only by agreement on the topic—e.g., they do not also vary across gender or racial groups. In order to account for the possibility of such relationships, which recent work examining political ideology has shown is a distinct possibility (Gerber et al. 2010), we also present results from specification (3′) in Section 7 of the supporting information.               "
"29","This specification includes all possible interactions between Relative Agreement and Controls, as well as the interactions between Controls and Personality. It therefore minimizes concerns that any estimated relationship between Personality and Relative Agreement proxies conditional effects of either Relative Agreement or Personality on other measured controls.            "
"30","Table 1 presents the results of model specification (1), which addresses the question of whether citizens are more likely to discuss an issue the more their views are in agreement, for the respondent's familial (Table 1a) and nonfamilial (Table 1b) discussant. We find support for our expectation that, on average, people discuss a topic more frequently the more their views on that topic are in agreement with their discussion partner's views.            "
"31","The relative agreement coefficient is positive and statistically significant for all seven topics in both the family and nonfamily discussion network. Thus, in 14 unique specifications accounting for seven different discussion topics and two different types of discussion partners, we uniformly find that (relative) disagreement is associated with (relative) frequency of discussion. The magnitudes of these effects are also quite large. For example, a two standard deviation increase in relative agreement on politics predicts an increase of about two‐thirds of a standard deviation for how frequently politics is discussed relative to mean topic discussion levels (see column [7] of both tables) in both types of networks.21 This relationship is comparable to the relationship between relative agreement and relative discussion frequency in the other topic areas and is robust to alternative model specifications—including (a) excluding indicators for how often the pair talks (column [8]), (b) using absolute reported agreement instead of relative agreement (column [9]), (c) using absolute discussion frequency and absolute agreement measures (column [10]), and (d) estimating the column (10) model using ordered probit (column [11]). In short, politics looks quite similar to the other topics in terms of the extent to which the frequency with which it is discussed is associated with agreement. Previous work has shown that politics tends to be discussed more the more people are in agreement (see, e.g., Huckfeldt and Mendez 2008), and our evidence suggests that politics is not atypical in this regard.            "
"32","Next, we examine the role Big Five personality traits play in shaping people's patterns of discussion. Table 2 presents the results of model specification (2) using frequency of political discussion as the dependent variable. This analysis allows us to examine whether certain Big Five traits make people more inclined to talk about politics. (Table C in the supporting information shows the results of model specification [2] for the remaining six topic areas for both the family and nonfamily networks.)            "
"33","Before discussing the results associated with our hypotheses regarding relationships between the Big Five and frequency of discussion, we highlight one other aspect of the results shown in Table 2 that is also noteworthy: the associations between relative agreement on an issue and the relative frequency with which that issue is discussed are largely unchanged by the inclusion of the Big Five in both networks. The coefficient on issue agreement in the family network moves from .34 in Table 1a to .31 in Table 2 (column [1]), and the coefficient on issue agreement in the nonfamily network changes from .43 in Table 1b to .44 in Table 2 (column [6]). This suggests that the relationship between (relative) agreement and (relative) frequency of discussion does not arise from the Big Five simultaneously causing people to both agree (or report agreement) about politics and discuss (or report discussing) it more.            "
"34","Turning to our predictions regarding the relationship between personality and political discussion, we find in column (1) of Table 2, as expected, that Extraversion and Emotional Stability are positively associated with the relative frequency of political discussion in family discussion networks, most likely because they are drawn to social interaction and are not easily upset, respectively. Also, as expected, Agreeableness is negatively associated with discussing politics with family members across columns (1)–(5), which present the same alternative specifications as those presented in columns (7)–(11) of Tables 1a and 1b. This suggests that, consistent with expectations, more agreeable individuals shy away from political discussion because they recognize that it can be a contentious topic that can result in disagreements. We find a positive association between Openness and frequency of political discussion; however, this coefficient is not statistically significant (p‐value = .239; all p‐values mentioned in the text are two‐tailed). We did not have clear expectations about Conscientiousness and find that it is negatively associated with discussing politics, but indications of statistical significance change across model specifications in columns (1)–(5).            "
"35","The associations between the Big Five and (relative) frequency of discussion are much more pronounced among family members than in the nonfamily network, however. In columns (6)–(10) of Table 2, we find that none of the five traits are statistically significantly associated with frequency of political discussion in the nonfamilial network, whereas three (Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability) are consistently statistically significant in the familial network. We discuss the different pattern of results for the family and nonfamily discussion networks in Section 5 of the supporting information.            "
"36","Table 3 presents the results of model specification (3), in which we interact each of the Big Five traits with reported agreement on politics, both for the respondent's familial (columns [1]–[2]) and nonfamilial (columns [3]–[4]) network. This specification permits us to test whether the Big Five alter the relationship between agreement on politics and the frequency with which politics is discussed. We outlined three expectations for how the Big Five might moderate the relationship between agreement and frequency of political discussion. We expected less extraverted, more agreeable, and less emotionally stable individuals to be more averse to disagreement. In other words, we expected the positive association between agreement on a topic and frequency of discussion of that topic to be stronger for these individuals. If this is the case, then we should observe a positive coefficient on the interaction term Agreeableness × (relative) agreement and negative coefficients for Extraversion and Emotional Stability × (relative) agreement.            "
"37","Beginning with the results for the familial network, we find that Extraversion and Emotional Stability moderate the relationship between relative agreement on politics and relative frequency of political discussion in the manner we expected. In columns (1)–(2) of Table 3, the maximum p‐value for the interaction term between Emotional Stability and relative agreement is .139, and the maximum p‐value for the interaction term between Extraversion and relative agreement is .032. The relationship between relative agreement and relative frequency of political discussion is stronger among individuals scoring low on Emotional Stability (who tend to be more anxious). This may be because they are more likely to become upset when they find themselves in political disagreements. Likewise, among individuals scoring low on Extraversion (who are more “reserved”), those who disagree with their family discussant are particularly unlikely to discuss politics frequently, presumably because they lack the assertiveness of their more extraverted counterparts. These findings are largely robust to the same alternative model specifications that we presented in Tables 1 and 2: excluding indicators for how often the pair talks in column (2), using absolute reported agreement instead of relative agreement (Table D of the supporting information, column [1]), using absolute discussion frequency and absolute agreement measures (Table D of the supporting information, column [2]), and estimating the model using absolute discussion frequency and absolute agreement measures using ordered probit (Table D of the supporting information, column [3]).22"
"38","In terms of our other hypothesis, although the coefficient for Agreeableness interacted with relative agreement is in the expected (positive) direction—perhaps reflecting the eagerness to cooperate that characterizes individuals scoring high on this trait—it is not statistically significant at conventional levels. (The p‐value in column [1] is .168.) We offered no hypothesis for how Conscientiousness might alter the relationship between agreement and frequency of discussion and find that the coefficient for this trait's interaction with (relative) agreement is small and statistically insignificant across columns (1)–(2). Finally, we offered no hypothesis for how Openness might change the relationship between agreement and frequency of discussion and find a positive and insignificant effect."
"39","Turning to the nonfamily network (columns [3]–[4] of Table 3), we find consistent, but unexpected evidence that Openness moderates the relationship between agreement on politics and frequency of political discussion. The coefficient for the interaction between Openness and (relative) agreement is positive and statistically significant in both model specifications, suggesting that more open individuals discuss politics more frequently the more they agree about politics with their nonfamily discussion partner. (This finding is robust to the alternative model specifications presented in columns [4]–[6] of Table D in the supporting information, but falls short of statistical significance in columns [3]–[4] of Table E in the supporting information where the maximum p‐value is .154.) Additionally, Extraversion and Emotional Stability moderate the relationship between agreement on politics and frequency of political discussion in the same (expected) manner as in the familial network. However, their moderating effects are not statistically significant in this network (although the moderating effect for Emotional Stability is statistically significant in some of the alternative model specifications presented in Tables D and E, supporting information). Finally, contrary to expectations, the coefficient on Agreeableness × relative agreement is negative in this network, but indistinguishable from 0.            "
"40","To provide a sense of the magnitude of the statistically significant effects, we calculated the effect of a two standard deviation increase in relative agreement on relative frequency of political discussion separately for individuals scoring low (one standard deviation below the mean) and high (one standard deviation above the mean) on each personality trait. These estimates are based on the models reported in column (1) and column (3) of Table 3. In the family network, a two standard deviation increase in relative agreement predicts a .62‐ and .58‐unit increase in relative discussion frequency for those scoring low on Extraversion and Emotional Stability, respectively, but only a .19‐ and .22‐unit increase for those scoring high on these same traits. In other words, the effect of relative agreement on relative frequency of political discussion in the familial network is roughly three times larger for individuals scoring low on Extraversion and Emotional Stability than those scoring high on the same traits. (In the nonfamily network the corresponding, but not statistically significant numbers are approximately .88 [for those scoring low on Extraversion] and .88 [for those scoring low on Emotional Stability] and about .47 [for those scoring high on Extraversion] and .47 [for those scoring high on Emotional Stability].) There is also a clear difference between individuals scoring low and high on Openness, particularly in the nonfamily network where a two standard deviation increase in relative agreement predicts a 1‐unit increase in relative discussion frequency for those high on Openness, but only a .27‐unit increase for those low on Openness.            "
"41","In sum, the analysis presented in Table 3 confirms two of the three hypotheses we offered and reveals one relatively robust and unexpected effect (for Openness in the nonfamily network). More generally, it provides additional evidence that personality traits alter who is exposed to political disagreement and provides evidence that personality shapes discussion within existing social networks (also see Mondak 2010, 119; Mondak et al. 2010).            "
"42","The preceding analysis illustrates, first, that although politics is only one of many topics people discuss, it is a topic that is discussed quite often (particularly during presidential campaigns). We also show that reported agreement on a given topic—including politics—predicts the extent to which that topic is discussed. Thus, although political discussions do occur frequently, those conversations are substantially more likely to occur among discussion partners who tend to agree about political matters (also see Huckfeldt and Mendez 2008). Our findings therefore suggest that even if a discussion partner does hold some opposing political viewpoints, political discussions with that partner may focus on topics where both parties already agree, limiting exposure to opposing viewpoints.         "
"43","Recent work finds that holding similar political views does not appear to be the reason behind the creation of new communication networks (Lazer et al. 2010; Levitan and Visser 2009). Our results complement this prior work because they suggest that when people have frequent discussion partners with whom they happen to disagree about political matters, one of the ways these relationships can be maintained is through regulation of the frequency of political discussions. Just as political matters are not the only (or perhaps even the primary) consideration that determines who ends up in a person's communication network, discussants can select from a menu of topics to discuss in order to maintain their relationship in the face of potential disagreement.         "
"44","Our analysis of the direct and moderating effects of Big Five personality traits on frequency of (political) discussion showed that these relationships differed between the two types of networks we examined. Differences in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability were associated with the frequency that politics was the topic of conversation in the familial network. While this suggests that personality plays a role in the extent to which people discuss politics (i.e., certain individuals are predisposed to discuss politics), this finding is not replicated in the nonfamily network. In fact, in the nonfamily network none of the five traits were associated with frequency of political discussion."
"45","Last, we found that the Big Five traits moderate the relationship between agreement and frequency of discussion. Most notably, we find evidence that more extraverted and more emotionally stable individuals were less responsive to disagreement (particularly with their family member). That is, the positive relationship between agreement and frequency of discussion was weaker for these types of individuals. Interestingly, we also find evidence that the relationship between agreement and frequency of discussion was particularly strong for individuals higher on Openness to Experience. This moderating effect is particularly pronounced in the nonfamilial discussion network. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that certain Big Five traits are associated with variation in who is exposed to political disagreement and, as a consequence, whose attitudes are most likely to be changed by discussion (e.g., Visser and Mirabile 2004).         "
"46","As we have noted, the results reported in Table 2 linking personality and frequency of discussion are different for the family and nonfamily networks. Because we did not have specific expectations that the relationships between Big Five traits and frequency of discussion would differ across familial and nonfamilial discussion partners, we wish to be cautious about drawing too much from these findings. However, there are a number of plausible explanations for these differences, including fewer choices about who the most frequent familial discussion partner will be, differences in the process of topic selection across networks, and genetic factors, each of which we discuss in more detail in Section 5 of the supporting information. We emphasize that these explanations are speculative and that future research could more rigorously examine these possibilities.         "
"47","Before concluding, we note that our analysis has several important limitations related to the use of observational survey data and the context of our survey. First, because our analysis relies on observational survey data, we have attempted to refrain from strong causal claims about the relationship between reported agreement on politics and frequency of political discussion. There is some evidence that talking about politics more frequently with a discussion partner results in greater agreement over time (see Huckfeldt and Mendez 2008). Although we interpret our findings as suggesting disagreement drives topic selection, our design does not allow us to rule out this possible reverse causality. Additionally, we note that people may maintain discussion partners because they hold similar views and part ways with discussion partners who hold disparate ones (see McPherson, Smith‐Lovin, and Cook 2001).         "
"48","To address the issue of causal direction, we also included a survey experiment on our follow‐up survey that provides preliminary evidence that disagreement causes less frequent discussion. The experiment asked respondents to imagine that they had two friends who would be meeting for the first time and provided basic information about the friends’ approaches to parenting, taste in food, and political preferences. Whether the two hypothetical friends agreed on each of these topics was randomly assigned. Respondents were then asked whether they would recommend the two individuals discuss each of four topics—food and dining, parenting, politics, and the weather—when they met. Support for talking about a topic was measured on 4‐point scales ranging from “Definitely avoid” to “Definitely talk about.” We then examined whether (randomly assigned) agreement on each of the three topics mentioned in the descriptions of the hypothetical individuals affected the frequency of recommended discussion for each topic. The results of separate OLS regressions for each of the four topics are presented in Table G of the supporting information, where we find that people were significantly more likely to suggest that the individuals discuss a topic on which they agreed. Randomly assigned agreement on a topic (e.g., politics) is a statistically significant and strong predictor of whether respondents said the topic (e.g., politics) should be discussed. Furthermore, agreement on politics also appears to substitute for discussion of other topics, as it is a statistically significant and negative predictor of each of the other three topics (which is not the case for the other two randomly assigned topics, parenting and food and dining).         "
"49","This survey experiment is, of course, hardly definitive evidence that there is no important reverse causality, but rather suggests that the causal arrow at least flows in one direction: people recommend avoiding discussion of topics where there is disagreement. A limitation of the survey experiment is that it is possible that discussing topics where there is disagreement should be avoided in initial meetings, but these topics are stimulating areas to explore in established relationships. In a different experimental setup, Hayes, Glynn, and Shanahan (2005b) find that people are less willing to express their true opinion to a (hypothetical) group of people who hold views that differ from them compared to a group of people who hold views similar to their own across a range of issues (death penalty, affirmative action, and environmental activism). Although limited in scope, these experiments suggest that people tend to see avoiding topics that are likely to lead to disagreement as a good social strategy.         "
"50","Another question we asked on the CCAP survey also addresses this concern. The question asked respondents whether they prefer to avoid sensitive topics in general, not just politics, “which people may disagree about” (see the supporting information for question wording and coding details). In a model where this measure is regressed on the Big Five and demographic controls (gender, race, age, and education), we find that more extraverted and more emotionally stable individuals are less likely to state a preference for avoiding sensitive topics (see column [4] of Table F in the supporting information). In other words, more extraverted and more emotionally stable individuals report a greater willingness to discuss sensitive topics. This suggests that although avoiding topics that are likely to lead to disagreement may be a generally good social strategy, there are personality characteristics of the individuals that predict such an avoidance strategy. These are the same traits for which we found a weaker relationship between agreement and frequency of discussion. But, in contrast to our (unexpected) finding that individuals high on Openness are more likely to avoid discussing political matters in the presence of disagreement (particularly in the nonfamily network), we find that Openness is associated with a greater reported preference for disagreement on sensitive topics and lower reported avoidance of discussing sensitive topics."
"51","A second limitation of our analysis is that all our measures are based on self‐reports and may be subject to measurement error. For example, our measures of the Big Five personality traits rely on responses to the TIPI. Random measurement error in independent variables like the Big Five tends to attenuate the estimated relationships between these measures and outcomes. Bias due to systematic measurement error may arise, however, if errors in these measures are correlated with respondent attitudes or behaviors that are correlated with the outcome variables and not controlled for in the statistical analysis. If, for instance, responses to the TIPI are influenced by perceptions of social desirability, and the degree to which the measures are affected is correlated with omitted factors that are also correlated with the measured outcome variables, the regression estimates will be biased."
"52","A third limitation is that the CCAP was fielded during a heated presidential election campaign, and the sample consists of only self‐reported registered voters. Our follow‐up survey, however, was conducted in February 2011, outside of an active campaign period, and included unregistered individuals. Nonetheless, the results presented here should be replicated in different contexts and with different sampling strategies. Future work could also consider other psychological characteristics that may be relevant to the extent to which an individual discusses politics. For example, willingness to self‐censor (Hayes, Glynn, and Shanahan 2005a) and need for cognition (Cacioppo and Petty 1982; Cacioppo, Petty, and Kao 1984; Cohen, Stotland, and Wolfe 1955)—an individual's tendency to “engage in and enjoy effortful thought” (Sadowski and Cogburn 1997, 307)—also likely shape the extent to which individuals discuss politics, an often engaging topic that sometimes requires effortful thought.         "
"53","These limitations notwithstanding, this article contributes to our understanding of the role discussion networks may play in shaping political attitudes by situating politics in the broader context of discussion that occurs in people's everyday lives. Our findings also add to the growing body of evidence that personality traits, and Big Five personality traits in particular, affect how people participate in the political process, including influencing whether they are willing to participate at all."
