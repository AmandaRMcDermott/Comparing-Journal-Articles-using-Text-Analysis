"1","A community of  citizens is electing a new leader to implement a policy decision. The policy space is represented by the [ − 1, 1] interval of the real line. Each citizen  has preferences over policies which are represented by a continuous concave and single‐peaked utility function, , that is decreasing in the Euclidean distance between her ideal point (or type), , and the policy decision, .         "
"2","An individual's ideal point is private information; therefore, only citizen i knows . Moreover, the ideal points are distributed according to a cumulative probability distribution function F, and we assume that , is common knowledge. We denote the density function by f and make the following assumptions about F:            "
"3","There are three decision‐making stages. In the first stage (Entry), all citizens learn their own type and decide simultaneously and independently on whether to run for office, , and bear the entry costs, , or not run, , and bear no costs. The number of citizen candidates is denoted by . In the second stage (Voting), if  each citizen i makes a costless decision on whether to vote for one of the candidates, possibly for herself, or to abstain. The new leader is determined by plurality rule, with random tie breaking, and announced publicly. If there is no candidate, , a stochastic default policy, d, takes effect: one citizen i is randomly selected as the new leader with equal probability of  for each citizen, and we assume that she bears no entry costs.8 In the final stage (Policy decision), the leader implements a policy γ. Then, ex post, each citizen i's total payoff is given by            "
"4","A “political equilibrium” is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the citizen‐candidate model with private information described above. In the characterization of equilibrium, all the action is in the Entry stage. Here, we briefly discuss the final two decision‐making stages, and analysis of the entry stage is carried out in the next section. In the Policy decision stage, the newly elected leader's only credible policy decision is to implement her own ideal point, , a strictly dominant strategy in that stage. In the Voting stage, all noncandidate citizens are indifferent between all candidates since the candidates' ideal points are private information (we abstract from any policy promises of the entrants, which would only result in cheap talk because of their incentive to misrepresent ideal points to increase their chance of winning). Hence, we assume each noncandidate either votes for each candidate with equal probability of  or abstains. For each candidate, it is a weakly dominant strategy to vote for herself. This is because in case of becoming the new leader, implementing her own ideal point yields her no loss in payoff, compared to a strict loss with probability one if another candidate is elected. Given these vote decisions, each candidate has an equal chance of winning the election.9"
"5","In this article, we focus on symmetric equilibria at the entry stage.10 We prove two main results. First, a symmetric equilibrium is always in cutpoint strategies at the entry stage. A cutpoint strategy is characterized by two critical ideal points, , where , where the check mark denotes a cutpoint, such that a citizen enters if and only if  or . This is true because the best response strategy of a citizen to any symmetric strategy of the other citizens is always a cutpoint strategy (first subsection), even if the other citizens are not using cutpoint strategies. Second, we show that such an equilibrium is always unique, and we fully characterize it. These results hold for any continuous cumulative probability distribution, , of ideal points  satisfying A1–A3 (second subsection), and for any concave single‐peaked utility function of citizens, and a stochastic default policy, d, in which one citizen is randomly selected if no candidate emerges in the entry stage. The rest of the section explores the comparative statics results for these entry equilibria (third subsection) and examines the limiting case of large communities (fourth subsection), and we illustrate these results with an example (fifth subsection).         "
"6","Here, we prove our first main result that equilibria are always in cutpoint strategies and that political polarization—i.e., entry from the extremes—is implied by these strategies. To build the intuition, we begin with the analysis by showing that best responses to cutpoint strategies are cutpoint strategies. While this analysis does not directly imply that equilibria are always in cutpoint strategies, the analysis is similar to the general case, which is formally stated and proved as Lemma 1 at the end of this subsection.            "
"7","Consider citizen i. Suppose all citizens  are using an entry strategy defined by two cutpoints:               "
"8","Recall that if neither citizen i nor any other citizen runs for office, , a stochastic default policy, d, takes effect, which randomly selects one of the n citizens as the new leader with equal probability of  for each. In this event, it follows from Bayesian updating that .            "
"9","To derive the equilibrium pair of cutpoint policies, or equilibrium cutpoints, ,11 we must compare citizen i's expected payoffs as both a candidate and a noncandidate, given the equilibrium decisions in subsequent stages (see the section entitled “Political Equilibrium”). Then,  is an equilibrium if and only if  is a best response for citizen i when  is the entry strategy of all .            "
"10","Citizen i's expected payoff for entering, , can be written as               "
"11","Citizen i's expected payoff loss from the policy outcome if some  is elected (a term inside the summation) equals               "
"12","By contrast, citizen i's expected payoff for not entering, , is               "
"13","Finally, it is readily verified that relating expressions (3) and (5) and rearranging yields the best response entry strategy for a citizen with ideal point , if all citizens  are using cutpoint strategy , which is to enter if and only if13                              "
"14","The key observation, however, concerns the properties of LHS(7). In particular, it is a U‐shaped (convex) function in  with a unique minimum, labeled , strictly between −1 and 1. In fact, the U‐shape is not restricted to the case where all other citizens  are playing a cutpoint entry strategy . Rather, this cutpoint strategy is the unique best response of citizen i best responding to any entry strategy of all other citizens  (as shown in the proof of Lemma 1 below). For an arbitrary (possibly mixed) entry strategy, , played by all , where  denotes the probability of entering for a citizen with ideal point x, the left‐hand side of the best response condition (7) can be written more generally as               "
"15","Lemma 1.For any symmetric entry strategy, , played by all , where  denotes the probability of entering for a citizen with ideal point x, the left‐hand side of the best response condition (8) is a U‐shaped function in  with a unique minimum at  and two relative maxima at  and .                  "
"16","Proof. See the online supporting information."
"17","The intuition for this result is the following: For a given  played by all , the probability terms , and  in condition (8) are constants. Then, i's expected benefits from holding office for entering, , are independent of , and thus differences in expected net benefits for entering only depend on the location of , with more extreme types yielding higher net benefits because the utility function  is concave (hence, these benefits are U‐shaped in ). The result that LHS(8) is U‐shaped in  is important, because it implies that citizen i always uses a cutpoint strategy in best responding to any symmetric (type‐dependent) entry strategy of all other citizens . To see this, recall that  is constant, and citizen i enters if and only if . The cutpoint policies are determined by the intersection of both sides, i.e., , and since LHS(8) is U‐shaped, the expected net benefits can only be equal to or larger than c in the extreme‐entry intervals , while they are strictly smaller than c in the moderate nonentry interval .            "
"18","In this subsection, we characterize the equilibrium. We do so for any well‐behaved continuous cumulative probability distribution of ideal points satisfying A1–A3 in the section entitled “General Model.” The proof is presented in the online supporting information. In particular, we show that there always exists a unique symmetric equilibrium in cutpoint strategies that uses equilibrium cutpoints, , where  and  gives the equilibrium cutpoint for universal entry. For the special case of symmetric distributions (i.e., ),  always and , and we present concrete equilibrium conditions at the end of this subsection. Our next result characterizes all symmetric entry equilibria:               "
"19","Proposition 1.For any continuous cumulative probability distribution, , of ideal points  with density , and for a stochastic default policy, d, that randomly selects one citizen as the new leader if nobody runs for office, the political equilibrium is characterized by a unique pair of cutpoints, , with , where each citizen iwith a more extreme ideal point in the left or right direction (i.e., or ) enters the electoral competition as a candidate, ,and each citizen i with a more moderate ideal point, , does not enter, . Four different kinds of entry equilibria can arise: (i)“everybody enters,” “nobody enters,”  some citizens with more extreme ideal points in only one direction are expected to enter, and  some citizens with more extreme ideal points in both directions are expected to enter.                  "
"20","Proof. See the online supporting information."
"21","While the proof is tedious, the intuition behind the results of Proposition 1 can be explained as follows. If the costs of entry are very small relative to the expected net benefits (i.e., from holding office and avoiding a payoff loss due to the distance between the preferred and implemented policy), everybody has an incentive to run for office. On the other hand, if the entry costs are sufficiently high relative to the expected net benefits, nobody wants to enter.15 If the distribution is symmetric, then LHS(7) is symmetric around 0, so if net benefits and costs are in the intermediate range, then the best response condition (7) must hold as equality (i.e., ) for exactly two citizen types  and  with . When ideal points are asymmetrically distributed, differences in expected net benefits in both directions must be balanced out by asymmetric cutpoints, . This either results in a pair of interior cutpoints  with  or possibly a fourth kind of equilibrium where (7) holds with equality for only one ideal point in ( − 1, 1) and either  when  or  when  In the former case, the left equilibrium cutpoint is , and there is only entry by candidates on the right; in the latter case, the right equilibrium cutpoint is , and there is entry only by candidates on the left. These are citizen candidates in the opposite direction of where the probability densities amass (i.e., the cutpoints are pulled toward the bulk of density), because these tend to have higher expected net benefits from entering as they have higher expected losses from the distance between the preferred and implemented policy.            "
"22","Finally, for the special case of symmetric  with density  the unique pair of equilibrium cutpoints  with  is fully characterized by (i) if , then  and  (“everybody enters”);  if , then  and  (“nobody enters”); and  if , then  is the unique solution to  ×  = c, where .            "
"23","In the following subsections, we use Proposition 1 to derive comparative statics results and characterize limit results for large communities.            "
"24","In this subsection, we derive comparative statics results for the unique equilibrium characterized in Proposition 1. To be precise, we analyze the effects of changes in c and b on the equilibrium cutpoints  and  for the region of the parameter space where the solution is interior for at least one cutpoint, that is, where  and/or  (see Proposition 1  and ). Thus, we are excluding cases (i) and , where there is either universal entry or no entry, respectively.16                              "
"25","Proposition 2.(Comparative statics) An increase in the costs of entry, c, yields more extreme interior equilibrium cutpoints, —i.e.,  strictly decreases or  strictly increases, or both—while an increase in the benefits from holding office, b, yields more moderate cutpoints. A decrease in  (increase in ) implies that candidates and policy outcomes in the left (right) direction get more extreme, on average. It also implies a decrease in the expected number of candidates, , when c increases or b decreases. Finally, if n gets very large,  approaches minus one and  approaches one, that is,  and .                  "
"26","Proof. See the online supporting information."
"27","Except for the limiting result, Proposition 2 does not give comparative statics results for the effect of changes in n on the expected number of candidates, , in equilibrium. The reason is that if c is small enough, then this comparative static can go either way. Specifically, there may be more or fewer candidates if n increases, because there are two effects on entry that result from increasing the community size from n to . First, there is the direct effect that the number of potential citizen candidates has increased by 1. If the equilibrium cutpoint were to remain unchanged, this effect works to increase the expected number of candidates. The second effect is the indirect equilibrium effect. Because the expected number of candidates would increase if the cutpoint remains unchanged, the probability of winning if one enters is lower, so the incentive to enter is reduced. This effect works in the opposite direction of more extreme cutpoints and a lower expected number of entrants. The total effect is generally going to be ambiguous.            "
"28","Finally, Proposition 2 shows that  and . That is, in very large communities, only the most extreme citizens throw their hat in the ring. This implies inefficiency, from a welfarist standpoint. Because utility is concave in the distance between the ideal point and implemented policy, the most efficient outcome ex ante will necessarily be a centrist outcome.17 For example, with quadratic preferences, the efficient outcome is the mean, and with linear preferences, it is the median. In both cases, the least efficient outcome is at either −1 or 1 (or both).            "
"29","Of course, the fact that the limiting cutpoints are −1 and 1 does not imply there is zero entry in the limit. Here, we use the result of Proposition 2 that  and  to fully characterize the properties of our citizen‐candidate equilibria for large communities. Fixing  and b, consider the sequence of equilibria , indexed by the number of citizens, n. We first introduce some notation. Let  and  denote the ex ante expected utility from entry of extreme citizens with ideal points at −1 and 1, respectively, which they will receive in the limit in the event nobody else enters. Let  and  denote the probability that a randomly selected voter enters as a left candidate or a right candidate, respectively, in the equilibrium with n citizens. Denote  and , the limiting expected number of candidates entering from the left extreme and the right extreme, and let  denote the expected number of entrants in the limit. This gives:               "
"30","Proposition 3.(Large communities) As n approaches infinity, there are three possibilities for the limiting equilibrium: (i) There is zero entry, i.e., , if and only if                     "
"31","Proof. Part (i) of the proposition is immediate. Parts  and  follow from a Poisson approximation argument. A detailed proof is in the online supporting information. A sketch of the proof of  is the following. Denote by π the limiting probability that at least one citizen enters in equilibrium. Denote by  the limiting probability a citizen will win if she chooses to enter. For a citizen with ideal point −1, the expected payoff loss of not entering in the limit is               "
"32","Observe that the “everyone enters” outcome is never an equilibrium in large communities. Equation 10 characterizes the equilibrium entry rates from the left for cases  and , setting  in the latter case. Similarly, equation 11 characterizes the equilibrium entry rates from the right for cases  and , setting  in the latter case. Note that if ideal points are symmetrically distributed, we know that  for all n (since ), and thus, the two equations 10 and 11 collapse to a single equation , which has a unique solution in τ, with  and .            "
"33","Finally, we can say a bit more about the range of costs where case  holds. Specifically, there will be entry only from the left if , with  being the entry cost at which (12) and (13) both hold with equality and  Similarly, there will be entry only from the right if , with  being the entry cost at which (12) and (13) both hold with equality and .            "
"34","Here, we illustrate the model with a parametric example of entry equilibria using the utility function  and the triangular distribution ,  with density . Thus, we use asymmetrically distributed ideal points that are skewed to the right. Figure 1 illustrates graphically the equilibrium for these parameters, when  and . The policy space, which is also the support of the distribution of citizen ideal points, , is represented by the horizontal axis. The vertical axis represents the costs and expected net benefits of entry.            "
"35","The two cutpoints of an entry equilibrium are determined by the intersections of the respective cost and expected net‐benefits curves. Since entry costs do not depend on a citizen's ideal point, the cost curve is simply a horizontal line at  (0.34), shown in Figure 1. The equilibrium expected net benefits of entry—a function of a citizen's ideal point that is computed by the  of (7)—are evaluated at the equilibrium cutpoints, i.e., setting , for the given cost and varying  in the interval [ − 1, 1]. These equilibrium net‐benefits curves for the two costs are represented by the two solid U‐shaped curves in the figure. The higher curve is the (equilibrium) expected net‐benefits curve when , and the lower curve corresponds to the (equilibrium) expected net benefits of entry when . The equilibrium cutpoints are then given by the intersection of the net‐benefits curve for  (0.34) with the corresponding cost lines. Each citizen with an ideal point in between the two intersection points does not enter as a candidate (the net benefits of entry fall short of the cost for such a citizen), and each citizen with an ideal point equal to or more extreme than either cutpoint enters. Thus, in this example, the equilibrium entry cutpoints when  are ( − 0.35, 0.71), while the equilibrium entry cutpoints when  are ( − 0.81, 1).            "
"36","The dotted U‐shaped curve with a kink at the bottom traces the locus of equilibrium cutpoints as the entry cost varies, with points to the left of the kink corresponding to values of  for various costs, and points to the right of the kink corresponding to values of . Hence, the two equilibrium pairs of cutpoints for  and 0.34 necessarily lie on this curve. Notice that for , there is no entry from the right, as the equilibrium cutpoint is at , so this corresponds to case  in Proposition 1. For costs less than or equal to 0.05, all citizens enter, which corresponds to case (i) in Proposition 1 (this is shown in Figure 1 by the intersection of the cost line  and dotted curve at ). Equilibria in the intermediate range of costs , including , correspond to case  of Proposition 1, where there is some entry on both sides. Case , with no entry, occurs at costs greater than or equal to 0.47, at which point the dotted line hits the left boundary of the set of ideal points (−1), in the far upper left of the graph.            "
"37","With respect to comparative statics (Proposition 2), the dotted line shows that an increase in the entry costs, c, yields more extreme equilibrium cutpoints and hence less entry, on average.18 Moreover, though not shown in the figure, an increase in the benefits from holding office, b, would shift up the expected net‐benefits curves, and as a consequence, the equilibrium cutpoints would become less extreme, and entry would increase. Finally, also not shown in the figure, for any entry cost, c, as n gets very large the expected net‐benefits curve approaches the horizontal axis, and the cutpoints converge to −1 and 1 (Proposition 3).            "
"38","In this section, we analyze in turn the robustness of our political polarization result with respect to variations in the default policy and to partially private information, that is, directional information about the candidates' political leanings."
"39","In the following, we discuss variations in the default policy that takes effect if no citizen runs for office. In the model of Osborne and Slivinski (1996), where the types of all citizens and candidates are complete information, the default policy is an infinite loss, . Applying this drastic measure to our model with incomplete (private) information would result in a unique equilibrium of universal entry, regardless of the specific citizen types and their distribution. To see this, note that in any equilibrium without universal entry, we have , and thus, the expected utility from not entering is , and the expected utility from entering is bounded below by  (recall that U has finite values). In other words, there is no feasible policy that gives any citizen a utility of a magnitude that can match an infinite loss. Therefore, an equilibrium would only exist if the conditions of universal entry are satisfied (see Proposition 1 (i)), which seems to be a very restrictive political scenario.         "
"40","An obvious alternative to modeling the no‐entry outcome would be to have a fixed default policy, , such as the status quo policy (e.g., Besley and Coate 1997). Applying  to our model yields only slightly different conditions compared to our stochastic default policy, d, where one citizen is randomly selected as the new leader if nobody enters. To see this, let us first introduce  to our best response entry condition (7), which is a function of the cutpoints :            "
"41","A slightly more general formulation of the fixed default policy would be to allow randomization over exogenous status quo points. Again, this is different from what we do in the article, but the characterization of a unique cutpoint equilibrium still goes through because a similar result to Lemma 1 (U‐shaped net‐benefits curve) can be shown for arbitrary exogenous stochastic defaults. Also, note that for very large n for cases  and  of Proposition 1, using an exogenous stochastic status quo given by F will be approximately the same as our endogenous model of randomly selecting a leader from the population, because for large n the equilibrium cutpoints converge to −1 and 1. In contrast to the alternative default policies discussed above, in our stochastic default policy, the distribution of potential leaders from the citizenry results endogenously from the rational calculus of the players, and indeed is part of the equilibrium.19"
"42","A third possibility is an alternative way to endogenize the no‐entry outcome by allowing for multiple rounds in the entry stage: if nobody runs for office in round 1, another round follows and this continues until eventually there is at least one candidate. Importantly, after each unsuccessful entry round, the citizens Bayesian update that no citizen's type is more extreme than the equilibrium cutpoints in that round. Then, the entry decision in round 2 will be derived just like the one in round 1, except that the earlier probability distribution of ideal points will be truncated, and so forth. As a consequence, the equilibrium cutpoints get more moderate with every additional entry round. A caveat of the process of multiple entry rounds is that it may continue without end (e.g., if the costs of entry are larger than the payoffs from holding office and the difference in utility between the largest and smallest actual types). To avoid this problem, one could, for example, assume a maximum number of possible entry rounds after which our stochastic default policy is invoked, or assume benefits from holding office that are sufficiently large relative to the costs of entry such that some voter would always prefer to enter if she is certain that no other voter will enter."
"43","The equilibrium conditions for the cutpoints would be more complicated with multiple entry rounds, compared to our stochastic default policy. Specifically, one cannot solve the model “forward” in a straightforward recursive fashion by using initial cutpoints derived from the equilibrium conditions of Proposition 1. This is because the cutpoints in round 1 depend on beliefs about the cutpoints in round 2, and so forth. However, one can characterize equilibrium conditions in a recursive fashion by using the monotonicity established in Lemma 1 (i.e., the U‐shaped best response condition), which will continue to hold. Specifically, a citizen whose type corresponds to an equilibrium cutpoint in round 1 is indifferent between entering in round 1 and postponing her entry decision to round 2, if nobody runs for office. However, the expected payoffs in round 2 are determined by the equilibrium cutpoints in round 2, which in turn are a function of the cutpoints in round 3, and so forth. In other words, the multiple entry rounds create a nested system of expected continuation payoffs in entry round t, , which depends on citizen i's type, all future cutpoints , and all exogenous parameters. Großer and Palfrey (2011) show that the equilibrium cutpoints in round 1 of multiple entry rounds are (weakly) more extreme than with our stochastic default policy. Of course, there are other ways of modeling multiple entry rounds. The aim here is just to explain that the model can accommodate a variety of other ways to endogenize the default policy, without changing the qualitative properties of the entry equilibrium.         "
"44","It is often the case that voters have directional information about each entrant's political leaning, and our model can be extended to accommodate such information about the candidates' ideal points. In particular, suppose that after entry decisions, voters learn whether a candidate's ideal point lies to the “left” () or “right” (), but they are not informed about any candidate's exact ideal point. An obvious way in which directional information might be revealed to the general public is via party labels. Therefore, we assume here that candidates entering from the left () are affiliated with party L, and candidates entering from the right () are affiliated with party R. To avoid coordination problems, parties have some kind of nomination state where they choose one of their party's entrants as the party nominee. Here, we assume that this procedure is completely random,20 so each of them has an equal winning probability of  and , where  and  denote the number of left and right contenders and .21 We call this the Nomination stage. In the Voting stage, after the selection of nominees by each party, each citizen either votes for party L's or party R's nominee or abstains. The rest of the model is the same as in the previous section.         "
"45","The analysis of the directional information model is more complex than for private information, but similar results obtain. The reason for the added complexity is that an entrant's probability of winning will now be different for entrants from the left and entrants from the right. A further complication is that an equilibrium in the directional information model has three endogenous variables that must be solved for simultaneously: a pair of entry cutpoints, , and a voting cutpoint, , that divides the voters between those who will vote for party L's nominee and those who will vote for party R's nominee.22 In spite of the more complex entry equilibria with directional information, we obtain similar results as before:            "
"46","Proposition 4.(Directional information about candidates' ideal points) When directional information about the candidates' ideal points “left”  or “right”  is revealed to the general public in nominating conventions of party L and party R where nominees are randomly selected, and when each citizen votes for either party nominee or abstains, existence of equilibrium in a pair of entry cutpoints is maintained. In particular, the equilibrium characterization and comparative statics results use the same logic as for private information of ideal points (cf. Propositions 1 to 3).               "
"47","Proof. See the online supporting information."
"48","The formal proof is rather lengthy, but the intuition is straightforward.23 First, the case where there is entry on only one side or neither side is trivial from the voter's perspective, so that does not change the earlier analysis. Therefore, suppose there is at least one entrant from each party, so the election is between the L party nominee and the R party nominee. In the Voting stage,  and  are party L's and party R's expected total vote shares, respectively, or alternatively, the probability that a randomly selected voter votes for the respective parties. The voting cutpoint is introduced since citizens are typically not indifferent between candidates across party lines. Specifically, each citizen i knows that the expected ideal point of the left and right (other) nominee is  and , respectively, and thus . Then, each party nominee votes for herself, and each other citizen i votes for the party L (party R) nominee if , which weakly dominates abstaining and voting for the nominee of R (L) (an indifferent nonnominee ‐type is assumed to vote randomly for either party with equal probability for each or abstain). As a consequence, a change in  generally changes  and in this way affects the probability that any of the left (right) entrants will lead the community,  (). Because like‐minded entrants are equally likely to become nominees, changes in the entry cutpoints affect the probability of each left and right entrant becoming the new community leader,  and , in proportion to the changes in the ρ‐terms. Specifically, a unilateral change of an entry cutpoint has two ceteris paribus effects that work in opposite directions. First, a direct effect of a more extreme‐entry cutpoint is to decrease the expected number of entrants in the direction of this cutpoint, which works to increase the probability of each contender becoming the nominee (and vice versa for a more moderate entry cutpoint). Second, an indirect effect of a more extreme‐entry cutpoint works to decrease the expected relative vote share  for entrants in this direction, because  shifts this way and thus decreases the probability of each contender becoming the community leader (and vice versa for a more moderate entry cutpoint). The overall effect of a unilateral change in an entry cutpoint on the probability that the eventual winner will be from the political left or right is ambiguous. However, despite this ambiguity, an equilibrium in cutpoints  can be shown to exist, and the characterization and comparative statics results use the same logic as for our model with private information. This straightforward transfer of results is essentially due to continuity of the best response condition and the U‐shaped property of the expected net benefits for entry—in particular, that the probability of becoming the party nominee and community leader is constant in this response—that continues to hold with directional information.         "
"49","Proposition 4 provides additional support for our political polarization result from the previous section by showing that the model can be extended to allow for additional information about candidates in the form of directional information. Moreover, the results from introducing directional information via party labels suggest that our citizen‐candidate model could provide a promising platform from which one can explore the party‐formation process. Such extensions could be related to the incentives of candidates to conglomerate in parties in order to increase their winning chances24 or to the role of parties as informative “brands” (Snyder and Ting 2002). Other extensions could vary the party nomination procedure. For example, instead of randomly selecting one contender as the nominee, one could select the one closest to the party median (defined as the median of the distribution of potential party contenders, i.e., the distribution truncated by the respective cutpoint), or the most moderate or most extreme contender. We leave to future research the analysis of these and other extensions.         "
"50","We analyze a citizen‐candidate model with plurality voting and incomplete information about all citizen and candidate ideal points. This is the polar opposite assumption to the seminal models of Besley and Coate (1997) and Osborne and Slivinski (1996), which assume complete information about the ideal points of all citizens before entry decisions are made, and our main conclusions are almost the polar opposite as well. Our analysis of equilibrium in the citizen‐candidate model with private information completely reverses the two key properties of equilibria that generally hold in the models with complete information: indeterminacy of equilibrium and centrality of candidates. We fully characterize the unique equilibria of the Bayesian entry game. These equilibria are in cutpoint strategies, characterized by a unique pair of ideal points, where only citizens more extreme than (or at) these cutpoints run for office. In the limiting case, as the community becomes very large, only those citizens with ideal points at the extreme boundaries of the distribution of ideal points become candidates. We show that this holds for any well‐behaved probability distribution of ideal points—symmetric or asymmetric—and it implies substantial political polarization in large populations, independent of the distribution of citizen ideal points! It only depends on the support of the distribution of ideal points. For example, consider the class of ideal point distributions defined by the set of all normal distributions truncated (and renormalized) at −1 and 1. Then for all these distributions, the only entrants in a large electorate will have ideal points at −1 and 1. Even if the density of ideal points is concentrated almost entirely at 0, so there is essentially no polarization of preferences in the general electorate, all candidates (and hence all policies) will be extreme. These properties of our equilibrium cutpoints, uniqueness and the emergence of only extreme candidates, differ from the multiple equilibria derived in previous citizen‐candidate models, a subset of which typically includes candidates with an ideal points at or close to the median ideal point.

"51","The comparative statics results for our model are empirically plausible. On average, higher entry costs yield fewer and more extreme candidates, whereas higher benefits from holding office yield more and less extreme candidates. The logic is that there are two kinds of potential benefits to running for office: office‐holding benefits and policy benefits. Entry costs and office‐holding benefits affect all potential candidates the same, but policy benefits affect potential candidates differently, depending on their ideology. Greater policy benefits provide stronger incentives for more extreme candidates to run for office. Finally, an increase in the number of citizens has ambiguous effects on the number of candidates if n is small, but for large n the effect is to produce more extreme candidates; we characterize the limiting equilibrium distribution and expected number of entrants.

"52","Modeling citizen and candidate ideal points on issues as being either fully private information (as we do here) or fully public information (as past researchers have done) provides useful benchmarks to consider, benchmarks that offer important insights about how information affects entry equilibria. Indeed, this article shows that the information effects are huge, essentially reversing the two key conclusions from citizen‐candidate models with complete information. However, for many issues, citizens possess information somewhere in between these two limit cases. A particular relevant piece of information is about a candidate's political leaning, that is, whether she is a “leftist” or “rightist,” which is revealed to the general public via party nominating conventions where the left or right party, respectively, selects one nominee for the election. We show that this directional information supports the exact same equilibrium cutpoints as for private information and symmetrically distributed ideal points. However, it generally affects the cutpoints because the parties' voter support, and hence their individual chances of becoming the new community leader, depends on these cutpoints. However, the main results for our cutpoint equilibrium still go through! Our model with directional information can, for example, be utilized to study endogenous party formation, since this information can serve as a coordination device for candidates with the same political leaning. In this respect, combining our model with Snyder and Ting's (2002) model of political parties as informative “brands” to voters would be an interesting next step. Another interesting extension would be to utilize other kinds of information about the candidates' ideal points, such as in the way introduced to the spatial model of competition by Banks (1990) or allowing for polls, media, or other sources of information about candidate preferences. If candidates take their own private polls, then they may have different information than voters. Finally, one could analyze within the framework of our citizen‐candidate model the effects of information about candidate valence that increases an entrant's probability of being elected on the polarization of political candidates (e.g., Groseclose 2001). For example, if acquiring valence is costly (as in Serra 2010), we conjecture our results still go through because citizens with more extreme ideal points have higher incentives to enter than those with moderate ideal points and therefore are willing to pay more for their candidacy. The analysis of such models and other elaborations of our basic model provide a number of promising directions for future research.         "
"53","We also elaborate on the choice of our default policy, which randomly selects one citizen as the new leader if nobody runs for office. A consequence of this default policy is that it implements a policy decision as part of the equilibrium. We compared it to the commonly used fixed default policy, such as a status quo policy (e.g., Besley and Coate 1997; Eguia 2007). If this exogenous policy is a feasible ideal point, the main results for our equilibrium cutpoints are maintained, though they are biased in an intuitive way (i.e., depending on their location). Finally, we discuss an alternative stochastic default policy with multiple entry rounds. That is, if nobody runs for office, another entry round follows, and this continues until eventually at least one candidate emerges. This default policy demands additional assumptions to ensure that the process ends with certainty. Comparing the equilibrium cutpoints for the first entry round to those for our citizen‐candidate model with random default policy suggests that the first‐round cutpoints will be more extreme when multiple entry rounds are possible (Großer and Palfrey 2011).         "
"54","On a grander scale, this article may contribute to our understanding of why we often observe extreme policy decisions and political polarization in democracies (e.g., McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006), in contrast to the classical Downsian predictions of median outcomes. Previous citizen‐candidate models do not make sharp predictions about this important empirical regularity and typically have equilibria that produce median or centrist outcomes. In our model, this phenomenon is predicted to arise even in communities where preferences are not polarized at all. Rather, extreme and polarized policies are the outcome of a process where only (the most) extreme citizens find it worthwhile to enter the electoral competition as candidates. This reduces social welfare, since concave preferences imply that centrist outcomes will be more efficient than extreme outcomes. The informational problem that candidates' true policy intentions when elected are privately known challenges the fundamental democratic idea that policy decisions should reflect the will of the majority. It remains to be shown empirically whether and, if so, to what extent this kind of informational asymmetry combined with endogenous entry of candidates contributes to political polarization.
