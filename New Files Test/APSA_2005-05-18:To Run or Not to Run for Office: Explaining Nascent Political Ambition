"1","Political scientists have long been interested in political ambition and the factors that motivate individuals to seek positions of political power. Indeed, more than half a century ago, Lasswell laid the groundwork for this type of investigation when he observed that the “conception of a ‘political type' is that some personalities are power seekers, searching out the power institutions of the society … and devoting themselves to the capture and use of government” (1948, 20). The early empirical research on political ambition promoted Lasswell's notion of the “political person”; accordingly, the quest to understand why people pursued political power, regardless of the level of office, focused on individuals' personal attributes, personalities, and motivations (Barber 1965; Fishel 1971; Soule 1969).         "
"2","With the release of Ambition and Politics in 1966, however, Joseph Schlesinger fundamentally changed the manner by which scholars approach the study of political ambition. He put forward a rational choice paradigm to understand the decision to run for office. The rational choice framework conceptualizes political ambition as primarily a strategic response to a political opportunity structure. More specifically, potential candidates are more likely to seek office when they face favorable political and structural circumstances (Black 1972; Levine and Hyde 1977). The number of open seats, term‐limit requirements, levels of legislative professionalization, partisan composition of the constituency, and party congruence with constituents are among the factors individuals consider when seeking any elective positions or deciding whether to run for higher office (Black 1972; Eulau and Prewitt 1973; Goodliffe 2001; Kazee 1994; Moncrief, Squire, and Jewell 2001; Rohde 1979; Schlesinger 1966; Stone and Maisel 2003). With the exception of general gauges of political interest, financial security, and political experience, potential candidates' personal circumstances are treated as relatively exogenous. In other words, the “seats available and the hierarchy of positions for advancement give shape and definition to the political career” (Prinz 1993, 27).3"
"3","Focusing on the political and structural circumstances involved in running for a particular office has enabled scholars to generate broad theoretical contributions to our understanding of expressive ambition—that is, whether individuals will choose to enter specific political contests and, once they hold office, whether legislators will exhibit static versus progressive ambition, or whether they will choose to retire rather than seek reelection (discrete ambition). But a distinct, yet vitally important phase of the development of political ambition occurs well before the actual decision to enter a specific race ever transpires. If the notion of a candidacy has never even crossed an individual's mind, then he/she never actually faces a political opportunity structure. By focusing on expressive ambition and a set of specific races and candidates, therefore, much of the literature that speaks to political ambition bypasses an earlier stage of the candidate emergence process. In order to understand fully the decision dynamics involved in moving from “eligible potential candidate” to “actual office holder,” it is necessary to step back and assess nascent ambition—or the inclination to consider a candidacy.         "
"4","Because nascent political ambition serves as a critical precursor to expressive ambition and the strategic factors associated with it, a more complete theoretical framework through which to study candidate emergence must include this earlier stage. Figure 1 depicts our conception of political ambition and the candidate emergence process. Consistent with the rational choice paradigm, we view expressive ambition as a phenomenon driven by the political opportunity structure a potential candidate faces. The inclination to consider a candidacy, however, is far less proximate to a particular race than is expressive ambition. In this initial step of the candidate emergence process, we suggest that interest in seeking elective office will be motivated not only by individual‐level “strategic” considerations, but also by attitudinal dispositions, personal experiences, and demographic characteristics that fall outside the realm of the political opportunity structures to which most existing political ambition theory refers. Essentially, as we step back and assess whether a potential candidate will face the opportunity structure the rational choice paradigm identifies, we must invoke some of the theoretical underpinnings from the earlier work on political ambition.         "
"5","                 Nascent Political Ambition and the Candidate Emergence Process                      "
"6","To shed light on the factors that affect the critical beginning stages of the candidate emergence process, we draw on theory and empirical evidence from the existing literatures on both political ambition and political participation at the mass level. Ultimately, we derive six expectations about the factors that will foment potential candidates' nascent ambition. The evolution of political ambition at the individual level is an intricate phenomenon, and, undoubtedly, many of the expectations we identify are linked to one another. We do anticipate, though, that each will exert an independent effect on a citizen's likelihood of considering a candidacy."
"7","We know from a wide body of literature that politicians tend to behave in ways that maximize their likelihood of attaining higher office, or at least maintaining the position they currently hold (Schlesinger 1966). Studies of congressional retirement, for instance, conclude that as an electoral margin decreases, so, too, does a member's likelihood of seeking reelection (e.g., Moore and Hibbing 1998; Theriault 1998). For many members of Congress, it is preferable to exit the chamber voluntarily, as opposed to engage in an arduous reelection bid that might end in defeat. Perceptions of electoral success have also been shown to be the most important predictor of whether an individual decides to enter his/her first congressional race (Maisel and Stone 1997). The variables that scholars typically think of as “strategic,” therefore, tend to be relatively short term and linked to the external political environment.            "
"8","Strategic considerations might also play a role in fostering nascent ambition, although we argue that they might manifest themselves somewhat differently. If a potential candidate does not deem himself/herself qualified to run for office, then considering a candidacy is probably unlikely. For some subset of potential candidates, this assessment may be based on short‐term electoral considerations and the structural forces at work in the political environment. For most potential candidates, however, strategic considerations are probably more abstract. Because nascent ambition precedes the stage at which a potential candidate faces a political opportunity structure, we expect individuals' estimates of their personal attributes and feelings of efficacy as political candidates, in general, to exert an impact on considering entering the electoral arena."
"9","A “resource‐based” model of political participation accounts for much of the variation we see in citizens' levels of political interest and activity (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). Individuals with time, money, and civic skills are significantly more likely than resource‐deprived citizens to engage in various forms of political activism. But specific issue motivations can compensate for, as well as bolster, individual‐level resources. Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995, 398) recognize that having a direct stake in a policy may increase an individual's likelihood to participate politically around that issue (see also Craig and O'Brien 1993; Lawless and Fox 2001; Verba and Nie 1972).            "
"10","Issue passion spurs activism not only at the mass level, but also among political elites. Canon (1990), for example, finds that strong policy goals serve as motivating factors for congressional candidates who have no previous political experience (see also Wilson 1962). Other studies reveal that, once individuals actually seek and hold state legislative positions, ideological preferences and passion often motivate their agendas (e.g., Thomas 1994). Hence, because running for office tends to require high levels of money, time, and civic skills—or at least potential candidates might perceive it that way—we expect individuals to be more likely to contemplate a candidacy when an ideological drive, either by a particular issue, or a general interest in politics, accompanies their resource base.            "
"11","Political science scholarship uses the family unit as a medium through which to understand political participation. Studies of candidates and office holders conclude that an “inherited” interest in political affairs oftentimes accounts for the decision to enter politics, regardless of sociodemographic background or personality (see Flanigan and Zingale 2002). We have to look no further back than to the 2000 presidential election—which pitted the son of a former senator against the son of a former president—to see that history is rife with politicians from different generations of the same family. Family ties are also often evident among state legislators (Gaddie 2004) and even city council members (Prewitt 1970b).            "
"12","Not only is political interest often passed on within the family unit (Jennings and Markus 1984, Table 6), but attitudes about what constitutes good citizenship also become deeply embedded. Beck and Jennings find, for instance, that highly politicized parents often create a family environment “charged with positive civic orientations … thus endowing their children with the motivation prerequisites for later [political] participation” (1982, 98; see also Almond and Verba 1963). This political socialization process instills in future citizens the belief that they, as individuals, have the power to influence government action. These attitudes, once impressed, can be sustained into adulthood. In fact, involvement in political associations, campaigns, and school elections can predict future levels of interest in politics (Prewitt 1970b; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995), as well as future levels of political activism (Beck and Jennings 1982; Gaddie 2004). Accordingly, we expect politicized upbringings to inflate an individual's perceptions of his/her qualifications to run for office and, ultimately, to bolster the likelihood of possessing nascent ambition.            "
"13","The vast majority of elected bodies in the United States continue to be dominated by white men.4 With so few women and minorities elected to prominent positions of political power, members of historically excluded populations may feel like the political system is not open to them. Burns, Schlozman, and Verba (2001), for instance, find that women who live in areas with higher densities of female‐elected officials are more likely to express interest in politics (see also Hansen 1997; but see Lawless 2004). In terms of race, Bobo and Gilliam (1990) find that sociopolitical participation among blacks increases dramatically in cities with black mayors (see also Hamilton 1986). Conversely, blacks who do not live in these “empowerment areas” are significantly less likely to participate in community activities, contact elected officials, and vote. Essentially, candidates and elected officials who elicit group identification can stimulate voter turnout and political activism (Abney 1974; Abney and Hutcheson 1981; Burns, Schlozman, and Verba 2001).            "
"14","A similar logic likely applies in terms of political ambition; if traditionally excluded groups are less likely to have role models to emulate, they may be less likely to consider running for office. This expectation is consistent with the research that finds that gender and race affect office holders and candidates' progressive ambition (Costantini 1990; Moncrief, Squire, and Jewell 2001). Somewhat more indirectly, members of traditionally marginalized groups may also be less likely to possess other key ingredients that foster nascent ambition, such as a sense of efficacy in oneself as a candidate and a politicized upbringing.5"
"15","Schlesinger begins his path‐breaking work by stating flatly: “Ambition lies at the heart of politics” (1966, 1). There is broad acceptance of the notion that anyone who ultimately decides to seek high‐level office is competitive and driven. Clear indications of ambitious behavior in realms outside of politics, therefore, can help predict who might consider running for office. More specifically, individuals who select high‐prestige occupations and seek to rise to the top of their professions may be more likely to think about acquiring positions of political power or climbing the political career ladder (Hain and Pierson 1975). Further, material ambition and financial success may weigh heavily on whether an individual has the flexibility to consider running for office. Recent congressional elections have seen an increase in candidates who are political amateurs with substantial monetary resources (Canon 1990; Chaddock 2001). Even nonwealthy candidates must invest a substantial amount of their own money if they are to be considered serious congressional contenders.            "
"16","Although we expect citizens with high levels of career and material ambition to be more inclined to consider entering the political arena, we acknowledge that they may be less likely actually to launch a candidacy; moving into the political arena from the private sector might involve a substantial decrease in pay (see Ehrenhalt 1991; Rohde 1979; Prewitt 1970a).6Eulau and Prewitt (1973, 239) find this to be the case even in local politics; wealthier communities are characterized by less city council electoral competition than poorer communities.            "
"17","Studies of political participation suggest that age, marital status, and parental status positively affect levels of political participation at the mass level (e.g., Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). The all‐consuming nature of running for office, however, may mean that age and family arrangements exert a different type of effect on potential candidates' initial decisions to run for office. Younger men and women may have more energy to enter politics, endure the rigors of a campaign, and engage in the activities necessary for networking and fundraising (Fowler and McClure 1989; Huckshorn and Spencer 1971; Swinerton 1968). In fact, among office‐holding national political convention delegates, younger delegates are more likely than delegates over the age of 55 to express interest in seeking higher office at some point in the future (Gaddie 2004, 25). But younger men and women may also be more likely to face the difficulties involved in reconciling a career and a family. A study of members of the candidate‐eligibility pool in New York, for example, found some, though not overwhelming, evidence that traditional family structures decrease the likelihood of running for all levels of office (Fox and Lawless 2003; see also Conway, Steuernagel, and Ahern 1997; Sapiro 1982). Members who leave the House of Representatives also often reference the fact that the “family‐unfriendly” schedule of Congress makes it difficult to balance career and familial responsibilities (Theriault 1998, 421). State legislators mention the trials and tribulations of maintaining this “balancing act” as well (Gaddie 2004). Although the empirical evidence offers competing expectations regarding the degree to which family structures and placement in the life cycle might affect potential candidates' choices, we anticipate that age, as well as marital and parental status, will make seeking elective office more viable at different points in a potential candidate's life.            "
"18","Together, these six research expectations represent a series of personal attributes and characteristics that may influence the development of nascent political ambition. In order to argue compellingly that nascent ambition is, in fact, a precursor to, and a distinct phenomenon from, expressive ambition, though, our six research expectations must withstand controls for the structural and contextual variables that tend to predict whether an individual opts to enter a particular race at a specific time. Structural factors and contextual considerations, after all, even play a substantial role in local politics, where election dynamics tend to mirror campaigns for state and federal office (Fleischmann and Stein 1998; Krebs 1998). Thus, we expect to uncover support for our expectations even after controlling for measures of political culture, size and openness of the political opportunity structure, and levels of legislative professionalization, as well as respondents' party congruence with elected officials in the state and their perceived likelihood of winning the first race they could envision entering.            "
"19","Despite the theoretical importance of studying nascent political ambition, a number of methodological and sample design issues make conducting an empirical investigation quite difficult. The complexity of assembling a national sample of potential candidates, alone, explains why most research on political ambition and candidate emergence focuses on declared candidates and office holders. In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, we developed the “eligibility pool approach,” which we carried out in the Citizen Political Ambition Study. We drew a national sample of 6,800 individuals from the professions and backgrounds that tend to yield the highest proportion of political candidacies: law, business, education, and political/community activism (Dolan and Ford 1997; Moncrief, Squire, and Jewell 2001).7 Based on survey responses from nearly 3,800 members of the “candidate eligibility pool,” the data from the Citizen Political Ambition Study allow us to offer the first nuanced assessment of the manner in which individuals emerge as candidates for the first public office they might seek. For a complete description of the research design and sample, as well as a discussion of its advantages, see Fox and Lawless (2004).         "
"20","Although the Citizen Political Ambition Study represents a methodological breakthrough, it is important to acknowledge two specific limitations involved in employing the “eligibility pool approach.” Our method means that we must forego a nuanced analysis of the structural and contextual variables that might exert an impact on the decision to enter the electoral arena. If we focused on a single race or election, the number of potential candidates would be extremely small. We assembled a broad sample at the expense of analyzing the political opportunity and structural aspects of the decision calculus in any particular race or set of races. The absence of a specific office focus does mean, however, that we are limited in the extent to which we can assess the effects constituency demographics, incumbency, and other sources of strategic calculations and political opportunities exert on the inclination to consider a candidacy. Second, our approach relies on potential candidates' self‐perceived qualifications and prospects for success, as opposed to more objective indicators of their electoral viability. Thus, our results might reflect a distorted version of reality. Because we are interested in the consideration process members of the eligibility pool undergo, however, self‐perceptions are perhaps as relevant as are objective assessments of the potential candidates' likelihood of winning. After all, individuals often distort the probability of winning an election, but engage in behavior based on these distortions.8 In short, what our approach sacrifices in precision and leverage in predicting who will enter a specific race at a specific time it makes up for in terms of the broad‐based nature of the sample. By turning to this earlier stage of the candidate‐emergence process, our focus not only complements investigations of expressive ambition, but also allows us to provide fresh insights pertaining to democratic legitimacy and political representation.         "
"21","Our sample of potential candidates is comprised of successful individuals who are well positioned to seek public office. Thus, it is important to begin our investigation of nascent political ambition with an overall examination of the degree to which this population thinks about entering the political arena as candidates. We asked the members of our sample—directly—whether they ever considered running for office. Although the proportion of respondents who considered running differs by profession, with lawyers (53%) and political activists (64%) more likely to have considered a candidacy than educators (37%) and businessmen and women (32%), the data presented in Table 1 indicate that, overall, almost half of the respondents acknowledge having thought about running for office. Nearly three out of every five respondents express some degree of interest in seeking office in the future.         "
"22","Moving beyond perceptual indicators, we also investigated whether respondents ever took any of the concrete steps that serve as precursors to seeking elective office. We asked the members of the sample whether they ever investigated how to place their name on the ballot, or ever discussed running with potential donors, party leaders, or community activists. Few respondents have ever taken multiple steps required to mount a political campaign, but 13% have engaged in at least one concrete activity that typically precedes launching a candidacy. Of those who actually considered running for office, 27% discussed a potential candidacy with an electoral gatekeeper, solicited financial contributions, or investigated placing their name on the ballot."
"23","An examination of the inclination to run for office must also address the level of office in which potential candidates express interest. In order to determine where the respondents focus their office specific interests, we asked the 58% of the sample respondents who expressed interest in a future candidacy to state the first office they would seek, should they enter a political contest. We then presented them with a list of several local, state, and federal positions and asked whether they would ever consider running for any of those posts. The data presented in Table 2 reveal an awareness of career ladder politics. Nearly 70% of respondents select a local office—school board, city council, or mayor—as the first office for which they might run, whereas only 10% consider entering the political arena at the federal level. Although most of the potential candidates state that, should they ultimately choose to run for office, they will get involved at the bottom rung of the ladder, 41% indicate interest in eventually running for the state legislature. Approximately one out of every three respondents identified at least one federal‐level position he/she would ultimately be interested in pursuing. This finding reinforces the importance of homing in on the initial decision to run, since most potential candidates would opt to enter lower level races before seeking entry into state level or congressional races.9"
"24","In order to determine why some potential candidates possess nascent ambition, while others do not, we developed two logistic regression equations, both of which are presented in Table 3. The models operationalize the six research expectations that predict the two aspects of nascent ambition we identified  (see Appendix for a description of the variable coding), as well as the series of structural/contextual variables that predict expressive ambition.10 In addition, the models control for party identification, levels of political engagement, and whether the individual ever received the suggestion to run for office from a political source  (i.e., party leader, elected official, or political activist). The first model predicts whether the respondent has ever considered running for office.11 In the second model, we estimate interest in running for high‐level office  (statewide or federal). We restrict the latter equation to respondents who have considered running for office, since an office‐specific preference requires at least a general inclination to enter the electoral arena.12 Together, these two measures allow us to gauge retrospective and prospective interest in seeking office.13"
"25","A general review of the findings indicates that the models perform well. The regression coefficients reveal that each expectation offers some degree of leverage in predicting whether a potential candidate has ever considered running for office  (Table 3, column 1). And when we focus on respondents who acknowledge interest in seeking public office, the data suggest that “strategic” considerations, minority status, a politicized upbringing, competitive traits, and stage in life are also statistically significant predictors of interest in high‐level office  (Table 3, column 2). Figures 2 and 3 illustrate that the independent variables that comprise each of our expectations are not only statistically significant, but also exert substantive impacts on the likelihood of considering a candidacy and the probability of expressing interest in high‐level office. Nascent political ambition, therefore, is shaped by a variety of personal and political experiences and circumstances.14"

"27"," Note: Changes in probabilities are based on the logistic regression results presented in Table 3, column 1. These probabilities were calculated by setting all continuous independent variables to their means and dummy variables to their modes for the five expectations not under consideration. Within each individual expectation, we assessed the maximum change in probability for each statistically significant variable  (i.e., the minority status probability reflects the fact that a black woman is 26 percentage points less likely than a white man, all else equal, to consider running for office). For age, we varied the values from one standard deviation above to one standard deviation below the mean.                     "
"28","                 Who Will Climb the Political Career Ladder? Substantive Effects of Predectors of Interest in High‐Level Office                      "
"29"," Note: Changes in probabilities are based on the logistic regression results presented in Table 3, column 2. These probabilities were calculated by setting all continuous independent variables to their means and dummy variables to their modes for the four expectations not under consideration. Within each individual expectation, we assessed the maximum change in probability for each statistically significant variable  (i.e., the minority status probability reflects the fact that a woman is 20 percentage points less likely than a man, all else equal, to consider running for office; in this equation, race did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance, so we did not vary its “value”). For age, we varied the values from one standard deviation above to one standard deviation below the mean.                     "
"30","Although many of the results that emerge from the regression analyses are consistent with our expectations, three broad findings merit further discussion, both because of the magnitude of their impact and because they speak directly to issues of representation, career ladder politics, and the theoretical and methodological importance of examining nascent ambition."
"31","The most appropriate place to begin to explicate the findings is with the strategic considerations expectation; a substantive interpretation of the regression coefficients in Table 3 reveals that a general sense of efficacy as a candidate, as gauged by self‐perceived qualifications, exerts the greatest relative impact on nascent ambition  (see Figure 2). Despite the fact that all of the members of our sample are roughly similar in terms of objective qualifications and credentials, variation in perceptions affects the likelihood of considering a candidacy. Respondents who deem themselves “very qualified” to run for office have a 0.75 likelihood of having considered a candidacy.15 This predicted probability is 37% greater than that of an otherwise “average” respondent, and roughly two‐and‐one‐third times the likelihood of a respondent who considers himself “very unqualified.” Moreover, the ability of an individual to imagine himself/herself as a qualified candidate for public office translates into a greater likelihood of envisioning oneself climbing the political career ladder in the future. Among respondents who express interest in seeking office, those who currently deem themselves highly qualified to run are 42 percentage points more likely than those who do not self‐assess this way to voice interest in eventually seeking a high‐level position  (see Figure 3). Any systematic biases or distortions in self‐perceived qualifications affect who ultimately enters a political contest.            "
"32","Although “strategic” considerations influence nascent ambition, it is also important to note that our gauge of qualifications is a perceptual indicator that does not focus on a particular seat or political contest. At the nascent ambition phase of the candidate emergence process, potential candidates' abstract notions of themselves as candidates, in general, and not as election competitors or victors, in particular, affect whether they consider running for office. Structural variables that affect the decision to enter specific races do not yield statistically significant effects in predicting nascent ambition, nor do gauges of the local or statewide political opportunity structure."
"33","This may not be entirely surprising in the first equation. After all, the majority of individuals who considered running for office expressed interest in local offices. We do not have gauges of the partisan composition of local constituencies, or information pertaining to the size and levels of incumbency associated with local offices, such as school board and city council. Thus, it is certainly possible that local structural variables exert an impact on nascent ambition. The total number of local governmental units by state, however—which serves as the one local structural variable included in the analysis—is statistically insignificant. Further, if state‐level structural and contextual variables played an important role affecting nascent ambition, then their influence should be evident, to some extent, in the second equation. Yet the data indicate that state‐level measures of political culture, legislative professionalization, and party congruence with the legislature and/or congressional delegation do not affect a respondent's likelihood of expressing a general interest in a statewide or congressional position."
"34","Coupled with the statistically insignificant coefficient on perceived likelihood of winning the first race, the structural variables' insignificance bolsters the notion that nascent ambition precedes expressive ambition and is influenced by personal predispositions and traits that are relatively far removed from the political opportunity structure. More abstract indicators of political interest and efficacy appear to trigger the general notion of running for office, at which point structural variables can begin to play a role generating interest in entering specific contests. Because strategic considerations are driven primarily by internal factors, these findings suggest that changes in electoral conditions or election laws will have little effect on potential candidates' attitudes about entering politics."
"35","Most of the members of the sample exist in the top tier of professional accomplishment and, in many cases, highly political environments. Yet early political exposure generates lasting effects that are independent and cannot be entirely compensated for by being politically active as an adult. In fact, a politicized upbringing is the third most important predictor of considering a candidacy; respondents who were raised in homes where politics were frequently discussed, and who ran for office as students, are much more likely to possess nascent political ambition as adults. Even among those members of the sample who express the utmost levels of political interest now, growing up in a household where politics were discussed and running for office was encouraged boosts the likelihood of considering a candidacy by 17 percentage points. Experience running in a high school or college student body election increases the likelihood by an additional 7 percentage points. The effect size is even greater for respondents who express only “average” levels of political interest  (see Figure 2). Individuals who participated in high school or college elections are 19%  (9 percentage points) more likely than those who never ran in school elections to express interest in high‐level positions  (see Figure 3).            "
"36","Moreover, politicized upbringings affect perceptions of qualifications to run for office. Respondents whose parents encouraged them to run for office are twice as likely as those whose parents offered no such support to consider themselves “very qualified” to run for office  (24%, compared to 12%; difference significant at p < .01.). Alternatively, 29% of potential candidates who did not receive the suggestion to run for office from their parents consider themselves “not at all qualified” to seek public office, whereas only 9% of individuals who received political encouragement when growing up assess this way.16"
"37","The role of a politicized upbringing in the development of nascent political ambition suggests that specific experiences that might seem far removed from the decision to enter electoral politics do, in fact, influence the likelihood of considering a candidacy. Although we anticipated that exposure to campaigns as students would heighten nascent ambition in adults, the magnitude of the effect of these preprofessional experiences is striking. Because politicized upbringings do not fall within the rubric of political opportunity structures, studies of expressive ambition tend to overlook their impact."
"38","Our regression analyses also reveal a portrait of a candidate‐emergence process that is far from fully inclusive of all members of the candidate eligibility pool. Despite the fact that women and members of racial minority groups are now succeeding in professions that had long been closed to them, the highly accomplished women and blacks in our sample are significantly less likely ever to have considered running for office. The “average” female respondent, for instance, has a 0.49 predicted probability of having considered a run for office; an identical man has a 0.62 likelihood of having thought about a candidacy. In terms of race, “average” black male and female respondents are 15 percentage points less likely than their similarly situated white counterparts to have considered running for office. Put somewhat differently, a white male respondent who self‐assesses as “highly qualified” to run for office and “very likely” to win a race is approximately one‐third more likely than a black woman with the same self‐perceptions to have considered running for office."
"39","Women and blacks are less likely to have considered running for office and, as a result, are less likely to reach the point where they can even express an office‐specific interest. Sex, however, plays an additional role when we turn to the willingness to climb the political career ladder. Whereas the “average” male respondent who has considered running has a 0.55 probability of being open to seeking a federal or statewide elective position at some point in the future, the “average” female respondent's likelihood is 0.34.17 Even among those who identified themselves as “highly qualified” to run for office, there remains a 32% gender gap in eventual interest in a high‐level position.            "
"40","Finally, it is important to recognize that women and blacks are not only less politically ambitious in the general sense, but they are also more likely to lack the key ingredients that foster ambition. Fifty‐seven percent of men, compared to only 36% of women, self‐assess as “qualified” or “very qualified” to run for office  (difference significant at p < .01). Women are more than twice as likely as men to consider themselves “not at all qualified” to run for office  (29% of women, compared to 14% of men). And in terms of political socialization, blacks are approximately 17% less likely than whites to indicate that, as children, they received encouragement from their parents to enter politics. Women are roughly 22% less likely than men to report parental encouragement for a candidacy.18"
"41","The study of political ambition has largely been limited to the decision making of political actors who are already fully immersed in electoral politics. The methodological challenges involved in identifying and sampling a broad cross‐section of potential candidates have deterred political scientists from investigating the critically important initial decision to run for office. Our “eligibility pool approach” allows for the first broad empirical examination of the factors that lead to individuals' initial considerations of a candidacy. The results culminate to substantiate empirically the theoretical distinction between nascent and expressive political ambition. Our findings also raise concerns about political representation and democratic legitimacy that examinations of expressive ambition overlook."
"42","Studies that focus on the expressive ambition involved in entering state legislative or congressional races do not account for the substantial winnowing process that occurs in the candidate emergence process long before potential candidates decide to run for particular offices at particular times. Yet our data indicate that race, gender, and a sense of efficacy as a candidate play critical roles, independently and in concert with one another, in predicting whether potential candidates will even reach the political opportunity structures central to expressive ambition. Further, focusing on expressive ambition does not allow us to identify the strong role that early political socialization plays in the decision to run for office. To bypass nascent ambition, therefore, is to leave a critical void in our understanding of who comes to control the reins of all levels of government."
"43","When we consider the broader implications of this “winnowing process,” our results speak to fundamental questions of political representation and democratic legitimacy. As we indicated at the outset of this analysis, the willingness of a large and diverse group of citizens to seek elective office is necessary for a healthy democracy. More specifically, in terms of substantive representation, women's presence in high‐level elective office decreases the possibility that gender‐salient issues will be overlooked  (e.g., Dodson 1998; Swers 2002). In a similar vein, black and Latino representatives are most likely to represent the issue preferences of black and Latino constituents  (e.g., Canon 1999). On a more abstract level, the presence of traditionally marginalized groups in positions of political power conveys the political system's level of inclusiveness. In the case of gender, Burrell captures the argument well:         "

"45","Women in public office stand as symbols for other women, both enhancing their identification with the system and their ability to have influence within it. This subjective sense of being involved and heard for women, in general, alone makes the election of women to public office important because, for so many years, they were excluded from power. (1996, 151)"
"46","A similar logic applies in cases of race  (e.g., Bobo and Gilliam 1990; Gay 2002) and ethnicity  (Pantoja and Segura 2003).         "
"47","The results of our investigation indicate that, despite policy‐related and symbolic benefits, the prospects for increasing women and racial minorities' numeric representation in our political institutions are not promising. Women and blacks are substantially less likely to express political aspirations, and women are much less likely to express interest in holding high‐level office. In reality, the situation is likely far worse than our findings indicate. Our sample of potential candidates approximates the race and gender breakdowns in society. In terms of the pipeline professions that lead to a career in politics, though, white males continue to dominate disproportionately, especially in the fields of law and business. Thus, many members of traditionally marginalized groups will likely remain severely underrepresented."
"48","Certainly, future work is needed to flesh out more thoroughly the role of nascent ambition in the candidate emergence process. But the establishment of this distinct stage of political ambition will allow scholars to identify more clearly the specific barriers to citizens' full inclusion in electoral politics. Nascent political ambition must continue to be employed as a crucial barometer for gauging democratic legitimacy in the United States."
