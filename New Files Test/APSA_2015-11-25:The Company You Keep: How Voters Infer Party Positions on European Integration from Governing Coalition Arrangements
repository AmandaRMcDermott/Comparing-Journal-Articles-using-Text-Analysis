"1","Theoretical and empirical studies explore how electoral systems condition parties’ incentives to moderate their policies (e.g., Calvo and Hellwig 2011), and whether parties respond to their core supporters’ beliefs (e.g., Dalton 1985). These analyses implicitly assume that voters accurately perceive parties’ policies, yet while survey respondents’ party placements correlate with the codings of parties’ manifestos and also with experts’ placements (Bakker, Jolly, and Polk 2012; Dalton, Farrell, and McAllister 2011), studies find that over time, citizen perceptions of party policy shifts only weakly track these alternative measures (Adams, Ezrow, and Somer‐Topcu 2011; Fernandez‐Vasquez 2014).1 These findings raise the following question: How and why do voters’ perceptions change? Fortunato and Stevenson (2013) argue that voters infer that governing parties’ positions converge on left‐right policies because voters recognize that coalition partners experience pressure to compromise over policy (e.g., Ganghof and Brauninger 2006), and that parties with similar positions often coalesce (Martin and Stevenson 2010). Fortunato and Stevenson (2013) demonstrate that citizens perceive coalition partners’ positions as more similar than is implied by the left‐right tone of their policy manifestos, whereas Fortunato and Adams (forthcoming) find that citizens project the prime ministerial party's left‐right position onto its junior partner(s), but not vice versa.         "
"2","Here we ask: Should we expect the above findings on citizens’ perceptions of parties’ left‐right positions to extend to more focused policy issues such as European integration? This question is interesting because the rationale for applying the coalition heuristic to issues that do not map onto left‐right politics appears weak. The argument that citizens will apply coalition‐based heuristics across diverse policy domains is that the considerations outlined above may extend beyond left‐right issues: Namely, coalition negotiations plausibly encompass all relevant policies, and moreover, the norm of collective cabinet responsibility applies to all government policies. By contrast, several considerations cast doubt on whether citizens will (or should) apply coalition heuristics to other issues. First, in most European party systems, post‐election coalition negotiations revolve primarily around issues such as taxes and social welfare policies that map onto left‐right economic policies (Muller and Strom 2000). Citizens who recognize this pattern may hesitate to infer governing parties’ positions on issues that cross‐cut left‐right politics. Second, public opinion research concludes that left‐right issues are often most salient to the public (Powell 2000; Soroka and Wlezien 2010), so that citizens may perceive parties’ overall left‐right positions more accurately than the parties’ positions on more specific dimensions. Given that citizens must perceive (at least) one governing party's position in order to apply the coalition heuristic, citizens’ ignorance of party positions on less salient dimensions hampers their abilities to apply coalition heuristics to such issues.         "
"3","We evaluate these arguments by analyzing voters’ party perceptions on a dimension that does not map neatly onto left‐right economic politics, namely, European integration. We analyze this dimension for two reasons. First, although research finds that Europe is less salient to citizens than are left‐right issues (see, e.g., Evans 1998), its salience has increased over time (Franklin and Wlezien 1997). This is especially true in polities such as Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal, whose governments encountered widespread public disapproval of the austerity policies they implemented to conform with the terms of international loans; Germany, where the fall 2013 national election campaign featured intense debates over the financial assistance packages to distressed European Union (EU) member states; and Britain, where the Conservative Party has been bitterly divided on Europe for over 20 years, prompting Prime Minister David Cameron to promise a national referendum on European integration, scheduled to take place before the end of 2017.         "
"4","Second, European integration is interesting because research uncovers inconsistent relationships between parties’ left‐right positions and their stances toward Europe, so that—even if voters infer parties’ left‐right positions from coalitions—citizens may struggle to use these estimates to infer parties’ stances toward Europe (see, e.g., Bakker, Jolly, and Polk 2012; Bakker et al. 2015; De Vries and Hobolt 2012).2 Hence, if citizens apply the coalition heuristic to European integration (a dimension that cross‐cuts left‐right debates and one that plausibly exerts little influence on government formation) they likely apply this heuristic across many different issues. Finally, European integration is the only dimension besides left‐right for which we have extensive cross‐nationally comparable measures of citizens’ party placements. Specifically, respondents in the European Election Studies—which were administered in Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain at the time of the European parliamentary elections held in 1999, 2004, and 20093—were asked to place themselves and each national party on a scale ranging from 1 (European unification has already gone too far) to 10 (it should be pushed further).         "
"5","We specify a regression model to evaluate how citizens’ perceptions of party shifts on European integration respond to the composition of governing coalitions. Our dependent variable is the change in the focal party j’s policy image between the year of the current and the previous European parliamentary election, defined as the difference between the party's mean perceived position in the current European Election Study (EES) survey and its mean perceived position in the previous survey, computed over all respondents who provided valid party placements. We label this variable [Party j's perceived shift (t)]. Our independent variables are [Party j's perceived position (t – 1)], which denotes party j’s mean perceived position at the time of the previous European parliamentary election; [PM party's perceived shift (t)], which denotes the perceived shift of the current prime ministerial (PM) party, again based on the EES respondents’ party placements; and [party j is in government (t)], a dummy variable that denotes whether the focal party was in government at the time of the current EES survey. We specified the following model, to be estimated over all parties except for the prime ministerial party:            "
"6","To evaluate the relationship between the PM party's policy image and other parties’ images, the key coefficients are those on the [PM party's perceived shift (t)] variable and the interaction of this variable with the variable [Party j is in government (t)]. The coefficient b3 on [PM party's perceived shift (t)] denotes the relationship between changes in the PM party's perceived position and changes in voter perceptions of opposition parties. A negative coefficient would denote that voters tend to perceive opposition parties shifting in the opposite direction to the PM party's perceived shift—an effect that might arise if voters infer that opposition parties oppose the PM party's policies. The coefficient b5 on the interaction [Party j is in government (t) × PM party's perceived shift (t)] denotes how the relationship between the PM party's perceived shift and the perceived shifts of its junior coalition partner(s) differs from that for opposition parties. A positive coefficient on this interaction would denote that, compared to opposition parties, voters perceive the positions of the PM party and its junior partners shifting in parallel on European integration—a relationship that would extend the empirical findings of Fortunato and Stevenson (2013) and Fortunato and Adams (n.d.), who analyze coalition partners’ left‐right images.4"
"7","Our specification also includes the party's lagged perceived position, [Party j's perceived position (t – 1)], to control for voters’ long‐term perceptions of the party's position, and for whether, when party placements are above (below) this “equilibrium,” they tend to subsequently shift downward (upward). We have replicated all of our models omitting this variable, and the resulting estimates support the same substantive conclusions that we report below.         "
"8","Finally, note that we speak in the language of statistical “relationships” between voters’ perceptions of different parties’ policy shifts, without specifying the underlying causal processes. In particular, when voters perceive junior coalition partners’ policy shifts tracking the PM party's shift—the pattern we estimate below—does this occur because citizens project the PM party's policy shift onto its junior coalition partners, or vice versa? Or, alternatively, do citizens update their perceptions of both PM parties and junior partners in response to factors such as the content of party elites’ speeches and interviews, election manifestos, and government policy outputs? We address these issues below, but we note here that our decision to calibrate junior partners’ and opposition parties’ perceived policy shifts (the dependent variable in our model) against the PM party's perceived shift reflects the theoretical and empirical reasons (outlined above in our summary of the research of Fortunato, Stevenson, and others) to expect citizens to project PM parties’ positions onto their junior partners, and not vice versa.         "
"9","We estimated the parameters of Equation 1 on the 56 perceived party shifts in our data set in eight European party systems that featured coalition governments during the period of our study: Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Table 1 reports the set of parties that we analyzed, and Table 2 reports the means and standard deviations of the observed values of the variables in our data set. These values suggest that voters perceived parties undertaking modest policy shifts on European integration during the period of our study: The mean magnitudes of parties’ perceived shifts are on the order of 0.5 units on the 1–10 European integration policy scale (see column 2 in Table 2). This perceived party policy stability on Europe parallels findings on the left‐right dimension (Dalton and McAllister n.d.), and it may reflect that political parties plausibly maintain stable policies in order to avoid charges of flip‐flopping (see, e.g., Budge 1994). Finally, the table reports that voters perceived both governing and opposition parties shifting toward (modestly) more pro‐Europe positions, on average; that is, the mean value of the [PM party's perceived shift (t)] variable is positive—and roughly equal—for both types of parties. This latter finding is interesting given research that during the time period under review, governing parties faced pressures to adopt pro‐Europe positions as they negotiated for their country's interests in the European Parliament (see, e.g., De Vries and Hobolt 2012; Hooghe, Marks, and Wilson 2002). Our data suggest that, this dynamic notwithstanding, citizens did not perceive governing parties shifting toward pro‐Europe positions to a significantly greater extent than opposition parties.         "
"10","Our data are time‐series cross‐sectional. Estimating a simple regression on the pooled data can lead to erroneous conclusions due to unobserved heterogeneity between parties, although this problem is mitigated with the differenced model specified in Equation 1 (see, e.g., Wooldridge 2002). We estimate robust standard errors clustered by party (Rogers 1993).5"
"11","We report our parameter estimates in column 1 of Table 3, where the dependent variable, [Party j's perceived shift (t)], is the change in EES respondents’ mean placements of the focal party j’s position between the years of the current and the previous European Parliament elections. Before turning to effects pertaining to coalitions, note that we find no evidence that being in government directly affects voters’ perceptions of party shifts; that is, the estimate on the variable [party j is in government (t)] is small and insignificant. In addition, the coefficient on the variable [Party j's perceived position (t – 1)] is negative and significant while the coefficient on the intercept is positive and significant, which implies a “regression to the mean” in voter placements; that is, when party placements are unusually large (or small) relative to the historical average placement of the party position, then subsequent placements will tend to revert to values closer to this historical average. This pattern is found in various social and physical settings, and it may reflect measurement issues and/or underlying dynamic processes (see, e.g., Barnett, van der Pouls, and Dobson 2005). The measurement issue is that the party's perceived position variable is bounded by the endpoints 1 and 10 of the EES European integration scale, so that when survey respondents placed a party at a radical position at the previous time period, they could not shift their placement of this party to a significantly more extreme position at the current time period—but they could shift their party placement toward a substantially more moderate position. The dynamic process is that, when a party's lagged position was extreme, this may indicate that the party's most strongly pro‐Europe (anti‐Europe) faction was in the ascendant at the previous time period, in which case a diminution of this faction's influence at the current time period might moderate the party's position.6 Below, we discuss robustness checks in which we reestimated our models while omitting the lagged perceived party position variable, which support substantive conclusions that are identical to those we also discuss below.         "
"12","We now consider the coalition‐based effects that interest us. If citizens’ perceptions of the PM party's policy shift are related to opposition parties’ perceived shifts, we would expect a significant coefficient on the variable [PM party's perceived shift (t)]. However, the estimate is near zero and statistically insignificant. By contrast, citizens’ perceptions of junior coalition partners’ shifts are strongly related to the PM party's perceived shift: The coefficient on the interacted variable [party j is in government (t) × PM party's perceived shift (t)], +0.73, is statistically significant (p < .01) and denotes that, compared to opposition parties, citizens shift their perceptions of junior partners’ positions in tandem with the PM party's perceived shift. The conditional effect, +0.66 (s.e. = 0.11, p < .001), is the sum of the parameter estimates on the [PM party's perceived shift (t)] variable and the [party j is in government (t) × PM party's perceived shift (t)] variable, and it implies that a one‐unit perceived shift toward a more (less) pro‐Europe position by the PM party is associated with a 0.66‐unit shift in citizens’ perceptions of junior coalition partners in the same direction, where all parties’ positions are calibrated along a 1–10 scale. This estimate implies that the difference between a perceived PM party shift of –0.32 units on the European integration scale (one standard deviation below the mean value for governing parties in our data set) and a perceived PM party shift of +0.76 units (one standard deviation above the mean) is associated with an increase of 0.71 units in the junior partner's perceived shift. Given that the values of the governing parties’ perceived shifts in our data range from –0.58 units to +1.41 units (see column 3 in Table 2), this difference of 0.71 units is more than one‐third of the entire range of values in our data.         "
"13","Figure 1 depicts the effects of perceived PM party shifts on junior coalition partners’ and opposition parties’ perceived shifts. The former are displayed as a dotted line and the latter as a solid line (with shaded confidence intervals).7 The figure illustrates that perceived PM shifts exert no effect on citizens’ perceptions of opposition parties but a strongly positive effect on perceptions of coalition partners. These patterns suggest that voters employ a coalition‐based heuristic to update their perceptions of party policy positions on European integration.         "
"14","Predicted Effects of Perceived PM Party Shifts on Perceived Shifts by Coalition Partners and Opposition Parties."
"15","Note: The figure charts the predicted effects of the [PM party's perceived shift (t)] variable on the [Party j's perceived shift (t)] variable, for opposition parties (dotted line) and junior coalition parties (solid line), computed for the coefficient estimates reported in Table 3 (Model 1). The shaded regions are set so that the probability is under .05 that the predicted values overlap. For these analyses, the [Party j's perceived position (t – 1)] variable is set at its mean value.                     "
"16","Our computations imply that citizens perceive the positions of prime ministerial parties and junior coalition partners—but not opposition parties—shifting in the same direction over time on European integration. While these patterns suggest that citizens apply coalition heuristics, an alternative explanation is that citizens weigh other factors, such as parties’ election manifestos, party elites’ speeches and interviews, and government policy outputs. Suppose, for instance, that junior coalition partners update their policy statements to support the prime minister's policies, and that citizens respond to these statements rather than to the fact of the coalition itself. In this case, failure to control for party elites’ policy statements may prompt the spurious conclusion that citizens employ a coalition‐based heuristic."
"17","To address this possibility, we analyzed the policy tones of the Euromanifestos that the parties in our data set published in the run‐ups to the European parliamentary elections of 1999, 2004, and 2009. Specifically, we analyzed the codings of party positions on European integration derived from the European Manifesto Project (EMP) analyses of parties’ Euromanifestos8 to assess whether these EMP codings display significantly positive correlations between the stated policy shifts of PM parties and those of their junior coalition partners.            "
"18","In fact, the EMP codings display little tendency for PM parties and their junior coalition partners to shift their positions in the same direction over time. The correlation between the EMP‐based codings of PM parties’ shifts on European integration and junior partners’ shifts is weak and insignificant (r = .18, p = .44). This implies that citizens’ strong tendencies to perceive coalition partners shifting their positions in the same direction (r = .65, p = .004) is not due to citizens’ responses to party manifestos. Moreover, given findings that party elites coordinate their overall election campaign messages with the policy tone of their manifestos (Adams, Ezrow, and Somer‐Topcu 2011), this suggests that voters’ perceptions that coalition partners shift their positions in tandem is not a response to the overall policy message parties convey during election campaigns.            "
"19","The proposition that voters discount campaigns for the European Parliament will not surprise scholars who classify these contests as “second‐order” elections that arouse little public interest (see, e.g., De Vreese et al. 2006). To address the possibility that citizens respond to information beyond that conveyed during these election campaigns, we analyzed political experts’ perceptions of parties’ policy shifts on Europe. Experts plausibly weigh all relevant information when estimating party positions, including party elites’ speeches and interviews, party press releases, parliamentary debates, election manifestos, and government policy outputs. Hence, if experts perceive coalition partners’ policies shifting in the same direction over time, this may indicate that ordinary citizens perceive this pattern because they respond to diverse information sources, as opposed to relying on the coalition heuristic.            "
"20","Our measure of experts’ perceptions is derived from the Chapel Hill expert surveys (see Bakker et al. 2015), in which experts placed each party in their party system on a scale running from 1 (strongly opposed towards European integration) to 7 (strongly in favor of European integration). We rely on the 1999, 2002, 2006, and 2010 Chapel Hill surveys, using linear interpolations to calibrate the experts’ mean party placements against voter placements derived from the 1999, 2004, and 2009 EES surveys. The correlation between experts’ perceptions of PM parties’ and junior partners’ shifts on Europe is weak and insignificant (r = .28, p = .27), which suggests that (1) rank‐and‐file voters rely more strongly on the coalition heuristic than do experts and (2) voters’ perceptions that coalition partners’ positions shift together are not due to the non‐coalition‐related information that experts plausibly prioritize.            "
"21","To further substantiate our conclusions, we reestimated the parameters of models identical to Equation 1 above except that we controlled for shifts in the policy tone of the parties’ Euromanifestos, and for experts’ perceptions of party shifts. For these analyses, we recalibrated the EMP codings of party manifestos, along with experts’ party placements, from the original scales (ranging from –100 to +100 in the EMP codings and from 1 to 7 in the Chapel Hill surveys) to a 1–10 scale, which matches the scale from the European Election Study surveys.9"
"22","Column 2 in Table 3 reports parameter estimates for a Euromanifesto Project (EMP) codings model that includes the variable [Party j's shift (t) – EMP codings], which denotes the change in the party's stated position in the current European parliamentary election compared to the previous election, based on the EMP codings. The coefficient estimate on this variable is small and insignificant, which implies that citizens do not respond to party Euromanifestos.10 Moreover, the estimates on the variables [PM party's perceived shift (t)] and [party j is in government (t) × PM party's perceived shift (t)] continue to support our conclusion that citizens’ perceptions of junior partners’ policy shifts—but not of opposition parties’ shifts—track the PM party's perceived shift: Specifically, a one‐unit shift in the PM party's perceived position is associated with a 0.62‐unit shift in the same direction in citizens’ perceptions of junior partners.               "
"23","Column 3 in Table 3 reports parameter estimates for an expert placements model that is identical to Equation 1 above except that we included an additional variable, [Party j's shift (t) – Chapel Hill experts], that denotes the change in the experts’ mean placement of party j in the year of the current European parliamentary election compared to the previous election. We estimate a positive coefficient on this variable, indicating that citizens’ perceptions of party shifts track experts’ perceptions.11 In addition, the estimates on the variables [PM party's perceived shift (t)] and [party j is in government (t) × PM party's perceived shift (t)] continue to imply that citizens update their perceptions of junior partners and the PM party in tandem—specifically, that a one‐unit shift in the PM party's perceived position is associated with a 0.72‐unit shift in the same direction in citizens’ perceptions of junior coalition partners.12 It is striking that we estimate such large effects when controlling for experts’ perceptions, for this implies that rank‐and‐file voters rely on the coalition‐based heuristic more heavily than do political experts. To see this, note that if experts and rank‐and‐file voters weighed coalition arrangements equally, then our expert perceptions measure, the variable [Party j's shift (t) – Chapel Hill experts], should capture the full extent to which ordinary citizens update their perceptions of party positions via the coalition heuristic, in which case the coefficient estimate on the variable [party j is in government (t) × PM party's perceived shift (t)] would be near zero when we control for experts’ perceptions. However, our estimate for this variable remains large and significant. This finding supports Fortunato and Stevenson's (2013) argument that sophisticated citizens have less need to employ the simple coalition heuristic than do unsophisticated citizens. Given that the political scientists and journalists who participated in the Chapel Hill Expert Study surveys are super‐sophisticated citizens, they plausibly have little need to rely on the coalition heuristic to infer parties’ positions.               "
"24","We performed several analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. First, we reestimated our models from Table 3 while omitting the party's lagged perceived position, [Party j's perceived position (t – 1)], which is intended to capture any regression to the mean in party placements. Second, to assess whether voters’ reliance on the coalition heuristic was mediated by economic conditions, we reestimated our models on subsets of cases corresponding to higher (lower) national levels of unemployment, inflation, and GDP growth. Third, to evaluate the effects of possible sampling error on our measures of perceived party shifts, we reestimated our models using errors‐in‐variable specifications. Fourth, we reestimated our models of parties’ perceived policy shifts using their supporters’ perceptions of these shifts, as opposed to the entire electorate's perceptions. These analyses, which we report in supplementary materials posted on our website, continue to support our substantive conclusions.               "
"25","In toto, our results consistently imply that citizens perceive the positions of the prime minister's party and its junior coalition partners—but not opposition parties—shifting together on European integration. This conclusion persists when we control for parties’ Euromanifestos, for experts’ perceptions of party shifts, for economic conditions, and for possible survey sampling error. Our findings on the coalition heuristic that citizens apply to European integration mirror those that Fortunato and Stevenson (2013) report on left‐right policies, which suggest that this represents a general heuristic that citizens apply across diverse policy domains.               "
"26","While our analyses suggest that citizens infer party positions on Europe from coalition arrangements, we have not analyzed whether the public projects the PM party's position onto its junior partners or vice versa, nor whether the coalition heuristic enhances voters’ perceptual accuracy. With respect to the first issue, we cannot parse out the reciprocal effects of PM parties’ and junior coalition partners’ positions because these causal processes produce observationally equivalent patterns whereby coalition partners’ policy images shift in tandem. We hope to eventually gain purchase on this issue by incorporating data from the 2014 European Election Study surveys into our analyses, so that we can analyze a longer data series and better estimate the reciprocal long‐term effects of PM parties’ policy images and those of their junior partners. We note, however, the strong reasons to expect voters to project the PM party's policy shift onto its junior partners, rather than vice versa. In particular, Fortunato and Adams (n.d.) empirically support this pattern with respect to left‐right policies, and the authors substantiate this finding by noting that survey‐based and experimental research concludes that voters project that the PM party will dominate government policy (see, e.g., Duch, Przepiorka, and Stevenson 2013), and that the norm of collective responsibility prevents junior partners from differentiating their policies from those passed by the government. This view that the PM party—typically the largest party in the coalition—drives government policy outputs is reflected in empirical studies on political representation, which typically estimate the government's position as the mean position of the governing parties weighted by their sizes (e.g., Powell 2000; Warwick 2001).               "
"27","Hence, there is a strong case that citizens use the PM party's position on Europe to infer the positions of its junior partners. In addition, given the heavy media coverage of the prime minister's speeches and policy statements, compared to stated positions by other cabinet members, it is plausible that voters infer the PM party's positions from these statements and use them as a baseline to infer junior coalition partners’ positions."
"28","The question of whether citizens correctly apply the coalition heuristic to European integration is complex because the answer depends on the validity of the alternative measures of party positions we have analyzed, namely, Euromanifesto codings and experts’ judgments—a topic that has prompted widespread debate (see, e.g., Bakker, Jolly, and Polk 2012; Benoit, Mikhaylov, and Laver 2009). While we must proceed cautiously here, we note that neither of these alternative measures supports citizens’ perceptions that PM parties and their junior partners shift their policies in tandem. Furthermore, as discussed above, the theoretical rationale for applying the coalition heuristic appears weaker for European integration than for left‐right politics.               "
"29","At the same time, two alternative considerations cast the coalition heuristic in a more positive light. First, in the absence of more specific information, voters’ application of this heuristic may enhance their inferences about party positions across most issue areas, even if it does not in the (unusual) case of European integration. In this regard, recent research by Cahill and Adams (2014) concludes that coalition partners do in fact converge on issues pertaining to both economic policy and libertarian‐authoritarian issues. This suggests that voters’ application of the coalition heuristic is a sensible approach to inferring party positions across many issue areas, even if it is less useful with respect to European integration than with respect to other issues. Second, we are reluctant to ascribe “mistakes” to rank‐and‐file voters when their perceived party positions clash with experts’ perceptions, not only because this judgment presupposes that expert judgments are error‐free, but also because this issue raises the following question: How does one conceptualize a party's issue position? In particular, given that the norm of collective cabinet responsibility may be interpreted—at the extreme—as implying that all coalition partners share identical positions, namely, the positions embodied in the government's actual policy outputs, one can make a case that the coalition heuristic is “correct” by definition. While most scholars would see this judgment as overly simplistic, there is room for reasonable disagreement over how much coalition partners’ issue positions are defined by their concrete actions (namely, their decision to join the government and to endorse its policies) versus the statements coalition partners issue in their policy manifestos, speeches, press releases, and so on. Our analyses suggest that in weighing the import of words versus actions, rank‐and‐file voters privilege coalition partners’ actions—in particular, their decision to participate in the coalition cabinet—to a greater extent than do political experts, who appear attuned to more varied sources of information.               "
"30","Our finding that citizens apply the coalition heuristic to European integration arguably only matters if citizens also react to parties’ perceived shifts by updating their own policy views and/or their party support (i.e., that we observe partisan sorting in response to voters’ perceptions). Previous studies find that citizens take policy cues from parties on European integration (Gabel 1998; Ray 2003b; Steenbergen, Edwards, and De Vries 2007) and also at times choose parties based on this issue (Ray 2003a), so that we expect to observe partisan sorting in response to voters’ shifting perceptions of party positions.            "
"31","In analyses of individual‐level panel data, we might parse out whether citizens update their party support as opposed to their policy views. However, because we analyze aggregate time‐series cross‐sectional data, we instead estimate the extent to which either process occurs. Our logic is simple: If parties’ perceived policy shifts prompt citizens to update their party support and/or their policy views, we should observe the positions of a party's supporters shifting in the same direction as the party's perceived shift (see, e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002).13"
"32","We specify a multivariate regression model to analyze mass‐level partisan sorting on European integration. Our measure of the position of each party's partisan constituency at the time of the current European parliamentary election is the mean self‐placement of all European Election Study respondents in that election who supported the focal party. (The appendix presents the party identification question from the EES surveys.) Our dependent variable, [Party j supporters’ shift (t)], is the change in the mean position of party j’s supporters between the current European parliamentary election and the previous election. Our independent variables are identical to those in Equation 1 above, except that we include the lagged level of our new dependent variable, [Party j supporters’ position (t – 1)], and also [Party j's perceived shift (t)]. This latter variable controls for partisan shifting in response to voters’ perceptions of the focal party's policy shift:14                              "
"33","Table 4 reports parameter estimates for this partisan sorting specification. The coefficient on the variable [Party j's perceived shift (t)], +0.64, is statistically significant (p < .01) and denotes that when voters perceive a party shifting one unit on the EU scale, the mean position of the party's supporters shifts 0.64 units in the same direction (on average), with parties’ and supporters’ shifts calibrated along identical 1–10 scales. These estimates imply that the coalition heuristic matters, in that citizens’ party perceptions prompt mass‐level partisan sorting.            "
"34","By contrast, the insignificant coefficients on most of the remaining variables provide no evidence that coalition‐based considerations prompt additional partisan sorting beyond what is due to parties’ perceived policy shifts.15 For instance, if junior coalition partners’ supporters were especially willing to take policy cues from the prime minister, we should estimate a positive coefficient on the interacted variable [party j is in government (t) × PM party's perceived shift (t)], which would denote that junior partners’ supporters shift in the same direction as the PM party's perceived shift (ceteris paribus). However, the estimate on this variable is near zero and insignificant. We conclude that coalition heuristics prompt partisan sorting via their direct effect on citizens’ perceptions of party positions, as opposed to junior partners’ supporters taking policy cues from the PM party.            "
"35","Fortunato and Stevenson's (2013) insight, that citizens infer parties’ left‐right positions from governing coalition arrangements, has important implications for mass‐elite linkages. This finding illuminates how citizens use the simple, sensible coalition heuristic to infer parties’ left‐right positions, which alleviates citizens’ need to obtain more complex information pertaining to party manifestos and press releases, parliamentary debates, and government policy outputs. We find that citizens apply coalition‐based heuristics to the increasingly salient issue of European integration. Moreover, we show that the coalition‐based inferences citizens make about parties’ stances toward Europe matter, in that they prompt mass‐level partisan sorting on this issue.         "
"36","We also identify an important difference between citizens’ application of the coalition heuristic to European integration, compared to left‐right politics: Namely, while research documents that governments form (and endure) largely based on parties’ shared left‐right policies, there is no comparable evidence that coalitions revolve around parties’ views on Europe, and we demonstrate that the coalition heuristic we identify—namely, voters’ inferences that coalition partners’ positions on Europe shift in tandem—is not supported by the content of parties’ Euromanifestos or by experts’ party placements. This suggests that when estimating party positions on European integration, rank‐and‐file voters diverge from political experts in that voters assign primacy to coalition partners’ concrete actions—in particular, the easily observable fact of the governing coalition itself—whereas political experts weigh more varied sources of information, such as parliamentary debates, party elites’ speeches and interviews, and parties’ election manifestos.

"37","Our study raises several additional issues for future research. First, given the increased salience of European integration over the past five years, parties’ coalition negotiations during this period may pertain to European issues more than was the case during the 1999–2009 time frame of our study. We plan to eventually revisit our analyses and incorporate the data from the 2014 European Election Study surveys, along with parties’ 2014 Euromanifestos and the 2014 wave of the Chapel Hill expert surveys in order to evaluate whether citizens’ reliance on the coalition heuristic has increased since 2009."
"38","Another path is to analyze how coalitions influence citizens’ perceptions along additional dimensions such as the environment, crime, and immigration. While the lack of cross‐nationally comparable surveys poses obstacles to this study, our findings of a coalition heuristic on European integration—in combination with the Fortunato‐Stevenson (2013) findings on left‐right issues—suggest that this heuristic may be a general one that citizens apply to various domains.         "
"39","An additional extension is to explore the dynamics of coalition‐based effects under minority governing arrangements. For example, in 2010, the Dutch minority coalition, composed of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), governed with the aid of the far‐right, anti‐EU Party for Freedom (PVV), which supported the government from outside the formal coalition. We plan to evaluate whether voters apply the coalition heuristic to such government support parties that remain officially outside the cabinet. This issue is relevant to the strategic calculations of radical right parties throughout Europe whose electoral appeal is tied to their anti‐EU stances, including the National Front in France, Golden Dawn in Greece, the British National Party, and the Dutch PVV. To the extent that these parties’ images as staunch anti‐EU parties are compromised when they provide informal support to more moderate governing parties, these radical right parties may have electoral incentives to withhold support from the government."
"40","In this article, we have extended the study of coalition heuristics to European integration policy. We have shown that citizens apply the heuristic to this policy domain and that the inferences citizens draw about party policy shifts prompt partisan sorting in the electorate. We do see various promising extensions, discussed above, which form the subject of future research."
