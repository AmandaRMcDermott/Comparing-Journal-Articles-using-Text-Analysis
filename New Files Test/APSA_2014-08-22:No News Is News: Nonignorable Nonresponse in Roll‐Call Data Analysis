"1","Scholars of legislative behavior estimate ideal points to examine the influence of interest groups on legislators' choices, the dimensionality of the political spectrum, the ideological coherence of political parties, the degree to which party pressure affects legislators' voting behavior, or the identity of pivotal and “most extreme” members of a voting body. Ideal points themselves are seldom the main quantities of interest, but their use requires that they be at least good summaries of revealed preferences. Estimation of ideal points builds on the spatial theory of voting, which assumes that legislators vote for a bill if the expected utility of supporting it outweighs the expected utility of opposing it (Enelow and Hinich 1984; Hinich and Munger 1992). Based on this theory—and on several auxiliary assumptions to ensure statistical identification—analysts can recover ideal points from legislator‐by‐vote matrices typically containing ones and zeros that correspond to observed ayes and nays.         "
"2","However, almost all legislatures generate matrices with missing values that correspond to abstentions or absences. This need not be problematic in legislatures with limited amounts of missing data; in the contemporaneous U.S. Congress, for example, missingness rates are extremely low, and thus unlikely to affect inferences about ideal points (see Poole and Rosenthal 2007, 292). Yet, the rate of missing values in many voting bodies around the world is rather high, often higher than rates of missingness typically seen in survey data. We have gathered a sample of 63 legislatures in 22 countries, including both parliamentary and presidential regimes.1 Many of these legislatures classify missing values as explicit abstentions, as official absences, or as instances in which legislators were present but did not vote. In our sample, the average incidence of explicit abstention is 3%. Yet rates of explicit abstention are much higher in countries such as Brazil (20–30% throughout the 1990s) or the Czech Republic (10.5% in the early 1990s). Furthermore, some legislatures, like New Zealand's before 1995, prohibit explicit abstentions or, when they allow them, make their exercise so costly that legislators may simply choose not to enter the floor when they in fact want to abstain. Thus, the average incidence of official absences—which stands at 23% across legislatures in our sample—may mask explicit abstentions in countries like Israel, where official absences have hovered around 70% (Rosas and Shomer 2008). The same argument can be made with respect to missing values in the “present but did not vote” category, whose average incidence is about 13%. This form of nonresponse is prevalent in countries like Argentina, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand and has at times amounted to 36, 18, 33, and 26% of cells in the roll‐call matrices of their legislatures. These rates illustrate the high prevalence of nonresponse in legislatures around the world.         "
"3","In the face of missingness, common scholarly practice is to assume that values are missing at random (MAR) before proceeding with estimation of ideal points. However, abstentions and physical absences in many institutional settings are purposeful strategic choices driven by the voting process itself. Scholarly work on abstentions in roll‐call voting in the U.S. House and Senate commonly concludes that abstentions are intentional and strategic acts (Forgette and Sala 1999; Kromer 2005; Rothenberg and Sanders 1999, 2000, 2002). Cohen and Noll (1991) find evidence that “indifferent” legislators are more likely to participate in a vote when the vote is close and the outcome is uncertain, whereas they are less likely to participate when the outcome can be clearly predicted. Similarly, Poole and Rosenthal (1997) model abstentions as a function of the chance that a legislator will be pivotal on any given vote and of the legislator's utility differential of voting aye or nay. In European parliaments, Noury (2004) finds that the expected closeness of a vote is an important determinant of abstention and that being in the majority decreases the probability of abstaining. If nonresponse is strategic and purposeful, the assumption that nonresponses are random may no longer be appropriate. Consider a case like Argentina, where legislators often face a competing principals dilemma: Since following directions from national party leaders may force them to register votes that are contrary to the preferences of their provincial bosses, it is not uncommon for legislators to simply be absent from the floor rather than risk incurring the displeasure of one of these two principals (Jones and Hwang 2005). In this case, the analyst holds additional information about the reasons that lead to nonresponse that should be considered in the analysis.         "
"4","Item nonresponse is rather common around the world and, as scholars have noted, can be the result of nonignorable mechanisms such as competing principals or indifference. To build intuition about how processes that generate nonignorable nonresponse can be modeled, we start in the next section by summarizing extant knowledge about the conditions under which missingness mechanisms can be ignored; we do so within the context of the Bayesian item response theory (IRT) model."
"5","Scholars commonly resort to the Bayesian IRT model to study various aspects of legislative politics (Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004b; Martin and Quinn, 2002). This statistical model is based on theoretical microfoundations about the behavior of legislators who confront an up‐or‐down vote on an item that changes the status quo in one or more policy dimensions. We adopt Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers's notation and parameterize the probability that legislator i will vote in favor of proposal j as , where  are ideal points and  and  are item parameters. Inference about parameters  is based on data , a matrix of I legislators by J items with 1's and 0's corresponding to ayes and nays.         "
"6","Legislators in many assemblies often abstain or are absent, leaving  with potentially large numbers of missing values. These missing values are commonly “filled in” through some form of multiple imputation.2 In practical terms, high rates of missing values mean that information about model parameters  is less plentiful. This has the effect, at a minimum, of increasing uncertainty about parameter estimates, but multiple imputation still guarantees reasonable estimates of ideal points as long as we can assume that the nonresponse mechanism is ignorable. If nonresponse cannot be assumed to be ignorable, Bayesian and likelihood‐based estimation will generate biased and/or inefficient parameter estimates. Thus, understanding the potential benefits of modeling missingness mechanisms in roll call data requires understanding the conditions under which missingness processes should be deemed nonignorable.         "
"7","Rubin (1976) derives the conditions under which missingness processes can be disregarded. We first define some concepts and relay Rubin's conditions for ignorability by focusing explicitly on nonresponse in legislatures. We assume that roll calls are realizations  of a random variable , with typical element  for an aye vote and  for a nay vote, where  comprises the sequence of vote choices of legislator i on items 1 through J, regardless of whether these vote choices are observed or not. We further assume that elements of  are independent and identically distributed with probability density function , and we seek to make inferences about parameter .         "
"8","Along with , the process of nonresponse is driven by variable , with typical realization  if we observe legislator i's vote on item j and  if i fails to cast a vote. We define the conditional probability that  takes on values  given that  has taken values  as . Again,  is a set that may include legislator‐specific and item‐specific parameters, and possibly elements of  as well. The probability density function  captures the process that produces nonresponse. Whether nonresponses are ignorable or not, the complete‐data likelihood for a model of votes and abstentions considers both the vote choice and the nonresponse processes: . In a Bayesian setting, the complete‐data joint posterior distribution of  and  is defined as            "
"9","We denote the observed elements of  as  (unobserved elements of  are denoted ). In the analysis of roll‐call votes, the default position is to assume that nonresponse is ignorable and then to make likelihood‐based inferences about θ from the observed‐data likelihood  or Bayesian inferences from the observed‐data posterior distribution, which reduces to:            "
"10","As can be seen from comparing the complete‐data and observed‐data posterior distributions in Expressions 1 and 2, ignoring the process that generates missing values means dropping  and —that is, the part of the model that captures (a) the abstention process and (b) a priori information about the relation between  and . Under the assumption of ignorability that underlies the IRT model, we make inferences about  based on the observed‐data posterior distribution. As long as the assumption of ignorability holds, efforts to model the process that generates abstentions will be redundant and will not improve inferences about the parameters that produce aye/nay votes.         "
"11","Rubin's theorems establish that the mechanism that generates missing values is ignorable under Bayesian inference given either of two sets of conditions:            "
"12","The latter is a necessary and sufficient condition that says that ignorability may still hold even if MAR does not, but this rests on an unlikely balancing condition linking  to .5 Thus, we require in practice that the nonresponse process be MAR and that the parameters of the nonresponse and vote choice processes are distinct. In Bayesian inference, distinctness holds when the prior distribution of  and  can be factored out as —that is, as the product of two independent distributions.6"
"13","What does this all imply for scholars interested in applied research? To analyze what may go wrong in a setting where roll‐call votes are not completely observed, we build a model of “competing principals” from first principles. This mechanism is commonly seen as a driving force behind absences and abstentions in various legislative settings. We think of the basic dilemma of competing principals as one where legislators are mostly free to vote their conscience (or district's interests) but might abstain if their vote preference does not coincide with the party line (see, e.g., Carey 2007; Rosas and Shomer 2008).7 In this section, we derive the complete‐data likelihood function for the competing principals model, suggest an estimation technique for this function, and explain what information, if any, is available a priori to the researcher. In the next section, we compare inferences about legislators' ideal points based on observed‐ and complete‐data posterior distributions in a set of simulated legislatures.         "
"14","To build a model of competing principals, we rely on two pieces of information that are generally available in actual legislatures. First, we consider the party membership of legislators. In the model we build, legislators can belong to any of two parties, L and R, occupying overlapping regions of a one‐dimensional ideological space. Second, we also assume that an official “party vote choice” is available for each bill. We think of this as the known aye or nay position of the party whip or party leader. We posit that the probability that legislators abstain on any given bill is larger if they disagree with their party's position than if they agree. This forces us to consider two cases in developing the likelihood function for the competing principals' process. The two cases correspond to the two possible positions that the legislator's party can take on a given vote; we introduce the notation  to refer to the party's observed vote choice (1=aye, 0=nay). The vector  of party vote choices constitutes data in this model.         "
"15","We derive the likelihood function for our competing principals model from the joint probability of vote choice and vote registration, that is, . We show how to parameterize the expression for the probability of registering a vote given that aye is preferred to nay, that is, ; the other cases can be derived in a similar fashion. As mentioned before, we need to consider two cases: If the legislator's party prefers aye, then the legislator will very likely register a vote if she also prefers aye. Conversely, the legislator will be less likely to register a vote if she prefers aye but the party's known choice is nay. In other words, the competing principals logic leads us to expect            "
"16","We consider a parsimonious model in which the probability of casting a vote conditional on agreement is identical across legislators, regardless of their party's choice, and is larger than the probability of casting a vote conditional on disagreement, also regardless of party choice. We capture these probabilities with two additional parameters:  and . Consistent with the competing principals dilemma that we model, we expect ; this knowledge constitutes a priori information that should be included in the model through a suitable prior distribution for . As before, we assume that legislators have preferences on aye and nay choices based on a spatial logic, and that these preferences are independent of each other and independent of the party vote. Because the competing principals mechanism does not alter the spatial logic underlying IRT, we continue to define  in terms of , , and . With these pieces in place, we parameterize the probability of observing a positive vote as:            "
"17","The competing principals logic produces nonignorable nonresponse, but we do not yet know whether the impact of nonresponse on ideal point estimates is large enough to be problematic. How severe is the bias in inferences about ideal points when the process that generates nonresponse is mistakenly assumed to be random? Even if we had exact knowledge about the conditions under which legislators prefer to abstain, how much is gained by explicitly modeling nonresponse or, conversely, how much is lost by assuming that patterns of nonresponse are random? This question can be best answered through Monte Carlo simulations, where we have control over the mechanism that generates both vote choice and nonresponse.         "
"18","Patterns of missing and observed votes furnish information that can be used to make inferences about various quantities of interest, including legislators' ideal points. We do not know, however, how much of an inferential improvement we should expect when modeling abstention‐generating mechanisms, since the additional information that can be extracted from conditioning inferences on the matrix  of missing and observed votes may be minute. To gauge the magnitude of inferential gains, we inspect a set of simulated assemblies. In each of 100 simulated assemblies, we assign 31 legislators to one of two parties, with the leftist party comprising a majority of 18 legislators and all legislators voting on 100 bills. We chose a ratio of votes to legislators close to 3:1 because (a) this ratio falls squarely within the observed distribution of actual legislatures,9 (b) the size of simulated legislatures is small enough to keep computational time within manageable proportions, and (c) the size of simulated legislatures is large enough that it allows a somewhat smooth distribution of legislators along an ideological dimension. Since the properties of ideal point estimates depend on vote‐to‐legislator ratios, rather than on the total numbers of votes or legislators, our results are not likely to be affected by the size of our samples.         "
"19","Each simulated run consists of one legislature (1 to 100) and one level of abstention (5%, 10%, 30%). We fit four different models to each simulated run, as can be seen in Table 1. The first is our benchmark model, namely, an IRT specification based on the full information matrix of vote choices (). The second model is the Nominate specification based on observed roll‐call matrix . The third model is an IRT specification, also based on observed roll‐call data ; we refer to this as the “observed data” model. Finally, the “complete data” model is based on roll‐call data  and on the matrix of nonresponse  and corresponds to the specification derived in the previous section.10"
"20","Table 1 presents a number of results that allow us to evaluate the performance of the complete‐data models. We consider statistics of model fit (Bayes residuals and percentages of correctly predicted votes) as well as quantities of interest to scholars, such as the recovered rank order of legislators' ideal points. The results are arranged by level of abstention; within each level of abstention, we consider (a) the fully observed votes model (“full,” for brevity), (b) Nominate, (c) the observed‐data model, and (d) the complete‐data model, in that order. Each cell in Table 1 averages over the results of 100 simulated runs.11 For example, the top left cell obtains from averaging over all Bayes residuals in a simulated run, and then across all simulated runs (we display in parentheses the standard error of the statistic in question).         "
"21","Consider first the statistics of model fit, which confirm that there are sizable gains from fitting complete‐data models especially as the rate of abstentions increases. The average Bayes residual for the full model provides a useful benchmark regarding how good of a fit we can expect in the observed‐ and complete‐data models (Bayes residuals are not estimated for Nominate).12 Table 1 confirms that the observed‐data model achieves good fit under low and even medium levels of abstention but is systematically outperformed by the complete‐data model, which generates average Bayes residuals similar in size to those of the full model even under heavy missingness. In general, observed‐data models tend to have a larger number of large deviations (large residuals) between predicted probability and the actual binary value of votes.         "
"22","In the next two rows, we look at the average number of correctly predicted vote choices among missing and observed cells. The standard again is the full model, which is estimated on the fully observed data . Note that when we look at the predictive distribution of vote choices based on the full model, performance is much better in predicting vote choices that will be observed than vote choices that will be missing. This is precisely the meaning of non‐ignorability; in a nonignorable abstention process, the vote choices that will eventually be missing are different from vote choices that will remain observed. Because the Nominate and observed‐data models are based exclusively on the latter, they tend to be very good at predicting vote choice in observed cells but generate poor predictive distributions for unobserved cells. In fact, both the Nominate and observed‐data models achieve similar rates of correct predictions among observed votes across the board, systematically outperforming the complete‐data model and the full model. However, the Nominate and observed‐data models deliver poorer predictions for missing cells, and their performance drops markedly as the rate of abstentions increases. The complete‐data model delivers predictive distributions among missing and observed cells that are closest to those of the full model.13"
"23","Scholars seldom resort to models such as IRT or Nominate to predict vote choices; to the contrary, vote choices are analyzed to infer quantities of direct interest, such as the degree of liberalism of a politician or the probability that a given legislator might be the median voter in the chamber. We compare our four models based on their ability to replicate the known structure of legislators' ideal points in our simulated legislatures. The first metric is Randall's τ, which compares the degree of association between the known and estimated ideal point rank orders. As the rates of abstention move from low to middling to high, the complete‐data model again outperforms the observed‐data model; the average proportional reduction of error statistics for the complete over the observed model is as high as 10% and 40% for middling and high rates of abstention, respectively, and is even much higher when we compare the complete‐data model against Nominate.14 A similarly remarkable improvement obtains when we examine these models based on their ability to recover the identity of the median voter, that is, both the complete‐ and observed‐data model perform similarly well for low to medium rates of abstention, but the complete‐data model outperforms the observed‐data model drastically at medium to high rates of abstention.15"
"24","We have shown that for relatively low rates of abstention, the observed‐data model (i.e., the IRT model based on observed votes) provides a very robust and reliable option that does not require the construction of alternative specifications. However, the simulation exercise also suggests that complete‐data specifications can improve markedly on observed‐data specifications as the rate of nonignorable missingness increases in a legislature."
"25","Before concluding this section, we analyze the performance of the competing principals complete‐data model in recovering the probability that a legislator will cast a vote conditional on her party's position. In building the simulated legislatures, we stipulated that a legislator would abstain with probability P1 if she disagreed with her party, and if she agreed she would abstain with probability P2. We also ensured that , so that even though the probability of abstaining in case of agreement is not negligible, the probability of abstaining in case of disagreement is larger. The complete‐data model specification incorporates two additional parameters, π1 and π2; the posterior distribution of these parameters provides an estimate of the probability of abstention conditional on agreement/disagreement (i.e.,  and  are estimates of P1 and P2).16 Table 2 displays the main results. For each level of abstention, we show the distribution (mean and standard deviation) across 100 legislatures of the “true” probabilities of abstention conditional on agreement and disagreement with the legislator's party (P1 and P2). Next to it, we show a summary of the posterior distribution of  over 100 models. For example, the top left cell suggests that in 100 simulated legislatures, the probability of abstaining conditional on disagreement (P1) was, on average, 0.14. Next to this cell we show that the average value of π1 is also 0.14. In all cases, the model recovers probabilities of abstention that are very close to the true probabilities; only at the highest rate of abstention do we see that the complete‐data model estimates an exaggerated probability of abstention conditional on agreement.         "
"26","This analysis raises a final question that we address briefly. Table 2 shows that the stipulated probabilities of abstention given disagreement are much higher than the corresponding probabilities of abstention given agreement. This means that, especially for high rates of abstention, a missing value is much more likely to correspond to a vote against the party line than to a vote with the party. This is precisely the extra information that the complete‐data model exploits, but the question is whether such disparity in the probabilities of abstention would occur in real legislatures. Our view is that these disparate probabilities reflect well the essence of the competing principals dilemma. Be this as it may, we generated an extra set of legislatures with more homogeneous probabilities of abstention (results are in the supporting information). We basically find a pattern similar to the one we discussed above, as the complete‐data model outperforms the observed‐data model in terms of fit and quality of inferences about ideal points, but these gains in performance obtain only when the overall abstention rate is relatively high.         "
"27","We use variations of the competing principals model to address two debates in international relations and American politics. Our goal in these illustrations is to show the ease with which competing principals assumptions can be incorporated in item response models; we also highlight the improvement in inferences about ideal points that scholars would make when modeling processes suspected to generate nonignorable nonresponse. The first debate concerns the degree of ideological cohesion displayed by the U.S. and Soviet blocs in the United Nations General Assembly during the height of the Cold War. Though it is obvious that some members of the Warsaw Pact, like Romania, were not entirely aligned with the Soviet Union, scholarship based on General Assembly resolutions does not find any obvious differences between such countries and other members of the Warsaw Pact. The second application is a reanalysis of the “most liberal senator” debate ignited during U.S. presidential campaigns in 2004 and 2008."
"28","Voting patterns in the United Nations' General Assembly have been widely examined. Scholars have estimated cohesion indices and ideal points based on voting records in this body to describe the ideological structure of the United Nations (Alker 1964; Alker and Russett 1965; Chai 1979; Hosli et al. 2010; Hurwitz 1975; Kim and Russett 1996; Lijphart 1963; Russett 1966; Voeten 2000). Researchers have also used ideal points to examine aspects of interstate cooperation and conflict within the United Nations and outside it. For example, Voeten (2004) uses multilevel IRT models to examine the extent to which the United States became isolated in the United Nations in the years 1991 to 2001 on account of its unilateral actions in the mid‐1990s. Reed et al. (2008) tested and found support for a bargaining model of war, particularly for the hypothesis that equality between distribution of power and distribution of benefits decreases the probability of conflict. The authors estimate a one‐dimensional IRT model for each year between 1946 and 2000 and use estimated ideal points to measure the likelihood that states will agree on the status quo (Reed et al. 2008, 1207). Note that researchers have resorted to both Nominate and Bayesian IRT models to examine the dimensionality of the United Nations and characteristics of international disagreements and cooperation (Reed et al. 2008; Voeten 2000, 2004).            "
"29","As in many other voting institutions, abstention in the UN General Assembly is an explicit vote choice (Lijphart 1963; Rai 1982). Moreover, explicit abstentions are very common in the United Nations. Voeten shows that abstentions are more frequent than nay votes in the General Assembly (Voeten 2000, 2004). Many times, abstentions may be related to a competing principals rationale: For example, a country aligned with the United States (or a recipient of aid from the United States) may officially abstain on a resolution in light of American pressure to do so, although its “true” preferences would have been to vote against the U.S. line. As Carter and Stone (2011, 14) put it, “the United States works hard in many cases to get countries to abstain on particularly sensitive issues.” Similarly, communist countries during the Cold War may have been caught between competing principals (e.g., Kremlin versus Beijing), and may have abstained on resolutions rather than voting with the Soviet Union. Thus, Cuba in 1965 abstained twice from votes the rest of the pro‐communist bloc supported—Gareau (1970) interprets Cuba's abstentions as consistent with a process of decentralization of the Soviet bloc—whereas Romania and Albania also “refused to support the Soviet Union in its dispute with Peking” (Gareau 1970, 953). Romania also broke with the Soviet bloc line on Arab‐Israeli issues. Having signed a trade agreement with Israel, Romania distanced itself from the Soviet bloc starting in 1965, and in 1967 Romania abstained on 7 out of 10 pro‐Arab votes (Gareau 1970).            "
"30","If abstentions in the UN General Assembly are strategic, assuming they are ignorable is erroneous and will lead to biased inferences about ideal points. Though one might be tempted to treat abstentions as negative votes, this practice could bias measures of agreement among blocs in the UN General Assembly, as noted by Rieselbach (1960). Similarly, Gareau argues that when studying dimensionality and bloc alignment in the United Nations one needs to think carefully about abstentions as these “are legitimate votes in the world organization” (Gareau 1970, 935). However, Gareau assumes that unobserved votes of abstaining states are distributed similarly to observed votes, thus regarding abstentions as ignorable.            "
"31","We analyze votes in the General Assembly during 1970 to illustrate how the tools developed in this article can be extended to deal with nonignorable abstentions. We chose this coldest of moments in the Cold War as a time period during which competing principals' dilemmas could arguably drive abstentions. We fit two models to a roll‐call matrix of 126 states voting on 68 resolutions. The first model is the standard Bayesian IRT model. The second model is an extension of the competing principals model we developed before that deals with two peculiarities of the roll‐call data. First, we consider the United States and the Soviet Union as the leaders of their coalitions, which means that the behavior of their clients is conditional on their observed votes. Unfortunately, both countries abstained on several votes during 1970, which means that we lack the conditioning variable for clients' votes.17 We deal with the missing votes of the United States and USSR by assuming that these abstentions are random, which is also our assumption for the missing votes of countries that are not clients of either superpower. Second, the size and composition of each superpower's clientele is varied, and the processes that lead to abstention within each camp are likely to differ. For this reason, we allow for bloc‐specific probabilities of abstention conditional on agreement and disagreement. As we discuss below, this modeling decision allows for a richer description of international relations within each of the two blocs.18"
"32","Table 3 displays the breakdown of General Assembly participants according to their relation with the two superpowers circa 1970. We follow a strict military criterion to decide which countries are allied to the United States and the Soviet Union. We consider countries in the Warsaw Pact to be Soviet clients, whereas U.S. clients come from the ranks of NATO and a number of regional defense agreements, such as the Rio Treaty (data on mutual defense treaties comes from Signorino and Ritter 1999). Admittedly, different criteria could be used to decide which countries are more likely to receive pressure from either the United States or the Soviet Union; we believe this straightforward coding decision to be a fair approximation to alliance dynamics at the height of the Cold War.            "
"33","Figure 1 compares estimates of ideal points from the IRT observed‐data model, in which abstentions are assumed random, and a version of the competing principals complete‐data model, in which abstentions by satellite countries are not random, but produced by a conflict of interest between a country's own preferences and the preferences of its superpower patron. In comparing inferences from these two models, our main observation concerns a handful of countries that we identified as Soviet and U.S. clients. On the Soviet bloc, the consensual view of Ceausescu's Romania as a state that kept its distance from the Soviet Union is clearly corroborated in our model (in the IRT model, Romania's position is virtually indistinguishable from that of the Soviet Union). Among U.S. allies, countries like Brazil, Bolivia, Iceland, or Japan appear to be more “centrist” than we would have inferred based on their observed voting record.19"
"34","Changes in estimated ideal points can be best understood by considering another set of parameters, namely, the probabilities that a client will register a vote given that it agrees or disagrees with its patron. Summaries of the posterior distribution of these parameters appear in Table 4. As is evident from this table, we estimate client states of the Soviet Union to be very unlikely to cast a vote when they disagree with their patron (). Among U.S. allies, the probability of casting a vote conditional on disagreement is close to even.            "
"35","As mentioned before (see note 13), we cannot employ measures of goodness of fit to compare our model's performance with that of the IRT model. Estimates of deviance are much higher for our model, mainly because the dependent variable is coded differently (see Jags code in the supporting information). Our model performs about as well as the IRT model in correctly predicting observed votes (correct prediction rates are 0.98 and 0.97); again, this slight underperformance is hardly surprising based on our conclusions from the Monte Carlo simulations. Also unsurprisingly, the predictions of the two models we fit differ the most for missing cells: Out of 2,269 missing cells, the observed‐ and complete‐data models differ in their prediction 217 times; in contrast, these models differ in predicting observed cells only 62 out of 6,299 times. Though the Monte Carlo simulations suggest ample inferential gains, the merits of modeling abstentions in actual applications with observational data need to be assessed against a different yardstick, namely, their purchase in helping researchers make sense of a particular problem or fitting some prior political narrative (like Romania's distance from the Soviet Union).            "
"36","The U.S. Senate is a voting body with very low overall rates of abstention where we would not expect our models to deliver large inferential improvements. However, a handful of senators abstain heavily at certain times in ways that may be nonignorable, especially during presidential elections when some of them are on the campaign trail. Analyses of voting behavior that rest overwhelmingly on votes cast in this period lead to mistaken inferences about the ideological leanings of senators. The problem is compounded when analysts study a small sample of votes, rather than the whole set of available bills. This is the case of the nonpartisan National Journal's rankings of “most liberal” and “most conservative” senators.20 We revisit the “most liberal senator” debate as an illustration of how our methods work in a subset of roll‐call votes characterized by low overall abstention rates, but with a few members who have high rates of nonignorable nonresponse. We hasten to add that we are not interested in estimating senators' ideal points per se; this has been done elsewhere, and in fact we will use those inferences as a yardstick for our model (see Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004a). We address the “most liberal senator” problem because it is a perfect illustration of the dangers of ignoring information on the patterns that generate missingness.            "
"37","To keep the illustration within manageable proportions, we review the National Journal's analysis of John Kerry's voting behavior in the buildup to the 2004 presidential election. The National Journal (NJ) analyzed U.S. Senate voting records on 62 key votes prior to that election to conclude that John Kerry was the most liberal member of that body; predictably, these rankings were promptly used by Senator Kerry's opponents to portray him as an ideological extremist. Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004a) have criticized the NJ results on two grounds: First, the journal's ideal points disregard estimation uncertainty; second, the journal based its inferences on a rather narrow set of observed votes for Senator Kerry, who missed a majority of votes under consideration, most of them while campaigning for the Democratic Party's (DP) presidential nomination. Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers point to a potentially insidious problem with Kerry's large number of missing votes, namely, the possibility that these votes were in fact not missing at random: As Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004a, 809) argue, “the roll calls that do draw candidates back to Washington to cast votes are not a random subset of roll calls, but are on issues where their votes might have utmost importance for procedural reasons. Party loyalty rather than a genuine ideological position might explain some of these votes.” If this interpretation is correct, Kerry's handful of observed votes during the campaign would overwhelmingly coincide with the party line.            "
"38","We seek to answer the following question: Would the NJ have ranked Senator Kerry differently had it recognized that his abstentions were not random? To do so, we proceed to model the 62 NJ votes as if the absent votes of four Democrats on the campaign trail had been generated by a mechanism akin to the competing principals model we developed before. The competing principals model is germane because if Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers's claim about missing votes is correct, the probability of observing a vote—that is, of seeing Senator Kerry and other presidential candidates flying back to Washington to take part in a vote—is a priori higher if senators agree with the party's position. As a proxy for the party's position on each vote, we follow Bradbury, Davidson, and Evans (2008) in using the records of Senators Nickles (R) and Reid (D), Senate majority and minority whips during the period under consideration, to represent the position of the Republican and Democratic parties.21 Kerry's 25 observed votes in the NJ set are with a majority of the DP, and only twice against the party's Senate whip. This high rate of agreement with the DP majority and the DP whip contrasts with the fact that in the same data set, the average DP senator voted with her party 85% of the time but was present for 60.7 out of 62 votes.22 Contrast this information with his full voting record during the 107th Senate. When the full session is considered, Kerry abstained only on 3.2% of all votes, voted with the majority of the DP in 73% (462) of all votes, and opposed the majority in 151 votes (24%). In short, Kerry's degree of conformity with the DP in the subset of NJ votes is abnormally high. Estimates of Kerry's ideology based on the NJ subset will make him appear far more extreme than he really is as long as the assumption of ignorable missingness is maintained, a point emphasized by Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004a).            "
"39","We further adapt our competing principals model by assuming that the responses of Senators Edwards, Graham, Kerry, and Lieberman—all of whom were contenders for the DP's presidential nomination—are observed not at random. Instead, we submit that the probability that these four senators would show up in Washington to vote is higher conditional on agreeing with their party. We codify this prior in suitable distributions for the probabilities of observing a vote conditional on agreement and disagreement.23"
"40","Our conclusions are best relayed by Figure 2, which plots credible intervals for the ideal points of senators. Senators' ideal points based on the observed‐data model appear in gray; ideal points based on the complete‐data model are in black (point estimates are medians and lines are interquartile ranges of the posterior distributions of x for each senator). Note that we do not estimate ideal points for Senators Reid and Nickles, as we use their records as proxies of the positions of the Democrat, and Republican parties, respectively.24 Senators in Figure 2 are ranked based on observed‐data ideal points. Consistent with the NJ characterization, Kerry is the most liberal Senator based on the model that assumes ignorability of nonresponse. In contrast, Senator Kerry seems to be much less liberal when we model abstentions as a competing principals process.25"
"41","Our estimates of the probability that Kerry would be the most liberal senator change drastically from the observed‐data model to the complete‐data model. In the former, we estimate Kerry to be the most liberal senator with probability 0.67. This probability drops to 0.04 based on the complete‐data model. Similarly, the interquartile range (IQR) of our estimate of Kerry's rank along the conservative‐liberal dimension is 97–98 (out of 98 senators, since Reid and Nickles are excluded) in the observed‐data model and 68–90 in the complete‐data model. As can be seen from this exercise, the recovered ranks from the complete‐data model are closely aligned with the ranks that Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004a) report in their “most liberal senator” analysis based on the entire voting record of the 107th Senate (their point estimate for Senator Kerry's appears to be around 83 out of 100, which falls squarely within our interval estimate). Our recovered ranks also place Kerry in a position similar to his rank based on Americans for Democratic Action scores (ADA); ADA ranked Senator Kerry on the conservative‐liberal dimension as 83rd in 2001, 77th in 2002, and 76th in 2003.            "
"42","In Figure 2, we have also added inferences from a model in which all absences are considered votes against the party line (open circles), which helps us provide some intuition about how the competing principals model works. A cursory inspection of these estimates suggests that the complete‐data competing principals model can be seen as a compromise between inferences based on the observed‐data model and inferences based on the alternative “absences as votes against the party line” model. Senator Kerry's case makes this interpretation most evident: His ideal point based on the complete‐data model is pulled toward the ideal point estimate that obtains when we consider his absences as votes against the Democrats.            "
"43","Modeling the abstention‐generating process effectively adds information that we use to improve inferences about ideal points. In this case, we exploit a priori knowledge, namely, that flying back to Washington signals that senators are more likely to agree with their party. Aside from improved inferences about Senator Kerry's ideological rank, our model also recovers estimates of the probability of observing a vote given that the senator agrees with the party line (δ1) and of the probability of observing a vote given that the senator disagrees with the party line (δ2). We estimate the probability that a campaigning senator will fly back to Washington to register a vote given that he or she agrees with the party's position as 0.57 (IQR 0.55:0.60). Our estimate for the probability of casting a vote conditional on disagreement is 0.32 ( IQR 0.29:0.36).26"
"44","We have sought to shed light on the issue of item nonresponse in roll‐call data analyses and to understand the consequences of turning a blind eye to certain patterns of missingness in roll‐call votes. After providing data that demonstrate that many legislatures suffer from significant levels of nonresponse, we explored this issue in the context of the Bayesian IRT model commonly used to analyze roll‐call data. We also showed how easy it is to extend the Bayesian IRT specification to model certain nonignorable abstention mechanisms; the flexibility of the Bayesian IRT model is indeed one of its greatest strengths (Jackman and Clinton 2009). In this regard, we derived complete‐data likelihood functions for processes of nonignorable nonresponse—competing principals and, in the supporting information, a mechanism of indifference—that start from microfoundations in the spatial theory of voting. Processes similar to the ones we portrayed are in fact commonly invoked as causes of nonresponse in roll‐call votes. These models can therefore be used as building blocks in the analysis of actual legislatures, and the code we provide can alleviate some of the costs of setting up more complicated models.         "
"45","We conclude that, when abstentions are nonignorable and the mechanism that produces them can be approximated well, complete‐data models at a minimum match the statistical inferences arrived at in observed‐data models, and at best improve markedly on these inferences. Not surprisingly, larger improvements occur in simulated legislatures with relatively high levels of nonresponse. Roll‐call matrices with substantial fractions of missing data are, unfortunately, very common around the world. In legislatures with high overall levels of nonresponse, inferences about ideal points and other quantities of interest may be affected by even modest systematic association between the decision to vote in a certain way (aye or nay) and the decision to vote at all (observed or unobserved). In contrast, legislatures with relatively low levels of nonresponse can still be fruitfully analyzed with observed‐data models that assume random missingness; in these legislatures, nonignorability would have to be extreme to induce even small biases in estimated ideal points (Ma, Troxel, and Heitjan 2006). The inferential purchase concerning ideal points that we obtained in the complete‐data models for simulated legislatures was insubstantial at low rates of missingness (5%).         "
"46","We also note that deciding empirically between missing not at random (MNAR) and MAR models by considering their fit to observed data is impossible (Molenberghs, Beunckens, and Sotto 2008). This last statement needs to be tempered: As the example of Senator Kerry's degree of liberalism in the 107th Senate or of Romania's voting record in the 1970 UN General Assembly underscores, low overall rates of abstention can be extremely deceptive. Though most senators exhibit a full voting record in the subset of bills considered by the National Journal to trace senators' ideological positions, the many missed votes of Senator Kerry not only increase uncertainty about his ideological profile, but also seriously bias whatever inferences one can make regarding his positions on the liberal‐conservative dimension. We thus conclude that in assessing the usefulness of modeling nonresponse, one needs to consider not only the overall rate of abstention, but also whether a handful of legislators exhibit high rates of nonresponse in legislatures otherwise characterized by overall low rates of nonresponse.         "
"47","Finally, we are persuaded that it is not possible to develop one‐size‐fits‐all models to deal with nonignorable nonresponse in roll‐call data. In fact, the naive use of the models that we develop in this article (either competing principals or indifference) in contexts where it is unlikely that such mechanisms are at play may lead to drastically incorrect inferences. Thus, applying the competing principals complete‐data model to a setting where legislators do not in fact face multiple principals may lead to estimates of ideal points that are more biased than estimates of a model that assumes ignorability.27 These models are not meant to be borrowed off‐the‐shelf; they are merely tools that can be redeveloped in different directions to test theories about potential patterns of strategic abstention. Moreover, assumptions about the degree of ignorability of missing patterns cannot be empirically corroborated, nor is it yet possible to rely on traditional estimates of model fit (DIC or Bayes factors) to assess model fit in data sets with large missingness. Still, we encourage scholars to think actively and carefully about potential processes that might generate strategic absences and abstentions in the legislatures they study. Before reaching conclusions about the ideological profiles of legislators, it is important to gauge the sensitivity of different legislator‐specific parameters (i.e., ideal points) to nonignorable abstention‐generating mechanisms deemed relevant in the legislature at hand. Detailed knowledge of the inner workings of these legislatures should be explicitly used as a priori information in setting up these models. Yet, because neither assumptions nor model fit can be assessed empirically, inferences based on complete‐data models should always be compared against the rather robust IRT model based on the assumption of ignorability of nonresponse.         "
"48","We are also aware of the many obstacles that remain in the analysis of nonresponse in actual legislatures. On a pessimistic note, we see that several nonresponse processes could be at play for different votes in any one legislative session, but also that the dynamics we alluded to in the introduction—misrepresentation of actual preferences, logrolling, homogeneous vote choice induced by party discipline—could have an effect both on patterns of nonresponse and on patterns of vote choice. The flip side of this view, though, is that abstentions and absences themselves may be among the empirical implications of theoretical accounts of logrolling or party discipline; beyond and above vote choices, patterns of nonresponse can be fruitfully studied for clues about such phenomena."
