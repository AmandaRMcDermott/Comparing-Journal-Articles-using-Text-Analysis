"1","Despite the well‐documented resurgence of congressional political parties (Aldrich 1995; Heberlig and Larson 2012; Herrnson 1988), contemporary research addressing congressional election outcomes offers little to say about the impact of party organizations, or any coordinated political efforts beyond individual campaigns (see, e.g., Jones 2010; Lazarus 2008; Woon and Pope 2008). Of course, partisanship (e.g., of candidates, districts, the presidency, and Congress) plays an essential role in every account explaining outcomes in congressional elections (Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Jacobson 1989; Woon and Pope 2008). This dichotomy—the prevalence of partisanship and the absence of party organization—fits well with the politician‐centered understanding of parties. That is, parties arise in response to the needs of policy makers, mainly legislators serving in the same body, to coordinate policy agendas in order to win individual gains through mutual support (Aldrich 1995). Thus, according to the dominant theoretical understanding, parties are organizations born out of service to legislators, with the central organizational focus being the top‐down enforcement by the party leadership of adherence to a unified policy agenda (Cox and McCubbins 1993).         "
"2","The theory of the party as a coalition of policy demanders, which we equate with EPN theory (Bawn et al. 2012; Cohen et al. 2008; Grossman and Dominguez 2009; Koger, Masket, and Noel 2009), holds that parties arise from the benefits that organized interests realize from aggregating agendas and coordinating resources in pursuit of electoral and policy goals.1 Specialized interests that are relatively rich in resources (i.e., money, large memberships, or expertise) typically have very narrow policy objectives (e.g., support entitlement programs for retirees, zone more offshore space for oil drilling, oppose gay marriage). Substantial resources would be wasted if organized interests pursued separate candidates corresponding to each individual group's agenda. This logic was expressed by Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, in a recent statement on the need for labor unions to align with other supportive interests (e.g., the NAACP; Trottman 2013): “Labor can't do it alone. Our density dictates that we've got to have partners.” To avoid this waste, policy demanders in pursuit of separate agendas that are compatible, or at least not contradictory, agree to pool resources in support of candidates who will represent overlapping agendas. This combination of agendas becomes the party platform, and the separate interest communities become the coordinated base of support and activism for the party.         "
"3","An archetypal example of the loose connections that form among issue‐oriented groups in partisan interest networks is provided by the U.S. Senate election contribution activities of three PACs in the 2012 cycle: the Gun Owners of America (Gun PAC), the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (Oil PAC), and the Republican National Coalition for Life (Abortion PAC). These three groups are firmly aligned with central issues in the Republican Party's policy platform, but they span the economic and cultural issue dimensions.2 The Gun PAC contributed to 11 Senate candidates in 2012. The candidate to whom they contributed the most was Ted Cruz (R‐TX). Ted Cruz was the second largest recipient of contributions from the Oil PAC, which contributed the most to Lisa Murkowski (R‐AK). The Abortion PAC supported eight Senate candidates, five of whom were also supported by the Gun PAC. In this example, the Gun PAC is directly connected to both the Oil PAC and the Abortion PAC, which are indirectly connected through the Gun PAC. The Abortion PAC indirectly helped the Oil PAC by freeing up resources for the Gun PAC to invest in Ted Cruz, which in turn helped the Oil PAC spread resources to Lisa Murkowski and other potential supporters of pipeline construction. This example highlights the loose network of cross‐supports that emerges from decentralized and overlapping backing of candidates for Congress.         "
"4","A common collective action motivation underlies party formation in both the candidate‐centered and EPN theories of parties. That is, parties arise because there are several political actors in pursuit of narrow policy objectives, who will rarely achieve success if they go it alone. The party forms as a collective action solution in which each actor achieves more than would be possible in solitary pursuit, in exchange for supporting the goals of other party members. Despite pursuing somewhat disconnected policies, political actors choose to create a long coalition that strives to stay together across time to increase the likelihood that each will achieve their particular goals. The two theories diverge when it comes to (1) the actors who require a collective action solution and (2) who benefits from party activity. In the candidate‐centered theory, policy makers form a coalition (i.e., party) in order to achieve policy objectives that appeal directly to their constituents and therefore secure reelection (Aldrich 1995). In the EPN theory, active special interests benefit from coordinating and standing behind candidates in the form of a party, and thus they secure benefits for their group members by electing politicians loyal to the integrated party platform (Bawn et al. 2012).         "
"5","Previous literature on challenger success has focused largely on whether a candidate has held elective office. Politically experienced challengers more frequently self‐select into races in which they will serve as an appealing alternative to the incumbent (Carson et al. 2012; Lazarus 2008). The literature clearly demonstrates the role of candidate self‐perception in choosing to run (e.g., Maisel and Stone 1997). We build upon this work with theory regarding the impact of organized interest perception and mobilization in the context of the EPN.         "
"6","The main challenge in achieving successful coordination among groups in the EPN is the identification of candidates for office who (1) have strong electoral prospects and (2) will deliver on the shared party agenda (Bawn et al. 2012). Bawn et al. (2012) highlight that the parties cannot simply commit resources to candidates in the hopes of convincing them to adhere to a party platform, since there is a principal‐agent problem in which the party's constituent groups cannot effectively monitor legislators. This is why the party network needs to focus its energies on bolstering the prospects of candidates who would enter office with a priori credible and agreeable policy stances (Cohen et al. 2008). From this characterization of EPN activity, we deduce that EPN support sends a strong signal regarding a candidate's interest in and capacity to deliver on the party agenda. Because different communities of interests (e.g., gun control advocates and environmentalist groups) converge on shared, compromise candidates, the credibility signals afforded by group support are concentrated on single candidates. This helps challengers overcome the hurdle (Bernhardt and Ingberman 1985) of convincing a broader, nationally focused partisan constituency that they will take appealing policy stances once in office.         "
"7","The first boost to the candidacy will come from the reputations of these groups. The fact that a coalition converges on a candidate sends a strong signal to attentive voters. These voters may have ties with such groups and comprise a significant portion of the electorate, particularly in primaries and low‐turnout general elections. Research shows that issue groups often contact members directly to endorse favored candidates, and many broadcast their preferences to the wider public. Such issue‐based advocacy or endorsements serve as important heuristics to attentive voters (Lau and Redlawsk 2001) and may even help low‐information voters make decisions (Lupia 1994), particularly when interest groups provide contextual information in campaigns to help voters understand the ideological or partisan implications of group support (Arceneaux and Kolodny 2009).         "
"8","The potency of the signal sent by EPN support for a candidate lies in the power of multiple consistent signals to discriminate the underlying preferences of a candidate. Since the ideology of interest groups can be inferred based on the candidates they support (Bonica 2013), when many like‐minded groups in a policy domain back a candidate (e.g., Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, and National Resources Defense Council support the same candidate), this provides multiplicative certainty in a candidate's policy preferences. Suppose there is some probability p that a group interested in supporting a candidate with position α—a component of the party agenda—supports a candidate who actually does not prefer position α, and a probability q > p that a group supports a candidate who actually does prefer position α. Let there be N groups that prefer α, and k of them support the candidate. As k increases, the probability that the supported candidate prefers position α also increases.3 Specifically, applying Bayes’ rule, P(α|k) = P(k|α)π(α)/(P(k|α)π(α) + P(k|not α)(1 – π(α))), where P(k|α) and P(k|not α) are the binomial distributions parameterized with q and p, respectively. The terms π(α) and π(not α) represent prior beliefs regarding the prevalence of candidates who prefer position α. Thus, the number of like‐minded groups supporting a candidate plays a key role in discerning a candidate's underlying preferences. Figure 1 illustrates this relationship for a hypothetical situation in which N = 10. For each additional like‐minded group that contributes to a candidate, the probability of that candidate's preferences aligning with the policies preferred by those groups (i.e., α) increases by between 5 and 50%, depending upon the number of groups already supporting the candidate and the inherent accuracy of an individual group in vetting the policy positions of a candidate. In this way, support by a coherent community of interests sends a clear policy signal about a candidate. This signal goes beyond the resource and reputational effects of any one group.         "
"9","Posterior Probability That a Candidate Prefers α Given the Number of Groups Preferring α That Contribute to the Candidate"
"10","Note: To parameterize these curves, the prior probability that a candidate prefers α is set at 0.5. The probability that a group supports a candidate given that the candidate prefers α (i.e., q) is set at an equal‐spaced sequence of 20 values between 0.55 and 0.99, with darker lines representing higher q. Given q, p is set to 1 – q.                     "
"11","Complementary to this dynamic is the formation of a broader and looser connection of not necessarily like‐minded communities, which converges around a single candidate who satisfies the multiple interests of the partisan coalition without offending any particular group. By integrating a coalition of interest communities, the EPN draws together the support of otherwise disconnected constituencies, raising the scale of candidate backing from the interest community to the political party."
"12","The second class of benefits that arise from EPN integration derives from intentional coordination among interests. Interest groups provide electoral resources—beyond campaign contributions and group endorsements—in coordination with other groups in the coalition that boost candidate prospects (Herrnson 2011; Herrnson, Deering, and Wilcox 2012). These include collective efforts to mobilize voters (Magleby 2010), air campaign ads attacking the opposing candidate (Franz 2010), and offer timely expertise on campaign matters (De Witt 1980; Herrnson 2011).         "
"13","We are not arguing that EPN support is all that drives electoral outcomes—many voters will directly evaluate candidates and make their own decisions. However, as Bawn et al. (2012, 57) note, “Some voters who care nothing about the interests of the various groups are nonetheless attracted to their parties because of the ‘values,’ such as social order or equality, that they perceive in their program.” EPN support signals that a challenger credibly represents the party's platform or significant components thereof and is likely to deliver on those policy preferences if elected. Candidates backed by the EPN have strong credentials on one or more elements of the party platform and will “give offense to no one [in the party]” (Cohen et al. 2008, 83). With this imprimatur, the chosen candidate is the beneficiary of the reputation, resources, and expertise of members of the long coalition. Given low attentiveness of many voters and the first‐past‐the‐post rules of American elections, the signaling and (noncontribution) resources of such coalitions will affect electoral outcomes, beyond candidate spending.         "
"14","We focus on the electoral predictions regarding EPN integration of challengers. Since incumbency offers access to party and other resources, we do not attempt to differentiate between EPN support and the incumbency advantage (Abramowitz, Alexander, and Gunning 2006; Fenno 1978; Levitt and Wolfram 1997; Mayhew 1974). Rather, we study challengers and consider whether the conception and analysis of extended party networks can build upon our understanding of challenger success.         "
"15","There are two fundamental tasks before us in our empirical analysis: (1) measurement of whether a challenger is integrated into a partisan network of organized supporters and (2) estimation of the effect of EPN support on electoral outcomes. In the analysis that follows, we show that the network analytic methodology referred to as community detection (Newman 2006) is very well suited to identifying groups of highly interconnected contributors and candidates. We then show that strong integration into a party network community substantially increases the likelihood of a challenger's success.         "
"16","Data on political action committee (PAC) and formal party committee contributions to all candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and data on all House election outcomes from the 1994–2010 cycles form the bases of our empirical analysis.4 From here on, we include the formal party committees in our broad references to PACs. We also gather data on additional district and candidate attributes up to the 2008 elections.5"
"17","In order to identify candidates backed by EPNs, we seek to operationalize our conceptual understanding of the EPN. As noted above, we understand a party network to be a collection of organized interests that concentrate their support efforts around a core group of candidates. Before detailing our approach to identifying these coalitions of interests, we must define the network that we will analyze. We construct a bipartite network. A bipartite network is one in which there are two “types” of nodes (i.e., actors), and ties can only connect two nodes of different types (i.e., there are no intra‐type ties; Newman 2010). The two types of nodes in the networks we construct are PACs and candidates for the U.S. House. The ties are weighted by the amount contributed up to July 1 of the election year. We measure the network early in the election cycle to minimize the risk that our inferences are driven by PACs giving to sure‐thing challengers.6"
"18","The network degree distributions in the bipartite networks we construct (Newman 2010) are given in Figure 2.7 The plots therein give the empirical cumulative distributions of the total amounts given by each PAC over all candidates, the total amounts received by each candidate over all PACs, the total number of candidates to whom each PAC contributes, and the total number of PACs that contribute to each candidate. Two main stories emerge from these distributions. First, there is stark inequality in the contributions received by incumbents and challengers. Over the entire period, the median amount received by incumbents is approximately 100 times the median amount received by challengers. This is a common finding, and it has led researchers to conclude that successful challengers owe their success to forces outside of systematic organized party support (Herrnson 1995; Jacobson 2009). Second, there is substantial inequality across PACs and candidates. The best‐funded incumbents and challengers receive 10 times their median counterparts, respectively. The most active PACs contribute 100 to 1,000 times as much as their median counterparts. Regarding the second column of Figure 2, it is rare for a challenger to attract a large number of contributors, as the majority of challengers are supported by a handful of PACs. Moreover, most PACs support just a few candidates, indicating that overlap among PACs should be an informative signal.            "
"19","PAC and Candidate Cumulative Degree Distributions, 1994–2010"
"20","Note: Political action committee (PAC) and candidate cumulative degree distributions are shown in terms of total amounts (in dollars) represented by ties and the total number of ties. The darker the line, the more recent the election year. The solid lines depict distributions for incumbents, and the dashed lines depict distributions for challengers. Note that the x‐axis is on the log scale in the amount plots, such that an increment of 1 represents an order of magnitude (i.e., a tenfold) increase.                        "
"21","We can explore the basic bivariate relationship between interest network integration and challenger success through the graphics in Figure 3. The plots depict the structure of the network for three cycles (i.e., 2006, 2008, and 2010). Ties are anchored in the positions assigned to PACs in the node placement algorithm, but in the interest of clarity, PACs are not drawn as nodes in the network. Coloration indicates partisanship and incumbency status. The first column of graphics depicts all candidates, and the second column displays only those who win election.8 Figure 3 provides initial evidence that interest network integration is associated with challenger success. In all three cycles, nearly all of the nonincumbents who are victorious are closer to the core of the network than are nonincumbents who lose. Though compelling visual evidence, this is not sufficient to identify an effect of EPN support. For that, we need to control for other explanations of challenger success and extract an explicit measure of EPN support from the contribution network.            "
"22","Contribution Network Visualizations"
"23","Note: Networks depict PAC nodes (invisible) connected to candidate nodes, which are colored based on party and incumbency status. Coloration differentiates four groups: Democratic incumbents (royal blue), Democratic nonincumbents (light blue), Republican incumbents (red), Republican nonincumbents (orange). Nodes are placed based on the algorithm of Fruchterman and Reingold (1991), with edges weighted by the amount contributed.                        "
"24","In the previous main section and Figure 1, we presented a theoretical claim that when multiple like‐minded groups converge upon a candidate, a clear signal is established regarding the ideological position represented by the candidate. To test this hypothesis, we must (1) empirically identify collections of like‐minded groups and (2) identify the candidates on whom they converge. We draw upon the network analytic method termed community detection to operationalize extended party networks of organized interests and the candidates they support.            "
"25","Community detection is the process of identifying groups of nodes, within which ties occur with greater frequency and intensity than they do across communities (Newman 2006). In our case, we have two node types: PACs and candidates. The only ties in our data are those from PACs to candidates. Thus, community detection within the context of our data constitutes the identification of groups containing both PACs and candidates, within which the PACs give more to the candidates in that group than they do to other candidates, and the candidates in that group receive more from the PACs in that group than they do from other PACs. An illustrative picture of a bipartite network with three communities is given in Figure 4. There are still cross‐community ties, but ties within communities occur with much greater intensity.            "

"27","Note: Brown circles represent one node type and navy squares another (e.g., PACs and candidates). All edges connect one circle and one square. The nodes in each community overlay a circle.                        "
"28","We characterize each PAC as drawing donations for candidates in a given community from its community‐specific Poisson distribution.9 Thus, if there are k communities and m PACs, we infer  Poisson distributions. We permit the number of communities (k) to vary because we expect the network of groups supporting candidates to be characterized by several communities that are densely connected within (i.e., focused on a coherent policy agenda) and loosely connected across (i.e., pursuing alternative aspects of a partisan agenda). The amount contributed from PAC i to candidate j, denoted , is modeled as a mixture of Poisson distributions. A mixture distribution is appropriate because, as central to the party compromise underpinning EPN theory, we expect each candidate will present a platform that appeals to overlapping interest communities. A total of k Poisson rate parameters (λ) are estimated for each PAC, and k community membership probabilities (π) are estimated for each candidate. The rate parameters can be interpreted as the intensity of an interest community's support for a candidate, and the community membership probabilities represent the cross‐community ties offered by candidates. The probability of is thus expressed as               "
"29","In each election cycle, we estimate the model with k from 5 to 50 and select the k that results in the lowest BIC.10 For the purpose of the discrete analyses we perform below, we assign each candidate to the community of which he or she is most likely to be a member. This facilitates the identification of candidates who are not integrated into the EPN. For each election, this results in a partition of the set of the candidates into communities that contain a mixture of candidates and PACs. These memberships and attributes of these communities are used to determine whether candidates are integrated into EPNs.            "
"30","The communities we identify, in four of the election cycles, are illustrated in Figure 5. The regularity that we seek to illuminate with this figure is the community that appears as a nearly flat line in the lower half of each plot. Based on the shape and position of this cluster, it can be seen that (1) the median member is very poorly funded, (2) the majority are nonincumbents, (3) there is little partisan bias to this community, and (4) it is by far the largest community. In truth, this cluster might be better labeled a “noncommunity,” capturing those candidates and contributors who cannot be classified into tight, coherent networks. This is evidenced through the lack of a partisan bias in this community, the large membership, and the paltry level of support. Though it might be possible to derive more nuanced measures of networked support, we see the classification of a candidate into this wide, flat cluster as a clear, simple, and stark indication of a lack of substantial support from any networked community of interests. In our empirical analysis going forward, we classify a challenger as having EPN support if he or she is not assigned to the largest and most weakly funded community (i.e., not in the wide, flat cluster). In the supporting information, we show that this wide and flat cluster appears in each cycle. The other clusters reflect communities arising from highly dense PAC‐candidate linkages. And most importantly, the communities with a large nonincumbent membership are highly partisan.            "
"31","Community Visualizations"
"32","Note: Each diamond corresponds to a community. Height is proportional to median contributions to a candidate in the community, and width is proportional to the number of candidates in the community. Axes depict the partisanship and incumbency characteristics of the candidates in the community.                        "
"33","We have proposed community detection as an approach to identifying the integration of candidates into the EPNs. We have yet to show that the communities into which challengers are integrated are, indeed, partisan. It is conceivable, for instance, that bipartisan communities exist with “pro‐business” challengers from both parties who receive support from business interests. However, Figure 6 clearly illustrates that, insofar as these communities of PACs are supporting challengers, they are doing so on a partisan basis. We plot the aggregate partisanship of candidates in each community against the percent of community members who are incumbents. Over all election cycles, nearly every community that contains any nonincumbents is decidedly partisan. Over the nine election cycles, only a few small communities emerge that are less than 90% in one party and contain any nonincumbents. This supports our claim that the community detection algorithm reliably locates challengers in partisan networks of interest groups.            "

"36","Another concern we want to directly address empirically is the possibility that we are measuring instances in which groups are piling on to challengers with a high likelihood of success in a last‐minute effort to gain access. Though we can never perfectly discern a group's motives, we can assess the aggregate dynamics in the campaign under the assumption that the likelihood of challenger success will be revealed as the campaign progresses. Figure 7 depicts the rate of change in the networked challenger classification throughout the election year. This is the percentage of challengers for whom their networked challenger status is not the same as it was in the previous month, where challenger status is 0 or 1 depending on EPN support classification. The final spike in change, which is the last‐minute shuffle toward challengers winning the race, occurs at some point between August and November. This is why we measure network integration on July 1.            "

"39","We utilize two separate analytical approaches, applied to two related but distinct data sets, to separate out the effect of EPN integration from other known predictors of success in U.S. House elections. Our first analysis utilizes the matching framework to examine whether we see the effects of EPN integration when we compare races in which the EPN‐ and non‐EPN‐integrated challengers are approximately the same on variables known to be strong predictors of success in U.S. House races. The second analysis constitutes a replication and extension of a regression model of partisan vote margins presented by Woon and Pope (2008). Both analyses support the hypothesis that EPN integration contributes to the success of challengers in U.S. House elections.            "
"40","Matching is an alternative or complementary methodology for taking account of the effects of potential confounding variables. The purpose of matching is to derive balanced treatment and control groups (Sekhon 2011; i.e., the treatment).11 When treatment and control groups are balanced, they are comparable on all potential confounding variables. Using the integration of a challenger into a party network community as the treatment, we identify treatment and control groups that differ only trivially on variables that have been found to predict congressional election outcomes. We use a mixture of exact and carefully tuned coarsened exact one‐to‐one matching (Iacus, King, and Porro 2012). In exact matching, the control case selected for each treated case must have exactly the same values on potential confounding variables as the treated case. Coarsened exact matching (CEM) is a process by which matches for each treated case are selected to be within rounding error (i.e., within a bin) of the treated case.               "
"41","The unit of analysis is the race, and the data span the 1994 to 2008 election cycles. We exactly match treatment and control cases on election cycle, incumbent party, and political experience.12 Matching on these variables controls for the macropolitical context and the traditional measure of challenger quality, respectively. Coarsened exact matching is used to match races based on incumbent vote share in the prior election, challenger spending, and incumbent spending. These variables account for the conventional measures of the competitiveness of the district and resources, respectively. We start with a bin size of one standard deviation in each variable and iteratively reduce the bin size used for the CEM by incrementing the denominator of the standard deviation (i.e., se/1, se/2, . . ., se/k) until hypothesis tests applied to the noncoarsened treatment and control group values indicate that there is no significant difference between treatment and control groups. Table 1 shows that our treatment and control groups are well balanced, in that there are no statistically significant differences between treatment and control observations in the quantitative variables.               "
"42","Figure 8 gives our estimates of treatment effects. We estimate the overall average treatment effect (ATE), the ATE among control units (ATC), and the ATE among the treated units (ATT; Morgan and Winship 2007).13 The ATT and ATC constitute estimates of how much the party network integration increased the probability of victory among the treated units and how much it would have increased the probability of victory among the control units, respectively. The ATE constitutes an estimate of the difference in the rate of victory between treated and control units, discarding units that are not comparable along the control measures. The ATC is noticeably larger than ATE and ATT, which indicates the need for our matching approach in estimating ATE—the main effect of interest. If treatment were truly unrelated to the confounding variables, then in expectation ATE = ATT = ATC (Konisky and Reenock 2012). Focusing on ATE, we find that party network integration increases the chance of challenger success by approximately 12 percentage points, an effect that is statistically significant at the 0.05 level (two‐tailed). This effect is substantively significant considering that a challenger's naïve chance of success is, in nearly every election cycle, below 10% (Friedman and Holden 2009).14"
"43","Effects of Interest Community Integration on the Probability of Challenger Victory in U.S. House Elections, 1994–2008"
"44","Note: Our matching procedure for estimating ATT, ATE, and ATC results in matched samples of sizes 21, 26, and 22 (i.e., 42, 52, and 44 observations), respectively.                           "
"45","Regression models constitute the predominant approach to studying the factors that influence congressional election results (see, e.g., Abramowitz, Alexander, and Gunning 2006; Alexander 2005; Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Carson et al. 2012; Jones 2010; Woon and Pope 2008). In this section, we extend a regression model from Woon and Pope (2008), in which the dependent variable is the vote share won by the Democratic Party candidate in U.S. House elections, to include an indicator that measures whether there is an EPN‐supported challenger in the race. There are two primary benefits of combining regression‐ and matching‐based inference. First, we can assess whether our conclusion about the effect of EPN support is dependent upon the use of matching. Second, we are able to incorporate many more potential confounding variables in a regression model than can be accommodated in the matching analysis.               "
"46","Woon and Pope (WP; 2008) examine the relationship between the aggregate ideological characteristics of political parties regarding the behavior of partisans in Congress and the results of individual House elections. Broadly speaking, they argue that party labels serve a branding function for candidates in congressional elections, and that the behavior of party members in Congress determines ideological information communicated by the party brands. In order to evaluate the empirical accuracy of their theory, WP study U.S. House election outcomes between 1952 and 2000. They estimate a series of hierarchical regression models in which the dependent variable is the vote share of the Democratic candidate in a district. They draw upon the literature to include several control variables and specify a number of additional independent variables that operationalize concepts derived from their theory of party branding. The variables included in their models are described in Table 2. The interested reader should see the original article for in‐depth discussion regarding hypotheses related to these variables.               "
"47","Our data on campaign finance networks overlap with WP's data in the election years between 1990 and 2000. We utilize the subset of WP's data that falls within this range, which includes 1,939 races in total.15 The model includes election‐level random effects, which are estimated by feasible generalized least squares.16 To test the effect of EPN support, we include two additional independent variables—Networked Rep. Challenger and Networked Dem. Challenger—which are indicators of whether there is a Republican challenger in the race with EPN support and whether there is a Democratic challenger in the race with EPN support, respectively. We expect that having an EPN‐supported Republican challenger in the race will reduce Democratic vote share and that having an EPN‐supported Democratic challenger in the race will increase Democratic vote share. In one of the models, we also include a set of election year and party‐specific PAC dummies that indicate the support of highly influential PACs. We do this to account for the benefits of individual group support that go beyond campaign contributions.17 The results are given in Table 3.               "
"48","The results provide strong support for our hypothesis that EPN integration improves the electoral prospects of challengers. The presence of a challenger in the race with networked support statistically significantly reduces the expected incumbent vote share by approximately 8 percentage points, an effect that is nearly identical for Republican and Democratic challengers. To put the magnitude of this effect in perspective, the conventional measure of challenger quality—the indicator of whether a challenger has held elective office—results in a 2–4 percentage point reduction in the expected incumbent vote share. This analysis illustrates that our result is robust to the choice between matching and regression to draw inferences. Despite the fact that the sample size is only 20% of that appearing in the original study, except for the South regional indicator, the effects of all of the variables are statistically significant and in the same direction as in the original study.

"49","We demonstrate that the EPN is active and appears influential in congressional elections. In support of previous theoretical work about the role of interest groups as policy demanders that shape the party, our analysis provides evidence of coordinated efforts by contingents of the EPN to support and elect challengers of their choice. In contrast to previous analyses that focused on relationships among PACs (Dreiling and Darves 2011; Grossman and Dominguez 2009), our community detection algorithm was able to isolate unique subsets of PACs that converged on distinctive subsets of challengers to finance their elections with contributions and independent expenditures. We also provide evidence—the first of its kind with a large sample of elections—that such backing elevates the chances of electoral success for selected challengers.         "
"50","It is instructive to unpack the groups that comprise the communities that we use to classify candidates as being integrated into the EPN. If these communities are thought to represent EPNs, then their top supporters (1) should be clearly on the same side of the partisan divide and (2) represent a diverse mix of specific interests. Table 4 lists the top 10 contributors to the communities that supported the most challengers (i.e., the greatest number of challengers were classified into their ranks by the community detection), broken down by the partisanship of candidates in the communities for election years 2004–2010. On the Democratic side, we observe that the formal party organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), sits atop the list each year. Right below the DCCC are interest groups that are often associated strongly with the Democratic Party coalition (Grossman 2012), including labor unions, trial lawyers associations, environmental groups, and women's organizations. On the Republican side, we observe antitax organizations, the National Rifle Association, pro‐life groups, and trade associations. In support of EPN theory, our study shows that these partisan and ideological groups coordinate their efforts to support targeted candidates in ways that potentially shape the outcome of the race.         "
"51","Previous accounts document two primary ways that partisan groups coordinate efforts: those driven by formal party committees and those that arise through loosely affiliated ideological groups. First, the formal party committees like the DCCC and National Republican Congressional Committee “orchestrate” partisan strategy with PACs (O'Connor 2012), some of which have leaders sitting on advisory boards of the party committee (Kolodny and Dwyre 1998). On the Republican side, party leaders with strong policy preferences have created new organizations dedicated to recruiting like‐minded challengers, providing them with seed money, and encouraging interest groups to support them (Peters 1999). A recent example is the “Young Guns” PAC started in 2007 by Republican Party leaders Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan, and Kevin McCarthy to recruit and support conservative candidates for Congress (Burns 2010). A second coordinating strategy involves meetings among interest groups to devise common campaign strategies. Campaign finance law prevents the party committees from coordinating with interest groups that use soft money. For this reason, partisans form umbrella organizations that help coordinate in the absence of a formal party organization. In 2004, Democratic partisans used “America Coming Together” to convene meetings of labor, environmental, and women's groups to coordinate voter mobilization efforts (Skinner 2005). In the 2012 elections, a diverse collection of conservative organizations took its lead from a prominent group called American Crossroads with the broad electoral goal of helping the Republican Party take full control of Congress (Confessore 2011). These coordination efforts have been documented in previous elections (Magleby, Monson, and Patterson 2007).         "
"52","These developments in congressional campaign activity provide evidence that the kind of coordination and signaling among partisan elites in selecting presidential candidates described by Cohen et al. (2008) also takes place in legislative elections. EPN theory portrays the party as a conglomerate of nonconflicting and cooperating interests who select and support candidates they can trust to pursue the policy objectives of the party. This implies that the integration of a candidate into the EPN is a signal that they are credible and appealing on partisan policies. Such signaling should pay electoral dividends with a broader constituency of partisans. Moreover, the presence of a community of like‐minded PAC contributors may imply a broader electoral effort by the coalition to campaign collectively for the candidate through direct mobilization of voters and campaign advertising. Similar to presidential elections (Cohen et al. 2008), participants in the EPN have discovered ways to coordinate, but across the many candidates and campaigns that constitute congressional elections.         "
"53","We addressed two basic questions. First, who—in terms of both supporters and candidates—constitutes the political party via the extended party network, and second, how are electoral outcomes shaped by the dynamics of EPN support? We built upon emerging theories about the organizational form of political parties and exploited a new algorithm of community detection to reveal unique patterns of behavior among different groups that embody the conceptual definition of an EPN. Our study confirms prior accounts regarding the existence of partisan networks, but it moves beyond prior work in two ways. First, we integrate both interest groups and candidates into communities using a bipartite network representation. This method enables us to identify the core of the party network and illustrate the tight links between party resources and selected candidates in advancing electoral goals. Second, we demonstrate the stark difference in electoral prospects for challengers within and outside the EPN. Challengers supported by densely interconnected partisan communities have a greater likelihood of winning compared to those with similar campaign resources and political backgrounds, but without EPN backing."
"54","We posit two related mechanisms that account for the improved success among EPN‐supported challengers. First, a key challenge for nonincumbents is to surmount the ambiguity that surrounds their candidacy. Given that candidate emergence in congressional elections tends to be highly entrepreneurial (Fowler and McClure 1989; Herrnson 2011), candidates must win an uphill battle to present themselves in an ideologically clear and compelling manner. When a challenger is backed by a collection of like‐minded interest groups, a clear signal regarding the policy positions represented by the challenger is sent to the broader party network and attentive members of the electorate. Second, many of these partisan networks arise from and engage in intentionally coordinated actions in support of candidates. We assume that EPN‐supported candidates benefit from these coordinated support efforts. The relative magnitude of these two mechanisms needs to be explored in future research, but it is clear that EPN support plays a major role in accounting for challenger success in congressional elections.         "
"55","The empirical findings from this analysis have important implications for theories about contemporary parties. By observing a unique set of groups that coordinate actions to help targeted challengers, we have revealed exactly the kind of electoral activity that scholars attribute to strong parties (see, e.g., Schattschneider 1942). The patterns we find suggest that parties comprise contending policy demanders in the electoral process (Bawn et al. 2012). Our findings also present a challenge to theories positing that officeholders in the legislature shape the party to advance their electoral and policy goals (Aldrich 1995; Cox and McCubbins 1993). If interest groups with strong policy agendas shape who wins office, then officeholders might have far less discretion about the direction of party policy than previously theorized (Masket 2009). Our findings also speak to why candidates often fail to move toward the median voter and instead take greater policy risks by adopting more extreme positions (Fiorina, Abrams, and Pope 2005). An approach that draws on networked theories of parties helps explain why party elites are converging on an ideological point that is more extreme than voters’ positions (Fiorina, Abrams, and Pope 2005).
