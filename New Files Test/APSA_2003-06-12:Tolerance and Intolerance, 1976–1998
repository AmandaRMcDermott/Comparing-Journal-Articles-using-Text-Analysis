"1","Since 1976, the GSS has included a modified, or balanced, rendition of the Stouffer tolerance battery. Unlike the original Stouffer items, which focused exclusively on actors on the political left (Communists, socialists, and atheists), the modified battery asks about an array of ideologically diverse groups: racists, militarists, atheists, homosexuals, and Communists. Respondents are asked three dichotomous items per group. The questions address whether members of the target groups should be permitted to deliver public speeches, have books that they write be available in the public library, and teach in colleges and universities. In past discussions of these data analysts have claimed that the three acts involve fundamental civil liberties (e.g., Bobo and Licari 1989; Cigler and Joslyn 2002).6 Researchers typically have summed responses to these items, yielding a 0–15 scale (e.g., Nie, Junn, and Stehlik‐Barry 1996).6 We begin our analysis using such a scale, with high values representing greater intolerance.6"
"2","Were the modified Stouffer battery a valid indicator of tolerance, assessment of trends in tolerance would be straightforward. Simple review of the data for each available year would reveal whether levels of tolerance have changed. Nie and his coauthors (1996) discuss the GSS data for the period 1976 to 1994 and conclude that a substantial increase in tolerance has occurred. The extended series, with data through 1998, is depicted in Figure 1. Two aspects of the data warrant discussion. First, there appears to be a clear trend toward increasing tolerance. GSS respondents expressed intolerant views on an average of 7.24 of the 15 items in 1977, the second year the modified battery was used, but intolerance dropped to 5.28 out of 15 by 1998, a decrease of over 27%.6 This stark change rivals in magnitude the movement in tolerance that purportedly took place from the 1950s to the 1970s (Nunn, Crockett, and Williams 1978). Second, in all years Americans seem to be more tolerant than intolerant. The GSS battery offers respondents 15 opportunities to express intolerance, but these data indicate that respondents chose tolerance over half of the time in every year in the series.         "
"3","                 The 0–15 GSS Modified Stouffer Tolerance Battery, 1976–1998 (high scores represent intolerance)                     "
"4","Unfortunately, analysis of trends in tolerance is not so easily accomplished. Reduced to its essentials, the objection raised by Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982) to the original Stouffer battery was two‐fold: respondents almost certainly differ in terms of how many of the target groups they dislike, and, in the aggregate, affect toward the target groups may change over time. Variants of these same points apply to the modified Stouffer battery. Sullivan and his colleagues argue that tolerance presupposes that the individual dislikes the group or groups in question. Using the 0–15 GSS scale, we have no means to determine how often this prerequisite has been met. For example, respondents may receive scores of nine because they dislike three of the GSS groups and they are fully intolerant toward them, or because they dislike four of five of the groups but are willing to extend limited political rights to those groups.         "
"5","More troubling for present purposes is the possibility of changing affect toward the GSS target groups. Sullivan et al. argued that this is precisely what took place between the 1950s and the 1970s with respect to atheists, socialists, and Communists. The increase in tolerance was an illusion because antipathy toward these target groups decreased, and the change in feelings toward these specific groups was mistaken for movement in tolerance. Unfortunately, there is no way to rule out a similar phenomenon with the modified Stouffer battery. Suppose, for example, that respondents in 1977 disliked an average of three of the five GSS groups. In this scenario, the typical respondent had nine opportunities to be intolerant, or three per disliked group. This would mean that these respondents expressed intolerance 80% of the time (7.24/9 = 0.80). Now suppose that in 1998 respondents disliked an average of only two of the GSS groups. In this scenario, intolerance would be greater in 1998 than in 1977 (in 1998, 5.28/6 = 0.88), but systematic change in group affect would create the illusion that intolerance has diminished.         "
"6","Evidence that changes in group affect influence the apparent trend depicted in Figure 1 emerges when we break the 15 GSS items down by the five target groups referenced in those questions. If the trend portrayed in Figure 1 represents a true change in tolerance, then we should observe little variance when comparing the longitudinal data for the five GSS target groups. However, if the observed trend instead represents changing feelings toward one or more of the GSS groups, then we should see different longitudinal patterns when the data are disaggregated. Figure 2 depicts data for two GSS target groups, racists, and homosexuals. The patterns differ starkly. Intolerance toward homosexuals decreased by 44% from 1976 to 1998, but intolerance toward racists is quite steady during this period, decreasing by less than 9%.6 Intolerance toward each of the other three GSS groups—atheists, communists, and militarists—decreased by approximately 28% in this same period. These data suggest that the trend depicted in Figure 1 likely is not wholly the consequence of a general increase in tolerance, but instead is at least partly the result of changes in group‐specific attitudes.         "
"7","                 Intolerance Toward Racists and Homosexuals, 1976 to 1998                      "
"8","Our claim is not that changes in group affect account for the entire trend observed in Figure 1, but rather that the GSS data provide no definitive means to rule out a role for group affect. As a result, it is simply not possible to speak confidently about trends in tolerance using the 0–15 scale.6 But this does not mean that the GSS data necessarily should be abandoned. The easiest treatment of the GSS data involves summing responses to the 15 tolerance items, but little in the way of theory justifies this approach. It is our contention that a more theoretically appropriate indicator of tolerance can be devised from the GSS data and that this indicator offers a functional means to assess longitudinal variance in tolerance. Demonstration of these points requires discussion of the meaning of tolerance and intolerance.         "
"9","GSS data reveal what appears to be a substantial decrease in intolerance over the period 1976–1998, but application of the logic outlined by Sullivan and his colleagues raises serious doubts regarding whether this decrease reflects a true change in tolerance. The dearth of more appropriate longitudinal data means that if we are to divine any insight regarding trends in tolerance, we must somehow make use of the GSS data, their warts and blemishes notwithstanding. But this does not mean that the only available course of action entails assessment of the conventional GSS 15‐point tolerance index. We believe that an alternate treatment of the GSS data provides a more valid indicator of levels of tolerance. To demonstrate this point, it is necessary to reexamine both the meaning of tolerance and intolerance and what it is that the GSS items actually measure."
"10","Although the content‐controlled procedure developed by Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982) brought dramatic change to the study of political tolerance, these same authors' contributions at the theoretical level are equally important. Sullivan and his coauthors approach tolerance from several theoretical perspectives and carefully assess the role of tolerance from various conceptions of democracy. For present purposes, however, what is most important is the meaning of tolerance itself. Sullivan et al. argue that tolerance “implies a commitment to the ‘rules of the game’ and a willingness to apply them equally” (1982, 2). “Political tolerance exists when respondents allow the full legal rights of citizenship to groups they themselves dislike” (1982, 76).         "
"11","Many analysts have raised objections to Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus's measurement procedure, but far fewer disagree with their conception of tolerance. For instance, Nie, Junn, and Stehlik‐Barry (1996) reject Sullivan et al.'s content‐controlled approach in favor of the 0–15 GSS battery, yet their definition of tolerance is nearly identical to the one presented by Sullivan and his coauthors. Specifically, Nie et al. write that “Tolerance is the belief that all citizens have the right to express their political views, regardless of how dangerous or repugnant those views may be…. (T)olerance signals a fundamental commitment to the rules of the democratic game…. (A) high degree of tolerance signifies the recognition of the importance of allowing all in the political community the right to express their views, regardless of the content” (1996, 29).         "
"12","We see three important implications in this view of tolerance. First, Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus are correct that the definitive test of tolerance presupposes that the perceiver dislikes the target group.6 It does not count as tolerance, for instance, if a Communist is willing to extend political rights to fellow Communists. This point places the GSS tolerance battery on uncertain ground. Gibson (1992, 574) captures well both the good news and the bad. The virtue of the GSS scale is that nearly everyone dislikes at least one of the five target groups, which means that nearly every respondent has some opportunity to express tolerance. The problem, as we have seen, is that some respondents may dislike only one or two of the five groups, whereas others may dislike three, four, or even all five.         "
"13","The second implication we see in the Sullivan et al. definition of tolerance is that the question of tolerance versus intolerance is inherently dichotomous, not continuous. This point is critical to our argument. People are tolerant to the extent that they are willing to grant the full rights of citizenship uniformly and without exception. It follows that people are intolerant provided that they advocate any restriction of political acts that are otherwise permissible under law. Put differently, it is the exception that signals intolerance. When respondents answer “no, I do not believe that members of group X should be permitted to engage in act Y,” they have carved out exceptions in the extension of political rights, and thus have identified themselves as being politically intolerant.         "
"14","If we assume for the moment that all respondents dislike at least one of the five GSS groups, then all respondents have some opportunity to carve out an exception, thereby signaling intolerance. Viewed in this manner, what matters for diagnosing whether a person is tolerant is not the respondent's score on the 15‐point GSS tolerance battery, but rather whether the respondent received a score of zero (tolerant) or greater than zero (intolerant). We know that a respondent is intolerant as soon as he or she expresses the desire to restrict political rights.6"
"15","Scores on the conventional GSS scale range from 0 to 15, yet we have argued that a single point on the scale divides tolerance from intolerance. What does this mean for values between 1 and 15? Surely, as Sniderman et al. (1989) note, it would be unfair to equate an individual who is intolerant toward only one group with a person who espouses intolerance at every opportunity. The third implication we see in the Sullivan et al. definition of tolerance is that levels of intolerance differ in both breadth and depth. Under our conceptualization, all GSS respondents who receive scores greater than zero are intolerant, but their levels of intolerance vary. At least three factors potentially contribute to this variance. First, respondents may differ in the number of groups they tolerate; i.e., in the breadth of intolerance. Consider two respondents, for example, both of whom dislike all five GSS groups. If one is fully intolerant of all five groups, and the other is intolerant of only two of the groups, their respective scores on the GSS battery will be 15 and 6. Second, and similarly, respondents may differ in the number of acts they tolerate; i.e., in the depth of intolerance. One respondent who dislikes atheists may wish to deny atheists all civil liberties, whereas a second respondent may feel that it is acceptable for the atheist to write a book or to deliver a public speech, but not to teach at a college or university.6"
"16","We see obvious importance in levels of intolerance and in efforts to identify factors that lead intolerance to vary in breadth and depth. Unfortunately, the GSS data simply are not well suited to this sort of inquiry. As we noted in the previous section, Sullivan and his colleagues provide the reason. For those GSS respondents who are intolerant, their scores will vary as a function of the breadth and depth of intolerance, but also as a function of a third factor, how many of the five GSS groups they dislike. Respondents who dislike all five GSS groups are afforded greater opportunity to express intolerance than are respondents who dislike only two of the groups. In most years, no data are available to determine conclusively how many of the five groups respondents dislike. As a result, we are left with a scale constructed with a known numerator but an unknown denominator."
"17","To reiterate, our claim is that assessments of tolerance and intolerance logically involve two questions: whether individuals are tolerant or intolerant, and, among the intolerant, whether that intolerance is broad or narrow in scope. Further, GSS data are not appropriate to measure possible variance over time in the breadth and depth of intolerance, but may be adequate to gauge whether the proportion of Americans who are tolerant has changed. The central problem with analyses concerning levels of intolerance is that longitudinal variance may be driven by changing affect toward the five GSS target groups. For example, if 50% of respondents are fully intolerant toward all groups they dislike, but they dislike fewer groups in 1998 than in 1976, then longitudinal analysis of GSS data would risk mistaking the change in group affect for a shift in levels of tolerance."
"18","Our empirical objective in this article is to provide what evidence we can regarding whether levels of tolerance have changed over time. However, it is worth noting that the view of the GSS tolerance battery developed here also has consequences for individual‐level inquiries. Both theoretically and empirically, a score of 0 on the GSS battery is qualitatively different from scores between 1 and 15. Respondents who receive scores of 0 are presumed to be tolerant, whereas respondents who receive scores greater than 0 are intolerant. Most empirical studies that make use of the GSS data employ the 0–15 scale as the dependent variable in OLS regression models. One implication of our thesis is that modeling the data in such a manner is inappropriate. A one‐unit shift from a score of 0 to a score of 1 is not comparable to any other one‐unit shift, such as that from a score of 12 to a score of 13. The former marks the difference between tolerance and intolerance; the latter merely signals intolerance that varies slightly in scope."
"19","The claim that 0 scores on the GSS battery are qualitatively unique rests on theory, but one bit of corroborative empirical evidence is provided by the actual raw data. Figure 3 depicts the distribution of responses on the 0–15 battery for the period 1976–1998. Nearly 18% of respondents received scores of 0, a mark nearly triple that of the next‐highest category. This distribution is consistent with our thesis that the 0–15 scale encompasses more than a single unidimensional construct. Hence, whether viewed theoretically or empirically, scores of 0 on the GSS battery do indeed stand out from all other scale values.6"
"20","                 Responses to the GSS Modified Stouffer Tolerance Battery, 1976–1998 (bars indicate the number of acts toward which respondents express intolerance)                        "
"21","Given the unique meaning of 0, how should the GSS data be treated in individual‐level models? The clear implication of the preceding discussion is that conventional single‐equation models are inappropriate because they do not capture the theoretical distinction between tolerance, as represented by scale values of 0, and levels of intolerance, as represented by values between 1 and 15. One alternate would be use of a selection equation, with the initial equation used to model tolerance versus intolerance and the second equation used to model the degree of intolerance. Zero‐inflated techniques offer a second plausible alternate, as these allow the analyst to represent the unique meaning of scale values of 0 on the dependent variable.6 Selection models and zero‐inflated models possess advantages and disadvantages relative to one another, and we will leave it to future discussion to determine if one is superior for analysis of individual‐level GSS tolerance data. For now it is sufficient to note that each approach maps to the theorized underlying structure of the GSS data far better than does a single‐equation OLS model.            "
"22","Returning to the central matter at hand, the question of whether tolerance levels have changed over time, additional discussion is warranted regarding our proposed dichotomous measure. We contend that respondents who receive scores greater than 0 can be labeled conclusively as intolerant because these respondents have expressed an unwillingness to extend full political rights to all citizens. Matters are not quite as clear with respect to respondents who receive scores of 0. Ideally, we would be able to claim that all respondents with scores of 0 are tolerant because these respondents are willing to apply political rights without exception. One constraint, however, is that some respondents may not have been asked about an actor, or, more specifically, an act‐actor combination, toward which they feel antipathy. We are on solid ground only if Gibson (1992) is correct that the GSS battery offers something for everyone to dislike. Social desirability biases constitute a second possible constraint. If some respondents feel compelled to disguise intolerance, and especially if any such tendency has increased over time, then longitudinal analysis would be compromised.            "
"23"," Gibson's (1989, 1992) contention that the modified Stouffer battery offers something for everyone to dislike is premised on supplemental data gathered in conjunction with the 1987 GSS, the 1987 Freedom and Tolerance in the United States survey. Respondents were asked the GSS tolerance items, but they also were asked to identify the four groups they disliked the most. Four groups—Communists, atheists, militarists, and homosexuals—were common to the two batteries. Racists constitute the fifth group on the conventional GSS tolerance battery, a more than suitable match to two groups mentioned on the supplemental survey, the KKK and American Nazis.            "
"24","For the dichotomous measure we have advanced to be on more solid ground it would have to be the case that all, or at least nearly all, respondents named one or more of the five GSS groups as being among the groups they most disliked. The relevant data are depicted in Table 1. The five GSS target groups provided the number one disliked group for 94% of respondents and the number one or number two group for over 99%. Every single respondent who named a disliked group listed a GSS target group as one of their four most disliked groups, and all but a handful of respondents named two. Gibson's assessment is right on the mark. Although respondents may vary in how many of the five GSS groups they dislike, all respondents dislike at least one of the groups, which means that the modified Stouffer battery offers all respondents at least some opportunity to be intolerant.6"
"25","The data in Table 1 are from 1987, the midpoint of the longitudinal series under consideration. Our analyses still would be in question were it the case that 1987 marked a unique high point in antipathy toward the GSS groups, but we find this to be implausible. There certainly is no reason to suspect that Americans viewed these groups more favorably in the years prior to 1987, and thus empirical analysis should be on rock‐solid ground for the period 1976–1987. Communists, of course, became less relevant as a target group soon after 1987, and we have seen that Americans' hostility toward homosexuals apparently lessened in the 1990s. These changes make analysis more speculative for the period 1987–1998, but only modestly so. Data in Figure 2 show that, at best, Americans' feelings toward racists warmed only fractionally in the 1990s, and the KKK was far and away the most disliked group in 1987. Thus, we are highly confident that essentially all GSS respondents in the period 1976–1998 were asked tolerance questions targeted toward one or more groups they strongly disliked.            "
"26","Social desirability biases present the second possible source of error in our measure. If respondents perceive tolerant answers to be socially preferred, then respondents with scores of 0 may include some people who are merely attempting to mask their intolerance. Given the present focus on possible changes in tolerance, a social desirability effect would be especially problematic were there reason to suspect that it operated most strongly at different points in the GSS series."
"27","If tolerance data are, in fact, confounded by a time‐varying social desirability effect, data gathered in accordance with the Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus content‐controlled procedure would not be immune to this bias. Thus, although the GSS data are imperfect on various counts, this is one situation in which the most commonly used alternate offers no improvement. But we know of no definitive evidence to suggest that the bias discussed here exists, let alone that it has increased in magnitude in recent years."
"28","Although the possible existence of a time‐varying social desirability effect cannot be tested conclusively, some relevant data are available. If a social desirability bias is present, it follows that some intolerant respondents deliberately disguised their true opinions by voicing tolerant answers. But an alternate form of disguise is also available, the “don't know” response. Focusing on survey questions about race, Berinsky (1999) demonstrated that “don't know” responses can be inflated by social desirability effects. In the present case, this would suggest that some intolerant respondents chose “don't know” as a middle ground option between admitting to socially undesirable intolerance and voicing disingenuous views. Provided that we can safely assume that any social pressure on respondents induces some to take refuge in the “don't know” response, analysis of trends in these responses should reveal whether there is circumstantial evidence of a time‐varying effect.            "
"29","The “don't know” marks for the 15‐item GSS battery are depicted in Figure 4. The mean number of “don't know” responses is always quite small, and the data vary within a fairly narrow margin. “Don't know” responses do increase over time (b = 0.005, p < .05), but the change is very slight and, as can be observed in Figure 4, the increase is hardly steady. The evidence is consistent with the possibility that a social desirability bias has become minutely more pronounced over time, and thus caution will be warranted below when trends in intolerance are reconsidered.            "
"30","                 Mean Number of “Don't Know” Responses on the GSS Modified Stouffer Tolerance Battery, 1976–1998                         "
"31","The dichotomous measure of tolerance we have proposed is not ideal, but we believe that it represents our best available means to assess patterns in tolerance over time. Content‐controlled measures are not available for a period sufficient to support meaningful longitudinal analysis, and the conventional 15‐item GSS battery is of highly uncertain validity. In comparison, the dichotomous measure fares quite well. The bottom line is that respondents who receive scores greater than zero on the GSS battery can be identified conclusively as intolerant, and respondents who receive scores of zero can be identified with considerable confidence as tolerant. Thus, analysis of the dichotomous data will reveal the upper bound of tolerance and the lower bound of intolerance for each available year in the period 1976–1998."
"32","At the outset of this article we began discussion of trends in tolerance with a look at variance over time in mean levels of intolerance as measured by the GSS's 0–15 modified Stouffer scale. That analysis revealed two noteworthy points. First, intolerance appeared to have decreased rather substantially between 1976 and 1998, dropping over 27% in just 22 years. Second, Americans as a whole appeared to be more tolerant than intolerant during the entire series in that, on average, respondents each year were willing to permit a majority of the 15 act‐actor combinations. As we have seen, though, great suspicion is cast on both of these points when the validity of the GSS modified Stouffer battery is taken into account."
"33","As an alternate to the conventional GSS index, we have advocated use of a dichotomous measure that distinguishes respondents known to be intolerant from those who offered zero intolerant replies on the 15‐item battery. The resulting data are shown in Figure 5. What do these data reveal regarding possible changes in levels of tolerance? First, intolerance does decrease over the course of the series, albeit by the relatively modest margin of slightly less than six percentage points, from highs of 85% in 1977 and 1988 to a low of just over 79% in 1998. Thus, most of the much sharper decline seen in Figure 1 is the consequence of changing levels of intolerance, and perhaps of a waning of group‐based antipathy. In contrast, actual tolerance apparently increased only marginally. Second, virtually no variance in levels of intolerance is observed in the period 1976–1989; intolerance ranges between 82% and 85% during this entire period. This is important because the validity of the dichotomous measure is much more certain through 1987, the year group dislike data are available, than for later years.6 There is no significant change in intolerance during the 14‐year period in which validity is more assured. Third, the shift observed here marks the greatest possible extent to which intolerance decreased. We observe what appears to be a slight decrease in intolerance after 1989, but we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the observed change is attributable to a warming of affect toward the GSS target groups rather than to true movement toward tolerance. The decrease in intolerance may be lower than suggested in Figure 5 if some GSS respondents in the 1990s found no groups they disliked, meaning that they had no opportunity to voice intolerance. The bottom line is that intolerance as conceptualized apparently here did decrease in the period 1976–1998, but only by an extremely modest margin.         "
"34","                 A Dichotomous Measure of Tolerance and Intolerance, 1976–1998                      "
"35","In their comparison of tolerance data gathered using a Stouffer battery and tolerance data gathered using the content‐controlled procedure, Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982) noted that levels of tolerance appeared dramatically lower under the latter. A similar pattern of results emerges here. Although we saw in Figure 1 that most GSS respondents are willing to permit over half of the 15 acts, we now see that the vast majority of respondents are unwilling to extend civil liberties uniformly to all individuals and groups. In this sense, the current approach yields a depiction of tolerance quite similar to that presented by Sullivan et al. Our procedure offers a stringent test of tolerance because respondents are only deemed tolerant if they are willing to put up with three acts conducted by each of five controversial actors; overall, some 18% of GSS respondents pass this test, including only about 15% in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Similarly, using content‐controlled data, Sullivan and his coauthors (1982, 67) found as few as 16% of respondents to be tolerant in 1978 as measured by the individual items on their six‐question political‐tolerance battery.         "
"36","Our measure and the Sullivan et al. indicator produce comparably low estimates of political tolerance because both recognize tolerance only if respondents have agreed to put up with that which they find to be objectionable. It should be clear that neither of these approaches is perfect. A few people may extend rights to their most disliked groups while denying those same rights to others (McCutcheon 1985).6 Likewise, some respondents who received scores of 0 on the GSS battery may have garnered scores greater than 0 had the questions focused on other groups or other acts. But this means that, if anything, the best available measures of political tolerance slightly overstate, not understate, tolerance levels. Hence, any error would not alter the fundamental implications of the present analysis: in the years 1976 to 1998, only a small minority of Americans was willing to extend the full rights of citizenship without exception, and the ranks of this tolerant minority grew only haltingly over time.         "
"37","One of the most straightforward and arguably most important questions concerning political tolerance has eluded clear answer for decades. Stouffer (1955) projected that trends in society were such that tolerance would increase in future years, yet the nature of available data has prevented direct test of this possibility. The initial problem was that researchers simply copied Stouffer's approach 20 years later without considering whether the context had changed in such a manner as to confound comparisons centered on Stouffer's three target groups. In an effort to address this problem, the GSS has asked an identical battery of improved tolerance items regularly since 1976, but debate and uncertainty over what these data represent have led most analysts to steer clear of longitudinal analysis. In an effort to shed what light we can on the matter of trends in tolerance, our strategy in this article has been to approach this question using the old data in a new way.         "
"38","Drawing on Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982), we have argued that people are tolerant if they are willing to extend the full rights of citizenship to all others without exception. In diagnosing tolerance within a society, it follows that two questions must be asked. First, what proportion of citizens is tolerant in the absolute sense defined here? And second, among the intolerant, to what extent does their intolerance vary in breadth (the number of groups toward which they would deny rights) and depth (the number of rights they would deny)? Though related, these questions are distinct, and both are important. Nonetheless, most research implicitly merges the two questions, with the bulk of attention paid to the latter. This apparently has occurred not for reasons grounded in theory, but rather because the most commonly available tolerance data happen to include items about multiple groups and multiple acts.         "
"39","We have argued that the GSS modified Stouffer battery used since 1976 provides data pertinent to both aspects of tolerance and intolerance, although the data are better suited to answering one question than the other. The GSS data are useful for identifying the proportions of Americans who are tolerant and intolerant. So long as all, or nearly all, respondents strongly dislike one or more of the five GSS groups, those respondents have the opportunity to express tolerance. Consequently, a dichotomous indicator that divides the tolerant from the intolerant is easily obtained. Unfortunately, the GSS data are much less useful for diagnosing the breadth and depth of intolerance for the simple reason that we cannot determine whether apparent declines in levels of intolerance are genuine or merely the consequence of changes in affect toward the GSS target groups. We have decomposed the issue of tolerance into two separate questions, and we have focused our attention on the one that is answerable. This does not mean that we see study of levels of intolerance as unimportant, for we most certainly do not. We have set aside this second question only because it cannot be answered reliably with available data."
"40","Our central empirical results will provide little or no solace to those observers who project, or hope, that levels of tolerance will rise dramatically over time. In many ways, our portrait of tolerance in the period 1976–1998 resembles the view from the late 1970s reported by Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982). Strong majorities of Americans were willing to limit civil liberties for members of unpopular groups in every year we considered, including over 79% of Americans in the last year we studied, 1998. There is evidence that tolerance has increased marginally in that 82 to 85% of respondents were coded as intolerant for the years 1976–1989 versus 79 to 82% for the years 1990–1998. But the change is slight and represents the upper bound of possible movement toward tolerance. Tolerance may be on the rise, but any increase is taking place at a shuffling pace. Absent a development that fundamentally transforms Americans' conceptions of civil liberties, nothing in the current results provides reason to believe that a majority of citizens will be willing to extend the full rights of citizenship to all others at any point in the foreseeable future.         "
"41","Although tolerance in an absolute sense has varied little since 1976, the data suggest that the breadth and depth of intolerance may have declined markedly. Put differently, the underlying condition has changed minimally, but outward manifestations of that condition have abated. In the short run, this state of affairs surely constitutes good news for those observers who wish to see an increase in tolerance. What this might mean in the long run, however, is less certain. It may be that expressions of intolerance will ebb and flow in response to factors such as incidents that alter the salience of particular target groups and the manner in which media report those groups' activities (e.g., Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997). If the vast majority of citizens remain willing to express intolerance, then the breadth and depth of intolerance may well rise in the future if new target groups draw the ire of the American public.         "
