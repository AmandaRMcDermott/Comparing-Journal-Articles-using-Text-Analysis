"1","Twelve years ago, Przeworski et al. said, “ … the probability that a democracy will be established does not depend on the proportion of the countries that have democratic regimes. This finding casts doubt on the notion that democracies come in waves” (2000, 127). While the existence of waves would imply some supranational dynamic to democratization, Przeworski et al. rely exclusively on domestic politics in their account, an emphasis reflected in most subsequent work on democracy and democratization. Nevertheless, Gleditsch and Ward (2006) find strong spatial clustering in both regime types and transitions, which belies this domestic focus as well as Przeworski and colleagues' notion of exogenous democratization. Gleditsch and Ward conclude that “international factors influence the prospects for democracy, and that transitions are not simply random but are more likely in the wake of changes in the external environment. The temporal and spatial clustering in democracy and transitions suggests diffusion, or enduring, cross‐boundary dependencies that influence the development and persistence of political institutions” (2006, 912). They do not, however, specify what these “international factors” might be, a challenge that subsequent research has failed to systematically address.         "
"2","The close association between the liberalization of the global economy and widespread processes of democratization in the latter third of the twentieth century seems a reasonable place to start looking. Using two different measures of democracy, Figure 1 displays the well‐worn fact that increases in global trade and the spread of democracy have gone hand in hand. Noting the link between the two, Milner and Mukherjee write that “democracy has … become a global trend, and countries all over the world have become more democratic” (2009, 164).         "
"3","World Trade and Democracy Seem Associated While Changes in Trade and Regimes Are Not"
"4","Note: The black curve is world trade as percent world GDP. The gray curve is percent of existing countries that are democratic according to Polity IV (left panel) and Svolik (2008; right panel).                     "
"5","The association between global trade and democratization has spawned a large literature. Much of the research has attempted to discover a direct linear relationship between each country's trade dependence and democracy that would seem to fit the stylized facts in Figure 1 (L). The lion's share of work has focused on the impact of democracy and democratization on trade dependence and policy (Dutt and Mitra 2002; Eichengreen and Leblang 2008; Kono 2006; Milner and Kubota 2005; O’Rourke and Taylor 2006), but there is also a body of research investigating the impact of trade on democracy (Eichengreen and Leblang 2008; Li and Reuveny 2003; Lopez‐Cordova and Meissner 2008). Though there is considerable consensus on the positive effect of democracy on trade liberalization, there is dissensus on the effect of trade on democracy. While some find a positive effect of national trade volume on democratization (Eichengreen and Leblang 2008; Lopez‐Cordova and Meissner 2008), others find exactly the opposite (Li and Reuveny 2003; Rigobon and Rodrik 2007), and still others find no effect at all (Bussman 2002; Milner and Mukherjee 2009).         "
"6","This confusion likely results from three limitations. First, as several participants in the literature have made clear, each country's trade volumes are likely to be endogenous to regime type (Lopez‐Cordova and Meissner 2008; Rigobon and Rodrik 2007). This claim is confirmed by several papers showing that democracies trade more than autocracies and that labor‐abundant democracies appear to have lower tariffs (Milner and Kubota 2005; Milner and Mukherjee 2009; O’Rourke and Taylor 2006). As discussed in greater detail below, existing efforts to model this endogeneity are not entirely satisfying. Second, though many of these papers have made important advances, they have typically failed to clearly specify the causal relationship running from trade to democracy. Li and Reuveny (2003), for instance, outline seven potential mechanisms whereby various features of “globalization” promote democracy, ranging from increased incomes to reduced information costs to the diffusion of democratic ideas. Many of these arguments are highly contested and few of them are clearly linked to models of either authoritarian breakdown or democratic politics. Several papers in this literature do make use of the Stolper‐Samuelson theorem to develop hypotheses, implying that class‐based interests are central to democratic transitions, but their relationship to democratization or democratic politics is unclear. Does trade increase everyone's incomes such that all citizens seek democracy as a means to protect property rights? Or by virtue of encouraging specialization and diversification, does it produce an alternative set of economic elites who seek protection from an authoritarian state? Alternatively, does trade enrich the middle class, which is thereby empowered to impose democracy on the traditional oligarchy? Or perhaps it enriches the poor, who seek democracy as a means to soak the rich à la Meltzer‐Richard?         "
"7","Third, absent a precise theoretical link between trade and democracy, it is unclear why all the papers linking “globalization” to regime type operationalize trade by summing each country's imports and exports. While some of the papers rely on a Stolper‐Samuelson argument, the actual model does not speak to a country's trade volume. Stolper‐Samuelson suggests that a change in relative prices benefits the factor used most intensively in the production of that good. Thus, abundant factors in an economy benefit from greater exposure to world prices and scare factors benefit from autarky. Note that Stolper‐Samuelson makes explicit a relationship between the price of a good and the price of factors (wages) and says nothing about an individual country's trade volume. Because goods prices are set on world markets, it need not matter if a country trades a lot or a little for the distributive implications underpinning most arguments in this literature to bite.5 Thus, it makes little sense to measure trade exposure as the dollar value of traded goods as a share of each nation's GDP, which is the only way it is measured in existing research. As we make clear below, more important is the openness of the overall global economy, which has implications for the extent of factor price equalization and distributive outcomes across countries.         "
"8","Since trade has important distributive implications, recent models of democratization by Boix (2003) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) provide important leverage for thinking about the effect of trade on democracy. Both authors model the transition from authoritarianism to democracy as part of a distributive struggle between rich and poor. Both import Meltzer and Richard's (1981) reduced‐form understanding of democracy: the key axis of political conflict is held to be taxation. Taxes are assumed to be flat, and redistribution occurs as an equal, lump‐sum transfer to all. Where the median voter has an income below the mean (which she will under any right‐skewed income distribution), we will see positive levels of taxation and redistribution. As a society becomes more unequal (or, more precisely, when mean income and the income of the median voter diverge), the equilibrium tax rate and level of redistribution will increase. In formulating preferences over regimes, actors compare payoffs under autocracy to those expected to emerge under a Meltzer‐Richard democracy.         "
"9","In answering why elites would democratize despite the redistribution likely to result from democracy, Acemoglu and Robinson respond:"
"10","                        "
"11"," … this only occurs because the disenfranchised citizens can threaten the elite and force it to make concessions. These threats can take the forms of strikes, demonstrations, riots, and—in the limit—a revolution. Because these actions impose costs on the elite, it will try to prevent them. (2006, xii)"
"12","Elites, they argue, would prefer to head off those costs by redistributing under existing authoritarian institutions, but any such redistribution faces a time‐inconsistency problem—promises of future redistribution are not credible in a nondemocratic setting. The poor know this and, therefore, prefer democracy since it institutionalizes promises of redistribution. As a stylized summary of Acemoglu and Robinson's argument, the resulting game between elites and masses produces three ideal‐type outcomes: at low levels of inequality, the poor have little to gain from democracy and authoritarianism persists; at high levels of inequality, the rich have so much to lose from redistribution under democracy that they resist and authoritarianism persists; only at intermediate levels of inequality, when the redistributive costs of democracy are moderate, do the demands of the poor and the willingness of the elites combine to produce democratization."
"13","Boix similarly argues that distributive considerations are at the forefront of transitions from authoritarianism and makes use of the median voter theorem. Unlike Acemoglu and Robinson, he posits a linear relationship between equality and the probability of democratization. He writes that “as the distribution of assets and income becomes more balanced among individuals, the redistributive impact of democracy diminishes and the probability of a peaceful transition from an authoritarian regime to universal suffrage increases” (2003, 3). Consistent with the application of the median voter theorem to redistributive politics, as inequality mounts, so do the redistributive demands of the poor and, thus, the resistance of elites to relinquishing the authoritarian status quo. Not all distributive models of democratization rely on insights derived from the median voter theorem (see, for instance, Ansell and Samuels 2010), but those that do have become the most prominent in recent years, spawning thousands of citations and much research.6"
"14","With their emphasis on distributive conflicts between classes‐qua‐factor owners, these theoretical arguments lend themselves to Stolper‐Samuelson‐inspired analysis and thereby offer a means to explicitly link work on “globalization” to democratic transitions. Indeed, Acemoglu and Robinson (2006, chap. 9) formally model the impact of trade on democratization, and Boix discusses the role of factor mobility in mediating the impact of inequality on the prospects for democracy.7 In both conceptualizations, trade affects the prospects for democracy via its impact on the income distribution. Locally abundant factors benefit from trade, and the effect on the income distribution depends on whether that factor is capital or labor. In the former, inequality increases, and in the latter inequality falls, with corresponding implications for democratization.         "
"15","None of these works empirically assess the impact of trade on democracy, and unfortunately, we again confront conflicting empirical results on the link between inequality and regime type. Though Boix (2003) finds evidence of a negative relationship between land inequality and democratization, Ansell and Samuels (2010) find a positive one between income inequality and democratization, but a negative finding between land inequality and democratic transitions. Houle (2009) finds that inequality, measured as capital share of income, has no relationship with democratic transitions but increases the risk of authoritarian backsliding. Many have failed to find any relationship at all between various measures of inequality and regime type (Bollen and Jackman 1985; Muller 1988; Przeworski et al. 2000).         "
"16","As with the literature on the relationship between globalization and regime type, we suspect these conflicting findings result in part from the difficulty of identifying the causal relationship between inequality and democracy. As considerable work makes clear, inequality has many causes, including technological change (Boix 2010; Krugman 2000; Krugman and Lawrence 1993; Lucas 2004), economic endowments (Leamer, Maul, and Rodriguez 1999), the supply of and demand for education (Goldin and Katz 2008), and demographic trends (Rogowski and MacRae 2008), and an entire cottage industry has developed in economics, history, and sociology to explain why within‐country inequality has been climbing across much of the world, even in countries where labor endowments suggest that globalization would reduce inequality (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007). Perhaps most importantly, it follows from the median voter model and its application to regime type that regime type should have a causal effect on the income distribution via the tax‐transfer system. Obviously, the theoretical claim that inequality has a causal effect on regime type, which in turn has a causal effect on inequality, produces a serious challenge to empirically identifying causation.         "
"17","Our contribution is to offer an empirical strategy that builds on the underappreciated open economy implications of these distributive models of regime change. As discussed below, the openness of the global economy is exogenous to any particular country, though it has important implications for factor returns across countries. Changes in the global economy should have a similar impact on income distributions across countries with similar factor endowments. As the income distribution narrows or broadens across similarly endowed countries, the prospects for democratization should follow suit. In summary, empirical work on the relationship between globalization and regime type as well as that on the relationship between inequality and regime type have not compellingly addressed the inferential threat posed by endogeneity. Below we suggest that attention to the open economy implications of recent work provides a means to wed both literatures while providing some leverage on causal identification."
"18","Rather than focus on Przeworski and colleagues' conclusion that there are no waves of democratization, we emphasize their more nuanced statement: “ … however the waves roll, there is always an undertow pushing in the reverse direction” (2000, 45), i.e., waves of regime change need not mean that all regimes move in the same (democratic) direction. Building on theories of democratization in the context of redistributive conflict, we outline two mechanisms whereby the openness of the global economy influences equilibrium political regimes. Available data do not permit us to differentiate these mechanisms empirically. We do not take sides among the various theoretical models of regime transition, nor are we attempting to add yet another model to the mix. Rather, we seek to demonstrate that existing theory logically implies that global trade openness should be critical in understanding regime dynamics in predictable ways regardless of the extent to which factor prices equalize."
"19","The first mechanism, articulated by Acemoglu and Robinson and Boix, combines the Stolper‐Samuelson logic (Jones and Scheinkman 1977; Stolper and Samuelson 1941) with Meltzer‐Richard arguments about inequality and redistribution. Trade‐related changes in factor prices impact the likelihood of democratization entirely through their effect on the income distribution and, ultimately, on the expected level of redistribution under democracy. To summarize, the Stolper‐Samuelson theorem shows that when the relative price of a good rises, the returns to the factor(s) of production used heavily in producing that good also increase while the returns to the other factors fall. What's more, these changes in factor prices will exceed the changes in output prices. Applied to international trade and assuming common technology and fully mobile factors within countries, opening a previously closed global economy to international trade will induce a change in relative prices: the price of goods that intensively use the locally scarce factors will fall relative to those that use the locally abundant factor.8 Trade‐induced changes in relative prices will raise the return to factors that are domestically abundant relative to trading partners, while relatively scarce factors see their share of income decline. More openness to international markets should increase labor's income share in labor‐abundant economies, thereby reducing cross‐class inequality. The opposite holds in labor‐scarce economies, where openness will increase the relative returns to capital vis‐à‐vis labor and thereby increase cross‐class inequality. In the Acemoglu‐Robinson model, increased trade openness in a labor‐abundant economy decreases the expected price of democracy for the elite since income directed to the poor will increase, thereby narrowing income gaps and lowering the median voter's preferred tax rate.         "
"20","This first mechanism presupposes near‐instantaneous factor‐price equalization across countries. Yet as Blattman, Clemens, and Williamson (2002), Kono (2006), and many others have noted, international product prices are not automatically translated into changes in domestic factor prices since government policy over everything from tariffs to exchange rates can mediate changes in openness of the international economy.9 Elites currently in charge of authoritarian institutions should pursue trade policies in their own interest. Where elites control factors that are relatively scarce, they have little incentive to allow opening to the world trading system. In such cases, the combination of factor endowments and protectionist trade policy can generate unrealized gains from trade for regime outsiders.         "
"21","The emergence of substantial unrealized gains from trade could have several effects, but it certainly changes the salience of trade and trade policy as an axis of political conflict. Similar to the argument made by Adserá and Boix (2002), we now have a situation in which fiscal policy and trade policy are bound together via their redistributive effects across different factor owners. Although Adserá and Boix claim that high taxes are needed to sustain low tariffs, class‐based models of regime transition imply a different configuration. Where labor is abundant, opening to trade redistributes from the elite to the citizens, but it also decreases the expected tax rate under democracy. If autarky is maintained, taxes remain low and the citizens are prevented from taking advantage of the opportunities in international markets. Thus, citizens in labor‐abundant autocracies face enhanced incentives to challenge the regime as world trade expands and unrealized gains from trade mount. Furthermore, the commitment problems Acemoglu and Robinson identify with regard to taxation and redistribution clearly extend to trade policy, providing a rationale for institutional change rather than simple policy change under authoritarianism. Thus, we have a second mechanism—one that does not require immediate changes in factor prices—through which increasing opportunities in the world trading system can affect the prospects for regime change, conditional on factor endowments.         "
"22","We have built on existing factor‐based theories of regime dynamics to identify two mechanisms whereby the openness of the world trading system should affect the prospects for democratic transitions. Indeed, no matter which of the diverse relationships between inequality and regime type hold (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Ansell and Samuels 2010; Boix 1999; Houle 2009), the state of the global trading system ought to matter. Labor‐abundant autocracies should face increasing pressure as the world economy becomes more integrated. The fundamental empirical hypothesis implied by factor‐based models of democratization is that an increase in trade openness will increase the likelihood of democratic transitions in labor‐abundant autocracies while an increase in trade openness will decrease the risk of democratic transition in labor‐scarce autocracies.10"
"23","Consistent with Acemoglu and Robinson (2006, 321), our argument makes an important claim, namely that the openness of the international trading system can be considered exogenous to any individual country.11 There is now a large body of work supporting that claim. Historians emphasize the importance of technological changes in shipbuilding, navigation, and transportation technology (e.g., refrigeration) for the expansion of trade with the western hemisphere during periods of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries (Lindert and Williamson 2001; Maddison 2001; O’Rourke and Williamson 1999). Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor (2003) show that among competing explanations for the rise and collapse of world trade from 1870 to 1939, changes in transport costs driven by shipping improvements, and then later by war, are far more important than aggregate tariff levels. The gold standard, while underwritten by the Bank of England in this period, is also shown to have a strong trade‐promoting effect. This can only occur when many countries are adhering. Similarly, Madsen (2001) shows that actual tariff levels directly set by governments account for roughly half as much of the decline in trade during the Depression as nominal income effects. Blattman, Clemens, and Williamson (2002) find that a multiplicity of variables beyond the control of individual governments, including factor endowments and world systemic factors, have a robust relationship with tariff rates.         "
"24","We evaluate whether there is evidence consistent with the distributional conflict/factor‐based models of democracy. Our approach differs conceptually and technically from existing work in a number of important ways."
"25","First, every quantitative piece we can find that links trade to democracy uses each nation's trade volume as the key independent variable.12 Aside from the vexing endogeneity of national trade dependence and regime type,13 it is not the relevant quantity for those papers that build arguments around factor returns. It has long been recognized that for factor prices to change, it need not be the case that a particular country trade a great deal with the rest of the world. Rather, producers in a country must compete with producers elsewhere. Furthermore, there is abundant evidence—consider the East Asian experience with export‐led industrialization—of countries expanding their trade profile yet intentionally preventing domestic factor returns from equalizing with world prices. Thus, a particular country's trade openness is, at best, a highly problematic proxy for the extent to which factor prices equalize across polities (Leamer 1998). A country's trade volumes are determined by a host of factors like geography and country size that are independent of the extent to which domestic factor prices deviate from those that would prevail were there no political or other barriers to trade. Moreover, if local prices do, in fact, deviate from world prices, trade policy becomes an axis for political conflict up to and including conflict over the regime itself, further complicating the use of country‐level trade volume as an indicator. That country‐level trade volumes are endogenous to regime type has been well established: democracies tend to have lower tariffs (Milner and Kubota 2005; O’Rourke and Taylor 2006) and trade more (Milner and Mukherjee 2009). World trade volume, measured as a proportion of world output, helps solve this problem.         "
"26","Using world trade openness not only allows us to circumvent these endogeneity and conceptual problems, but it also allows us to capture a feature not readily recognized in the literature: the effect of domestic participation in the world trading system necessarily depends on who else is trading.14 When only a few countries are trading a few goods, the effects on those goods prices (and, by extension, on domestic factor prices) will be muted and fail to conform to what we would expect based on global comparisons of relative factor endowments, even if some countries trade large volumes. The greater the participation in the global trading system, the more closely we would expect the returns from trade to fit expectations formed by looking at relative factor endowments (Wood 1997).         "
"27","Second, while some papers do not include a measure of factor abundance at all, those that do limit their discussion of factor endowments to the post‐1960 period, and their measures of factor endowments are debatable. The most frequently used indicators are a country's capital‐labor and land‐labor ratios. As Leamer (1984) and Midford (1993) emphasize, such measures are entirely domestic and fail to account for the crucial role of relative abundance across countries in shaping comparative advantage, trade patterns, and the distributive implications of trade. Indeed, the very concept of factor abundance or scarcity is relative to other trading partners, not relative to other factors. We follow Leamer's advice and construct a more appropriate measure of relative labor endowment.         "
"28","Third, existing tests of the impact of trade on democracy generally omit any serious discussion of inequality (Eichengreen and Leblang 2008; Lopez‐Cordova and Meissner 2008; Rigobon and Rodrik 2004), notwithstanding frequent invocations of Acemoglu and Robinson's argument and/or the Heckscher‐Ohlin theorem. In contrast, empirical models on the relationship between inequality and regime type focus intense effort on conceptualizing and measuring inequality, but tend to omit trade variables (Ansell and Samuels 2010; Boix 2003; Houle 2009). Parsing the effect of inequality on democracy in an open economy is complicated by the fact that the income distribution is expected to be endogenous to the openness of the economy.15 If factor prices fail to equalize, however, inequality and trade can now have independent effects on domestic politics, particularly in the short term. While our data do not allow us to discern the extent to which world trade is affecting any particular country's domestic income distribution, we now have good reason to explore whether the inclusion of inequality measures in empirical models improves model fit and/or conforms to the theoretical expectations of Boix or Acemoglu and Robinson.         "
"29","Fourth, existing studies of trade's effect on democracy fail to account for the strong spatial dependence observed by Gleditsch and Ward (2006). Interestingly, Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) claim to find a positive relationship between trade openness and democracy using distance as an instrument for trade volumes. We fit models explicitly accounting for these localized dependencies in the data.         "
"30","We have put together an unbalanced panel time‐series dataset covering up to 8,347 country‐years between 1875 and 2002. Obviously both the universe of independent countries and data availability increase greatly as we move forward in time, especially after World War II. Nevertheless, we have made a strong effort to incorporate recent advances in the measurement of income, trade, and inequality over long periods of time and broad cross‐sections of countries (Bourguignon and Morrison 2002; Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor 2003; Maddison 2006).            "
"31","Several of the empirical models of democratization use the Polity IV dataset (Marshall, Jaggers, and Gurr 2004), treating the Polity index as interval‐level data (Li and Reuveny 2003). Doing so involves heroic assumptions about the metric information in the Polity indicator (Gleditsch and Ward 1997; Treier and Jackman 2008). Treating Polity as if it were interval scaled, especially when it is the primary variable of interest, seems unwarranted. We therefore adopt a binary conception of democracy. Our primary indicator is the democracy/autocracy indicator developed by Przeworski et al. (2000). We use Svolik's (2008) update, which revises previous efforts by Boix and Rosato (2001) and Cheibub, Gandhi and Vreeland (2009). As a check, we also report results using the dichotomized version of Polity IV.16"
"32","Relative Labor Endowment, World Trade, and GDP.  The major covariate of interest is relative labor endowment. Our measure of relative labor endowments (RLE) follows the method of Leamer (1984) and Midford (1993): we calculate (populationi/world population)/(GDPi/World GDP). A country with a small value on this variable is producing a lot using a relatively small number of people; it is relatively labor scarce. While in an ideal world we would make this calculation using actual labor force sizes or, even better, skilled and unskilled labor forces, low levels of economic differentiation for the first 75+ years of our data make this less of a concern. In any case, such data are not available prior to the 1960s. The labor endowment variable shows pronounced skew, so we log it. GDP data are those reported by Maddison (2006) and used in Eichengreen and Leblang (2008). World trade openness is measured as total world exports and imports divided by world GDP. The values from 1870 to 1940 are from Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor (2003). Postwar values are taken from the Penn World Tables (Heston, Summers, and Aten 2006). We imagine the skeptical reader will want to be shown that our findings do not hinge entirely on our choice of trade measure. We fit alternate models using inequality data and standard measures of country‐level trade dependence. The openness measure is the standard (IM+EX)/GDP, taken from the Penn World Tables.                  "
"33","It is worth noting that our RLE measure is highly (negatively) correlated with GDP per capita, both within and across years; this is consistent with the theoretical link between labor endowments and comparative advantage. In fact, it is easy to show that RLEi is equivalent to the ratio of world per capita income to country i's per capita income.17 It therefore makes little sense to include both per capita income and RLE in the same model. Our solution is to recognize that if the factor endowment story fails to hold, there should be no conditional relationship between either RLE and trade or GDP per capita and trade on democracy. We fit models using both and evaluate their relative performance.                  "
"34","Figure 2 plots the (log) RLE variable in 1965 against the same for 2000. Country names are color coded by region. The dashed lines represent world means in 1965 and 2000. In the bottom left we see the relatively labor‐scarce, rich OECD countries; moving to the northeast we then see the major Latin American nations. The Asian nations are around the mean, while the highly labor‐abundant countries in both years are found in sub‐Saharan Africa. The southeast quadrant represents countries that were relatively labor abundant in 1965, but by 2000 had below‐average relative labor endowments. Unsurprisingly, these are the rapidly industrializing Asian countries where the capital stock expanded much more quickly than the labor force: Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Singapore.                  "
"35","Relative Labor Endowments in 1965 and 2000"
"36","In Figure 3 we present the same data, only now countries are color coded based on democracy status according to Svolik (2008) in 1965 (top‐left panel) and 2000 (top‐right panel). The bottom panels code democracy using the binary version of Polity IV in 1965 (bottom‐left panel) and 2000 (bottom‐right panel). If the factor‐based stories are right, we should see the countries in the upper right going from red to black as world trade expands from 18% in 1965 to 41% in 2000. This is not what the picture shows. Democratic transitions are concentrated among the countries at or below the mean for RLE in 2000. The large, labor‐scarce countries of Latin America—Argentina and Brazil—democratize in this period, when the returns to capital were increasing and inequality was climbing. Egypt and Tunisia, the two harbingers of the current wave of unrest in North Africa, are near or below the global mean for relative labor endowments.                  "
"37","Relative Labor Endowment and Democracy Status in 1965 (L) and 2000 (R)"
"38","Note: World trade accounted for 18% of world GDP in 1965 and 41% of world GDP in 2000.                              "
"39","Other Covariates.   Gleditsch and Ward (2006) identify important spatial processes in regime type and transitions. We follow their lead and calculate neighborhood democracy and transitions. Specifically, for each country we identify their neighbors as those with minimum distance < 501 km, as reported in Gleditsch and Ward (2001) and the cshapes R library. We then calculate the proportion of neighbors that are counted as democracies18 and whether any of them underwent a democratic transition (according to the Svolik 2008 data or Polity, depending on the model) in the previous year. In line with common practice, we also include global proportion of countries democratic, the number of previous democratic failures, and whether a country is Communist.                  "
"40","The structure of the international monetary system could affect both global trade openness and democracy, so following Eichengreen and Leblang (2008), we include dummies for the gold standard (1875–1932), interwar (1933–40), and post‐Bretton Woods (1972–2003) periods.19"
"41","The study of inequality has been plagued by the dearth of comparable data across countries and through time (Atkinson and Brandolini 2001). Easily the best source of comparable data on income inequality is the Luxembourg Income Study, but until very recently it has only covered countries of the OECD, and even for those cases, it only goes back to the early 1980s. Though lesser‐quality data are available for a broader set of countries dating back to the 1960s, researchers interested in topics like the relationship between inequality and the historical origins of democracy have had to rely on proxies of unknown quality, such as land inequality. Certainly distributive models of democracy built on the median voter theorem imply a measure of income inequality rather than inequality in landholdings. Only recently has historical income‐inequality data become available for a broad cross‐section of countries. Our measure of inequality for the models covering long time spans is the p90/p10 ratio. To generate long enough time series, we calculate the 90/10 ratio for all countries using the data reported in Bourguignon and Morrison (2002).20 Where inequality is measured at intervals, we linearly interpolate the intervening years, though we do not extrapolate before the first observation or after the last. We then combine this measure with the 90/10 ratio calculated from the WIDER (2005) dataset for the postwar period, as cleaned and adjusted in Babones (2008). We also fit a model using the “best estimate” Gini coefficients reported in Babones (2008) for the postwar period.                  "
"42","Following the standard in the liteature, we treat regime transitions as first‐order Markov processes in which we model the various transition probabilities into and out of democracy.21 Formally, we let yit= 1 in years where country i= 1, … , n is democratic and 0 otherwise. We fit dynamic probit models:               "
"43","We report results in Table 1. Model 1 presents our baseline specification; Model 2 replaces RLE with log GDP per capita. Both have several noteworthy features. First, we confirm Gleditsch and Ward's (2006) finding of spatial correlation in regime transitions using a different indicator of democracy. The probability of a democratic transition increases by almost two‐thirds if the proportion of neighbors democratic increases from 0% to 44%.24 The probability of a transition more than doubles from 1% to 2.5% if a neighbor underwent a democratic transition last year. Global democracy, prior democratic failures, Communism, and economic growth all have significant influence on democracy in the expected directions.            "
"44","Looking at RLE (Model 1), GDP per capita (Model 2), world trade, and their conditional relationships, however, we find very little evidence consistent with the core empirical hypothesis. RLE is strongly negatively associated with both democratic transitions and stability, which mirrors per capita income's positive effects on both. This is consistent with Epstein et al. (2006): higher levels of per capita income are associated with both increased risk of democratic transition and increased likelihood of remaining a democracy, once established. The interaction term, though “significant” at the 0.05 level, buys us little. Figure 4 displays the predicted probability of a democratic transition as world trade openness moves across its interquartile range, calculated based on Model 1. The solid line sets RLE to the value of Argentina in 1980, a relatively labor‐scarce autocracy. The dashed line sets RLE to the value taken by China, a labor‐abundant autocracy in the same year. The shaded regions represent the 95% confidence interval around the predictions.25 Strong evidence in favor of the factor‐based story would look like an “X” with the risk of transition increasing for the labor abundant. While the risk of a transition decreases for labor‐scarce autocracies as trade increases, there is no discernible effect on labor‐abundant autocracies—exactly the cases where theory predicts we should see a strong relationship. The confidence intervals overlap substantially for all values of trade, making it difficult to sustain the claim that there is a large conditional relationship at work here.            "

"46","Note: Predicted probabilities calculated from Model 1.                        "
"47","We also examine the extent to which the models with the interaction term represent any improvement over the simpler model without.26 We find little statistical justification for preferring the more complicated models. The simpler version of Model 1 has a BIC of 1,406, which is nearly identical to (and slightly better than) the 1,419 reported in Table 1. The simpler version of Model 2 has a BIC of 1,410, whereas Table 1 reports a BIC of 1,420 for the model itself. The BIC is an index of in‐sample fit (penalized for model complexity); it may be that the more complicated models help us predict new data better. To evaluate this possibility, we conducted a 10‐fold cross‐validation exercise for both Model 1 and its simpler analogue. Model performance out‐of‐sample was virtually identical, with the area under the ROC curve equal to 0.99 for both Model 1 and its interaction‐omitting cousin.            "
"48","Findings for the unconditional relationship between world trade and democratization are mixed. Model 1 shows a negative relationship between world trade and democratic transitions (though this disappears in the noninteracted version of the same), while Model 2 finds a positive relationship. The other specifications show either no relationship or a small negative “effect.”"
"49","Models 3 and 4 address concerns about some omitted variables. Model 3 includes the p90/p10 income ratio and its square using data from Bourguignon and Morrison (2002). This variable shows no relationship with democracy either linearly, as expected under the Boix (2003) model, or parabolically, as predicted by Acemoglu and Robinson (2006). We find even weaker evidence that the relationship between RLE and democracy is conditioned by world trade openness. Model 4 restricts our attention to the postwar period and includes additional covariates common in the literature: indices of religious and ethnic fractionalization as used in Boix and Stokes (2003) as well as percent Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim. We omit parameter estimates for these additional covariates from the table for space reasons. We also substitute the “best estimate” of the Gini coefficient (and its square) from Babones (2008) for the 90/10 ratios used earlier. Our nonfinding for the conditional influence of RLE on democracy remains.            "
"50","Models 5 and 6 use Polity as our indicator of democracy. Model 5 uses the same specification as in Model 1 with similar results. The time period/exchange rate regime indicators show more influence here and growth no longer appears as a significant predictor of democratic stability, but the central conclusions remain. Model 6 substitutes the standard country‐level measure of openness for world trade openness with largely similar results, save that trade volumes have a negative and strongly significant influence on the probability of democratic transitions, contrary to the globalization literature."
"51","Finally, we note that we fit models using country random effects, including logged per capita energy consumption as an alternate measure of development, and using Houle's (2009) capital share as a measure of inequality. We failed to find significant variance terms in random effects specifications, and parameter estimates were nearly unchanged from those reported in Table 1. Including energy consumption similarly fails to alter the interpretation of results meaningfully, though it did reduce the sample and induce some numerical optimization problems in certain specifications. The capital share variable showed no relationship with democratization in our models, consistent with Houle's dynamic probit specifications.            "
"52","The study of democratization has come to all but define the subfield of comparative politics. Political economists still distinguish between “comparative” and “international” variants. The recent emphasis on the distributive underpinnings of regime type has focused attention on the domestic class politics associated with democratization. The state‐of‐the‐art models focus on distributive conflict between factor owners as the engine of regime transition and are driven by Meltzer‐Richard conceptions of distributive politics under democracy. The challenge for empirically assessing key claims in this literature is that inequality is endogenous to both regime type and trade exposure, while domestic‐level trade volumes are known to be endogenous to regime type. These problems are exacerbated by dubious inequality data. Previous efforts have focused on one or the other of these challenges but not all of them. Those studies that concentrate the most effort on addressing identification problems fail to fully engage with the factor‐based theories of democratization."
"53","We develop a novel solution to this problem, relying on the open‐economy implications of current theory. As formalized by Acemoglu and Robinson (2006), there is an expected link between the openness of the economy, inequality, and therefore prospects for democracy. We extend this line of reasoning by arguing that if the factor‐based models are correct, trade can impact regime type regardless of the extent to which factor prices equalize. World trade, as distinct from national trade dependence, can influence the prospects for democracy via the domestic income distribution where factor prices are allowed to equalize, but trade can also inflame domestic conflicts over trade policy if autocratic elites protect themselves from external competition using policies that prevent world trade expansion from directly affecting the domestic income distribution. All of the distributive models of democratization, particularly those relying on Meltzer‐Richard logic, imply that world trade should have a systematic relationship with democratization, conditional on the country's relative labor endowment. This approach presents us with an opportunity to evaluate these models since global trade can reasonably be treated as exogenous to any one country's policies or regime type.         "
"54","We look for evidence consistent with this hypothesis in data covering 130 years and over 100 countries. Unlike most previous efforts, we also account for the spatial dependence of regime type. We find no evidence that world trade interacts with relative labor endowments to affect the prospects for democracy. Our findings are an important challenge to distributive models of regime type. No matter the functional form of the theorized relationship between inequality and democracy—whether it is linear, as in Boix, or curvilinear, as in Acemoglu and Robinson (2006)—regime dynamics should respond to changing factor returns that result from the interaction of factor endowments and world trade. We also find no evidence that domestic inequality is related to regime outcomes once spatial correlation is accounted for, something that may occur if factor prices fail to equalize. Our results are also inconsistent with some research linking “globalization” to regime type. The extant literature arguing for a positive impact of trade on democracy routinely fails to account for local effects, something we do here. Our finding in this regard may be driven by the spatial lag and our focus on global (rather than country‐level) trade volume.         "
"55","International trade is obviously not the only factor impacting domestic inequality, and in this article, we rely on a theoretical model that assumes common technological endowments. Contemporary research on inequality, however, emphasizes the distributive impact of new technology, most clearly stated in arguments about “skill‐biased technological change” (Krugman 2000; Krugman and Lawrence 1993). Though prominent, this argument lends itself less clearly to the factor‐based politics that underpin the models of regime change of concern here. Not only is the cross‐national measurement of skill‐biased technological change profoundly difficult, but the distributive implications of technological change in any given country are difficult to predict. They depend on the skill distribution in the population, a country's comparative advantage, and the nature of technology in those sectors where its comparative advantage lies. Even more importantly, our inability to find any evidence that inequality impacts regime change suggests that finding the ultimate source of changes in inequality is not terribly important for understanding regime dynamics.         "
"56","Our findings are perhaps less problematic for distributive models that do not rely on median voter conceptualizations of democracy, such as Ansell and Samuels (2010). In their account, democracy emerges from new elites in dynamic sectors of the economy who seek democracy to protect their assets from expropriation by an authoritarian state. Their account is distributive in nature, but the median voter is not decisive and votes on the tax‐transfer systems are irrelevant. Their model also does not generate clear predictions with regard to income inequality since the rise of new elites could come at the expense of traditional ones (in which case inequality falls) or as a result of new wealth (in which case inequality could rise). But their model does seem to provide a way forward for thinking about the political economy of technological change.         "
"57","Though our results raise questions about these well‐established literatures, we are cautious about our findings. The various sources we have used for inequality data are flawed (though they are the best we have), and data are simply unavailable for many countries, particularly early in their existence. Likewise, our blunt measure of global trade openness does not allow us to distinguish the impact of global trade on the domestic income distribution from its effect on class conflict over trade policy. Similarly, our measure of factor endowments fails to differentiate high‐skill from unskilled labor, a distinction of increasing economic salience in both the developed (Freeman 1995) and developing world (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007).         "
"58","Finally, our account suggests the importance of additional theoretical work on some consistent but ill‐understood empirical findings. Congruent with work by others, we find that global and regional preponderance of democracies, whether a country is Communist, and whether the country has experienced past democratic failures are the most consistent predictors of democracy. Yet these are the variables with the least social‐scientific theoretical content. Our open economy distributive account of democratization provides one possible explanation for the observed spatial correlation, namely that it results from the fact that factor endowments are clustered in space—Europe is capital rich, Latin America is land abundant, and Asia has an abundance of labor. Dynamics in the international economy could have similar distributive effects within regions of similarly endowed countries. Yet our findings suggest that this is not the case—factor endowments have nothing to do with regime type. In addition to the well‐worn finding linking per capita income to democratization and stability, we are again left with “waves”: democratization in neighboring countries and the share of countries around the world correlate with domestic regime type."
