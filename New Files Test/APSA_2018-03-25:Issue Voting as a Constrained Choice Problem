"1","Prevalent empirical studies on issue voting in multiparty elections model vote choice as a comparison among utilities that a voter would derive from the policy offerings of distinct parties (e.g., Adams, Merrill, and Grofman 2005; Alvarez and Nagler 1998; Macdonald, Listhaug, and Rabinowitz 1991; Merrill and Grofman 1999; Rabinowitz and Macdonald 1989). Those studies aim to establish whether and, if so, how voters react to political parties' policy offerings and to evaluate the importance that voters assign to different policy domains. Indirectly, these models also speak to how parties should and tend to choose their policy stances.         "
"2","The previous literature on issue voting typically treats voters' choice sets as common and leaves the composition of such choice sets to researchers' discretion. While we have trust that researchers make reasonable decisions about the set of parties that the majority of voters would see as acceptable alternatives, we suspect that some voters may have choice sets that are larger or smaller than those imposed by researchers. This may occur for a variety of reasons. A voter may, for instance, be inclined to ignore specific candidates and/or parties if she deems them not viable or too extreme for her taste. If this is the case, conventional models, which assume that all voters choose from the same choice set, can produce biased estimates and lead to invalid inferences regarding the effects of voters' policy considerations on their vote choice."
"3","In this article, we evaluate the degree to which voters' individual (“effective”) choice sets vary and their influence on issue voting. We relax the assumption of fixed and identical choice sets and endogenize the effective choice set composition of individual voters. We do so by constructing a random utility multinomial model that combines the principles of the conditional logit (McFadden 1974) and the constrained multinomial logit (Castro, Martinez, and Munizaga 2013; Martinez, Aguila, and Hurtubia 2009). This model enables us to account for both the process that generates voters' choice sets and the process that guides a voter's choice among the alternatives included in her effective choice set. In addition, this model draws on the characteristics of voter–party dyads and can account for choice‐specific and individual‐specific covariates.         "
"4","We refer to the proximity and directional theories of issue voting, as well as to the literatures on strategic voting and party identification, to inform our theoretical expectations. We employ data from the 1989 parliamentary election in Norway to assess the implications of taking into account the process that generates voters' effective choice sets for our understanding of the policy–vote nexus. Our model provides a better fit to the data than the conditional logistic regression, even when they include the same independent variables."
"5","Our findings suggest that voters take into account only a subset of party policy offerings available to them, and their choice set compositions vary widely. Party identification and parties' relative electoral viability and policy extremity are not just other determinants of the observed vote choice, which compete for influence with policy considerations. Rather, they act as constraints in the calculus of voting and, relatedly, affect the relevance of parties' policy offerings on the support they receive from individual voters and the electorate in general. We find that the effect of policy considerations on vote choice is conditional on the composition of individual voters' choice set compositions and may be trumped by non‐policy constraints. In the concluding section, we discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of our findings and the constrained decision‐making model we present in this article for the literature on spatial theories of voting and for other fields of study."
"6","Elections give the public power to influence public policy. Whether citizens actually influence public policies largely depends on whether they vote, and how they factor alternative policies into their vote choice. Thus, the assumptions about voting behavior are critical components of any theory in which democratic elections serve as a means of representation. Do prevalent theories of elections make sufficiently realistic assumptions about voting? To what extent does violating these assumptions affect our understanding of the influence of party policies on vote choice and parties' electoral fates? How can we provide a more realistic picture of voting behavior and elections? These questions help develop our understanding of democratic representation."
"7","Downsian models of political competition (e.g., Aldrich 1983; Davis, Hinich, and Ordeshook 1970; Downs 1957; Enelow and Hinich 1984; Schofield 2008) are empowered by their assumptions about voting behavior, which connect voters' voting decisions to the similarity between their preferred policies and party policy offerings. Empirical challenges to these assumptions have led to rich literatures on spatial competition and issue voting, which still make strict assumptions about the composition of voters' choice sets. We argue that voters have differing effective choice sets, and these differences condition their policy considerations as they cast their votes. We propose a method for evaluating the factors of the composition of such choice sets and the influence of the policy offerings of parties that fall into voters' effective choice sets on their vote choices.         "
"8","One of the empirical challenges to the Downsian theory is about the conceptualization of the policy space. Downsian theory assumes that voters have single‐peaked preferences on a policy continuum. Rabinowitz and Macdonald (1989) propose an alternative conceptualization, which suggests that each policy dimension can be split into direction (a dichotomy) and intensity (a continuum). According to the directional theory, voters strictly prefer policies in a particular direction from a “neutral point” to those in the other direction. Voters' preferences over party policies with the same direction depend on voters' and parties' relative intensities. Rabinowitz and Macdonald's seminal article (1989) was the first among many testing the proximity theory of voting (i.e., the traditional spatial approach), the directional theory, and/or their combinations. Such studies provide mixed evidence of the relative performance of these distinct approaches. However, they make an important contribution to the literature on spatial competition by showing that parties' policy offerings matter for vote choice.         "
"9","Another important development in the literature on issue voting deals with the role of non‐policy factors of voting behavior. Similar to theoretical works on spatial competition, early empirical studies on issue voting treated voters' policy considerations as the sole determinants of voting behavior. Since behavioral studies suggest that non‐policy considerations of voters, including party identification (Campbell et al. 1960; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002), are of crucial importance for vote choice, it is no surprise that more recent studies usually include indicators of party identification and other non‐policy considerations as additional covariates (e.g., Adams and Merrill 1999; Adams, Merrill, and Grofman 2005; Iversen 1994; Merrill and Grofman 1999). When such non‐policy considerations are taken into account, fits of empirical models to data significantly increase.         "
"10","Yet another important caveat in the previous literature on issue voting is about the common assumption of sincere voting. Despite the extensive literature on strategic voting (e.g., Abramson et al. 2010; Alvarez and Nagler 2000; Cox 1997), most studies on issue voting, with the exception of a few focusing on voters' considerations of post‐election coalition making (e.g., Bargsted and Kedar 2009; Indridason 2011; Kedar 2005), tend to ignore voters' strategic considerations and hence provide at best a partial explanation of vote choice.         "
"11","In this article, we evaluate important assumptions that the theoretical and empirical literatures on issue voting make about voters' choice set composition. Previous works presume that voters' choice sets contain a finite number of parties, and the list of parties is fixed and shared by all voters (but see Steenbergen and Hangartner 2009; Steenbergen, Hangartner, and de Vries 2011).1 While this assumption may be rather innocuous in theoretical studies, its uncritical use in empirical research may have serious implications.         "
"12","First, if certain characteristics of voters that make them consider particular political parties (in other words, determine their choice set compositions) are correlated with their policy preferences, then failure to account for these factors may bias the estimates of the effects of policy considerations on vote choice. Likewise, if the characteristics of political parties that make them considered by individual voters are correlated with parties' issue positions, then failure to account for such endogeneity may bias the estimates of the effects of party policies on vote choice, and relatedly on spatial competition."
"13","To illustrate, consider the following example from Norway. The Conservative and Progress parties were the two most extreme right‐wing parties that contested the 1989 election. Mean respondent placements of these parties on the left–right scale are, respectively, 8.2 and 8.9. The spatial logic predicts that the voters with a self‐reported position of 9 or 10 would vote for the Progress Party, if they are presented with this alternative. However, the Norwegian data show that only 43% of 109 respondents at 9 and 10 on the left–right scale reported having voted for the Progress Party. In light of this apparent contradiction, we would not give justice to the spatial theory unless we also considered that 48% of these respondents strongly identify with the Conservative Party and that the Progress Party, by virtue of being that far to the right, may be too extreme to present a credible alternative to some voters."
"14","In fact, voters may dismiss some parties beyond their “region[s] of acceptability” (Rabinowitz and Macdonald 1989) as too extreme. Several studies evade this problem by employing an arbitrary threshold to exclude some parties from empirical analyses (Cho and Endersby 2003; Iversen 1994; Macdonald, Listhaug, and Rabinowitz 1991; Macdonald, Rabinowitz, and Listhaug 1998). Under some conditions, this may only exacerbate the problem, as, akin to censoring, arbitrarily excluding particular party policy alternatives from all voters' choice sets may also bias the estimates. In the example above, the exclusion of the Progress Party from the choice set would make us misclassify at least 43% of voters with extreme policy preferences who may have supported the party on the grounds of its policy offerings.         "
"15","Omitted variable and sample selection biases are not the only perils of ignoring the variation in voters' choice sets. We have other reasons to believe that choice set composition conditions the effects of policy considerations on vote choice. Party identification, arguably, not only biases a voter toward a particular party, but also makes her support for such and other parties' policies almost irrelevant. Likewise, the inclusion of two ideologically close parties in a single choice set can, in the absence of perfect coordination, disperse the vote of like‐minded voters. From a methodological standpoint, this means that a model that fails to account for the conditioning effect of the choice set composition is misspecified and thereby produces biased estimates. From a theoretical perspective, since the true effect of issue voting is conditional, we cannot meaningfully characterize it unless we specify the choice sets under which this influence takes place."
"16","Finally, the assumption that all voters have the same choice set conceals important theoretical questions, including that about the influence of the heterogeneity in voters' choice sets on position‐taking incentives of political elites. The presence of different segments of political markets changes the nature of the goods (i.e., policies) that political parties would supply to voters. Although this is not directly relevant to the estimation of the influence of policies on vote choice, it can nevertheless harm a larger goal of the models of issue voting—studying party competition."
"17","In this article, we aim to incorporate the process that generates voters' choice sets into a model of vote choice in a multiparty election. We build a random utility model that combines the features of the conditional logit (McFadden 1974)—a widely used method of modeling the vote choice in multiparty elections—and a class of multinomial models with varying choice sets from the transportation research (Cascetta and Papola 2001; Castro, Martinez, and Munizaga 2013; Martinez, Aguila, and Hurtubia 2009). Hereinafter, we refer to it as the constrained choice conditional logit (CCCL).            "
"18","Previous studies on issue voting treat a voter's choice as a result of her solving the following optimization problem:               "
"19","Following this tradition, we take the conditional logistic regression as our point of departure. Specifically, we treat the systematic component of the chooser's utility function as a linear combination of the variables defined over chooser–alternative dyads—that is, , since it is sufficiently flexible to incorporate the characteristics of each voter–party dyad (as well as those of voters and parties) in the analysis. In the context of issue voting, vector  describes the congruence between voter i's and party j's stances in different policy domains. For this reason, Alvarez and Nagler (1998) recommend this type of discrete choice model as a more appropriate method for modeling voting behavior than the multinomial logit.            "
"20","Our theoretical perspective on vote choice is different from the one in Equation 1: We suggest that voters disregard some political parties while making their vote choice. Formally, we assume that each voter has an individual effective choice set , a subset of the set of all parties (). Each voter, thus, makes her choice by solving the following optimization problem:               "
"21","To modify conditional logit to incorporate the process that generates effective choice sets, we borrow some principles from a random utility model with implicit availability of choice alternatives (Cascetta and Papola 2001) and the constrained multinomial logistic regression (Castro, Martinez, and Munizaga 2013; Martinez, Aguila, and Hurtubia 2009). In the latter, chooser i's random utility from alternative j includes a penalty term proportional to the log of the probability of alternative j's being in the chooser's choice set—that is, .            "
"22","Applying this approach to the conditional logit,2 we formulate voter i's utility from choosing party j as               "
"23","Parameter α scales the importance of the constraints on choice set composition vis‐à‐vis the choice determinants in the process that generates the observed choice. By setting this parameter to be equal to the scale parameter of the error term distribution, we make the penalty term increase with the unexplained variability in the individual voter's utility (in this, we follow Martinez, Aguila, and Hurtubia 2009). Denoting , the probability that voter i chooses party j can be expressed as follows:               "
"24","Notice that in this formulation, when the probability that party j is included in voter i's choice set is close to 0, the penalty term effectively “turns off” this alternative from the denominator. That is, the modeled voter essentially ignores this party and its policy stances while making her vote choice.            "
"25","Following the constrained multinomial logit, we parameterize the probability of inclusion in the choice set as inverse logit:               "
"26","In this context, the likelihood function is               "
"27","Thus, to find the maximum likelihood estimates of β, γ, and γ0, we use the following log‐likelihood function:               "
"28","The CCCL is not the only model of voting behavior that accounts for the variation in voters' effective choice sets. Alternative modeling strategies (Paap et al. 2005; Steenbergen and Hangartner 2009; Steenbergen, Hangartner, and de Vries 2011) take root in Manski (1977): For each choice set type, they formulate the probability of choosing each alternative from all possible choice sets and the probability of having that choice set. The choice probabilities are then derived as               "
"29","We find two major advantages of the CCCL over these models. First, the CCCL allows alternatives to have intermediate levels of inclusion in voters' choice sets, not only 0 or 1. Although the choice sets implied in the models that assign probabilities to specific choice sets are “crisp,” the choice sets implied in the penalized‐utility approach are “fuzzy” (Cascetta and Papola 2001). In addition, the models based on Manski (1977) suffer from “the curse of dimensionality.” The computational difficulty in estimating these models grows exponentially with the number of alternatives (e.g., specific parties) to be included in the universal set of alternatives. This difficulty impedes its estimation using (classical) maximum likelihood estimation, particularly when the number of alternatives is high.3"
"30","In our empirical analyses, we draw on two prominent theories of issue voting to inform the parameterization of , the policy component of voters' utilities. The first group of models presented in the next section is based on the proximity theory of voting, whereas the other is based on the directional theory.4 Both spatial approaches begin by placing all voters and parties in a policy space, but they differ in how they measure the similarity between voter and party locations in that space.            "
"31","According to the assumptions of the proximity theory (Davis, Hinich, and Ordeshook 1970; Downs 1957; Enelow and Hinich 1984; Schofield 2008), a voter's utility from choosing a party increases when the Euclidean distance between their policy stances decrease. Thus, we set the systematic component of a voter's random utility to               "
"32","According to the directional theory of voting (Rabinowitz and Macdonald 1989), individuals' and parties' policy preferences can be described as vectors drawn from a neutral point in the policy space to the policy position of that individual or party. Each voter's utility from the election of a particular party is measured as the scalar product of the voter's and the party's policy vectors. Thus, the systematic component of the voter's utility can be represented as               "
"33","Several institutional, organizational, and policy factors may influence whether a voter includes a particular party in her effective choice set. Such factors may condition the effects of voters' policy considerations on vote choice and make voters disregard certain parties, even if such parties put on offer more congruent policies. A voter's propensity to consider or disregard a particular party is a latent variable, which we capture through its effect on the policy–vote nexus and correlation with its known determinants. We limit our attention to three such determinants found in the voting behavior literature: the electoral viability of a party in a voter's electoral district, party policy extremity, and voters' partisan attachments."
"34","Party identification is often viewed as a strong psychological factor influencing voting behavior, which does not necessarily reflect voters' policy preferences (Campbell et al. 1960; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002). Although several studies of issue voting incorporate party identification in the empirical analyses, only a few ask whether partisan attachments of voters nullify the effects of policy considerations on voting behavior (Adams and Merrill 1999; Adams, Bishin, and Dow 2004; Kedar 2005; Lacy and Paolino 2010; Singh 2010). In a recent study, Lachat (2015) finds that party identifiers are less responsive to policy similarity with other parties. We suspect that voters with strong partisan affinities are less likely to view alternatives as relevant. We therefore introduce a dichotomous variable, strong affinity to another political party, which takes the value of 1 for each voter–party dyad in which the voter strongly identifies with another party.            "
"35","Scholarly work on the “psychological” effect of electoral institutions on voting behavior has long suggested that voters avoid “wasting their votes” on nonviable candidates and parties. Although the criteria of viability vary across electoral systems, there is evidence of this effect both under first‐past‐the‐post (Alvarez and Nagler 2000; Blais and Nadeau 1996) and proportional representation (Abramson et al. 2010; Blais, Erisen, and Rheault 2014; Cox and Shugart 1996). To the extent that voters do not vote with expressive concerns and a party has little influence on public policymaking, voters are unlikely to consider such a party in their calculus. For this reason, we view the relative electoral viabilities of political parties in voters' electoral districts as another important determinant of the composition of their choice sets.5"
"36","We approximate a party's electoral viability under the PR rule in Norway by multiplying its vote share with the district magnitude (i.e., its anticipated district‐level seat count). Our measure accounts for how close the party came to winning a seat in the voter's district in the previous election or, if it won any, how far it was from losing.6 District‐level electoral data were obtained from the Global Elections Database (Brancati n.d.).            "
"37","Finally, voters may avoid parties that take too extreme stances (Rabinowitz and Macdonald 1989). Some may also view such parties as infeasible or non‐coalitionable (Westholm 2001). To capture the extremity of a party, we calculate the Euclidean distance of the party's policy positions from the neutral point, following previous literature, that is, .7"
"38","We study the implications of taking into account the heterogeneity in voters' choice sets, using the data from Norway.8 The 1989 Norwegian Election Study has been used in a number of works on issue voting (e.g., Adams and Merrill 1999; Macdonald, Listhaug, and Rabinowitz 1991; Macdonald, Rabinowitz, and Listhaug 1998; Merrill and Grofman 1999; Rabinowitz and Macdonald 1989; Westholm 2001). It provides voters' self‐placement and their placement of seven parties on seven dimensions, namely, the traditional left–right continuum, protection of domestic agriculture against foreign competition, environmental protection, restrictions on immigration, private provision of health‐care services, deregulation and reduction of prices on alcoholic beverages, and harsher punishment of violent crimes. We treat the mean respondent placements as the true positions of parties on each issue dimension.9"
"39","Our dependent variable is the reported vote choice of respondents among seven major political parties (Labour, Conservative, Progress, Socialist Left, Christian People's, Center, and Liberal parties) in the 1989 parliamentary election in Norway."
"40","Table 1 shows the estimates of the conditional logit and the CCCL, based on the proximity (Models P1–P3) and directional (Models D1–D3) theories. While Models P1 and D1 are conditional logistic regressions that account only for voters' policy considerations, conditional logistic regressions in Models P2 and D2 add the covariates of choice set composition. Models P3 and D3 are CCCL estimates, with the determinants of the choice set composition parameterizing the probability of the inclusion of a party in a voter's choice set. We present these three sets of models (1) to show the added value of incorporating information about non‐policy considerations that affect voters' choice set compositions, and (2) to show the added value of the functional form we propose.10"
"41","The models that account for the determinants of the choice set composition (P2/D2 and P3/D3) have significantly higher values of log‐likelihood and lower values of Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) than policy‐only models (P1/D1), which speaks to the importance of non‐policy factors in explaining observed vote choices. Moreover, the CCCL regressions (P3 and D3) have better fits than the conditional logistic regressions (P2 and D2), even though they include the same covariates. The likelihood ratio tests show that the former have higher likelihoods than the latter (p < .01, d.f. = 1). AIC and BIC also favor the CCCL over the conditional logistic regression. Such differences point to the significant added value of the functional form we present."
"42","We also present the comparisons of the predicted and reported vote choices in Table 2. The CCCL estimates (Models P3 and D3) are closer to the observed vote distribution than those from the conditional logistic regressions (Models P1–P2 and D1–D2).11 In substantive terms, this corroborates our theoretical expectation that the choice set composition conditions the effects of policies on vote choice. The CCCL Models P3 and D3 predict 20% to 25% of the wrong predictions from the conditional logistic regressions (respectively, from Models P2 and D2) introducing the same set of covariates in the model equations. Aside from these increased fits to the data, the CCCL provides students of voting behavior and decision making with an opportunity to model the process that generates a decision maker's choice set composition. In the next section, we exemplify how such added functionality of the CCCL can be of use to the study of voting behavior and political competition from a spatial perspective.         "
"43","Our estimates show that voters, indeed, differ in the composition of their effective choice sets. To illustrate these differences, we use in‐sample predicted probabilities of inclusion in the choice set to compute a private effective number of parties (PENP) for each voter, following the logic of Laakso and Taagepera's (1979) effective number of parties.12"
"44","This indicator is close to 1 if the estimated probability of inclusion of a particular party in a voter's effective choice set is dramatically higher than the probability of inclusion of all other parties. It would approach the value of 7 if all parties had similar estimated probabilities of inclusion. As Figure 1 shows, Norwegian voters' PENPs significantly vary: They range from about one to about six parties. The distribution is also bimodal: A third of voters have two or fewer effective parties, and two‐thirds have PENPs higher than 3.5. This bimodality is due to the strong effect of party identification. Those with stronger partisan attachments have very low PENPs, whereas voters with no such attachments consider more parties in their choice sets. Note that 59% of voters according to Model P3 (71% according to Model D3) have PENPs below the effective number of parties by votes at the national level (4.8 in 1989). This suggests that the heterogeneity in voters' choice sets is as much a factor of the overall size of the Norwegian party system as the heterogeneity in voters' policy preferences.         "
"45","Our estimates also show that such differences are of crucial importance for vote decisions. According to Model P3, 53.7% of voters did not vote for the party with the highest policy component of their utility. Compare this against 34.7% of voters who did not vote for the party with the highest predicted probability. According to Model D3, these percentages are in turn 67.2 and 35.0. In fact, modeling individual voters' effective choice sets allows us to eliminate such high levels of deviance from observed outcomes in the spatial theories of voting.13"
"46","With the exception of party policy extremity in Model P3, all coefficient estimates for the factors of the choice set composition are statistically significant and in the expected direction. A unit increase in the electoral viability of a party doubles the odds that the voter includes the party in her choice set. Strong affinity with a political party, on the other hand, reduces the odds of an inclusion of any other party in the choice set by about 99.5% according to Model P3 and 98.6% according to Model D3."
"47","To see the conditional effects of these variables on the inclusion probabilities, consider Figure 2, which shows out‐of‐sample predictions of the probability that a party is included in a voter's choice set at different values of the covariates of interest. Note that we normalize predicted probabilities by rescaling our model predictions so that the probability that a voter without a strong identification to any political party would consider the party with the highest electoral viability and the lowest extremity in the sample is equal to 1. This normalization is needed because our models estimate the probability of inclusion up to a constant factor, which cannot be recovered from the estimates.         "
"48","As Figure 2 shows, strong affinity to a political party makes it unlikely that a voter would vote for another party regardless of the party's policy stances and electoral viability. The electoral viability of a party in the voter's electoral district has a significant positive effect on the probability of inclusion in the choice set, provided that the voter is not affiliated with another party. Electoral viability has almost no effect on the probability of inclusion if the voter is a strong partisan.         "
"49","As expected, party policy extremity is negatively associated with the probability that the party is included in the effective choice set of voters in the models based on the directional theory. However, the sign of the coefficient is reversed in the models evaluating the proximity theory. We suspect that the Euclidean distances included in the vote choice equation account for voters' distaste toward extreme parties.14 This positive coefficient may reflect the tendency of voters to disregard parties with insufficiently divergent policies.         "
"50","Because the major purpose of the models of issue voting is to improve our understanding of the effect of party policies on vote choice and spatial competition, we should answer how voters with different effective choice sets respond to the policy offerings of political parties."
"51","First, note that the inclusion of varying choice sets does not alter the sign of the coefficients of the policy variables. It does, however, change the substantive significance of the coefficients. In the models based on the proximity theory, policy congruence in all policy dimensions, with the exception of environmental protection, has smaller coefficients if we account for the varying choice sets. In the models based on the directional theory, policy congruence on all policy dimensions, however, has larger coefficients for all policies except health care.15"
"52","Figure 3a shows the predicted probabilities of voting for the Conservative Party mapped against a voter's position on the left–right scale. The dotted and dashed lines show the predictions, respectively, from Models P1/D1 and P2/D2 (conditional logit). Model P1, which ignores the variation in individuals' non‐policy considerations and choice set compositions, predicts that a unit change in a moderate voter's stance (from 5 to 6 on the left–right scale) increases the predicted probability of voting for the Conservative Party by 7 percentage points. Model P3, employing the CCCL, predicts a more substantial increase of 13.4 points. This difference suggests that the policy‐only Model P1 underestimates the effect of voters' policy considerations on their vote choice at the center of the policy space, where it matters the most according to the proximity theory.         "
"53","The CCCL predicts a lower effect of policy considerations at the extremes. For the proximity theory, Model P3 produces a marginal effect of 4.7 percentage points per unit at the right extreme (at 9), whereas the conditional logit (Model P2) predicts it as 14 percentage points. Likewise, when the policy utilities are specified according to the directional theory, the marginal effect of an extreme right voter's position on the left–right scale is 0.3 percentage points per unit according to the CCCL (Model D3); according to the estimates of the conditional logit (Model D2), this effect is 11 percentage points per unit."
"54","The CCCL also enables us to simulate votes using hypothetical choice sets. In Figure 3 b, we consider three hypothetical voters whose choice sets include some parties while excluding others. The dotted line (with round markers) represents the case in which a voter considers only the mainstream Labour and Conservative parties. The dashed line with diamond markers represents the case in which the voter considers the Labour, Conservative, Center, and Christian People's parties. The line with square markers corresponds to the case in which the voter's choice set also includes the Progress Party.         "
"55","In the case when a voter considers only the two mainstream parties, the probability of voting for the Conservative Party monotonically increases as the voter's own stance on the traditional left–right continuum moves to the right. The slope of its tangent dramatically increases after about 4.0 (i.e., the actual position of the Labour Party in 1989). At around 8.2, where the Conservative Party stood, this probability is around 0.9 for both models. The effect of policies on vote choice is the strongest in this scenario—the dotted line is steeper than other curves. In the second scenario, a voter's choice set also includes two center‐right parties. The effects of voters' policy considerations are again positive, but their substantive significance is diminished. An increase in the number of parties in voters' choice sets reduces the influence of voters' policy considerations on their votes (except strong partisans).16 This is noteworthy considering how close the latter case is to the conditional logit estimates in Figure 3a.         "
"56","In the two scenarios above, proximity and directional theories provide almost identical predictions. This is not the case in our third hypothetical scenario, which also includes the extreme right Progress Party. Model D3 accentuates the attractiveness of extreme parties when voters' preferred policies are also extreme and are at the same end of the policy spectrum. Our predictions from Model D3 show that the most extreme voters are not more likely to vote for the Conservative Party than less extreme voters. In this case, the probability that a voter votes for the Conservative Party never exceeds 40%."
"57","Previous literature identifies optimal policy positions of political parties by allowing a particular party to move by small increments on a given policy scale while holding the positions of voters and other parties constant (Adams and Merrill 1999). Using a similar approach, we simulate the predicted vote shares of the Labour Party (with the highest vote share in 1989) and its closest competitor(s). Figures 4a and 4b show the results of these simulations for the models based on the proximity and directional theories, estimated using the CCCL and conditional logistic regressions. In panels a1 and b1, the probabilities of including the party in the choice set are predicted with the estimation sample. In panels a2 and b2, the choice sets of all voters exclude the Socialist Left and Progress parties, as is often done in previous literature, and include all other parties with their estimated inclusion probabilities. In panels a3 and b3, all parties are included with a probability of 1. Panels a4 and b4 show the predictions of the conditional logit (Models P2 and D2).         "
"58","Our purposes in doing so are twofold. First, we examine the effects of the Labour Party's ideological stance on its and its competitors' electoral fates, as well as their governing potential. Second, we examine the extent to which the predictions of CCCL are vulnerable to the arbitrary exclusion of third parties from voters' choice sets."
"59","In none of the cases can the Labour Party win the majority; thus, its ideological stance does not affect its ability to form a single‐party government. Its ability to win the plurality—and, hence, be a likely formateur—is contingent on the assumptions we make about voters' choice sets. In the simulations based on the in‐sample probabilities and proximity theory, the Labour Party can win the plurality as long as it does not go too far on the extremes. In the simulations based on the in‐sample probabilities and the directional theory, the party obtains the plurality regardless of its ideological stance. If voters equally consider all parties (panels a2 and b2), it is almost always beaten by one of the competitors. This suggests that the ability to infiltrate voters' choice sets is an important component of parties' electoral fates."
"60","Three additional points are in order. First, the locations of the vote‐maximizing points illustrate the major difference between the proximity and directional theories. In our simulations based on the proximity theory, the Labour Party maximizes its vote share when it is closest to the median voter. According to the directional theory, the party maximizes its vote share when it takes an extreme left stance. Second, the shape of the predicted curve is almost invariant to the exclusion of extreme parties—that is, the Socialist Left and the Progress—from our simulations. This suggests that the CCCL properly weights down the contribution of these parties to the spatial competition at the estimation stage, thereby producing a more accurate picture of the spatial competition than the models that would exclude these parties altogether or include them as equally viable as the mainstream parties. Lastly, comparing CCCL and conditional logit estimates shows that the predicted vote (hence, seat) shares of parties differ to a large extent. These three points provide empirical support to our claims that excluding weak competitors from empirical analyses may lead to invalid conclusions when estimators other than the one proposed here is used, and voters' non‐policy considerations, which shape their choice sets, condition the effects of their policy considerations on vote choice."
"61","Since the composition of voters' choice sets is often not directly observable, prevalent models of voting behavior implicitly assume that all voters share the same choice set and leave the decision about the composition of such a choice set to researchers' discretion. We construct a model of issue voting that endogenizes the varying composition of voters' choice sets, and we show that our models provide more accurate vote choice predictions than conditional logistic regressions, even when they include the same set of covariates."
"62","This study shows that the influence of voters' policy considerations on their vote choices depends on their choice set composition. We obtain different predictions for the effects of their policy considerations depending on which parties are included in individual voters' choice sets. Moreover, the composition of voters' choice sets determines whether parties can become more successful by moving their policy positions. In this regard, our findings also speak to how political parties should change their policy stances if they wish to maximize their electoral gains. Apart from allowing researchers to model voters' choice set compositions, as determined by distinct short‐ and long‐term factors, this study has important theoretical implications for the analysis of party competition. As political parties choose their policies, they are unlikely to pay equal attention to all voters. Rather, they would be better off targeting voters whose choice sets include them. This finding suggests the need for more theoretical work addressing the incentives of parties that face voters with heterogeneous choice sets, which would produce more realistic Nash equilibria."
"63","The constrained choice conditional logistic regression also provides a partial solution to the problems emerging from the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption. This property of the conditional logistic regression, which is shared by many multinomial response models, is known to be particularly problematic when a voter tends to deviate from her true preferences depending on the composition of her choice set (Alvarez and Nagler 1998). Similar to other recent attempts in the literature (Gallego et al. 2014; Labzina and Schofield 2015; Yamamoto 2014), our model addresses this problem by incorporating the information about the variation in the sets of alternatives considered by voters in the systematic component of their utility functions. Since the focus of our project is on the variation in effective (i.e., unobservable) choice sets of individual voters, we focus here on a number of important policy and non‐policy factors that affect the composition of voters' effective choice sets.         "
"64","The model we present is also different from the constrained multinomial logit. In fact, the conditional logit framework that we take as our point of departure provides an opportunity to examine variables of interest not only at the chooser, but also at the chooser–choice dyad level: Especially important for our purposes is the similarity between voters' preferred policies and parties' policy stances. Moreover, unlike previous attempts in the literature on voting behavior (Paap et al. 2005; Steenbergen and Hangartner 2009; Steenbergen, Hangartner, and de Vries 2011), the CCCL provides a computationally less demanding means of incorporating information about the choice set composition.         "
"65","Finally, our investigation of individual decision makers' varying choice sets here focuses on only one of its many possible empirical implications. We believe that our approach can find a broader application outside the literature on voting behavior. It is particularly useful and applicable to cases when researchers (1) theorize about phenomena of interest in terms of two interrelated processes (i.e., the process that generates choosers' choice sets and the process whereby a chooser makes a choice), (2) do not have a direct measure of choice set composition, and (3) have data at the level of chooser–choice dyads. For example, the constrained choice conditional logistic regression can be used to model how governments, bounded by domestic and international constraints, choose public policies and how citizens, whose choice of actions is limited by social or institutional constraints, choose from among different means of political participation. In this regard, we hope further research will employ the constrained choice conditional logistic regression to assess empirical implications of theoretical models in other fields."
