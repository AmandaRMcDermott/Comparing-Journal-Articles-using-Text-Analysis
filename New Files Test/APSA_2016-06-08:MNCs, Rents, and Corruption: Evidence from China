"1","How does multinational corporation (MNC) activity affect corruption in host countries? The general account in the literature is that deepening economic integration tends to lower the level of corruption because integration increases market competition and efficiency and promotes the diffusion of good governance. Nonetheless, cross‐border economic activities are not immune from corruption. Wal‐Mart, for instance, has recently been alleged of paying bribes in Mexico and other emerging economies such as Brazil, China, and India to expand business. An investigation by the New York Times found that “Wal‐Mart de Mexico was an aggressive and creative corrupter, offering large payoffs to get what the law otherwise prohibited.”1 In 2006, Transparency International (TI) surveyed 11,232 business executives in 125 countries and found that foreign firms from giant exporting countries have a considerable propensity to pay bribes in operating countries, especially in low‐income countries (Transparency International 2006).         "
"2","These anecdotal evidences lead us to rethink the relationship between foreign investment and corruption. The existing literature seems to oversimplify the consequences of MNC activity on corruption in host countries. Foreign direct investment (FDI) undertaken by MNCs is different from other forms of capital flows, such as portfolio investment, in the sense that it involves the transfers of physical assets, human resources, and technology, while demanding deep engagement and long‐term commitment from parent companies. These distinctive characteristics give MNCs incentives and opportunities to exert potent influences on host countries."
"3","In this article, I examine the impact of MNC activity on corruption in developing countries and argue that MNC activity may contribute to rent creation in the host country through either exploiting high‐entry‐barrier markets or competing least efficient firms out of business, thereby giving rise to more corruption. High rents not only reinforce firms' ability to internalize the cost of corruption, but also increase government officials' incentives to engage in the quid pro quo exchange of their “control rights” for bribes (Ades and Di Tella 1999), consequently exacerbating corruption in the host country.         "
"4","To test this argument, I conduct a case study on China. Testing the argument presents challenges of how to measure corruption in China. I rely on “objective” corruption cases reported by the procuratorate (jian cha yuan) and collect an original data set on the number of filed corruption cases, the amount of recovered corrupt funds, and the number of senior cadres disciplined (at or above the county or division level, xian chu ji) for each province for two time periods—1998–2002 and 2003–07—to construct measures of corruption at the provincial level. As robustness checks, I turn to survey data and use the frequency of residents' witnessed corruption and the level of perceived corruption as alternative measures. Finally, I leverage a large firm survey conducted by China's National Bureau of Statistics and use firms' expenditures on entertainment and travel costs (ETCs) as a proxy for bribes. Empirical evidence shows that provinces with more MNC activity are strongly associated with a higher level of corruption, and firms in localities with more MNC activity in general pay more bribes. In addition, I find that economic development and government size are also significant predictors of corruption in China.         "
"5","The article proceeds as follows. The next section briefly reviews the literature and then develops an argument on how MNC activity may contribute to corruption in developing countries. Next, the article discusses research design, a testable hypothesis, and measurement of corruption. After that, systematic empirical analysis is conducted to examine the determinants of corruption in China. Finally, it concludes."
"6","Corruption is commonly defined as the “misuse of public office for private gain.” There is a large body of literature on the determinants of corruption. Yet, research on the impact of economic integration in general, and inward FDI and MNCs in particular, on corruption lags behind. The existing literature tends to suggest that deepening economic integration helps lower the level of corruption. First, the competition argument hypothesizes that increasing competition from foreign products and firms reduces the rents enjoyed by firms, thereby decreasing the incentives for corruption (Ades and Di Tella 1999; Sandholtz and Gray 2003, 765–66; Treisman 2007, 236). Second, economic integration may also affect corruption through diffusing such norms and values as economic neoliberalism, democratic governance, rule of law, and property rights protection, all of which help reduce corruption (Gerring and Thacker 2005; Kwok and Tadesse 2006; Sandholtz and Gray 2003). Therefore, the expectation is that the more deeply a country integrates into the global economy, the higher the likelihood that it will adopt these norms and values and will therefore be less corrupt. Third, MNCs may play with the exit option and leverage their bargaining power for favorable policy and institutional changes that may help curb corruption (Kwok and Tadesse 2006; Malesky 2004; Wang 2015).         "
"7","All the explanations are plausible. However, MNCs often adapt to local business practices and adjust their entry mode and market strategy to different environments. For instance, U.S. companies in China, rather than “compel Chinese competitors to adopt more ethical business practices,” adopt “Chinese‐style tactics [bribery]” to secure sales.2 Evidence based on firm surveys also indicates that MNCs are as likely as their domestic counterparts to engage in corruption (Hellman, Jones, and Kaufman 2000, 2002; Søreide 2006) and have a considerable propensity to pay bribes in operating countries, especially in low‐income countries (Transparency International 2006). Recently, scholars have devoted more attention to the negative consequences of MNCs on corruption. For instance, Robertson and Watson (2004) find that a rapid rate of increase or decrease in FDI leads to a high level of perceived corruption. Leveraging a list survey experiment in Vietnam, Malesky, Gueorguiev, and Jensen (2015) provide evidence that foreign firms are more prone than local firms to pay bribes in restricted sectors that yield higher rents. These findings suggest that the interactions between foreign firms and host countries are rather complex. When studying the impact of MNC activity on host countries, we need to take into account the specific characteristics of both MNCs and local environments.         "
"8","MNCs arise from exploiting their ownership‐specific advantages to overcome imperfections in arm's‐length markets (Caves 1996; Dunning 1992). To be able to invest in foreign countries, a firm must possess some firm‐specific assets (ownership advantages) that are sufficient to overcome the disadvantages it faces when competing with indigenous firms in the host country. These proprietary assets include, for instance, advanced technology, brand names, product differentiation, and managerial and advertising skills, which are of a public‐goods character and thus possess economies of scale. In order to protect and enhance their proprietary assets, MNCs actively adjust their entry mode and market strategy to local environments (Henisz 2000; Rodriguez, Uhlenbruck, and Eden 2005), and meanwhile pursue monopolistic or oligopolistic positions in host countries (Blomström 1986; Lall 1979b; Li and Resnick 2003, 182; Newfarmer 1979). This kind of conduct adopted by MNCs has important implications for understanding the consequences of MNC activity.         "
"9","When analyzing the effect of MNC activity on corruption, we need to explore how the distinctive characteristics of MNCs determine their market strategies in different host countries and the consequences of their conduct on corrupt activity. Since MNCs compete with very different groups of indigenous firms in developing and developed countries, this article focuses on the former, where local firms tend to be relatively small, weak, and technologically backward, and market structures are quite different from those in MNCs' home countries (Blomström and Kokko 1996, 2; Lall 1979b, 327).         "
"10","The political economy of corruption literature has convincingly shown that rents accruing from natural resources exploitation or a lack of competition in the economy foster corruption (Ades and Di Tella 1999; Rose‐Ackerman 1999). In this regard, MNCs may contribute to corruption in operating countries by increasing the amount of rents in the market.         "
"11","First, MNC activity may contribute to rent creation in host countries through entering into markets with high entry barriers that often deter indigenous firms. In developing countries, many market opportunities remain under‐ or unexploited, especially in industries with high entry barriers exercised by economies of scale, technology and capital requirements, product differentiation, and so on. Nonetheless, it is exactly the existence of these entry barriers that gives rise to MNCs (Caves 1996; Dunning 1992). The proprietary assets possessed by MNCs enable them to enter into these markets. Because of the existence of entry barriers and consequent lack of competition, potential rents in these markets are high. The entry of MNCs helps to overcome these barriers and hence extract high rents in these markets.         "
"12","Furthermore, the public‐goods nature and economies of scale inherent in the proprietary assets often drive MNCs to pursue monopolistic or oligopolistic market positions (Blomström 1986; Lall 1979b; Li and Resnick 2003, 182). After entering into these under‐ or unexploited markets, MNCs may create and thereafter enhance entry barriers for new entrants by introducing new technology and differentiated products and raising capital intensity of production. Moreover, MNCs may collude with or lobby host governments to shelter them from foreign counterparts' competition (Dunning 1992). As a result, firms enjoy high rents in these markets characterized by high entry barriers and limited competition.         "
"13","Second, MNC activity may increase market concentration by crowding out domestic investment, thereby contributing to rent creation. Multinational firms represent advanced technology, sophisticated managerial and marketing skills, easy access to international market, and so on. On the contrary, indigenous firms in developing countries are typically small, weak, and technologically backward. On the one hand, more competitive MNCs can take over local firms or drive the least efficient ones out of business, thereby decreasing market competition. On the other hand, domestic firms may adopt defensive mergers among themselves to fuse and amalgamate (Blomström and Kokko 1996; Lall 1979b). Many empirical studies have shown that FDI inflows and the presence of MNCs tend to increase market concentration and result in imperfect competition in developing countries (e.g., Blomström 1986; Blomström and Kokko 1996; Lall 1979b; Newfarmer 1979; Willmore 1989). When the market is concentrated and competition decreased, rents enjoyed by firms are typically high.         "
"14","The above discussions suggest that MNC activity in developing countries may contribute to rent creation. High rents enable firms to internalize the cost of bribes. To the bureaucrats in the host country who have influence over these firms, high rents increase the value of their control rights and therefore their incentives to engage in the exchange of their control rights for bribes (Ades and Di Tella 1999). Consequently, corrupt activities in the host country increase.         "
"15","One important note is that this argument does not necessarily suggest that MNCs are more likely than domestic firms to pay bribes. They may or may not. Rather, it claims that the attributes of MNCs and their conduct contribute to generating higher rents that give rise to more rent‐seeking behavior in developing countries. First, rents enjoyed by MNCs may spill over to domestic firms through various vertical linkages. MNCs often creates backward or forward linkages with domestic firms in the host country through procurement, subcontracting, or other cooperative arrangements (Fuller 2013; Javorcik 2004; Liu, Wang, and Wei 2009). Thus, these domestic upstream suppliers and downstream customers are able to share part of the rents. Second, as discussed before, the entry and presence of MNCs may increase market concentration or even result in a monopolistic or oligopolistic market structure. Firms in oligopolistic markets possess considerable market power and enjoy high profits regardless of the competition among them (Lall 1979a). High rents reinforce both MNCs, and domestic firms' ability to internalize the cost of corruption and increase the incentive of government officials to demand bribes.         "
"16","Recent corruption scandals involving both multinationals and domestic companies in China's automobile and pharmaceutical industries help to illustrate the above causal mechanisms. China's automobile industry is highly concentrated. Government regulations require foreign automakers to form joint ventures with domestic firms to get access to the market. With multinationals' technology, brand names, differentiated products, and marketing and advertising skills, these joint ventures have been able to take the lion's market share and obtain oligopolistic market positions. For example, in 2014 over 12 million passenger cars were sold in China, and the top five manufacturers (all joint ventures) accounted for about 49% of the total market share.3 With their enormous market power, multinational automakers have been accused of price monopoly and under the government's antitrust investigation.4 High rents enjoyed by automakers nurture corruption. For instance, the recent corruption scandal of First Automotive Works (FAW)–Volkswagen Automobile Co. has brought both FAW and Volkswagen into the spotlight. The Chinese government has launched an anticorruption probe into top executives at the joint venture for “suspected serious violations of discipline and law.”5 In addition, the huge profits accruing to the sales of its passenger cars and procurement of parts and components have led to many corruption cases involving its local suppliers and dealers.6"
"17","In the pharmaceutical industry, MNCs, with their advantages in technology, research and development, brand names, and marketing and advertising skills, are able to enter those high‐entry‐barrier markets such as brand‐name/patented drugs. Through adopting merger and acquisition tactics, they have established monopolistic positions, inflating the prices of medicines and enjoying huge profit margins.7 These market imperfections have generated huge rents, which not only enable firms to pay large bribes, but also increase the incentives of government officials, hospitals, and doctors to extract bribes.8 Multinational drug makers, such as GlaxoSmithKline, have been found to funnel large illicit payoffs to government officials and doctors through travel agencies, industry association, and project financing.9 Meanwhile, leading domestic pharmaceutical companies have undertaken a series of mergers and acquisitions to sustain and expand market shares.10 The oligopolistic market structure fosters corruption in the industry. Domestic pharmaceutical companies such as Sinopharm and Shanghai Pharmaceuticals have been alleged of bribery as well.11 Bribery is an “unspoken rule” in the industry. While the prevalence of corruption in China's pharmaceutical industry has its deep institutional roots, the entry and presence of MNCs have contributed to creating higher rents, thereby giving rise to more corrupt activities.         "
"18","To examine the relationship between MNC activity and corruption, I leverage the within‐country subnational variation in China. There are a few advantages for such a research design. First, cross‐national studies of corruption have mainly relied on perception‐based measures constructed by the TI, World Bank, or PRS Group. These subjective measures have received much criticism (see Treisman 2007). Second, as Knack and Azfar (2003) point out, existing studies on economic integration and corruption suffer from sample selection bias because small countries are less likely to be covered by most available corruption perceptions indices, and they tend to be more open naturally given their small domestic markets. When including more small countries in their sample, they find that trade openness does not affect corruption significantly. Third, by focusing on a single country, I am able to take advantage of multiple measures of corruption, both objective and subjective, therefore mitigating the concerns of measurement problems in cross‐national studies. Finally, China, the largest FDI recipient in the developing world and still a relatively underdeveloped country, provides an ideal case to study the topic. Despite its authoritarian regime, China is a very decentralized country (Landry 2008). Montinola, Qian, and Weingast (1995) argue that China is a de facto federal system. All of these justify the focus of subnational variation and the use of provinces as units of analysis. By focusing on China, I hypothesize that provinces with more MNC activity will be associated with a higher level of corruption.         "
"19","It is important to note that, in a large and diversified economy like China, MNC activity may contribute to creating rents in some industries and regions while reducing them in others. In addition, foreign firms from developing and developed countries may impact rent creation differently given the disparity in their levels of capital, technology, economies of scale, product differentiation and so forth. This study is intended to estimate the net effect of MNC activity on corruption in China.         "
"20","One big challenge is how to measure corruption within China. Two measures of corruption—subjective and objective—are commonly used in empirical studies. Subjective measures of corruption are indices of perceived corruption. These indices are aggregated from different surveys of international and local businesspeople as well as country experts and residents. Objective measures typically use the actual number of corrupt convictions as a proxy. The quality and reliability of both measures are questionable (see Treisman 2007). Subjective indices are measures of opinions of corruption that are largely influenced by respondents' cultural backgrounds, identity, and social norms.12 Opinions of international businesspeople and country experts are also biased because the majority of them come from advanced Western countries. The problem of objective measures is that they are a mixed reflection of true corruption and the efficacy of law enforcement. Recently, scholars have turned to other “objective” measures that survey people or firms' experienced corruption, such as the TI's Global Corruption Barometer and the World Bank Enterprise Surveys.            "
"21","To deal with the problems in measuring corruption, I adopt several strategies to check the robustness of the findings. First, I rely on objective corruption cases as a proxy. The advantage of this data is that the reporting and classifying procedures are standard across provinces and consistent over time. Moreover, the data allow us to examine different aspects of corruption, including the level of bribes in each corruption case, per capita corruption burden, and the frequency of high‐ranking officials involved in corruption. To deal with the fact that objective corruption cases are a mixed reflection of true corruption levels and law enforcement, I control for several measures of law enforcement in the regression. Second, I turn to survey data and use both “witnessed” and “perceived” corruption as alternative measures. The former is based on respondents' personal experience, which is arguably more objective and reliable. Finally, I utilize firms' expenditures on entertainment and travel costs (ETCs) as a proxy for bribes and examine whether firms pay more bribes in localities with more MNC activity."
"22","The procuratorate (jian cha yuan), part of the government's judicial system, is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases. Corruption is commonly defined as the misuse of public office for private gain. However, in China, corruption is defined more broadly. It is “virtually any form of ‘improper’ behaviour by either a state official or a member of the Communist Party” (Wedeman 2004, 896–97; see also Manion 2004). Since 1997,13 corrupt cases reported have included graft, bribery, and misappropriation of public property, as well as violations of civil rights and official malfeasance by state employees. Apparently graft, bribery, and misappropriation of public property are in accordance with the conventional definition of corruption. Ideally, the cases of the first three categories should be used as a measure of corruption. However, available data are not detailed enough to allow us to disaggregate corruption cases for each province. Fortunately, according to the data at the national level, the first three types of corruption account for an average of 82% of total corrupt cases filed during the period of this study (1998–2007). Therefore, even if corruption is narrowly defined, the filed corrupt cases can still be a good proxy.               "
"23","The most comprehensive and consistent information revealed by the procuratorate includes the total number of filed corruption cases, the amount of corrupt funds recovered, and the number of senior cadres disciplined (at or above the county and division level, xian chu ji). I have thus collected the data on these three categories by reading annual procuratorial reports for each province for the period of 1998 to 2007 to construct measures of corruption. To capture the severity of corruption, I first utilize corrupt funds recovered per filed case as a measure that addresses the level of bribes involved in each case. Second, total recovered corrupt funds are used to capture overall bribes. This variable is normalized by total population such that it gauges per capita losses or the burden of corruption. Finally, level of corruption can be high because more high‐ranking officials are involved. I employ senior cadres disciplined per 10,000 public employees to capture this dimension.               "
"24","It should be noted that corruption cases take time to detect, and the whole process of investigation and prosecution may last several years. Guo (2008) finds that the average latency period of corruption cases, referring to the time it takes to detect the corruption case since a public official commits a corrupt act for the first time, increases from about 3 years in the late 1990s to 5 years or even more in the early 2000s. In addition, the actual number of corruption cases investigated each year may depend upon leaders' political willingness and considerations. Thus, the annual number reported by the procuratorate at the provincial level may not well reflect each year's actual level of corruption. To deal with this problem, I take an average of these three corruption variables for two periods, 1998–2002 and 2003–07.14 All three variables are logged in order to deal with skewed distributions. Given that corrupt funds tend to grow over time, I include a dummy variable for the second period to account for the effect of the time trend.               "
"25","I utilize three variables to capture local government's anticorruption incentives and law enforcement. The first one is a score of bureaucratic integration (see Huang 1996; Sheng 2007).15 This score “gauges the propensity of provincial officials to comply with central policy directives by virtue of their future career prospects or prior career trajectories” (Sheng 2007, 414). Scholars have found that pro‐center provincial leaders are more likely to implement policies in accordance with the central government, fighting harder against inflation, and getting less favorable fiscal treatment (Huang 1996; Sheng 2007). Since anticorruption has been at the top of the central government's agenda (Wedeman 2005), I expect that the more centrally oriented provincial leaders are, the more vigorously they fight against corruption, and therefore more corruption cases are detected.            "
"26","The second one is a dummy variable of the four municipalities—Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin—directly administrated by the central government. These are four cities that have the same administrative status as a province. Given their unique positions in the administrative system, I expect that the central government monitors the four municipalities more closely, and therefore they fight harder against corruption and discover more corruption cases. The third one is a measure of the public's trust in the court system, which is constructed from two waves of the Asian Barometer Survey.16 In the survey, one question asks about how much trust respondents have in the courts. I first reverse the order of the responses and then take the mean for each province as a measure of the effectiveness of the court system. The public's trust in the courts can be influenced by corruption cases reported. However, corruption cases only account for a very small proportion of total cases accepted by the courts. For instance, in 2008, they are less than 3% of total accepted criminal cases and are only 0.35% of total accepted cases by the courts. In addition, the public's trust in the courts is also dependent upon people's personal experience. This variable is thus likely to capture the overall efficacy of the court system. I expect that the more trust the public has in the courts, the more effective the court system is, and therefore the more corruption cases it detects.            "
"27","Alternatively, we could use expenditures on public security agency, procuratorial agency, and the court of justice as a proxy for local government's anticorruption campaigns. However, this variable is problematic for at least two chief reasons. First, it is extremely highly correlated with total government expenditure, which is commonly used to measure the size of government in the literature.17 Second, more expenditures could result in more corruption rather than greater anti‐corruption efforts.            "
"28","The independent variable—MNC activity—is measured by the percentages of inward FDI18 and trade by foreign‐invested enterprises (FIEs) to GDP.19 In China, more than 50% of trade is conducted by FIEs for the period of this study, and a substantial part is actually intra‐firm trade. In this sense, trade to a large extent reflects foreign firms' activity rather than market competition. In addition, trade may give rise to opportunities for corruption that is related to customs clearance and the distribution of import licenses and quotas (Knack and Azfar 2003, 3). I conduct a principal component factor analysis of these two variables and use the first principal component score as a measure of MNC activity.            "
"29","In the regression, I also control for a number of covariates commonly identified in the literature as determinants of corruption, including economic development (GDP per capita), economy size (GDP), country size (population), government size (government expenditure, number of public employees), relative wages, education, and gender (share of female public employees). Detailed discussions of their measurement and data sources are presented in Supporting Information I."
"30","Previous studies have suggested that higher levels of corruption reduce FDI inflows (e.g., Wei 2000). Therefore, it is possible that corruption “selects out” certain types of investors in the first place and leads to less inward FDI. Nonetheless, since this article argues that MNC activity leads to corruption, if the endogeneity and selection bias at the first stage were corrected, we would observe higher levels of MNC activity in more corrupt localities and hence a larger effect of MNCs on corruption. In such a case, OLS regressions tend to underestimate the positive effect of MNC activity. Endogeneity is not a serious concern. To precisely estimate the coefficient of MNC activity and to deal with possible endogeneity and selection biases, I construct an instrumental variable—weighted geographic closeness—for MNC activity using the summation of multiplicative inverses of bilateral geographic distances between each provincial capital and the five major economic centers—Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo—around China, weighted by the five economies' real GDP per capita. This instrumental variable (IV) is rooted in the gravity models of international trade and FDI flows (see, e.g., Carr, Markusen, and Maskus 2001; Loungani, Mody, and Razin 2002; Markusen 1995). Detailed discussions of the instrumental variable and sensitivity analysis of the IV exclusion restriction are presented in Supporting Information III and IV.            "
"31","I estimate the following two‐stage least square (2SLS) model:            "
"32","Equations 1 and 2 represent the first‐ and second‐stage regressions, respectively.  and . To deal with possible heteroskedastic errors, the generalized method of moments (GMM) is used in 2SLS estimation.         "
"33","As discussed before, OLS regression tends to underestimate the coefficient of MNC activity on corruption.20 Model 1 in Table 1 presents the 2SLS regression results using recovered corrupt funds per filed case as the dependent variable. In the first‐stage regression, the instrumental variable strongly predicts provincial level of MNC activity, and the F‐statistic of the (excluded) instrument is 45.92,21 which suggests that the instrumental variable is valid and strong (see Bound, Jaeger, and Baker 1995; Staiger and Stock 1997). In the second‐stage regression as shown in Model 1, the coefficient of MNC activity is 0.49 and statistically significant at 1%, which supports my argument that MNC activity contributes to corruption.            "
"34","Given that the dependent variable is a mixed reflection of true corruption and the efficacy of law, to estimate the direct effect of MNC activity on corruption, in Models 2, 3, and 4, I respectively add three variables—bureaucratic integration, a dummy variable of the four municipalities, and the public's trust in the court system—as proxies for local government's anticorruption efforts and law enforcement. We can see that all three variables have expected regression signs, and the coefficient of the four municipalities dummy is statistically significant. After we control for local government's anticorruption efforts and law enforcement, MNC activity still has a positive and significant effect on corruption. Model 5 controls for the three variables simultaneously. Substantively, in Model 5, all else being equal, one standard deviation increase in MNC activity will raise corrupt funds recovered per filed case by 0.49 units, which are about ¥16,323 or $2,145 per filed case,22 which roughly equals 65% of the national average annual wage in 2007. The coefficient is both statistically and substantively significant. In addition, the results in Model 5 show that economic development (GDP per capita) significantly decreases corruption. All else being equal, one standard deviation change in GDP per capita decreases corrupt funds recovered per filed case by 0.48 units, approximately ¥16,212 or $2,130 per filed case. A bigger government is strongly associated with higher levels of corruption. One standard deviation increase in government expenditure or the size of public employees will result in more recovered corrupt funds per filed case by 0.34 and 0.32 units, respectively (roughly ¥14,066/$1,848 and ¥13,730/$1,804 per filed case), when all other variables are held constant.            "
"35","The degree of corruption may also relate to the burden of corruption on the entire population. To capture the second dimension, I use recovered corrupt funds per capita as an alternative measure. Results are presented in Model 6. We can see that MNC activity has a positive and significant effect on per capita corruption losses. Substantively, one standard deviation increase in MNC activity will raise per capita corruption losses by 0.29 units, which are about ¥1.34 or $0.18 per capita, when all other variables are held constant. The severity of corruption may be connected to the number of high‐ranking government officials involved as well. Thus, I construct a third measure of corruption—senior cadres disciplined per 10,000 public employees. Results in Model 7 indicate that MNC activity is strongly associated with a high frequency of senor cadres involved in corruption. All else being equal, one standard deviation increase in MNC activity will raise the frequency of senior cadres involved in corruption by 0.22 units, which are roughly 1.25 corrupt senior cadres per 10,000 public employees."
"36","To summarize the results in Table 1, the most significant finding is that MNC activity leads to more corruption in China in terms of the amount of corrupt funds recovered in each filed case, per capita corruption losses, and the frequency of senior cadres involved. In addition, the results show that economic development and government size are also strong predictors of corruption in China.            "
"37","One caveat of the above results is that the dependent variables are a mixed reflection of the underlying true level of corruption and the efficacy of law. It might be the case that MNCs help improve domestic governance and the rule of law, thereby leading to more corruption detections. Although I have employed three variables—bureaucratic integration, a dummy of the four municipalities, and public trust in courts—to control for local government's anticorruption efforts and law enforcement, they might not capture the whole picture. For further robustness checks, I turn to survey data and use people's witnessed and perceived corruption as alternative measures. If MNCs did improve domestic governance and the rule of law rather than lead to more corruption, people would witness less corruption and have a more favorable opinion of corruption in provinces with more MNC activity. To construct indices of witnessed and perceived corruption, I use data from the China Module of the 2008 Asian Barometer Survey, which includes questions asking inhabitants whether they have witnessed corruption and their opinions about local corruption.23 The 2SLS regression results are presented in Table 2.24"
"38","We can see that MNC activity has a positive and significant coefficient in both models. All else being equal, one standard deviation increase in MNC activity will raise the frequency of witnessing corruption by approximately 9% (1.21 standard deviations of the dependent variable) and the level of perceived corruption by approximately 0.15 units (0.73 standard deviations of the dependent variable). Both coefficients are substantively large."
"39","Although we have concerns that the positive relationship between MNC activity and corruption measured by objective cases might be attributed to the fact that MNCs contribute to the improvement of domestic governance and the rule of law, thereby leading to more corruption detections, if this were really the case, we should observe that people witness less corruption and perceive corruption more favorably in localities with more MNC activity. However, the empirical results suggest that MNC activity is positively and significantly associated with both witnessed and perceived corruption. These findings mitigate our concerns that corruption cases are simply the results of law enforcement and provide evidence that measures based on corruption cases do capture the true level of corruption."
"40","The empirical results so far have demonstrated that provinces with more MNC activity are associated with higher corruption levels in China. My argument suggests that MNC entry and presence increase market concentration, which results in higher rents, thereby leading to more rent‐seeking activities. Two questions still remain: Do firms in provinces with more MNC activity actually pay more bribes? And to what extent does MNC activity contribute to corruption through increasing market concentration? To answer these two questions, I take advantage of a large firm survey conducted by China's National Bureau of Statistics in 2005. The survey contains information on firms' expenditures on entertainment and travel costs (ETCs), which are a standard expenditure item publicly reported in firms' accounting books. In this sense, the information is not subject to the biases that are commonly found in subjective survey data. In addition to legitimate expenses, the ETC accounting category is commonly used to “reimburse expenditures used to bribe government officials, entertain clients and suppliers, or accommodate managerial excess” (Cai, Fang, and Xu 2011, 56–57). Such practices are also well known and have been adopted by MNCs in China.25 Recently, scholars have used ETCs as a measure of bribe payment (e.g., Cai, Fang, and Xu 2011; Wang 2013). Following these studies, I utilize ETCs normalized by firms' total revenues as a proxy for bribes.26 Since we are interested in whether firms operating in an environment with more MNC activity pay more bribes, the key independent variable is MNC activity at the provincial level. To deal with possible endogeneity, I again use weighted geographic closeness as an instrumental variable for MNC activity. In addition, I control for per capita GDP, total GDP, and population at the provincial level, and market size, growth rate, asset intensity, scale economies, government helpfulness, and tax burden at the two‐digit industry level. For firm‐level covariates, I include a full set of firm ownership dummies—state‐owned enterprises (SOEs), collective, private, foreign (Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan [HMT] versus other countries [non‐HMT]), and mixed (reference category), total revenue, whether the firm sells to other provinces, proportions of sales to the government and SOEs, years of relationship with major clients and suppliers, number of licenses required, CEO pay, degree of interaction with the government, and a dummy variable indicating whether or not the general manager is appointed by the government.27 Given the structure of the data, I estimate a multilevel model (MLM) with varying intercepts at both the industry and provincial level. Results are presented in Table 3.            "
"41","The results indicate that MNC activity is strongly and positively associated with more bribe payments proxied by firms' expenditures on ETCs. Substantively, taking Model 1 for example, all else being equal, one standard deviation increase of MNC activity will raise firms' expenditures on ETCs by 1.16% (the mean value in the sample is 1.08%). In addition, the results show that foreign firms with non‐HMT origin actually have higher expenditures on entertainment and travel when compared to mixed‐ownership firms. These findings provide strong evidence to the central claim in the article that MNC activity contributes to rent creation, which leads to a higher level of bribes in general."
"42","Then to what extent do MNC entry and presence contribute to corruption through increasing market concentration? To address this question, we need fine‐grained, industry‐level data to measure market concentration, as MNCs often compete and obtain a monopolistic or oligopolistic position in a niche market given their highly differentiated products (Lall 1979a). I utilize the 2003 data from the China Industrial Enterprises Database28 to construct measures of market concentration—four‐ or eight‐firm concentration ratio (output share of the largest four or eight firms)—at the four‐digit industry level within each province. Then this variable is aggregated to the two‐digit level using industrial output as a weight and merged with firms' ETCs data.29 To measure MNC activity at the two‐digit level, I use the output share of foreign firms. In the regression, I also control for a number of industry‐level covariates—market size, growth rate, asset intensity, and scale economies—that are identified to be important determinants of market concentration (see Blomström 1986; Lall 1979b), as well as province‐level covariates.            "
"43","To explore the mediation effect, I first regress market concentration on foreign presence, then ETCs—our proxy for bribes—on foreign presence, and finally ETCs on both foreign presence and market concentration.30 Again, MLMs are used to estimate the coefficients, and results are shown in Table 4. The first three models use foreign presence as the independent variable. The results show that foreign presence is a strong predictor of market concentration (Model 1), and it is also positively associated with firms' expenditures on ETCs, but the coefficient is not statistically significant (Model 2).31 When we introduce market concentration into Model 2, this variable is a strong predictor of firms' ETCs, and meanwhile the coefficient of foreign presence decreases from 0.15 to 0.01 (Model 3). In Models 4–6, I disaggregate foreign presence into HMT and non‐HMT origin, since we may expect that firms with non‐HMT origin are more likely to increase market concentration because they tend be larger, more capital intensive, and more technologically advanced compared to firms with HMT origin. The results indeed indicate that foreign presence of non‐HMT firms is strongly associated with high levels of firms' ETCs, and this positive relationship is mediated by market concentration.32 This exercise provides some evidence that foreign presence, especially non‐HMT firms, leads to higher levels of bribes partially through increasing market concentration (see more discussions in Supporting Information V). While we are not able to identify a positive mediation effect for foreign presence of HMT firms, when we disaggregate total FDI inflows into HMT and non‐HMT origin and use the three measures of corruption based on filed cases, results suggest that both types of FDI are positively and strongly associated with corruption (see results in Supporting Information VI).            "
"44","Today, both developed and developing countries are wooing foreign investors, as it is believed that foreign investment helps to create jobs, boost exports, and stimulate economic growth. In addition to these benefits, foreign investment may also generate some unintended consequences. In this article, I examine the impact of MNC activity on corruption in developing countries and argue that MNC activity can lead to more corruption by contributing to rent creation. Empirically, I conduct a case study on China, drawing from original data on objective corruption cases and utilizing both individual and firm survey data to construct alternative measures of corruption. Robust and consistent empirical results support my argument that localities with more MNC activity have higher corruption levels."
"45","My findings are at odds with the conclusions from one recent study by Wang (2015). Wang suggests that firms that are not politically connected (i.e., MNCs from outside of the China circle) have incentives to push for judicial fairness and empowerment, thereby contributing to the improvement of the rule of law in China. He acknowledges that the rule of law in China is partial in the sense that it improves judicial fairness and efficiency only in the economic realm, and not in the political realm. My study focuses on the consequences of MNCs on rent creation and argues that the entry and presence of MNCs generate higher rents by either exploiting high‐entry‐barrier markets or increasing market concentration through competing the least efficient firms out of business, thereby giving rise to more opportunities for corrupt behavior. I find that inflows of both HMT and non‐HMT FDI contribute to corruption in China. To some extent, the presence of non‐HMT firms is more likely to cause market concentration that is conducive to rent‐seeking activities. My results suggest that efforts to level the playing field in economic issues, such as commercial dispute settlement and contract enforcement (Wang 2015), are not strong enough to weaken forces that facilitate corruption more generally. Furthermore, the design of China's anticorruption enforcement tends to protect corrupt officials, in that party agencies have the advantage over the procuratorates to initiate investigations and party disciplinary actions routinely replace harsh criminal punishment (Manion 2004). Therefore, corruption is likely to grow with increasing rents accruing from MNC activity.         "
"46","To what extent can the findings from China be generalized to other developing countries? China is a transition economy, and much of the corruption can be attributed to this feature (e.g., Gong 1994; Kwong 1997; Lü 2000; Manion 2004; Sun 2004). Moreover, scholars have argued that large inflows of FDI into China are mainly due to its market distortions and institutional deficiency (Huang 2003). In such a context, the entry of MNCs is more likely to generate rents and thus gives rise to rent‐seeking behavior. However, that MNC activity contributes to rent creation and therefore corruption can take place in other developing countries as well. Journalist reports have provided some anecdotal evidence. As discussed at the beginning of the article, the bribery scandal of Wal‐Mart de Mexico is an example of how a giant MNC can change local market structures and rent‐seeking behavior.33 With its advantages in brand name, managerial and marketing skills, access to international capital, and so on, Wal‐Mart, since 1991, has opened more than 2,000 stores and restaurants and has become Mexico's largest private employer. Its sales represent about 2% of Mexico's GDP, and it controls 30% of all supermarket food sales in Mexico; its conduct has crushed other supermarket competitors and reshaped the economic landscape.34 With such a market dominance, Wal‐Mart is likely to enjoy high rents that enable it to pay large bribes of hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars. In its rapid growth in Mexico, “bribery played a persistent and significant role.”35 Apparently, more detailed case studies are needed to demonstrate the link between MNC activity and corruption in other developing countries.         "
"47","To further understand the consequences of MNC activity in China and other developing countries, future research should move to firm‐level analyses of the motivation and behavior of MNCs in corrupt and risky environments. We still know little about how foreign investors influence government policy in the host country and how they behave in corrupt and risky environments. For example, under what circumstances do foreign investors use bribing or lobbying or both to influence policymaking decisions in the host country, and how successful are they in obtaining favorable government policies? Which types of investors are more prone to corruption? How do foreign investors cope with corrupt and risky environments? How does corruption affect firms' investment strategies and entry modes? These questions are important to address in order to further unpack the linkages between FDI and corruption, and meanwhile provide fertile future research opportunities."
