"1","During the last half‐century, most scholars who have ventured to interpret Rousseau's general teaching have defended its fundamental unity. Some have done so without clear acknowledgement of any deep tensions within his thought—a task which can seem plausible enough so long as one, in practice, focuses chiefly or exclusively on a single aspect of it, such as the romanticism of his autobiographical writings or the republican virtue of his political writings. Other scholars have, more plausibly, attempted to show how his many apparent contradictions might somehow be consistent expressions of some deeper principle,3 or how one principle or stance can be judged to be his truest or most fundamental, despite substantial and largely unintended incompatibility among the ideals he praises.4 For our purposes, we will focus upon those who have shown how Rousseau presents multiple ways of life or kinds of society which are largely incompatible, some of which are nonetheless comparably defended by him. A seminal version of this approach is Judith Shklar's Men and Citizens, which argues that Rousseau presents two radically opposed utopias as “equally valid” (Shklar 1969, 4). She explains how one of Rousseau's main influences, Archbishop Fénelon, had used a similar tactic, which need not be self‐contradictory since these utopias are offered more in the service of diagnosing “the emotional diseases of modern civilization” than as empirical or attainable alternatives. Rousseau's models of “a tranquil household” and “a Spartan city” are not meant to be reconciled, but to show how each meets “the inner psychic needs of men for inner unity and social simplicity,” unlike the modern attempts to be half natural and half social, thus rending the self and generating neither true “men” nor true “citizens” (Shklar 1969, 1–6, 31n4, 57–58, 213; see E I, 39–40/248–49f).         "
"2","There can be little doubt that Shklar's distinction is illuminating, at least preliminarily.5 We might highlight, for instance, Rousseau's stark contrast of (on one hand) the true citizen's radical subordination of domestic life and repudiation of contemplative and universalist religiosity with (on the other hand) village life's embrace of sweet, “unspoiled family love,” which even allows gentle Christianity to flourish (Shklar 1969, 12–32, 160–61). Along these lines, Shklar's distinction may help us understand Rousseau's recurring contradictions between apparently sincere praises and forceful disparagement of cosmopolitanism (DOI II, 174/178; “Geneva Manuscript” I.2, CW 4:81/OC 3:287; cf. Todorov 2001, 26–30). Unlike the citizen, whose duties do not extend beyond the national borders, the cosmopolitan is not bound to any particular polity, but to humanity as a whole. Despite Rousseau's occasional praise for cosmopolitanism, it is clear that he saw patriotic fervor to be deeply necessary in the cultivation of citizen virtue, which is largely understood as love of the polity's common good over private goods (DPE 15–16, 20–21/254–55, 259–60f; “Geneva Manuscript” I.2, CW 4:79/OC 3:284). And since patriotism and cosmopolitanism are virtually impossible to combine in the same soul—and fully impossible to combine among an entire people—he seems to have found it necessary to preach patriotism one‐sidedly in civic contexts.6 This civic virtue is pursued through radical dedication to the polity's general will (DPE 13/252; DSA I, 13/14f), and generates a deep harmony among one's fellows, while naturally tending toward utter indifference and harshness to foreigners (E I, 39/248f; SC IV.8, 146–47/464–65). However, an alternative vision of a more private moral virtue is also prominent in his writings, and this defines virtue as the strength of will necessary to conquer one's passions, which naturally values and serves humanity as such (E V, 441/812f; cf. Reisert 2003, 8f, 107–13, 135). In another relevant contrast, within the political sphere he insists upon severely prosecuting the wicked (in the manner of the Spartans and early Romans), lest one indirectly become cruel to the innocent. Regarding personal virtue, though, he tends toward a (proto‐Kantian) maxim of “severity toward oneself and gentleness [douceur] toward others.”7 We may thus diagram a basic dichotomy of Rousseau's thought along Shklar's lines (Figure 1).         "
"3","                 The Shklarian Model                      "
"4","Nonetheless, in depicting these two “psychological poles” (Shklar 1969, 31), we might question whether Shklar has adequately depicted that of “man.” For equally formidable cases have been made that Rousseau's genuine alternative to his political ideal is the radically individualistic, proto‐romantic “solitary dreamer.” This aspect of his thought is emphasized by many writers, including those influenced by Leo Strauss. In Arthur Melzer's The Natural Goodness of Man, which is plausibly understood as the leading comprehensive Straussian interpretation, we find a largely dichotomous reading of the alternatives which Rousseau presents to civilized, divided humanity: “the political solution” and “the individualistic solution” (Melzer 1990, 91–108; see also Salkever 1978, 208, 223). On such readings, Rousseau is seen as rigorously consistent in his ultimate meaning, since he subtly indicates that his political solution—and with it, his many pronouncements in favor of virtue—ought to be read as merely intended for popular consumption.8 The one life which is currently available to moderns, and which receives true justification according to his most fundamental theoretical or philosophical principles, is that which he most boldly revealed in the Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality (Strauss 1953, 264; Conf. IX, 314/407). This is also very nearly the life in which he himself indulged in his later years—one of spontaneous, sentimental delight, shorn of human attachments, transcendent moral principles, and their corresponding obligations and burdens.9 While not entirely neglecting Shklar's idea of “man”—that is, the domestic and virtuous life of Emile and Julie—such readings would generally agree with Melzer in seeing this romanticization of domestic virtue and attachments as mere popularizations of Rousseau's genuine individualistic solution. On this reading, the latter solution is only attainable by someone with extraordinary intellectual gifts.10"
"5","If Shklar's distinction between citizen and man corresponds to Rousseau's contrast between civic virtue and domestic moral virtue, the Straussian distinction between the political solution and the individualistic solution largely corresponds to Rousseau's contrast between “virtue” and “goodness.” Unlike the demanding and harsh standard of virtue, this “goodness” is humanity's natural endowment (E II, 92/322; IV, 237/525; “Letters to Malesherbes” II, CW 5:575/OC 1:1135f; Strauss 1953, 290; 1959, 49–50). It is the healthy and natural expression of love of oneself (amour de soi), which—apart from the corruption of society and the development of pernicious self‐love or vanity (amour‐propre)—tends toward one's simple self‐interest with a minimum of harm to others, due to the influence of pity (DOI Preface, 127/126; I, 152–54/154–57; Note XV, 218/219). For our purposes, perhaps the most revealing contrast of the ethics of goodness with that of virtue is found in Rousseau's conflicting pronouncements regarding harm. For, in his teachings related to virtue—and especially political virtue—relevant others make binding claims upon us and not to overcome one's passions and dedicate oneself to them constitutes a severe harm (DSA II, 17/18; Observations, EPW 46/OC 3:51; LR 81/91; Preface to Narcissus, EPW 97/OC 3:965; LA 16, 117/262, 337f/15, 107). In his teachings related to goodness, however, the avoidance of direct and palpable harms to others, insofar as this can be reconciled with one's self‐preservation, appears to be humanity's sole moral requirement (DOI I, 154/156). It seems to be the latter standard to which the autobiographical Rousseau appeals. In surrendering himself to the sweet reveries of solitude, he asks for nothing from society and thus may offer it nothing in return.11 In this way he seems to suggest that duties differ objectively and to a very large extent, depending on one's social circumstances.12 Along these lines, then, we may depict a second Rousseauian contrast (Figure 2).         "
"6","                 The Straussian Model                      "
"7","One reason for choosing either the Shklarian or the Straussian dichotomy as the most accurate overall interpretation is that Rousseau himself characteristically frames his contrasts in a radically dualistic fashion. In this he follows a distinguished line of powerful rhetoricians such as Augustine—who are often, for this very reason, guilty of overstating their dichotomies (cf. Rist 1994, 310; Letter to Beaumont, CW 9:29/OC 4:937f). Thus if it remains the case that both dualisms illuminate basic elements of his thought, we might prefer a model which incorporates them both. And since they both include a similar “Citizen” category, we need only consider whether the solitary Dreamer and the domestically virtuous member of the village or the family might sensibly be distinguished, deciphered as significant for Rousseau, and placed alongside each other. Here we may find the work of Jonathan Marks helpful, since he has recently established that Rousseau repeatedly praises a “middle way” between the solitary individual and the collectivized Citizen (2005, 7–11, 54–88). Marks finds that although some of Rousseau's most prominent and well‐known formulations are framed dichotomously, his considered judgments frequently prescribe a social life based around the tribe or the family to be the ideal situation. In such a middle state of “independent commerce,” one may attain many of the sweet pleasures and cultivations of social life, while avoiding the radical interdependence and concomitant servility of advanced societies (Marks 2005, 12, 61–65, 77–82; see also Plan for a Constitution for Corsica, CW 11:134–35/OC 3:914–15). The virtuous and domestically sentimental life possible under such circumstances would seem to constitute “the happiness of the moral human” (E III, 177/444; V, 442–46, 474/814–820, 859). Whereas for Marks (as for many other recent commentators) this model based on Emile is clearly Rousseau's genuine ideal,13 we will suspend such final judgments. Instead, we will adopt Marks's argument for our own purposes and suggest that insofar as Rousseau variously recommends a middle state of limited societies in addition to the two better‐known extremes, we may schematize his thought as tripartite (cf. O’Hagan 1999, 19–20, 26–27, 272). Rousseau himself suggests a three‐tiered distinction soon after his famous “man or citizen” dichotomy, by saying that a father, in educating his son, “owes to his species men; he owes to society sociable men; he owes to the state citizens” (E I, 49/262; see Figure 3).         "
"8","                 A Synthesis of the Shklarian and Straussian Models                      "
"9","In addition to combining the insights of the Shklarian and Straussian approaches, this model links Rousseau's various moral prescriptions explicitly to three socio‐political contexts, thus enabling a better explanation of his apparently contradictory pronouncements. For Rousseau is, in one sense, a radically political and even deterministic thinker, maintaining that characteristic mentalities and habits naturally flow from certain social conditions, and that certain moral norms and obligations are proper to those conditions (cf. Starobinski [1957] 1988, 292). In terms of our themes of gentleness and severity, we find a clear continuum of the rigor of moral demands across these social conditions. The Citizen, in addition to being the harshest of these three to outsiders, is also called to be the harshest to himself. He is not to find his happiness in contemplative delights, and may take pleasure only secondarily (at best) in domestic ones. He must instead find his pleasures chiefly through immersion in all things public, and in deriving his delight from identification with the harmony and well‐being of the community.14 Accordingly, it is with regard to this social state—and not his moral teaching in general—that we find Rousseau making his most radically “constructivist” pronouncements. For, given the naturally asocial (or at least apolitical) character of humans and the aggressively competitive nature of amour‐propre among any large group of interdependent people, one must offer a correspondingly radical solution to minimize social interdependence and channel amour‐propre toward communally salutary ends. Instituting such a people thus requires, “so to speak, changing human nature” (SC II.7, 69/381; cf. E I, 40/250; DOI II, 177/182; DPE 4–5/242–43). In the formation of the “moral human” Emile, by contrast, Rousseau's depiction differs, speaking of “the natural man living in the state of society” (E III, 205/483; Reisert 2003, 21–22, 118–19), and of allowing natural potentials of “becoming social” to develop in due course (E IV, 290/600; “Moral Letters” V, CW 12:196/OC 4:1109). Emile combines a fundamentally cosmopolitan disposition and will, with rich domestic and neighborly associations, and extraordinary physical vigor. Although he is typically gentle, this vigor and dedication enable him to forcibly defend the weak or his country when situations require (cf. Julie I.57, 128/157; E V, 446, 456–57, 472–75/820, 834–35, 857–60). In addition, the methods applied to Emile's education seem much gentler than those applied to the Citizen, since Emile is spared from any commands of a guardian, from the terrors of a wrathful religion, and from regular immersion in the martial glories of his fatherland. Throughout his extreme social isolation during his boyhood and adolescence, he is spared from the unnatural and premature expansion of his passions. Thus when he comes to adulthood, the duties of virtue he learns are far less burdensome to him. At this point, nonetheless, the high degree of severity he requires in relation to himself is especially evident—in his need for natural religiosity, deep moral inspiration, and voluntary submission to his tutor (E IV, 324–26, 442–49/650–53, 814–24)—if he is to overcome his burgeoning passions when socially necessary (E V, 444–45/817–18; cf. Cohen 1997, 137n41).15 By final contrast, the autobiographical Rousseau chafes at all constraint and eventually surrenders himself to every natural impulse. He nonetheless maintains a dogged confidence that—despite his many prior interactions with society—he alone has maintained the soul of original, natural humanity, and that his natural goodness has been expressed in his deeper, abstract preferences even when social pressures led him to betrayal or abandonment (Cooper 1999, 194).         "
"10","Having distinguished three alternative ideals offered by Rousseau, may we be said to have outlined every fundamental social state or moral life he sketches? A further glance at existing interpretations may call this into question. Although what I have called the Shklarian and Straussian paradigms may be among the best‐known overall interpretations, other commentators have focused upon the “human types” or “cast of characters” presented by Rousseau, and have come across a broader array of possibilities (Cooper 1997, 51; cf. Todorov 2001, 3). Tzvetan Todorov, for instance, follows a different methodology than that employed here, and finds that there are three main ways of life praised by Rousseau: (1) the Citizen, (2) the physical and solitary individual, and (3) the moral and universal individual (Todorov 2001, 18). These ways converge nicely with what we have depicted, but in addition Todorov posits a distinction between the “state of society,” out of which each of these lives flow, and the “state of nature.” Whereas the difference between the state of nature and the state of society constitutes a crossing from one stage to another, the contrast of lives following upon the state of society constitutes an alternative (Todorov 2001, 13). However, Todorov does not consider the state of nature fully among the human ways of life, since on his reading of Rousseau, “The notion of a state of nature is only a mental construct, a fiction intended to help us comprehend reality, not a simple fact” (Todorov 2001, 10; see also 13, 47–48; 2002, 82–84).         "
"11","A still more comprehensive picture is offered by Laurence Cooper, who deciphers five human types representing “the fundamental alternatives that are or have been available to humanity” (1999, 51f; see also 17–26, 51–59; 2008, 139–40, 148–49, 166–69, 175–76). Again converging with our analysis above, among these types are (1) “the virtuous citizen of the ancient, austere polis,” (2) “the Jean‐Jacques of the Reveries and selected other autobiographical depictions,” and (3) “Emile,” a natural man living in the state of society (1999, 51).16 In addition, Cooper posits—like Todorov, but as a once‐possible alternative— (4) “the inhabitant of the pure state of nature”: a “savage” who is “asocial and pre‐moral” (1999, 51, 54). And finally but least admirably, we find (5) “the divided, corrupt social man, exemplified most commonly by the bourgeois but most perfectly (according to Rousseau) by the vain, malicious philosophers who conspired against Jean‐Jacques” (1999, 51).17 Among these, it is only the divided social man who has in no sense a good or natural life, since he “lacks both moral and psychological integrity, [living] in contradiction with nature in the deepest sense” (1999, 52; cf. 1).         "
"12","If we combine Cooper's savage and his divided social man with Todorov's distinction between stages and alternatives, we may conclude that both the savage and the divided social man represent stages, with the latter being the usual historical outcome of the former (cf. Cooper 1999, 52; Neuhouser 2008, 65, 117). This suggests, in turn, that if we are to understand properly the world‐historical alternatives presented by Rousseau, we must carefully investigate not only the lives he endorses as contemporary alternatives, but also his broader (and often critical) philosophy of history. Here we approach better‐trodden interpretive territory, since his basic philosophy of history is apparently presented systematically in the Second Discourse, a relatively brief and frequently read work. According to the best‐known version of its historical narrative, humans had lived for ages untold in isolated self‐sufficiency, living entirely in the moment from the spontaneous fruits of the earth (DOI I, 143/144), with a childlike peacefulness in relation to others, whom they had no vested interest in harming. Their needs were minimal, purely physical, and thus easily satisfied; their days were spent freely enjoying humanity's natural laziness in a “delicious indolence” (DOI I, 134/135; 150/152; II, 187f/192; Note X, 208/211; EOL IX, 272n/401n; “The State of War,” LPW 169/OC 3:605). This idyllic state was brought rapidly to a close, however, due to various accidental and external causes, such as the seizure of private property and the founding of states, thus forcing others to leave the natural state for the sake of survival (DOI II, 173f/178; E III, 193/467; “The State of War,” LPW 167/OC 3:603). The “civilization” that was then quickly established is characterized by vanity, fierce ambition, and cruel exploitation. Its feigned order and violent essence may best be exemplified by war, in which “more murders were committed in a single day's fighting, and more horrors at the capture of a single town, than had been committed in the state of Nature for centuries together over the entire face of the earth” (DOI II, 174/179; see also “The State of War,” LPW 162–63, 167/OC 3:608–10, 603). Rousseau's philosophy of history thus seems to suggest a fundamental historical dualism (Figure 4).         "
"13","                 A Dualistic Model of the Philosophy of History                      "
"14","Regardless of the ultimate historical status of the state of nature, Rousseau is quite clear that there can be no return en masse to the forests and the savage state (DOI Note IX, 203–4/207–8f). This provides further justification for not modeling it alongside the three alternatives he prescribes, in various ways, for his contemporary readers. An additional complication arises in considering whether Rousseau's primitive history can be adequately characterized as a single stage. Arthur Lovejoy and Jonathan Marks are among the more careful scholars who have insisted upon the significance of a middle historical stage, between what we may call the “primitive” stage of the “pure state of nature” and the stage of advanced civilization.18 Rousseau refers to this middle stage as “nascent society,” in which comparative judgments, amour‐propre, and the development of reason and foresight have been set in motion, with deeply ambivalent consequences for humanity, which we will explore below (DOI II, 162–67/165–71). Even with the beginnings of amour‐propre, however, an intensive social interdependence could not exist before the invention of agriculture and metallurgy (168/171f; cf. EOL IX, 272/400). And it is interdependence which seems to be the decisively negative turning point, since as long as humans applied themselves only to tasks and arts “that did not require the collaboration of several hands, they lived free, healthy, good, and happy as far as they could by their Nature be, and continued to enjoy the gentle sweetness of independent association [des douceurs d’un commerce independant] … ” (DOI II, 167/171; see Melzer 1990, 70n2, 74–81, 108, 290).19 Although Rousseau's discussion of this middling stage is terse and—like the “middle way” represented by Emile—often overlooked, he explicitly states that it occupied “a just mean between the indolence of the primitive state and the petulant activity of our amour‐propre, [and thus] must have been the happiest and the most durable epoch” (DOI II, 167/171; cf. Marks 2005, 64–65; Melzer 1990, 70; Masters 1968, 168, 171–75). It seems significant enough to include in our basic model, then, and upon consideration, these three stages seem to be differentiated by precisely the same social structures which differentiate the three prescriptive types. Although some scholars have previously identified parallels between a descriptive type and a prescriptive type (e.g., Marks 2005, 70–71, 77–79), to my knowledge none have anticipated the following systematic analysis (Figure 5).         "
"15","                 The Basic Sociopolitical Typology                      "
"16","We must pause to explain the terminology, since Rousseau's usage of “savage” seems looser than his underlying concepts (cf. E II, 108n/345n; DOI II, 166/170). On one hand, he is remarkably clear in distinguishing the two states in question. The earliest state of humanity, which occurs in “the pure state of nature” or “the primitive state” (DOI I, 141–42, 159/142–43, 162), is one in which a human might meet another “perhaps no more than twice in their life” (144/146; cf. II, 161/164f). In some passages these terms are explicitly contrasted with a nascent state of society, which is characterized by “independent association,” and exemplified by “most” of the “Savage Peoples who are known to us” (DOI Exordium, 132/132; I, 157/160; II, 166f/170; Note XV, 218/219). On the other hand, perhaps due to the polemical requirements of the Second Discourse in contrasting noncivilized life favorably with civilized life, his terminology regarding these peoples is far less clear, referring to them indiscriminately as “Savage,” in dualistic opposition to “civilized” (DOI I, 157/159f; Marks 2005, 101). By contrast, we shall see below how the Essay on the Origin of Languages uses “Savage” in a narrower, technical sense, referring to a minimally socialized people who subsist chiefly by hunting. Partially on this basis, then, I introduce “Primitive” as a noun to refer to people of the solitary, primitive state. When applying Rousseau's broader use of “Savage” in an instance which clearly refers to one or another social state, I will add a prefix: “solitary‐Savage” or “social‐Savage.” For his overarching category of “Savage,” I will often substitute “noncivilized.”         "
"17","The plausibility of this model hinges largely upon a distinction between diagnostic (or descriptive, or critical) and prescriptive (or constructive) teachings in Rousseau. This distinction is central to Kant and later Kantian interpreters of Rousseau, while also appealed to by non‐Kantian interpreters, such as the Straussians.20 Put simply, the two early Discourses are understood as diagnosing the ills of modern society, in terms so bleak they often seem hopeless; whereas later works (including Julie, Emile, and the Social Contract) propose various remedies for those ills, none of which involve a return to the state of nature. Some disputes properly remain regarding how unqualifiedly this distinction may be applied, such as the extent to which the patterns exemplified in the diagnostic thought are retained and reapplied in the prescriptive thought (Marks 2005, 70–79, 113–15; cf. Todorov 2001, 18). Nevertheless, the model seems accurate insofar as it suggests a clear distinction between a philosophy of history—depicting the usual course of human social development and moral decline—and a series of proposals for radically breaking from this process and thus avoiding its “civilized” end. We have seen how, in his most prominent narrative, Rousseau attributes the rise of civilization to accidental factors which are external to human nature (DOI Preface, 124/122f; I, 137f, 159/138, 162; E IV, 212/491). Nonetheless, he simultaneously maintains that this process has unfolded with overwhelming uniformity, and in accordance with human capacities which he acknowledges to be latent. This has drawn intelligent criticism from the beginning.21"
"18","However his persuasiveness on this point may be challenged, we have seen that he does not believe returning to an earlier, spontaneous social state is an option. Thus for any prescriptive solution, breaking from the course of civilization requires a mind and will powerful enough to transcend the usual course of thought and life in instituting a new way. If this were not daunting enough, certain highly favorable social conditions also seem to be required. In the case of the political solution, “the Legislator” along the lines of Lycurgus is required—someone who is able to “persuade without convincing.” This, in turn, requires a people who are minimally socialized, and thus remain malleable.22 Any robust form of the domestic solution seems to require a brilliant and benevolent manipulator of circumstances, such as Wolmar or Emile's tutor (Shklar 1969, 127–64); alongside a divinely inspiring paragon of female virtue, such as Julie or Sophie; as well as a moderate degree of decency in one's government and a robust degree of isolation from advanced and urban societies. Finally, the individual solution—in addition to presupposing a person of formidable brilliance—seems to require a still higher degree of rustic isolation (cf. DOI Note IX, 203–4/207–8f).         "
"19","The six‐type model above seems useful as a first approach to Rousseau's teachings on the social forms and moral possibilities of human life. For those concerned with the issues of gentleness and severity, however, certain complications soon emerge regarding Rousseau's diagnostic thought—complications with deep implications for his critique of civilization and its most intensified form, modernity. We have seen how, in the images of the Second Discourse which would prove so influential in later cults of sentimentality and romanticism, Rousseau appeals to a peaceful and idle primitive existence as a device for exposing the frenzied, unnatural oppressions of self and others which are typical of civilization. It has accordingly been observed that Rousseau nowhere uses the term “noble savage” with which he is often associated, and that his image of humans in the pure state of nature is not remotely “noble” in the usual sense (Melzer 1990, 55n13). Nevertheless, it is equally striking that in the Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts and in several other writings, he offers far different images of early humanity—as thoroughly vigorous, stern in their morals, and at times pitiless in their fury and vengeance. Such images are invoked to expose, not the excess harshness or cruelty of civilized and modern life, but rather its softness, weakness, and decadence. In short, at first and second glance, Rousseau seems to engage in a blatant form of philosophical self‐indulgence, seeking to have it both ways in describing the softness and severity of both civilization and savagery, and in evaluating the moral status of both softness and severity. Otherwise put, he seems to insist, somehow, that savage life is to be seen as simultaneously soft, hard, and thus praiseworthy, while civilized life is also soft, hard, and yet despicable. We can put a finer point on the problem by invoking Arthur Lovejoy and George Boas's distinction between two traditions which they term “hard primitivism” and “soft primitivism.” The soft variety was exemplified in many paeans to “the Golden Age under the Saturnian dispensation,” during which humans enjoyed abundant security, leisure, and simple pleasures, bestowed by Nature as a gentle and indulgent mother (Lovejoy and Boas 1935, 10–11, 27–28, 46–47, 64–65, 304–14). By contrast, hard primitivism paid tribute to the constant overcoming of physical hardship, poverty, and threats from harsh climates and predatory animals; among the “rude, hardy fellows” of this tradition were the Scythians, the Getae, and later the Germans (Lovejoy and Boas 1935, 9–11, 70–73, 315–67).         "
"20","The most immediately apparent solution would be to find in Rousseau's solitary‐Savage the bases for soft primitivism, and to find in his social‐Savage those of hard primitivism. In the later state, amour‐propre has been awakened, and thus pride, the drive for honor, and the need to be loved and praised superlatively by all (DOI I, 152/154; Note XV, 218/219; E IV, 213f/493; RJJ I, 9–10/669–70; II, 112–13/805–6). One then came to judge any intentional wrong not only as physical harm, but also as “contempt for his person,” and “vengeances became terrible, and men bloodthirsty and cruel” (DOI II, 166/170). Jealousy springing from new ideas of comparative merit, beauty, and romantic attraction also provided powerful new kindling for explosions of social violence (DOI II, 165–66/169–70; cf. E V, 429–31/796–98f). Indeed, Rousseau was led to reason philosophically toward a gentler, prehistorical, primitive state precisely because of the historical and ethnographical evidence which depicted the cruel vengeances of humans in this middling stage:         "

"22","This is precisely the state reached by most of the Savage Peoples known to us; and it is for want of drawing adequate distinctions between ideas, and noticing how far these Peoples already were from the first state of Nature, that many hastened to conclude that man is naturally cruel and that he needs political order to be made gentle [a besoin de police pour l’adoucir], whereas nothing is as gentle [si doux] as he in his primitive state when, placed by Nature at equal distance from the stupidity of the brutes and the fatal enlightenment of civil man, and restricted by instinct and reason alike to protecting himself against the harm that threatens him, he is restrained by Natural pity from doing anyone harm, without being moved to it by anything, even after it has been done to him. (DOI II, 166/170)               "
"23","We may note here in passing Rousseau's frequent appeals to historical and ethnographical evidence regarding the social‐Savage state, which deeply undermine the view that he is indifferent to empirical evidence.23 Among this vast range of sources, he takes a special interest in the Caribs, who seem to provide decisive evidence for certain softer elements of the noncivilized—and perhaps even the primitive—state: “it is all the more ridiculous to portray Savages as constantly murdering one another in order to satisfy their brutality, as this opinion goes directly counter to experience, and as the Caribs, which of all existing Peoples has so far deviated least from the state of Nature, are in fact also the most peaceful in their loves and the least given to jealousy … ” (DOI I, 156/158). Rousseau's claim that the Savage soul yields itself “to the sole sentiment of its present existence, with no idea of the future,” is also based partially on observations of the Carib, who “sells his Cotton bed in the morning and comes back weeping to buy it back in the evening, not having foreseen that he would need it for the coming night” (143/144).24 This may reflect the profound indifference of all noncivilized people to all but repose and freedom, in contrast to the citizen's frenzied pursuits of power and reputation—concepts which must have no meaning for a Carib (DOI II, 187/192f).         "
"24","Nevertheless, a complete dichotomy between a soft primitivism grounded in the earliest humans and a hard primitivism grounded in the social‐Savage is far from adequate. For, just as the above examples of Carib immediacy are used to show that some softer aspects of primitive life are retained in the later Savage state, the Caribs are also appealed to in establishing a certain hardness which seems to apply even to the earliest states. The reason why Caribs (like Africans) live in “the most profound security” with regard to ferocious beasts, is that they have realized they surpass such beasts in skill more than the beasts surpass them in strength (DOI I, 136/136–37, 137n). The problem of such beasts may suggest that nature is not as gentle a mother as is sometimes suggested, and human use of stones, sticks, and arrows is often required to compensate."
"25","More generally, Rousseau frequently depicts life in or near the original state of nature as requiring and generating an extraordinary hardiness in comparison with civilized humanity. In keeping with the traditions of hard primitivism, he appeals to the toughening effects of inclement weather, changes of seasons, and fatigue from escaping ferocious beasts (DOI I, 135/135; II, 161f/165). In such a setting those without robust constitutions perish, and those with strong constitutions give birth to similarly endowed children who undergo the same travails, thus acquiring “all the vigor of which the human species is capable” (I, 135/135; see also 157/160; Note XII, 215/217; EOL X, 279/407; E I, 59/277). Their physical capacities regarding self‐preservation—in sharp distinction from the organs concerning softness (la molesse), sensuality, and delicacy—become exceedingly fine‐tuned. This reasoning is confirmed by travelers’ reports of “most Savage Peoples,” which express astonishment at their strength and acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell (DOI I, 140/140; Note VI, 194–95/199–200). Rousseau similarly observes that although civilized man, with advanced machinery in hand, can easily overcome the savage, if they were both unarmed it would be a still more unequal contest in the savage's favor (I, I35/135f). At the same time, since primitive man's passions are minimal, and his reason and amour‐propre are uncultivated, there are no temptations to disobey the “gentle voice [douce voix]” of pity, and he will naturally seek his own good with the least possible harm to others, being fierce only occasionally and as preservation requires (DOI Preface, 127/125f; I, 135–36, 152–54/136–37, 154–57; Note IX, 198f/203). Thus vengeance is only mechanical and immediate, seldom leading to bloodshed; for such reasons Rousseau declares them “fierce [farouches] rather than wicked” (154/157).25 By comparison, we have seen above how in social‐Savages, amour‐propre makes outbursts of vengeance more intense and less limited by mere self‐preservation, and thus these outbursts may be described as “cruel” rather than (the more beast‐like) “fierce.”26"
"26","Unfortunately, while one might outline the soft and hard elements of Rousseau's primitivism with some confidence, it seems far less clear how these elements cohere. His primary account in the Second Discourse seems to be one of an overwhelmingly abundant and secure original state (DOI I, 134/134f), which was interrupted by accidental and foreign causes. At the same time, among the difficulties with which “nascent man” is “soon” presented are ferocious beasts and the height of trees (II, 161f/165), and these would seem to harden the human condition from nearly the beginning. According to Jonathan Marks, we ought to infer that, for Rousseau, these harsher aspects of life—requiring foresight and hardening to circumstances—are present from the very beginning. And thus we must also infer that in his genuine teaching, nature and human nature are essentially disharmonious (Marks 2005, 5–7, 26–28; cf. Cooper 1999, 189). Marks further argues that Rousseau's depiction of a lush and idyllic state of nature must therefore be a form of satire, intended to undermine his previously stated definition of “nature” as equivalent to origins and therefore independent of history and circumstance (Marks 2005, 15–38, 93–104).         "
"27","However, it is also possible that Rousseau posits two different kinds of primitive states, with one being considerably softer than the other, and this possibility can be supported by the Essay on the Origin of Languages. There Rousseau derides European philosophers for projecting their own “barren and harsh” conditions onto the first men, since humans (like all animals) surely had their origins in the far more abundant and accommodating South (EOL VIII, 266/394). These lush and fertile climates allow men to live more easily, and thus without one another (IX, 272, 277/400, 405; cf. II, 253/380; PF X, 56–57/532–33). This may converge with the claim in the Second Discourse that as humanity spread, “difficulties multiplied together with men,” leading them to different sorts of terrain and climates, and thus different ways of life (DOI II, 162/165; cf. Note XVII, 221/222). It may be, then, that to whatever extent one inhabited a Southern climate with a low population, one's conditions were quite “prodigal,” whereas population pressures may have forced many to the more “miserly” North (cf. EOL X, 279/407). Alternatively, higher population would at least lead to greater scarcity within the South, making “the height of trees” (DOI II, 161/165) newly problematic. For such reasons, we may suggest that, for Rousseau, although an unqualifiedly soft primitive existence was probably quite rare, and although certain soft elements are incorporated in perhaps any life prior to nascent society and especially civilization, there are some solitary, primitive states which seem predominantly soft, while others seem predominantly hard.27 In order to avoid confusion with Rousseau's normatively loaded uses of the terms “soft” (mou, molle) and “hard” (dur), we will henceforth dub those primitive existences which predominantly align with Lovejoy and Boas's category of “soft primitivism” as “Idyllic Primitives,” and those predominantly aligning with their “hard” category as “Vigorous Primitives.”         "
"28","In addition to these harsher aspects of solitary life, any strict dichotomy between a soft primitive state and a hard social‐Savage state is further undermined by the observation that the romantic love made possible by nascent society is not solely a tale of jealousy and violence. After a chain of events led from increased interaction to increased rationality, the use of tools, and finally the development of huts, families could be established and differentiated (DOI II, 164/167). The habit of living together then gave rise to “the first developments of the heart … the sweetest [les plus doux] sentiments known to man, conjugal love and Paternal love” (164/168).28 The rise of such ideas and sentiments is said to tame humans (166/169). In the Essay, Rousseau similarly depicts youths’ initial interactions with new, sweeter sights outside their family, which render the heart “less savage”: “Beneath old oaks … spirited young people gradually forgot their ferociousness [férocité], little by little they tamed one another; in striving to make themselves understood they learned to make themselves intelligible” (EOL IX, 277/406). The cultivation of romantic love thus seems to increase sweetness as well as severity, and this paradox is not lost on Rousseau. Indeed, “at the least obstacle” this “tender and sweet [tendre et doux] sentiment” becomes an “impetuous frenzy,”“and the gentlest [la plus douce] of all passions receives sacrifices of human blood” (DOI II, 165/169). In addition to these outbursts regarding the beloved, we also find at this stage the first historical analogue to the insider‐outsider distinction exemplified on a broader scale by Rousseau's model of the patriotic Citizen: “Hence the apparent contradictions one sees in the fathers of nations. Such naturalness and such inhumanity, such ferocious ways [moeurs si féroces] and such tender hearts, so much love for their family and aversion toward their species. All their sentiments concentrated among their near ones were therefore the more energetic” (EOL IX, 268/396).29 Thus the state of independent association is marked by the cultivation of human capacities for the sweeter and gentler sentiments, and at the same time a vast increase in the stakes of threats to the enjoyment of one's beloveds—whether by romantic competition or tribal outsiders’ encroachments—which leads to intense expressions of cruelty unknown in more primitive life. Rousseau nonetheless considers this stage “the golden age,” since meetings with outsiders so rarely occurred: “Everywhere the state of war prevailed, yet the whole earth was at peace” (269/396). And although this aspect of his thought is by no means clearly developed, it may be that it is these harder attributes of both primitive and later savage life to which Rousseau appeals in the First Discourse and the polemics which followed it. In criticizing the luxurious softness of modern humanity, he there appeals to the rude, rustic virtues of such (often despised) peoples as the Scythians, the early Persians, the Spartans, and the Goths (DSA I, 11/11–12; Letter to Grimm, EPW 58/OC 3:65). Such virtues include a vigorous endurance of pain, martial strength, true courage, “good faith, hospitality,30 justice, and … a great horror of debauchery … ” (LR 66/74f).31"
"29","In contrast to these conflicting psychological developments, certain material attributes of nascent society lead straightforwardly to softening. Due to a more settled life, the sexes begin to establish different ways of living, with the women becoming more sedentary, while “both Sexes … began to lose something of their ferociousness and vigor” as a result of “their slightly softer [un peu plus molle] life” (DOI II, 164/168). Through such factors as the mastering of useful animals (162/166) and the rise of mechanical conveniences, the body is continually weakened in comparison with primitive life (164f/168; cf. DSA II, 20–21/22–23). And just as our domesticated animals are smaller and less vigorous than wild ones, so also humans are enervated from our “soft [molle] and effeminate way of life” (DOI I, 138f/139).         "
"30","Whereas the Second Discourse here anticipates the ominous rise of modern luxury, the Essay focuses upon an economic practice which enables much of the leisure we have found in the primitive state, in combination with the broader social sentiments of nascent society. There Rousseau precisely defines “three stages of man considered in relation to society,” where “everything is seen to be related in its principle to the means by which men provide for their subsistence, and as … a function of the climate and of the nature of the soil.” Namely, “The savage is a hunter, the barbarian a herdsman, civil man a tiller of the soil” (EOL IX, 272/400).32 Although the Essay claims to investigate “the first men” (269/396) and “the first times” (cf. 267n/395n), it either bypasses or revises the Discourse's primitive state, since the Essay's “first men” are united in families, and apparently must engage in hunting, herding, or farming, in contrast to the Discourse's mere gathering of the spontaneous fruits of the earth.33 Apparently having already commenced the cycle of human industry responding to new needs, the greater number of people, who were “less active and more peaceable,” stopped this frenzied cycle “as soon as they could” by gathering and taming cattle (271/399). Thus pastoral life was born, which Rousseau praises as “the most self‐sufficient art,” since it “almost effortlessly” provides humans with food, clothing, and tents. “[F]ather of repose and of the indolent passions” (271f/400), pastoral life enabled countless hours of the romantic taming we have depicted, since “time had no other measure than enjoyment and boredom” (277/406). For such reasons, it seems plausible that at least the majority of people in nascent society enjoyed “the gentle sweetness of independent association” as herdsmen, and the tenor of their lives was predominantly soft in both labor and social (i.e., familial) relations. We might finally note that it is of such pastoral images that Rousseau drew many of his most grandiloquent images, of which he himself was the fondest.34 Accordingly, a more accurate moniker for him and his theoretical progeny may be “the gentle barbarian,” rather than “the noble savage.”         "
"31","However, in the same pages we are introduced to Rousseau's most severe human type—at least among the noncivilized. In contrast with the “less active and more peaceable majority”:"
"32","                        "
"33","The most active, the most robust, those who were always on the move could only live off fruit and the hunt; so they became hunters, violent, bloodthirsty and, in time, warriors, conquerors, and usurpers. History has stained its records with the crimes of these first Kings; war and conquests are nothing but manhunts. Once they had conquered, it only remained for them to devour men. This is what their successors learned to do. … Of the three ways of life available to man—hunting, herding, and agriculture—the first develops strength, skill, speed of body, courage and cunning of soul, it hardens [endurcit] man and makes him ferocious [féroce]. (EOL IX, 271/399)35"
"34","Such a life of hardened and habitual bloodthirstiness does not seem to be paralleled among the noncivilized humans depicted in the Second Discourse.36 It is not immediately clear how this textual difference should be explained. It may simply be that the purpose of the Discourse is to indicate the origins of inequality, and accordingly it can only rapidly outline the intermediate forms of society which are depicted at length in the Essay (cf. Duchet and Launay 1967, 434, 423).37 I would also suggest, more speculatively, that since the Essay began as a fragment of the Discourse, but was probably not completed until around 1761, the Essay's more impartial and descriptive tone may indicate a shift away from the harsh and somber Discourse.38 The polemical thesis of the Discourse required it to depict noncivilized life as characteristically soft and gentle, especially during its most properly natural phase, which is more primitive (and thus gentle) than the lives of most contemporary savages. It may be for this reason that it sometimes blurs the distinction between the solitary Primitive and the social‐Savage (cf. Masters 1968, 171–74). By contrast, the Essay may be seen as partially undermining the polemics of the Discourse, since in dwelling at length upon the delights of the Barbarians’ sociability, it emphasizes an exception to the layer of the Discourse which was directed against society as such. And in clearly depicting a habitually bloodthirsty yet preagricultural human type, the Essay may naturally dampen the longing which the Discourse evoked for noncivilized life as a whole.39 Whatever the reasons for this textual difference, the Discourse's closest approximation to the bloodthirsty hunters is found after the invention of landed property and agriculture, when those who were stronger, more skillful, and more ingenious employed various stratagems which radically heightened inequality (DOI II, 169f/174; PF VII, 49/522). This eventually led to a class war in which the rich “had scarcely become acquainted with the pleasure of dominating than they disdained all other pleasures … ” (DOI II, 171/175f). Although the Second Discourse thus seems to consign thoroughgoing viciousness to civilized peoples, the polemics following the First Discourse had ultimately conceded the presence of certain vices among the noncivilized. In contrast to the “reasonable” and “modest” ignorance which Rousseau finds essential to ancient virtue, “There is a ferocious and brutal ignorance, born of a wicked heart and a deceitful mind; a criminal ignorance even of the duties of humanity, which multiplies the vices, degrades reason, depraves the soul, and renders men similar to beasts … ” (Observations, EPW 49/OC 3:54). Peoples exemplifying such vices despicably feed their self‐indulgence, ambition, and idleness “with the sweat, the blood and the toil of a million wretches” (LR 72/82; cf. Letter to Grimm, EPW 54/OC 3:62). Such images of vile, noncivilized hardness are rare in Rousseau, but as we can see from the immediately above, even these could be readily applied to expose the genealogy and character of civilized privilege.40"
"35"," Figure 6 may schematize Rousseau's images of the softness and severity of noncivilized life. The dotted line indicates a distinction which is not as explicit or readily implicit in Rousseau as the distinctions indicated by solid lines. His apparent vagueness here could be partially explained insofar as the groups on either side of the dotted line are similar in social complexity and historical locus, differing only in the favorability of their natural and social environments.         "
"36","                 The Detailed Sociopolitical Typology of Noncivilized Humans                      "
"37","If we turn briefly to Rousseau's depictions of advanced civilization and modernity,41 we might find that the bulk of modern humanity is similarly dichotomized into those under conditions of abundance and softness, and those under conditions of scarcity and severity. Importantly, however, these favorable conditions are attained not through the spontaneous abundance of the earth or the pastoral harnessing of animals, but through advanced economic luxuries necessarily acquired at the expense of the multitude (DOI I, 137/138; Note IX, 199/203f). To the extent that a people has become civilized and interdependent, their interests are fundamentally at odds with each other, and the great majority of individuals will be deprived of necessities and degraded into habitual deceit, betrayal, and theft (cf. PN 101–2n/970n). However, given the intensity of Rousseau's polemics against modernity, and his concession of certain elements of ferocity and cruelty in noncivilized life, it is striking that he does not portray his elite contemporaries as ferocious or actively cruel. Rather, he grants much of the descriptive content of doux commerce theory, conceding that commercial wealth, cross‐cultural interaction, and higher learning have made their partakers more polite and less violent in key respects (e.g., DSA I, 7/7; Observations, EPW 47/OC 3:52; LR 65/74). Yet he interprets such gentleness as resulting not from higher moral conviction or more elevated sentiments, but rather from physical softness, psychological weakness, and moral indifference (LR 70/79; “Moral Letters” II, CW 12:181–82/OC 4:1089–90; E IV, 335/665). In addition, given the workings of the established state apparatus and economic system, they simply have no need for the vigorous ferocity of much noncivilized life (cf. E IV, 236n/524n; Conf. VII, 274/327). Instead, they need only remain largely indifferent to the sufferings of the masses, which is naturally combined with contempt or disdain for them (E IV, 224–25/507–9; “On Wealth,” CW 11:8–16/OC 5:471–81). In these ways, Rousseau's fundamental charge against his elite contemporaries is not their cruelty but their “harshness” or “hardness” (dureté: “Letters to Malesherbes” IV, CW 5:582/OC 1:1145). Although refraining from charging the elite moderns with ferocity or active cruelty is a significant concession on its face, Rousseau ultimately faults them for, on one hand, an excessive softness which makes them incapable of vigorous acts, and on the other hand, a lack of authentic sentiment which makes them incapable of the sweet, intimate, spontaneous relations of social‐Savages and Barbarians.         "
"38","A final diagram (Figure 7) summarizes the major distinctions and social types described above. This analysis suggests the great extent to which Rousseau finds our morals to be shaped by our surroundings, in terms of social complexity (the horizontal dimension), the favorability of our environmental resources (the descriptive element of the vertical dimension), and whether a far‐seeing intellect had decisively broken with the usual course of civilization (the prescriptive element of the vertical dimension). This schema builds upon and confirms the status of the main characters previously identified by Rousseau scholars (who find between two and five types). Without claiming to definitively identify each social type depicted by Rousseau, it draws attention to additional characters which are theoretically pivotal, and which are neglected or undertheorized in previous analyses. Moreover, each of these characters has been placed within a typology which attempts to show the interrelation of many of Rousseau's fundamental social principles in a more systematic manner than has previously been attempted. To be sure, some of these social types and principles are more evident and fundamental than others in Rousseau's thought. Accordingly, this typology is offered to spur conversation rather than to conclude it. Yet it is hoped that even in provoking disagreement, it might enhance the clarity and rigor of our reflections by bringing several basic types and principles systematically to the forefront.         "
"39","                 The Comprehensive Sociopolitical Typology                      "
"40","For instance, by framing the various types as arising from our sociopolitical surroundings, this analysis may suggest a particular understanding of Rousseau's teachings on perfectibility and the possibilities of human life. Rousseau probably coined the term “perfectibilité” (cf. Wokler 1978, 127–28, 134n93), and it became a fundamental social premise for legions of later progressive and radical reformers, suggesting the prospects for indefinite social improvement. For Rousseau, perfectibility is the only faculty which is undeniably unique to humans; with “the aid of circumstances,” it successively develops all our other faculties (DOI I, 142/142). Thus, our survey of the extraordinary range of human types, and the environmental circumstances which give rise to them, can be read as a study of the implications of perfectibility. Rousseau's broader anthropology of the possible is regularly used to expose the moderns’ complacency in believing their own petty baseness is the pinnacle of human possibility (DOI Note X, 210/212f; SC III.12; Considerations on the Government of Poland II, 179f/956; PF XIII, 64/544). In such ways Rousseau is a true father of progressive perfectibility, but in several other ways he differs from this legacy of his. Notably, he reflected so extensively upon the nature and advantages of noncivilized life chiefly because he maintained that, through the strong passions resulting from interaction and interdependence, advanced civilizations must with overwhelming regularity fall into devastating forms of corruption, degradation, and mutual exploitation. Ironically to civilized ears, much of this degradation is blamed upon the unfolding of perfectibility itself, which “perfects … human reason, while deteriorating the species,” and develops virtues in a few, while overcoming the many with vices (DOI I, 159/162; II, 184/189; see also DSA II, 16/18; DOI I, 151f/154; E III, 204/483; Conf. VIII, 326/388). It is for such reasons that even Rousseau's most thoroughly developed and optimistically prescribed human types—the Solitary Dreamer, the Moral Human, and the Citizen—must be highly selective in their development of human faculties, and highly secluded from the false delights and sophistications of civilized modernity. Overall, in Rousseau's analysis, once human perfectibility has moved beyond its rudimentary stages, it allows for human possibilities which are indeed very high in their greatness and purity, but exceedingly narrow in the social and cultural conditions which enable them.         "
"41","More generally, by interpreting Rousseau's apparently conflicting remarks carefully according to sociopolitical context, we can discern many consistencies underlying his inconsistencies. In analyzing the social types which emerge, we might also find that Rousseau shows a surprising degree of impartiality in openly depicting various nonmodern weaknesses, while at least observationally and implicitly acknowledging certain modern strengths. Furthermore, our analysis may reveal a degree of moderation in his moral stances, in both their critical and prescriptive expressions. For, despite all his bravado in praising the hard sternness of the Citizen or the Vigorous Primitive, he consistently repudiates any bloodthirstiness, lust for domination, and universal hard‐heartedness. Similarly, despite all his romanticism in praising the idleness and abundance of the Idyllic Primitive or the pastoral Barbarian, he consistently repudiates any softness attained through human exploitation, or of frivolous luxury, or of failure to execute any duties appropriate to one's sociopolitical condition."
"42","Yet though his various social types display moral moderation and phenomenological integrity, there may remain a degree of arbitrariness in his appeals to them. It is, for instance, rhetorically compelling to expose Civilized Elite softness through the image of the Vigorous Primitive, the stern Barbarian, or the ancient Citizen. But it would require a more careful and sustained analysis to show that those moderns who enjoy a substantial degree of economic security, leisure, and refinement due to economic and technological progress are characteristically softer in less appealing ways than the Idyllic Primitive, or harsher in more deplorable ways than the hunter‐Savage. Typically, Rousseau's approach is to criticize a modern weakness by appeal to an inverse primitive strength, whereas a more impartially philosophical approach would surely compare strengths against strengths and weaknesses against weaknesses. For such reasons, our analysis—insofar as it is convincing—can only be considered a prolegomenon to future discussions of Rousseau's coherence, rather than a demonstration of it. Some mystery shall always remain in explanations of how he appealed to both gentle savages and fierce citizens in his campaigns against modern civilization."
