"1","This study has broad implications for our understanding of American politics. First, political participation scholars have, in recent years, significantly advanced our understanding of the role government policies play in shaping individuals’ political behavior (Campbell 2012; Mettler and Soss 2004).3 By establishing that mandatory collective bargaining laws increased political participation among teachers, we contribute to the growing “policy feedback” literature that examines the effects of public policies on mass behavior. However, our work expands upon existing scholarship by showing that government policies can activate a political constituency not only by providing material resources to, or altering the interpretive experiences of, individual citizens (Mettler 2002; Pierson 1993), but also by directly subsidizing the efforts of previously established interest groups to mobilize their supporters in politics.         "
"2","Second, our findings provide an explanation for the growth and maintenance of an often ignored interest group sector—public employee unions—that quietly comprises eight million Americans and remains a cornerstone of the Democratic electoral coalition (Anzia and Moe 2015; West 2008). Despite the fact that existing accounts of interest group formation and maintenance emphasize the crucial role of patron (including government) support in these processes (Judd and Swanstrom 1994; Nownes and Freeman 1998; Walker 1983, 1991), interest group scholars have rarely, if ever, tested the implications of these findings for groups (e.g., public employees) that arise from within government.4 In light of recent arguments that parties are best understood as coalitions of “policy‐demanding groups” (Bawn et al. 2012; Cohen et al. 2008; Karol 2009), we agree with Anzia and Moe's (2015) contention that the omission of public sector unions from interest group research continues to handicap our overall understanding of American politics. For parties and interest group scholars, the simple fact that public employees currently constitute nearly one‐third of party activists (an increase of almost 40% since the 1970s) merits greater scholarly attention and explanation.5"
"3","Third, it is widely understood that street‐level bureaucrats wield significant discretion that in turn shapes service delivery and policy implementation, yet only recently have bureaucracy scholars identified rank‐and‐file bureaucrats as capable and influential political activists in their own right (Berry 2009; Carpenter 2001; Moe 2006). This lack of attention is especially surprising given widespread recognition that government employees are more likely to participate in politics than their private sector counterparts (Johnson and Libecap 1991; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980).6 By demonstrating that government policies can play a critical role in boosting organized political activity among the government's own employees—particularly by subsidizing the costs of mobilization (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995)—this study helps advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of political activism among millions of street‐level bureaucrats in the United States (Lipsky 1980).         "
"4","We begin with a puzzle. Using an additive index of five participation items asked about by the ANES, we find that the rate of political participation among teachers in the 1950s and early 1960s was relatively modest.7 In fact, for 1956–62, teachers reported rates of participation that were only slightly higher than nonteachers, a somewhat surprising fact when one considers that teachers, on average, have higher levels of education than the general public. However, starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, teachers began to participate in politics at rates significantly higher than nonteachers.         "
"5","What explains this teacher‐specific rise in political activism? In searching for a theory that can explain such a significant change in the political activity of one particular occupation group, a likely candidate emerges: the enactment of statewide mandatory collective bargaining laws requiring school districts to collectively bargain with teacher employees. By the final quarter of the twentieth century—precisely the time in which teachers and their unions began cementing their place as one of the most active groups in politics—teacher unionization rates soared on the heels of new laws guaranteeing public employees bargaining rights (Saltzman 1985; West 2008). In 1959, Wisconsin became the first state to enact mandatory bargaining for state and local government workers (including teachers). By 1980, 29 states had enacted public sector bargaining laws mandating that districts bargain collectively with their teacher employees once a majority had requested to do so.8 A map illustrating variation in the timing of mandatory teacher bargaining laws is presented in Figure 1.9"

"7","Source: Authors’ updated analysis of National Bureau of Economic Research Public Sector Collective Bargaining Law Data Set (Valletta and Freeman 1988).                     "
"8","Why would we expect public sector collective bargaining laws to galvanize teacher political participation? One possible explanation is that collective bargaining activated a link in teachers’ own minds between political participation and their occupational interests. Indeed, the growing “policies make citizens” literature provides evidence supporting this explanation (e.g., Campbell 2002, 2003). However, another possible explanation that has received less scholarly attention10 is that government policies can confer targeted advantages to organized interest groups that better equip those groups to organize and mobilize their supporters in politics. In the context of collective bargaining laws and teacher political participation, we contend that teachers unions were the primary recipients of organizational advantages that greatly strengthened their ability to mobilize teachers for political action.11"
"9","Teachers unions became explicitly advantaged (from an organizing and mobilization standpoint) when state governments passed laws mandating that school districts bargain collectively with their employees. Perhaps the most obvious advantage is the fact that these laws created powerful incentives for teachers to join the union.12 We have already referenced research that shows union members are more likely to participate in politics than nonmembers (Flavin and Radcliff 2011; Leighley and Nagler 2007). When considered alongside other studies showing that mandatory bargaining laws were a cause (and not simply a consequence) of higher union membership rates across the states (Freeman 1986; Saltzman 1985, 1988), one connection between these laws and higher levels of subsequent political activity is quite obvious. However, our core argument is not that mandatory bargaining laws simply increased the percentage of teachers who were unionized, which in turn led to greater political activity among teachers on account of their newfound status as union members. Instead, we hypothesize that mandatory bargaining laws had a strong causal effect on the political participation of all teachers, both union members and nonmembers alike.         "
"10","Specifically, we focus on the fact that collective bargaining decreased the costs for teachers union interest groups to mobilize teachers to participate in politics. In states with mandatory bargaining, once certified, the local teachers union becomes the “exclusive representative” of all teachers (not simply union members) in the district. “Exclusive representative” is thus a legal designation that ensures all educators inside the bargaining unit (even those who elect not to join the union) will have contact with the union that represents their occupational interests. For example, as exclusive representative, the teachers union is almost always contractually entitled to receive a comprehensive list of all district employees at the outset of each school year with detailed contact information (e.g., phone numbers and e‐mail addresses), which makes organizing and mobilizing teachers for political action significantly less costly.13"
"11","It is also quite common in mandatory bargaining states to find contracts that guarantee teachers unions the equivalent of congressional franking privileges through unlimited use of the school district's internal mail service as well as the right to post announcements about union business in the staff lounge.14 The union is also typically ensured the right to use school facilities and supplies to conduct union business,15 as well as guaranteed time on the agenda at mandatory faculty meetings (where all staff, not simply union members, are required to be present). In addition, school districts in mandatory bargaining states routinely subsidize the local union president's teaching salary so she can focus her efforts on union business. In other words, many school districts effectively pay for the equivalent of a full‐time political activist for the head of the local union interest group.16"
"12","Finally, the ubiquitous practice of automated dues deductions in mandatory collective bargaining states ensures a steady cash flow for the teachers union. Moreover, dues deductions are typically carried out by the school district's payroll office, which has the effect of drastically reducing the union's administrative costs. Instead of having to devote considerable time and resources going from member to member to collect dues (like any other interest group must do), teachers unions in mandatory bargaining states can rely on the government to perform this task. As a result, teachers unions are ensured a reliable stream of revenue and have their resources freed up for use in other purposes, both of which make organizing and mobilizing teachers to political action much easier."
"13","The aforementioned examples help illustrate the myriad ways in which mandatory collective bargaining conferred an assortment of benefits (often formal and contractual) to teachers unions at the organizational level, benefits that in turn made it easier and less costly for the unions to focus on recruiting rank‐and‐file teachers to participate in politics.17 Indeed, we suspect that if you asked any number of aspiring policy entrepreneurs intent on founding a successful interest group what assortment of start‐up provisions would be most useful in helping them mobilize prospective supporters, the type of advantages mentioned above would rank highly on most every list. For public sector employee unions, then, the decision of state governments to establish mandatory collective bargaining laws provided important patron‐like support (Walker 1983, 1991) that subsidized their efforts in the political arena.         "
"14","In summary, there are strong theoretical reasons to anticipate that mandatory collective bargaining laws increased the rate of political participation among teachers, chiefly by conferring special benefits on teachers union interest groups, which were then more effectively able to mobilize teachers. In what follows, we take advantage of the fact that different states adopted mandatory bargaining laws at different times over the last 50 years to evaluate the effects of these laws on teachers’ rates of political participation."
"15","To measure variation in state collective bargaining laws over time, we use a database originally constructed by Valletta and Freeman (1988) that codes bargaining laws for various classifications of public employees from 1955 to 1985. This data set was subsequently extended by Kim Rueben to 1996,18 and then to 2004 by the authors. We code states’ bargaining laws for teachers dichotomously: state‐years with a mandatory bargaining law are coded as 1 and those without are coded as 0. One particularly useful aspect of this data set is that 34 states enacted a mandatory bargaining law at varying times during the period we study, which allows us to examine within‐state effects and offers additional analytic leverage for identifying any possible causal effects of laws on political participation.19"
"16","To measure political participation, we use the ANES cumulative file, which pools across years from 1956 to 2004, leaving us with a sample of over 1,300 teachers.20 We focus on teacher participation in electoral and campaign‐related political activities separate and apart from voting because voting is neither theoretically nor empirically linked to the central puzzle that we seek to explain: the fact that teachers became active in electoral politics, whereas they once remained on the sidelines. As previously explained, teachers have always voted at consistently high rates although they participated minimally in other political activities, such as campaign work, in earlier decades (NEA 1957). Indeed, with such little variation in teacher voting rates across the ANES series (teacher turnout typically exceeds 80% in midterm elections and 90% in presidential elections), there is simply little to explain empirically as it relates to voting. On the other hand, the rate of teacher participation for nonvoting political activities varies significantly across the time series.         "
"17","The ANES have been asking a consistent battery of political participation items for over 50 years.21 For each teacher, we compute his or her score for an additive (0–5) participation index using self‐report responses to five survey items that ask whether he or she engaged in the following activities during the election season:            "
"18","Among teachers in the sample, the mean for the participatory index is .92 and the standard deviation is 1.21. By way of comparison, nonteachers participated (as expected) at lower rates, with a mean of .54 and a standard deviation of .94."
"19","Our estimation strategy is to model political participation as a function of whether there is a mandatory collective bargaining law in a teacher's state the year of the survey and a series of individual‐level control variables, including whether a respondent is a union member, the intensity of his or her political partisanship,22 level of education, income, age,23 gender,24 and dummy variables for whether a respondent is African American, Hispanic, or an “other” race25 (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). Accounting for whether a teacher is a union member or not is especially important because it allows us to evaluate whether a mandatory bargaining law has an independent effect on the political participation of teachers above and beyond the fact that a mandatory bargaining law makes it more likely that teachers will join a teachers union and union members are generally more likely to participate in politics than nonmembers (Flavin and Radcliff 2011; Leighley and Nagler 2007).26 Using these variables, we then estimate the following equation:            "
"20","As discussed above, there is evidence of a significant uptick in the political participation of teachers toward the end of the 1960s and into the 1970s, when more than half of all states adopted mandatory public sector collective bargaining laws. Our goal is to identify whether this well‐documented increase in teacher political participation was concentrated among teachers in those states that established mandatory collective bargaining laws for teachers, and whether those laws were, in fact, the cause of that increase in participatory behavior. Before turning to our multivariate analysis, we present an initial examination of the raw data on teacher participation in states that adopted mandatory bargaining laws by comparing participation rates before and after law enactments. Figure 2 displays the average number of political acts registered on the ANES five‐item index for teachers and for nonteachers before and after a mandatory collective bargaining law was enacted in their state of residence.28 The figure reveals that, in the two subsequent elections following the passage of a bargaining law in their state, and especially the third and fourth elections after the law went into effect, teachers reported a sharp increase in their rate of political participation. By contrast, the political participation of nonteachers does not appear to be related to changes in their state's public sector collective bargaining law.         "
"21","Rates of Political Participation before and after Enactment of a Mandatory Collective Bargaining Law"

"23","Next, we evaluate the relationship between mandatory bargaining laws and teacher political participation more rigorously by modeling political participation as a function of state collective bargaining laws and the host of control variables discussed above. Because our index of political participation is a count (0–5) of the number of participatory acts a teacher engaged in and is overdispersed, we use a negative binomial regression estimator. In Table 1, we present the results of modeling political participation among teachers as a function of whether that teacher's state‐year has a mandatory collective bargaining law or not, individual‐level control variables for union membership, strength of partisanship, education, income, age, gender, and race, the average number of participatory acts for nonteachers in a teacher's state‐year, and state and year fixed effects. Column 1 reports that the coefficient for a mandatory collective bargaining law is positive and bounded above zero at conventional levels of statistical significance (p < .05), indicating that teachers participate in politics at higher rates after their state implements a mandatory bargaining law. Simply put, a mandatory bargaining law boosts subsequent political participation among teachers in the ANES sample. In addition, we find that, as expected, self‐identified union members participate at higher rates than nonmembers and partisans participate at higher rates than nonpartisans.         "
"24","As a way to check the robustness of our results and confirm that the effect of a mandatory bargaining law on political participation is isolated only to teachers, we also conduct a placebo test. Specifically, we run the same model specification reported in column 1 for nonteachers in the ANES sample. If mandatory bargaining laws boost political participation among nonteachers in the same way as teachers, then it is likely that the boost in participation among teachers is caused by some other factor we have not accounted for. However, if a mandatory bargaining law has no effect on the political participation of nonteachers, that evidence would provide additional confidence that the effect we find for teachers is not spurious. Column 2 reports the results of the estimation for nonteachers and reveals that a mandatory bargaining law has no effect on the political participation of nonteachers. This null result for nonteachers provides additional confidence that the effect of state collective bargaining laws we observe for teachers is not spurious and is consistent with the hypothesis that these laws had the effect of motivating occupation‐specific political activity."
"25","Substantively, the effect of a mandatory collective bargaining law on political participation among teachers is quite large. Table 2 reports the predicted change on the five‐item participation index when manipulating the independent variable as indicated and holding all other independent variables in the model at their mean value. The top row of the table reveals that enacting a mandatory collective bargaining law leads to a predicted increase of .27 on the participation index. By comparison, this is larger than the difference between a teacher who is not a union member compared to a teacher who is a union member, a teacher with some college compared to a teacher with an advanced degree, a teacher in the lowest income quintile compared to a teacher in the highest income quintile, and nearly as large as the difference between a teacher who is nonpartisan compared to a teacher who identifies with a political party. In sum, when compared to traditional predictors of political participation, the effect of a mandatory collective bargaining law on teachers’ political activity is substantively large.         "
"26","Although we have posited that the enactment of mandatory bargaining laws led to an increase in the political participation of rank‐and‐file teachers, an alternative interpretation of the findings we present in Table 1 is that the causal arrow runs in the opposite direction. Specifically, it is possible that teachers ratcheted up their political participation with the expressed aim of securing a mandatory bargaining law in their state that would benefit them professionally. In other words, the boost in participation among teachers may be a cause (and not an effect) of a change in state collective bargaining laws. To probe this possibility, we run a series of models where we examine whether political participation among teachers increased in the years immediately preceding a change in a state's collective bargaining law. Specifically, we “lead” the mandatory collective bargaining law variable for one and two elections before the law actually changed in a state and compare the results to those displayed in Table 1.         "
"27","Table 3 reports the results of these two models, with the number of elections the mandatory bargaining law measure is led indicated at the top of each column. We find that the coefficient for a mandatory bargaining law is not statistically different from zero when it is led one or two elections. In other words, political participation among teachers was not higher in the years immediately before the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law in their state. We interpret these results as evidence that the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law temporally precedes an increase in political participation among teachers and not the other way around. Simply put, there is no evidence that rank‐and‐file teachers were especially politically active or clamoring for a mandatory bargaining law in the years leading up to its enactment.         "
"28","Although we take this as evidence that public sector bargaining laws (for multiple occupations) were not adopted in response to political activism among rank‐and‐file teachers, we might also be concerned that mandatory bargaining laws emerged because of strong and influential state‐level teachers union interest groups. This concern would be especially problematic for our theory that the chief mechanism linking newly adopted mandatory bargaining laws to increased political activity among rank‐and‐file teachers was the fact that such laws conferred important organizational subsidies to teachers unions that in turn helped them mobilize rank‐and‐file teachers in politics."
"29","To investigate the concern that bargaining laws may have been adopted in response to the prior existence of a strong teacher organization within a state, we analyze a survey of state legislators conducted in 1963 by Wayne L. Francis. State legislators were asked, “One hears a lot these days about the activities of interest groups and lobbies. Which would you say are the most powerful organizations of this kind in your state?” and could rank up to six different groups in order of their influence. Using legislator responses to this question, for each state we calculated (1) the average ranking of teacher interest groups or teacher associations, (2) the percent of legislators who mentioned a teacher group at all, and (3) the percent of legislators who ranked a teacher group as most powerful. We then separately used each measure as a predictor of whether a state implemented a mandatory collective bargaining law in the subsequent decade. In all three probit models, the coefficient for perceived teacher interest group power in a state is not statistically different from zero (i.e., none of the measures predict whether a state implements a mandatory collective bargaining law in the near future).29 We interpret these null findings as further evidence that mandatory bargaining laws led to an increase in political activism among teachers as opposed to the laws being enacted in response to the strength and political clout of teacher organizations beforehand.30"
"30","Finally, why does political participation among teachers increase after the enactment of a mandatory collective bargaining law? Above, we theorized that the introduction of mandatory bargaining policies in the teaching profession provided subsidy‐like benefits from the state to union interest groups that desired to mobilize teachers in the political arena. In the case of public school teachers, the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law chiefly advantages teachers unions by making it much easier for them to organize and contact teachers whose salaries and benefits are now negotiated by the teachers union (regardless of whether a teacher is a union member or not). Because of the unique professional relationship where teachers have the opportunity to help elect their bosses (e.g., school board members; Moe 2006, 2011), teachers unions have a strong interest in capitalizing on the law change by mobilizing this newly organized group.         "
"31","We evaluate the plausibility of this mechanism by investigating whether the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law increased the likelihood of teachers being a target of nonparty‐based electoral mobilization efforts. Relying on the very same model specification31 that we have used to identify the effects of bargaining laws on individual teacher participation throughout this article, in Table 4 we examine whether teachers were more likely to report being targeted for mobilization by the Democratic Party (column 1), the Republican Party (column 2), and someone other than the parties32 (column 3) after the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law. We find that neither political party is more likely to contact teachers after they have been organized into bargaining units under a statewide mandatory bargaining law. However, we do find a strong relationship between mandatory bargaining laws and the likelihood of a teacher being the mobilization target of some other (outside) group.         "
"32","Although the ANES question wording does not specify the identity of the contacting group, we strongly suspect that for most teacher respondents, the group they are reporting contact from is the teachers union. One way to empirically test our suspicion that these outside mobilization contacts are coming at the bequest of a teachers union is to replicate the analysis (using the same model specification) for nonteachers. We report the results of this analysis in column 4 of Table 4 and find no evidence that nonteachers were more likely to report being contacted by an “other” nonparty‐based organization after the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law in their state. Instead, this recruitment effect is confined only to teachers.         "
"33","While we have focused on an organization‐based explanation of increased political participation among teachers, it is also possible that mandatory bargaining laws activated a psychological link between participation and advancing occupational interests in teachers’ minds. This would be consistent with prior studies that demonstrate how public policies (and the material incentives they provide) can activate previously unengaged citizens and motivate them to political action (Campbell 2002, 2003). To test this possibility, we use the same model specification as before to examine the effect of a mandatory bargaining law on the interest of teachers in elections (column 5) and in politics in general (column 6).33 In both models, the coefficient for a mandatory collective bargaining law is not statistically different from zero, indicating that teachers do not report being more interested in elections or politics in general after the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law in their state. These findings suggest that collective bargaining did not, in and of itself, do very much to reverse the individual‐level reticence that teachers reported having about engaging in partisan political activity in surveys from prior decades.34 When considered in tandem with the null results in the political interest models, these estimations suggest that the primary mechanism behind the boost in political participation among teachers is the greater likelihood of teachers unions and other affiliated groups contacting and mobilizing them to political action after the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law.         "
"34","In this article, we apply Schattschneider's (1935, 288) observation that “new policies create a new politics” to the inner workings of government itself. We do so by demonstrating that the adoption of mandatory collective bargaining decreased the costs for public sector employee unions to successfully organize and mobilize government workers in electoral politics. Exploiting variation in the timing of mandatory bargaining laws across states, we find that the political activity of rank‐and‐file teachers (both union members and nonmembers alike) significantly increased after the enactment of a mandatory collective bargaining law. We then investigate our theory that bargaining laws conferred special advantages that subsidized labor organization and mobilization efforts and uncover evidence that teachers (but not other citizens) were significantly more likely to report being asked to participate in electoral activity by an outside (nonpolitical party) group after their state adopted a mandatory bargaining law.         "
"35","These findings contribute to important theoretical debates in several scholarly literatures, including policy feedback, political parties and interest groups, and the bureaucracy. Policy feedback studies frequently consider how government policies can either enhance or deter certain individuals from participating in politics (Mettler and Soss 2004; Schneider and Ingram 1993). However, we extend the logic of the “policies make citizens” thesis beyond the unit of the individual citizen to examine how “policies make interest groups.” In doing so, we show that policies can influence mass behavior not only by altering individual citizens’ attitudes or perceptions about the merits of their own political engagement, but also by constructing privileged relationships between government and organized interests that can then help those privileged groups mobilize their supporters for political action (Walker 1983, 1991).         "
"36","The impact of collective bargaining laws that we uncover suggests that the political power of teachers unions (and public employee unions more generally) would likely be much less if mandatory bargaining laws were never enacted by state governments. Indeed, today the eight million members of public employee unions are a cornerstone of the Democratic electoral coalition. Yet, as Moe (2009, 156) rightly notes, “Students of American politics have had little to say about the rise of public sector unions, and . . . the impact of collective bargaining on the structure and performance of government.” This lack of attention is despite the fact that there are strong theoretical reasons to anticipate that collective bargaining will have important consequences for an array of political phenomena and policy outcomes, consequences that likely extend widely to other public employee groups ranging from police and fire protection to county and city maintenance workers (see Anzia and Moe 2013, 2015).         "
"37","In addition, bureaucracy scholars (particularly those concerned with understanding principal‐agent problems) have typically focused on how structural and informational constraints (i.e., information asymmetry) shape the efficiency, accountability, and overall responsiveness of public agencies. For example, Lipsky's (1980) seminal work highlights how the working conditions and discretion afforded to street‐level bureaucrats influence the delivery of public services and, by extension, public policy outcomes as citizens experience them in daily life. Yet only recently have scholars begun to acknowledge the centrality of rank‐and‐file bureaucrats as influential political activists in their own right (Berry 2009; Carpenter 2001; Moe 2006). Our findings contribute to this emerging area of bureaucracy research by drawing attention to how government decisions to mandate collective bargaining in the public sector have helped shape the balance of power between principals and agents in unionized public agencies.         "
"38","Most importantly, our findings speak directly to the growing debate in the United States about the costs and benefits of public sector collective bargaining laws. For labor supporters, the findings amplify concerns that the ongoing attempts in several states to curtail collective bargaining rights will have the net effect of reducing the influence of public employee unions and exacerbating political inequality. Recent scholarship demonstrates that participation bias in the interest group system persists (Schlozman, Verba, and Brady 2012) long after Schattschneider (1960, 34–35) issued his famous declaration that “the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper‐class accent.” Traditionally, labor unions have been relied upon as a crucial counterbalance to the upper‐class bias in American politics (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995), and several scholars point to the decline of labor union influence as a major cause of the growth in both political inequality and income inequality between the working class and the wealthy (Bartels 2008; Gilens 2012; Gilens and Page 2014; Hacker and Pierson 2010). If state governments are successful in weakening the collective bargaining rights of public employees, it is likely that the political influence of labor unions and their members will only further decline.         "
"39","On the other hand, critics of public employee unions argue that they are the ultimate special interest group—uniquely advantaged in the public policymaking process by being afforded “two bites at the apple.” That is, public sector unions are able to lobby elected officials at both the ballot box and the (collective) bargaining table. As DiSalvo (2010, 10) explains, “‘Government‐workers’ unions [through their political activity] help elect the very politicians who will act as ‘management’ in their contract negotiations—in effect handpicking those who will sit across the bargaining table from them, in a way that workers in a private corporation cannot. Such power led Victor Gotbaum, the leader of District Council 37 of the AFSCME in New York City, to brag in 1975: ‘We have the ability, in a sense, to elect our own boss.’” For those who believe public employee unions have widely contributed to the current fiscal crises (e.g., pension obligations and other legacy costs) facing state and local governments around the nation, our finding that these two bites at the apple (collective bargaining and political activism) work in concert with one another will likely confirm opponents’ convictions that the time to rein in formal government subsidies to public employee unions is long overdue.         "
"40","More broadly, irrespective of how one views these findings from a normative perspective, this study provides an important reminder that the laws governments enact can have enduring and often unanticipated (initially, at least) implications for interest group organization, citizens’ political participation, and, ultimately, the distribution of political power across society."
