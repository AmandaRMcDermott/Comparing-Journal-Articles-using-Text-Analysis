"1","We fielded a fully crossed 6 × 2 between‐subjects design by randomly assigning individuals to a five‐member discussion group composed of between zero and five women and randomly assigning each group to unanimous or majority rule. Random assignment allows us to gauge the unbiased effects of group‐level treatments. To randomize gender composition, we randomly assigned compositions to dates on the schedule of experimental sessions; subjects who signed up to attend a session were thus assigned to the corresponding gender‐composition condition (recruiting alternates to ensure the assigned composition).2 This ensured that composition did not cluster on particular days of the week, and participants had a roughly equal probability of being assigned to a composition, satisfying the random assignment assumption (Morton and Williams 2010). Randomization checks and propensity‐score analyses show that groups are equivalent on relevant covariates.3"
"2","We recruited students and community members at two different sites—a small town on the mid‐Atlantic coast and a medium‐sized city in the Mountain West. Because subjects were randomly assigned within but not across sites, we control on site. The basic results are the same at both sites. In total, we have 470 individuals in 94 groups (Table 1).4"
"3","We adapted the protocol of an earlier study by Frohlich and Oppenheimer (1990, 1992). As in that study, participants were told that they would be performing tasks to earn money, and that the amount they actually received would be based on their task performance and the group's collective decision about redistribution. They were not told the nature of the work task until after the group made its decision about how the money earned during the task would be distributed.5 After privately filling out a pretreatment questionnaire and receiving information about different principles of income distribution, individuals sat with their assigned group around a table. They were instructed to conduct a “full and open discussion” to decide collectively (by secret ballot) on the “most just” principle of redistribution and set a poverty line in dollars. All instructions other than the decision rule were identical across conditions. On average, groups discussed for 25 minutes (SD = 11). Following Frohlich and Oppenheimer (1990, 1992), we instructed participants to reach a group decision that would not only apply to themselves but also could apply hypothetically to society, in order to generalize beyond the lab to the decisions people make about redistribution in politics. Participants then returned to private computer stations and completed the protocol, including assessing the group's functioning, performing tasks to earn money, and answering questions on their attitudes.         "
"4","We taped and transcribed each individual's speech and matched it with his or her individual characteristics, including gender.6 A sample transcript is in the online supporting information. Our content analysis of speech relied on the Linguist Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software (Newman et al. 2008), which counted words in a priori categories we defined. We computed two versions of our dependent variables: (1) a dummy variable indicating whether or not the person mentioned any words in a category at least once (Mention) and (2) the number of category words per thousand spoken (Frequency).7 When multiplied by the total number of women in the group, even small individual increases in Frequency can mean dramatic changes in the number of times the concept is raised overall during the group's deliberation.         "
"5","Our “care” categories correspond to women's distinctive issue priorities outlined above: (1) children, (2) family, (3) poor, and (4) needy.8 We use three contrast categories for the purpose of discriminant validity: (1) rich, (2) salary, and (3) taxes. “Rich” resembles children, families, and the poor in referencing a social group, but it is not one that women prioritize. It serves as a placebo. “Salary” and “taxes” reflect the distinctive priorities of men. Full word lists are in the online supporting information.         "
"6","References to such care issues are found throughout the transcripts. For example, in the midst of a discussion about how much is needed to survive in today's society, a woman asks, “Let's say there's one person who's bringing the income and then a spouse and a child or something like that, or you could even spend it as a single, like, mother who's working with two kids. How much do they need to get by or something like that?” In another group, a woman volunteers, “[I'd] consider a hand‐out because I'm poor. My husband is college educated. I'm trying to go to school, and I have two children, nursing one of them.” These are typical examples of how themes of children, family, poverty, and the needs of vulnerable populations emerged in the deliberation. Additional examples are in the online supporting information."
"7","While our word‐count method has the virtues of simplicity and ease of systematic analysis, it cannot tell us what is being said about these categories. To rule out the possibility that speakers mention women's distinctive topics unsympathetically, we classified each mention as sympathetic, neutral, or negative. The unit of analysis is the speaking turn containing a reference to care issues (n = 1926, the entire set of “care” words we analyze below). For example, negative mentions include “rob from the rich to give to the poor.” Examples of sympathetic phrases are “whether the poor ever get help by anyone, that is not even raised here”; “if like the range is like 50,000 or whatever . . . then the poorer they don't get anything. It's kind of risky”; “I thought maximize the floor income was, that was my number one, help those who have the least.” Mentions are rarely unsympathetic: 11.7% are positive, 5.0% negative, and 79.8% neutral.9"
"8","Building on results from Karpowitz, Mendelberg, and Shaker (2012), we expect that women discuss care issues the least in the conditions that most disadvantage women's floor time and influence—majority rule with minority women. And that is what we find. Women's average individual Frequency of care issues in this setting is 6.3 words per 1,000, about half their care Frequency in any of the other settings. Also as expected, the setting producing the highest women's care Frequency (15 per 1,000) is the setting where women's influence and speaking are highest—majority rule with majority women.10 Frequency is in between these two extremes for unanimous rule groups with minority or majority women (11 words per 1,000).11"
"9","For multivariate tests, we employ probit for Mention and OLS for Frequency.12 The unit of analysis is the individual speaker, and we employ cluster robust standard errors to account for the fact that individuals are nested within groups. We estimate two models. For predicted values, we estimate a set of dummy variables representing each condition, and control on site, number of liberals (a count from 0 to 5), the subject's liberalism, and (for Mention) the log of the person's overall word count to control for overall verbosity (Table A3). To better test the predicted interaction of rule and gender composition and include additional controls, we estimate a model containing a dummy variable for majority versus unanimous rule, a count of the number of women (1 to 4), a variable that multiplies the two, and control on site, liberals, liberalism, the subject's predeliberation preference over redistribution, and the subject's membership in the predeliberation preference majority.            "
"10","Panel A of Figure 1 displays the predicted values for the topics we identified as of distinctive concern to women: the poor, children, family, and the “needy,” depicting the overall Frequency summed over the four care topics. If descriptive representation enhances substantive representation, then it will increase talk on women's distinctive concerns. And that is what the figure shows, but as predicted, only under majority rule. As the number of women increases, so too do women's references to care topics. The effect is quite large. Frequency for a care topic more than triples, moving from 4.2 to 14.8 words per 1,000. The analogous increase in the predicted probability of Mention is from 18% to 54%.13 Moreover, there is no effect under unanimous rule with either Mention (Figures A2 and A3) or Frequency (Figure 1). Notably, Figure 1 also shows that the increasing talk of care issues is not found for financial issues that tend to be favored by men (taxes, salary; Panel B) or for the placebo category “rich” (Panel C).            "
"11","To directly test the predicted interaction of rule and gender composition, we estimated a linear model for the mixed‐gender groups (Table 2). The interaction term is significant, confirming that the effect of descriptive representation differs under the two rules.14 Its magnitude and standard error are virtually unchanged no matter whether we control for group and individual ideology, use a dummy for majority liberals, interact controls for liberalism with rule, omit these controls, or replace them with predeliberation redistribution preferences, membership in the group's predeliberation preference majority, and/or age in a variety of configurations (Table 2).15 In addition, when we remove the individual‐level controls and estimate our interactive model at the group level only (see Table A4), we again find the same strong evidence of an interaction between decision rule and gender composition.            "
"12","We replicated these results with another method, the TM module in R, which identifies the words most frequently used by the sample and calculates for each its proportion of the person's total words. We classified these most frequent words as care issues using the same a priori criteria we applied to the other count.16 Using this alternate method, we again find a significant interaction between gender composition and decision rule, with women devoting more attention to care issues in majority‐rule groups with many women (Table A5).17"
"13","When women are outnumbered, the paucity of women's topics can be quite striking. Under majority rule, lone women never mention family, and only 13% of minority women mention children at least once. In the unanimous condition, however, 46% of minority women mention children (with similar findings for family; p < .01 for children and family; all from raw means), making unanimous rule all the more important in protecting minority women's voice.            "
"14","How do care issues get on the agenda in the first place? An important measure of women's voice is whether they introduce the topics of distinctive concern to them into the deliberation. Figure 2 depicts how often a woman was the first one within the group to mention a topic of specific concern to women, coded at the group level. The dotted line in Figure 2 shows how often women would mention care topics first if there were no difference between men and women (e.g., women would be first‐mentioners 40% of the time when they composed 40% of the group). When women are in the minority, the first mention of a care topic was made by a woman in only 6% of groups under majority rule, but in 31% of groups under unanimity rule (p < .04, one‐tailed, raw means). The difference between rules disappears when women are the majority (53% under majority versus 47% under unanimity rule, n.s.).            "
"15","The pattern is familiar. Descriptive representation helps women but primarily under majority rule, and unanimous rule ameliorates minority women's quiescence. Women reach or approach equality as a majority under majority rule or as a minority with the minority‐friendly unanimous rule. The magnitudes are striking. For example, no lone woman is the first to mention care issues under majority rule, but a lone woman produces the highest individual likelihood of first mentions under unanimous rule."
"16","To control for individuals’ “care” Frequency, verbosity, and liberalism and on liberals and location, we estimated an individual‐level probit model. The interaction of rule and composition remains strong and significant.18 Thus, both group‐ and individual‐level analyses show that women introduce care issues more often in conditions that empower them by the combination of numbers and rule.            "
"17","We can get a clearer picture of women's substantive representation by examining the relative balance of care and financial topics across the conditions. We do this by computing the ratio of average Frequency of care topics to average Frequency of financial topics for each individual in the experiment.19 The ratios are shown in Figure 3 (raw means by condition) and support our interaction hypothesis.20 Majority status matters under majority but not unanimous rule: the average woman's ratio of care to financial topics increases under majority rule, from 0.44 as a minority to 2.7 as a majority (p < .01), but it declines slightly and not significantly under unanimous rule (from 2.05 as a minority to 1.61 as a majority, p = .50). These numbers also show that unanimous rule helps women who are outnumbered by men (0.44 under majority rule and 2.05 under unanimous rule, p = .04). Finally, the interaction between gender composition and decision rule is significant, meaning that the effect of increased numbers is different under majority rule than under unanimity (p = .02).21 Numbers benefit women only under majority rule, while unanimous rule protects minority women's voice.            "
"18","We have focused primarily on women since it is women's voice that is at issue in the theoretical and political debates that prompt this study. Figure 4 displays predicted values for men (using the same model as above) and shows that the average man is also affected by women's descriptive representation under majority rule, but by a more modest magnitude than the average woman: the ratio of care to financial Frequency increases from 1.19 (with female minorities) to 1.42 (with female majorities). Under unanimous rule, the ratio increase is similar, from 1.20 to 1.48. In addition, unanimous rule does not substantially elevate the average man's relative emphasis on women's priorities when women are a minority—unanimous rule protects minority women's voice but does not empower women to influence men's speech.22"
"19","Men are, however, affected by the experimental conditions with respect to the topic that is most distinctively women's concern: children. Under majority rule with one woman present, only 19% of men raise the topic of children versus 69% who mention salary‐related issues. However, surrounded by four women, men's focus reverses: 62% now mention children, as compared to 50% who discuss salary.23 But the effects of gender composition do not extend to discussions of the poor or the needy (predicted probabilities from the dummy model using Mention, Table A3). Overall, Figure 4 shows evidence of movement in the direction of a higher ratio of care to financial issues, but the movement is modest and not statistically robust.            "
"20","Finally, the overall substantive representation of women's distinctive issues can also be measured by the average ratio for all participants, including both women and men. Figure 5 shows that when they are empowered by the combination of the rule and their numbers, women can move the overall focus of the group discussion: the ratio of care to financial Frequency goes up substantially—more than doubling—as women go from minority to majority, but only under majority rule, where it increases from 1.04 to 2.30 (p < .01).24 For unanimous rule, the effect of gender composition on the group is much smaller, from 1.45 to 1.52, and not statistically significant.25 Women need the power of both large numbers and a rule that favors large numbers to have the biggest effect on the terms of the group discussion. Unlike the finding on women's talk and consistent with men's talk, unanimous rule confers no statistically discernible benefits over majority rule in minority‐female groups (the ratios increase from 1.04 under majority rule to 1.45 under unanimous rule).26 Despite their increased attention to issues of care, women's small numbers make it difficult for them to affect the overall tenor of the discussion.            "
"21","So far we have not asked if women's voices are disadvantaged relative to men's—that is, if a gender gap in voice exists or how it changes with the conditions. We do so using the Mention measure, which can be interpreted as the chance that a given person refers to the issue and allows us to move the question from how much a person talks to how many people talk. We ask whether women are less likely to raise their distinctive concerns than men are to raise theirs, in the conditions prevalent in the real world—majority rule and minority women. The answer is yes: in these conditions, a woman's probability of mentioning care issues is 57%; a man's probability of mentioning financial issues is 81% (p < .03, two‐tailed). Thus, in the typical political setting, there is a gender gap in voice. But when women compose a majority under majority rule, the percentages reverse: 89% for women and care versus 68% for men and financial, respectively (p < .04).27 Yet that is not the only way to remedy women's disadvantage. Leaving women as a minority but changing the rule from majority to unanimous raises women's probability of mentioning care issues to 91% and lowers men's probability of mentioning financial issues to 72% (p < .05). That is, women are severely disadvantaged relative to men in their group as a minority under majority rule, and they are not disadvantaged as a majority under majority rule or as a minority under unanimous rule.28"
"22","To illustrate these effects, we provide some qualitative examples in the online supporting information. They show that in conditions of gender equality, women introduce women's topics; when these topics are introduced, they are taken up by subsequent speakers, and women tend to mention these topics to argue for generosity, help, or meeting a need. In conditions with gender inequality, these are less likely, and when a women's topic is mentioned, it tends to die in the conversation."
"23","The final question is whether groups with a higher Frequency of care issues also subsequently set a higher minimum guaranteed income. Children are far more likely to live in poverty than adults.29 To the extent that poverty policy is more generous to the poor, children will especially benefit. So people concerned with the needs of children may well be more interested in a generous minimum income for the poor, and the more that the discussion focuses on the needs of children and on their care, the higher the minimum income will be. In addition, all the referents of care issues—children, families, the needy, and the poor—tend to be viewed sympathetically (Gilens 1999); so the more they are discussed as beneficiaries, the more generous the assistance is likely to be.30"
"24","The evidence supports this prediction, but as expected, women's position in the group matters (Table 3).31 The dependent variable is the group's minimum guaranteed income. Under majority rule, the effect of women's Frequency ratio of care to financial issues is negative when women are in the minority, but large and positive in interaction with majority‐female compositions. But under unanimous rule, numbers do not moderate the effect of ratio.32 Figure 6 displays this rule‐numbers interaction, showing how the group's predicted generosity changes with a two standard deviation increase in the average female ratio. When women are disempowered by small numbers under majority rule, raising issues of distinctive concern to women backfires: the more the average woman talks about care issues at the expense of financial issues, the less generous the group becomes (this difference in predicted values is significant at p < .02, one‐tailed). This result reveals the depth of women's disempowerment in typical settings. Conversely, when numbers favor women under majority rule, the group is generous toward the poor whether women raise care issues often or not (though women are much more likely to raise such issues when they are the majority).33 Women can raise the group's generosity by raising care issues, but only when the rule and numbers elevate their status in the group.            "
"25","Group Generosity as Women's Emphasis on Care Issues Changes, by Gender Composition and RuleNote: Predicted values from Table 3.                        "
"26","Because women's voice is endogenous, however, we need to confirm the relationship between women's status in the group and generosity using only exogenous measures—namely, the experimental conditions. Doing so confirms our expectations. Women's descriptive representation under majority rule results in more generous redistribution (controlling on location and liberals): the guaranteed minimum income is $3,580 higher in majority‐female than minority‐female groups (p < .05, one‐tailed test). In groups deciding by unanimity, however, this model produces no statistically significant difference in generosity between majority‐ and minority‐female groups (Table A7).34 Thus, as predicted by our interaction hypothesis, women interacting with men do best as a numerical majority, but only under majority rule, where they are most likely to talk about women's distinctive issues relative to men's. Under those conditions, women achieve a more generous minimal standard of living for a population that they tend to want to benefit.35"
"27","We expected that matching the decision rule with a gender composition equalizes women's status, with women not only enjoying equal participation and authority, but also speaking to their distinctive concerns and aligning the group's decision with these concerns. The evidence is consistent with these notions. Women are worse off in groups with few women and majority rule. Unanimous rule dampens or eliminates this deleterious effect of minority status. As we found with participation and influence, so it is with the agenda and its influence over the outcome—when women are numerical minorities, they are better off with unanimous rule, and as majorities, they are better off with majority rule. These effects are not due to preferences correlated with gender, nor are they consistent with an explanation based on social contagion or appealing to the gender majority, since they are not the effects of numbers alone but of numbers combined with rule. These patterns support our argument that rules and numbers jointly create norms that either empower and include women or fail to do so. The findings represent the power of the setting to produce or mute women's voice on issues of distinctive concern to women.36"
"28","Different types of substantive representation require different settings. To maximize women's voice on women's distinctive issues, choose settings with many women and majority rule or all‐female groups under either rule. To empower individual women to introduce care issues into debate, assemble minority‐female groups with unanimous rule. If the goal is to maximize the overall voice for women's distinctive issues, or to prompt men to speak to these issues, the settings are many women under majority rule. To maximize the relative emphasis of care to financial issues in the discussion, the setting is again majority rule with many women or all‐female groups under either rule. To translate women's voice into decisions that improve the lot of the disadvantaged or the unfortunate, in line with women's distinctive priorities, one should avoid majority rule with few women, which is the single most deleterious setting for women across multiple measures. If one had to pick the one setting that yields the most forms of substantive representation for women, one should pick majority rule with many women."
"29","Our measure has important limits: mere mention of a topic does not indicate a particular position on the left‐right policy spectrum. We have three responses to this valid criticism. First, studies we reviewed suggest that women are both likely to mention these topics and to take liberal positions on these topics. Second, we showed that the mentions in our study are almost never negative. Third, the salience of a topic is itself an important type of substantive representation; in fact, some theorists argue that the presence of an issue on the agenda is the most important measure of political power (Bachrach and Baratz 1962; Gaventa 1982). The disagreement cannot come to light, and no view on the issue can be aired if the topic remains off the agenda. To be sure, where people mention women's distinctive issues but women lack power, the outcome runs against generosity to the vulnerable. Nevertheless, our evidence suggests that on the whole, the conditions where women speak to their distinctive topics tend to foster group decisions in line with women's tendency to prefer generosity. Thus, counting words is a useful way to analyze representation, especially since we also analyze the direction of the decision toward which these words lead.         "
"30","We address several caveats about our results. Discussion moderators may mitigate gender inequality; on the other hand, moderators typically are not focused on gender equality (Mansbridge et al. 2006). The effects we found may diminish when the topic is clearly feminine. Our study was conducted with non‐Hispanic whites since the effects may differ for other populations; this can be tested in future work. Group size may be a moderator. Culture or ideology may also be moderators, though we do replicate the results in two very different milieus in the United States—one a socially conservative, religious community in the West and the other a liberal, secular community on the East Coast. The findings are thus not limited to only conservatives or liberals.37"
"31","Though conducted in the lab, our study resembled the “real world” in important respects. The task mirrored the purpose of many deliberative settings—the members were asked to make decisions about the distribution of resources both to themselves and in society. In many real settings, deliberations are structured and directed by officials or authorities, and participants are unfamiliar with each other (Jacobs, Cook, and Delli Carpini 2009, 72). Many of these settings have a group size similar to ours. The findings may thus generalize to many settings where citizens congregate in small groups to discuss matters of common concern. Such settings are ubiquitous: juries, local boards, neighborhood councils, and the plethora of community and civic meetings that characterize the United States (Burns, Schlozman, and Verba 2001). Approximately 45% of Americans report attending such a meeting at least once in the past year (Karpowitz 2006; see also Conover, Searing, and Crewe 2002, Table 3).         "
"32","This study makes several contributions. Although studies have documented that female representatives act on a distinctive set of concerns from male representatives (e.g., Carroll 2001; Swers 2002), we are not aware of studies showing that women articulate different topics or words from similar men in public discussions (for excellent small‐N studies, see Kathlene 1994; Mattei 1998). No study of inequality in representation has used any of the features we use: a large number of groups; randomly assigned treatments; or links between the person's and group's pre‐ and postdeliberation attitudes with actual speech behavior during deliberation. Linking speech to predeliberation preferences allows us to control on ideology and preferences over the group decision and thus isolate the effects of gender. Therefore, we can conclude that conditions that increase women's talk of women's topics do so by altering the gender dynamic specifically. Our placebo tests further indicate that the shift occurs on women's distinctive issues only and is not caused by nongendered conformity or majority‐induced dynamics. In addition, we are not aware of studies documenting that men adopt speech similar to women's, and they do so as women's influence rises. The rich data allow us to conduct a large number of tests and do so rigorously.         "
"33","The key point of our study is that women's voice in deliberative settings varies a great deal with the institutional setting. Studies of women's representation in legislatures have recognized as much for other institutional variables (Carroll 2001; Grunenfelder and Baechtiger 2007; Kathlene 1994). Our results suggest that rules and norms shape norms of interaction. These norms affect men as well as women. They produce quite different levels of conversational salience for the topics that tend to concern women. In these ways, institutional settings can contribute to or detract from equal substantive representation for unequal social groups. Institutional rules and descriptive representation interact to shape substantive representation via the salience of women's concerns. To the extent that our results apply to legislative settings and other elite groups, our study also makes a broader contribution to the study of descriptive representation by unpacking the process of interaction and showing how gender composition and rules affect it.         "
"34","As Mansbridge (1999) notes, descriptive representation of a social group can promote the group's distinctive perspectives. But as she argued in her magisterial study of deliberative democracy (1983), processes of consensus, and the rules that prompt them, matter. We argue that these processes interact with descriptive representation. And we have unpacked the black box of deliberation to show how, and when, descriptive representation matters for substantive representation.         "
