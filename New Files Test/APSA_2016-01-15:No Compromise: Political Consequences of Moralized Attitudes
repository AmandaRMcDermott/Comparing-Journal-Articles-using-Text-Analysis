"2","To the man of rigid morality … it is better not to agree at all than to agree to an imperfect bargain. (Dahl 1967, 53)               "
"3","In August 2011, President Obama signed legislation providing for cuts to discretionary spending to go into effect in 2013. The reductions were to affect a host of spending areas: Medicare, scientific research, the military, education, housing assistance, and food and drug safety would face significant reductions. Moreover, the cuts were to be indiscriminate; administrators would have almost no discretion with which to prioritize crucial programs over dispensable ones."
"4","Initially, the rash nature of the cuts was thought to be a virtue: They were so clearly suboptimal and unpalatable to Democrats and Republicans alike that they were certain never to take effect. Instead, they were a specter designed to give the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction the cover to craft a meaningful compromise that would address looming fiscal problems. The committee's mandate was unprecedented; its proposal would be guaranteed an up‐or‐down vote in both houses of Congress, immune from amendment, filibuster, and party gatekeeping obstacles. But incredibly, the committee never offered a proposal. It too was unable to bridge internal divisions. As the budget sequestration took effect, Peter Welch, the representative from Vermont, remarked, “One hundred percent of Congress opposed it, and we're doing it. That's a sign of a dysfunctional institution” (quoted in Weisman 2013).         "
"5","This article examines the psychological antecedents of uncompromising politics, focusing on pressures that work through the “electoral connection” (Mayhew 1974). I entertain the idea that, separate from policy preferences, citizens make predictable judgments about the style in which their representatives should act: whether they should cooperate with opponents, bargain over policy, and, in a word, compromise. Admittedly, existing work gives reason to doubt that citizens have crystallized opinions about compromise itself. Opinions about procedural matters are underdeveloped (Geer et al. 2004; Nicholson 2005), and it is easy to imagine opinions about compromise being epiphenomenal—emerging backwards out of partisan or other attachments (Harbridge, Malhotra, and Harrison 2014; Sniderman et al. 1986). I examine compromise from a different angle, looking not at whether citizens endorse and apply compromise as a general principle, but rather at the psychological antecedents to judgments in specific cases (cf. Glaser and Ryan 2013, chap. 3).         "
"6","A psychological literature on attitude intensity provides some guidance concerning how citizens might evaluate compromises. As I review below, attitudes can be intense in several different ways. Some aspects of attitude intensity might predict aversion to compromise, for instance if a strong preference for one policy outcome makes it unpalatable to accept any alternative. Then again, one can imagine some aspects of attitude intensity increasing support for compromise (e.g., a devout student concerned that a school's policy will prevent her from praying during the day might be enthusiastic about compromise). To better understand judgments about compromise, I adopt a comparative approach, systematically examining (across several issues) which aspects of attitude intensity induce opposition to compromise.         "
"7","I pay special attention to a set of mental processes that might be particularly valuable for understanding such judgments: intuitions about right and wrong. Moral intuitions are quite distinctive in character. They engage mental systems that regulate adherence to perceived duties and prohibitions (Baron and Spranca 1997; Haidt, Koller, and Dias 1993; Tetlock 2003). They orient evaluative processes away from maximizing gains and toward adherence to rules of conduct (e.g., Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010). They evoke powerful emotions, especially toward divergent opinions (Haidt 2003). Additionally, scholars argue that they have an evolutionary (DeScioli and Kurzban 2013; Sinnott‐Armstrong 2007a; Tooby and Cosmides 2010) and neural (e.g., Berns et al. 2012; Greene et al. 2001; Sinnott‐Armstrong 2007b) basis.         "
"8","Motivated by these observations, I leverage improvements in the conception and measurement of moralized attitudes to assess whether they are notably resistant to compromise. Study 1 examines within‐person variation in aspects of attitude intensity, including moralization, assessing which aspects predict resistance to bargains on political issues. In four separate data sets, attitude extremity and moral conviction predict opposition to compromise, whereas personal importance and relevance (two other dimensions) exhibit weaker relationships. Study 2, which draws on a separate national sample, examines the relationship between attitude intensity and vote choice, finding a similar pattern as concerns opposition to a candidate expected to negotiate with political opponents. Study 3 offers subjects money if they make a concession associated with a political issue. Again, attitude extremity and moralization predict who will pay a cost to avoid cash flowing in support of a disliked political stance, but attitude importance and relevance do not."
"9","Thus, this research accumulates consistent evidence that intense attitudes are not all alike. In particular, moralized attitudes are associated with a distinctive processing style that has important ramifications for how citizens render judgments about compromise. In the conclusion, I lay out an agenda for integrating this finding into dynamic models of politics."
"10","The idea that attitudes are multidimensional has long played a role in the study of politics. Robert Dahl's study of democratic theory, for instance, argues that analysts need to consider two properties of an attitude separately: its content and the intensity with which it is held (1956, chap. 4). Psychologists have enriched this perspective considerably. Attitudes differ in the extent to which they are extreme, important, elaborated, accessible, certain, conscious, and several other properties (for helpful overviews, see Abelson 1988; Miller and Peterson 2008; Petty and Krosnick 1995).         "
"11","A subset of attitudes engage a suite of mental processes that we experience as morality (Baron and Spranca 1997; Fiske and Tetlock 1997; Mikhail 2007).1 These attitudes are perceived as objective and universally true—standards that others should share (Skitka 2010). They evoke moral emotions, such as guilt, disgust, and contempt (Tangney, Stuewig, and Mashek 2007). They elicit monitoring and judgment of others' actions (Kurzban 2011, chap. 9). Moral attitudes are likely to be extreme, but they are more than that, for only some extreme attitudes are moralized. To see the difference, compare a nonmoral preference—“I don't like Brussels sprouts” —to one that, for many people, is moralized—“I don't like to clean my bathroom with an American flag.” A dislike of Brussels sprouts can be arbitrarily extreme, but unlike cleaning a bathroom with a patriotic symbol, it is easier to imagine reasonable disagreement and harder to imagine someone else's violation inspiring anger or contempt.2"
"12","A distinctive characteristic of attitudes relevant to morality is that they resist processing through a cost/benefit framework (Baron and Spranca 1997; Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010; Tetlock et al. 2000). There are several vivid illustrations. For instance, dozens of studies on so‐called “runaway trolley problems” present subjects with hypothetical dilemmas in which they can sacrifice one life to save several. Subjects overwhelmingly endorse doing so when it involves a nonmoralized action (e.g., flipping a switch to make the trolley run on a different track), but not when it involves a moral prohibition (e.g., pushing someone off a bridge onto the train tracks; for a review, see Greene 2007a). Subjects asked whether they would open a river dam to save 20 species of fish from extinction if doing so would lead to the extinction of two other species said they would not, since they would not want to “cause” the death of any species (Ritov and Baron 1999). Ginges and colleagues find that, when it comes to negotiating over a “sacred” issue (land division between Israelis and Palestinians), incorporating material incentives into a concession backfires, increasing support for violent opposition (Ginges et al. 2007).         "
"13","These empirical demonstrations coincide with more commonplace observations. Barring pathological thinking, what benefits would a patriot accept to defile his country's flag? A scientist to falsify data? A law‐abiding citizen to lie in court or accept an expensive gift she knew to be stolen? A religious person to vandalize her place of worship? The obstacle to these trade‐offs is not that they are costly; it is that they preclude considering cost. To seriously contemplate them is to “think the unthinkable” (Tetlock 2003, 320).         "
"14","In two important ways, the new psychological synthesis concerning morality revises the political science assumptions about where moral thinking will arise. First, Converse (1964) convincingly demonstrated that most citizens do not approach the political world with a developed ideology, a finding that might be taken to preclude the notion that they really think about morality. This conclusion, however, assumes moral convictions to be deductive and internally consistent. In contrast, recent psychological work finds moral convictions to be primarily intuitive (Haidt 2001, 2012). For instance, many subjects cannot explain why they believe it would be wrong to consume a family pet after it died of natural causes—they cannot articulate what principle this view derives from—but they exhibit strong negative emotional reactions to the proposition nonetheless (Haidt, Koller, and Dias 1993). Thus, citizens might have moralized attitudes even if they cannot explain the basis of the moralization. Moreover, moral convictions might be surprisingly detached from things often assumed to be precursors of a moral disposition, such as endorsement of certain values (e.g., egalitarianism, individualism) or religious devotion.         "
"15","Second, but related, where political scientists have sought to identify a role for moral thinking in politics, they often assume that moral processing naturally coincides with specific topics, such as abortion, the death penalty, capital punishment, school prayer, or same‐sex marriage. Economic issues are assumed to evoke fundamentally different patterns of thought, and thus to be intrinsically nonmoral (e.g., Tatalovich and Daynes 2011, xxxiii). But the distinction between social and economic issues is socially constructed, not a natural kind, so there is little reason to expect it to coincide neatly with innate brain processes. Motivated by this observation, Ryan (2014), using the same measurement paradigm as described below, directly measures moralization of both economic and noneconomic issues. In both domains, he finds substantial individual‐level variation in terms of what is moralized.         "
"16","In short, where political science scholarship has long considered moral attitudes to be deductive, constrained, and homogeneous across individuals, there is good reason to consider them as intuitive, atomized, and variable across individuals—a “fairly loose collection of intuitions, rules of thumb, and emotional responses” (Pizarro 2007, 63). This bottom‐up approach to conceiving moral attitudes might be unfamiliar, but it fits well with an oft‐noted feature of moral psychology: the incredible diversity in what actions are moralized across time and place (cf. Rozin 1999; Shweder 2012).         "
"17","The foregoing discussion suggests that moral attitudes could powerfully influence how citizens render political judgments, but also that a top‐down approach, which makes assumptions about where and how moralization arises, might lead to misleading conclusions. If attitudes become moralized in a more haphazard way than has previously been appreciated, then characterizing their effects might require direct measurement—preferably with an approach that makes few assumptions about where moralization will arise. The task is difficult. Humans have limited introspective powers and are adept at manufacturing false rationales on the fly (Nisbett and Wilson 1977), so one possibility—asking people to elaborate on the reasons that underlie a particular opinion—is likely to elicit spurious responses (for a discussion, see Skitka and Bauman 2008, 36).         "
"18","Linda Skitka and colleagues have developed an alternative approach that takes advantage of the fact that, although individuals lack introspective access to reasons for their opinions, they do reliably have a visceral perception (a metacognition) that certain opinions are a matter of right and wrong. Skitka and colleagues' Moral Conviction battery asks subjects to report, typically on a 5‐point scale, “to what extent is your position on [attitude object] a reflection of your core moral beliefs and convictions” and “. . .connected to your beliefs about fundamental right and wrong?” This approach has been validated across several studies and been found to have discriminant validity with respect to other attitude characteristics (Skitka 2010; Skitka et al. 2015; Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis 2005). It also exhibits generally low correlations with individual traits including age, political orientation, education, political knowledge, church attendance, and cognitive rigidity (Ryan 2014; Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis 2005; Wisneski, Skitka, and Morgan 2011).3 Moral conviction exhibits test‐retest stability on par with other aspects of attitude intensity (Skitka 2010; Skitka et al. 2015).         "
"19","The approach in the studies below will be to measure the moral conviction metacognition directly—applying no assumptions about for which individuals or topics it will arise—and then assess how well it explains judgments about compromise, relative to other facets of attitude intensity."
"20","The foregoing discussion of the rule‐bound character of moral intuitions implies a hypothesis: Morally convicted attitudes will be particularly resistant to compromise. Moreover, since there is reason to think that moral conviction reflects activation of a specialized brain processes not reducible to other aspects of intensity, moral conviction should predict opposition to compromise irrespective of other facets of intensity."
"21","To evaluate how distinctive moral conviction is, I adopt a systematically comparative approach, examining it in tandem with other recognized aspects of attitude intensity. This approach has the additional benefit of addressing ambiguities concerning how the other dimensions relate to compromise. The three dimensions for comparison were chosen for their political significance and plausible relationship to judgments about compromise. First, extremity is “the degree to which the favorability of an individual's attitude diverges from neutral” (Wegener et al. 1995, 465). It might predict compromise, since extremity is taken to capture the “unqualifiedness” of a person's issue position (Abelson 1995, 38): The preference for one policy outcome is made without recognizing anything appealing about alternatives. Second, importance is “a person's perception of the amount of personal importance he or she attaches to an attitude” (Wegener et al. 1995, 467) or, stated plainly, caring about something (Visser, Bizer, and Krosnick 2006, 3). While citizens with non‐important attitudes might readily acquiesce to a compromise since they profess to be unconcerned with the outcome, those who care might find it more difficult to do so. Third, personal relevance is “the extent to which people believe that a topic or attitude object holds significant consequences for some aspects of their lives” (Wegener et al. 1995, 470). As illustrated in the school prayer example above, personally relevant attitudes might predict acceptance of compromise, at least if the compromise can resolve an impasse.4"
"22","While straightforward, the conjecture that aspects of attitude intensity bear on judgments in different ways is potentially far‐reaching. In political science, survey instruments routinely measure attitudes with a single item (usually focused on extremity), perhaps assuming that attitude extremity is a sufficient proxy for many attitude characteristics. The hypothesis above suggests that, for at least some kinds of judgments, a more comprehensive measurement approach might illustrate that equally extreme attitudes are not all alike."
"23","Study 1 focuses on how citizens evaluate compromises about specific political issues. It uses a design that exploits within‐person variation in attitude intensity while holding constant individual‐level characteristics that might also predict compromise."
"24","Study 1 draws data from three convenience samples and one national sample. First, a researcher visited political science courses at a large university and administered a questionnaire to undergraduates as part of an in‐class activity (N = 217). Second, a nearly identical questionnaire was administered to a somewhat larger (N = 472) sample of American workers on Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service (cf. Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012). The study was later replicated on a separate Mechanical Turk sample (N = 317) and then again on a larger (N = 604) national sample collected via a contract with Survey Sampling International (SSI).5 Table 1 describes the data sources for this and subsequent studies. The supporting information reports demographic information for all samples.            "
"25","The questionnaires measured attitudes with respect to five political issues, which were presented in random order. In the student and MTurkA samples, the issues were Social Security reform, collective bargaining rights, stem cell research, same‐sex marriage, and the presence of American troops in Afghanistan. For the MTurkB and SSI samples, corporate taxation and investment in renewable energy were substituted for same‐sex marriage and troops in Afghanistan to accumulate evidence across a broader array of issues. Overall, the issues were chosen to examine an array of topics that are both putatively moral and nonmoral."
"26","For each issue, subjects were asked to consider two possible approaches—one identifiably liberal in character, and one conservative. For instance, the Social Security topic asked:               "
"27","As you may know, the Social Security program in the United States is projected to run out of funds in 2033 if changes are not made. One idea that has been proposed to address the problem is to raise taxes on people currently in the work force. Alternatively, some people have proposed cutting back on the benefits the government provides future retirees. How about you? Would you prefer to see taxes raised to preserve benefits at the current level, or would you prefer to cut benefits so taxes don't have to go up?"
"28","Preferences for one option over the other were recorded on a 7‐point scale with a neutral point. To construct a measure of attitude Extremity, these responses were folded at the midpoint. Importance is measured by the follow‐up question, “How important is this issue to you personally?” Relevance is measured by another follow‐up: “How much does the outcome of this issue directly affect you?”6 Moral Conviction was measured using Skitka and colleagues' (2005) Moral Conviction battery.7 The supporting information reports all correlations between these measures, as well as factor analyses showing Moral Conviction to be correlated with other aspects of intensity, but empirically distinct from them. (The supporting information also reports all question wording for this and subsequent studies.)            "
"29","After attitudes about all five issues were recorded, subjects moved on to a new section of the survey. They were asked, without prior warning, to evaluate a plausible compromise concerning each of the already considered issues.8 For instance, the Social Security prompt read:               "
"30","Suppose there were a proposal in Congress to address the Social Security shortfall with a mixture of the two approaches. Some tax deductions would end and, as a result, most people would pay more. But benefits scheduled for people more than five years away from retirement would decrease, also serving to bridge the shortfall. Would you favor such a proposal, oppose it, or neither favor nor oppose it?"
"31","Responses to these prompts were recorded on a 7‐point scale that ranged from “strongly favor” to “strongly oppose.” For analysis, all variables were rescaled to run from 0 to 1.9"
"32","To estimate the relationship for Moral Conviction as separated from each individual's general propensity to compromise, as well as the idiosyncrasies of particular issues, I pool all responses and estimate using ordinary least squares (OLS):               "
"33","The results, presented in Table 2, suggest that attitude characteristics relate to compromise in a textured way. Extreme attitudes significantly predict opposition to compromise ( in three samples;  in the SSI sample). There is a significant relationship () for  in the student sample, though it does not replicate in the other samples.  exhibits no appreciable relationship to the dependent variable in any sample.            "
"34","There is consistent support for the hypothesis that moral conviction evokes opposition to compromise above and beyond other attitude characteristics (p < .01 for three samples; p < .03 in the MTurkB sample). The magnitude of the relationships merits note: They are comparable to Extremity in three samples, and larger than Extremity in the SSI sample ().            "
"35","Thus, Study 1 finds that aspects of attitude intensity relate to compromise in different ways. Extreme attitudes predict opposition to compromise, but Importance has an inconsistent bearing on compromise, and Relevance shows no correspondence at all. Whether or not an attitude is moralized seems to explain about as much about whether a compromise will be acceptable as knowing that a citizen's attitude is extreme.10"
"36","For a simpler look at the explanatory purchase afforded by Moral Conviction, as distinct from attitude Extremity, I create (within the SSI data set) indicators for attitudes that are at the highest level of Extremity (31.7% of issue attitudes) and Moral Conviction (15.6% of issue attitudes). Figure 1 shows simple means for the compromise dependent measure, depending on whether attitudes are extreme and/or moral. Moralization predicts substantially reduced support for compromise, whether attitudes are extreme or not.            "
"37","Support for Compromise"
"38","Note: Support for compromise, scaled 0–1, depending on whether attitudes are extreme and/or morally convicted. Whiskers are standard errors. Source: SSI data set.                        "
"39","The supporting information reports several additional analyses that evaluate potential concerns about the results in Study 1. First, since the attitude dimensions were measured with a different number of items, I examine whether Moral Conviction predicts compromise when measured with one item, rather than two. It does. Second, I examine whether Moral Conviction might simply reflect the conjunction of attitudes that are both extreme and personally important. Reestimating the models in Table 2 with Extremity × Importance interactions does not diminish Moral Conviction's predictive power. Third, I examine the implications of a short time interval between the measurement of Moral Conviction and the compromise items. A separate investigation (Study 4) finds that Moral Conviction remains a significant predictor of compromise even when the latter is measured after a delay of several weeks.            "
"40","Having accumulated evidence that moralized attitudes are resistant to compromise, I now turn to studies investigating their broader effects."
"41","Politicians' ideological reputations are quite separable from their reputations as compromisers. Of course, some ideological extremists tout uncompromising stances.11 But there are also examples of ideologically committed individuals who cultivate a reputation as compromisers. For instance, Senators Ted Kennedy and John McCain both have a record of working across the aisle. Study 2 examines whether moralized attitudes weigh on the approach citizens like their representatives to adopt. As in Study 1, I compare moral conviction to other aspects of attitude intensity.         "
"42","Data were collected by GfK Research, which uses random‐digit‐dial and address‐based sampling methods to construct a nationally representative sample. The study was in the field from May 30 to June 10, 2013, and has 1,345 respondents. All analyses below are weighted to be reflective of the national population."
"43","The study focused on opinions about Social Security reform, which was selected for several reasons. It is an economic issue and therefore allows testing of the idea that moral psychology matters for policies that are not typically regarded as moral. Moreover, policy experts acknowledge that the current level of taxation cannot support the current level of benefits beyond 2033, so it is an appealing focus for compromise. Nevertheless, when elites talk about Social Security reform, some entrench themselves in uncompromising positions (cf. Scott 2015).            "
"44","The outset of the study measured the extremity, importance, personal relevance, and moral conviction of attitudes concerning Social Security reform."
"45","After registering their opinion about Social Security reform, each subject was asked to evaluate two congressional candidates who agreed with the subject's Social Security views. Figure 2 shows the question seen by respondents who opposed Social Security cuts. Respondents who supported Social Security cuts saw an alternative version that described two “fairly conservative Republicans” and listed four different policies. Respondents who selected the neutral point on the stem Social Security question were randomly assigned to one of the two question versions. Additionally, for balance, the slate of positions associated with Candidate A and B was randomly assigned (such that “negotiable” was associated with Candidate A in half the cases, but always attached to the same policy). Respondents were asked how likely they would be to support each candidate in the election on a 5‐point scale ranging from “not at all” to “very.” I subtracted one candidate's support from the other's to construct a measure of preference for the compromising politician (the dependent variable).            "
"46","Politicians Who Differ on Compromise"
"47","Note: Question seen by respondents who opposed Social Security cuts in Study 2. Respondents who favored cuts saw an alternative version. The slate of issue positions was randomly swapped between Candidates A and B.                        "
"48","Table 3 shows the results of a model (OLS) in which support for the compromising politician is regressed on measures of Social Security attitude Extremity, Importance, Relevance, and Moral Conviction. Similar to Study 1, Importance and Relevance exhibit small, nonsignificant relationships with support for the compromising politician. The subjective perception of relevance captured by a direct question is likely the best way to measure personal relevance, but as an additional check, Model 2 also examines an objective factor that should determine the personal relevance of the Social Security issue: Income. As can be seen, this measure also does not predict support for a compromising candidate. Moralization, in contrast, predicts compromise as well as extremity does.            "
"49","Study 1 examined within‐subject variation of the attitude strength measures across issues. Study 2, in contrast, only examines one issue per subject. Since individual‐level characteristics are no longer absorbed by fixed effects, it is prudent to examine whether the measures of attitude intensity are simply standing in for something more familiar. Strength of partisanship is one contender here. Given the symbolic and expressive nature of partisanship (Huddy, Mason, and Aarøe 2015), the strength of a subject's party identification might predict opposition to compromise. As Model 3 shows, taking account of partisanship (entered separately for Republicans and Democrats) reveals only a moderate relationship to compromise. The relationship is statistically significant for Republicans, though the Democratic and Republican coefficients are not statistically distinguishable from each other.12 Importantly, taking account of partisanship does not appreciably change the results for Moral Conviction.            "
"50","Religiosity is another possible confounder for moral conviction. Perhaps devout respondents are likely to have morally convicted attitudes concerning Social Security, and also oppose the Social Security compromise. In fact, the correlation between Church Attendance and Moral Conviction is small () and taking account of Church Attendance does not affect conclusions about Moral Conviction (Model 3).            "
"51","One potential concern surrounding the empirical tests presented above is that they are abstract. Citizens oppose compromise and punish compromising politicians on morally convicted issues, but perhaps their rigidity would soften if actual material gains were at stake—if they really had skin in the game. To evaluate this possibility, Study 3 presents subjects with a dilemma in which they can receive a monetary reward, but only if they make a concession associated with a political issue. This test investigates in a more concrete way the idea that moral conviction is associated with a distinctive mind‐set for evaluating trade‐offs: one in which material benefits are less enticing and can do little to offset an unpalatable result (a mind‐set antithetical to compromise)."
"52","Data come from the same instrument and subjects described in Study 2. After registering their Social Security attitudes, subjects were invited to receive cash, but with a trade‐off. Figure 3 shows the dilemma posed to individuals who oppose cuts to Social Security benefits (as well as a random half of individuals who chose the neutral point on the stem question). All other respondents saw an alternative formulation in which a donation would be made to “the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), an organization whose supporters strongly oppose changes to Social Security benefits.” The effort is to construct a measure of subjects' willingness to accept (WTA) benefits.13"
"53","Measuring Willingness to Accept Benefits"
"54","Note: Willingness To Accept (WTA) measure posed to individuals who oppose cuts to Social Security. Individuals who favor cuts saw an alternative formulation in which “Progressive Change Campaign Committee” is substituted for Tea Party Patriots.                        "
"55","As can be seen in the figure, the response options in the WTA measure were chosen with attention to their symbolic meaning. Option E provides maximum benefit to the subject and is thus the alternative that would be expected under at least some formulations of a homo economicus perspective. Option C would be chosen by individuals who are willing to accept benefits as long as they are not exceeded by the disliked group. Option B would be attractive to individuals who are willing to gain as long as their gains outpace those given to the disliked group. Option A would be attractive to individuals who would accept no benefit whatsoever, if it means lending support to the disliked view.14"
"56","Table 4 shows the distribution of responses to the WTA measure, depending on whether the disliked group was the Tea Party or the PCCC. As can be seen, the vast majority of respondents choose one of the extreme options, either maximizing their benefits or accepting no benefits at all. Eschewing all benefits is clearly the most popular response.            "
"57","Table 5 examines what predicts responses to the WTA measure. Because each response option has its own symbolic meaning, I estimate relationships by ordered probit. Parallel to Table 3, I estimate three models: one examining subjective perceptions alone, one including an objective measure of personal relevance (income), and one that accounts for partisanship and frequency of church attendance.            "
"58","The pattern of results follows that seen in previous studies. Extremity and Moral Conviction exhibit the largest relationships with compromise, though statistical significance for the latter is more tentative than in the earlier studies. (The p‐values for Moral Conviction in each of the three models are p < .08, .07, and .05, respectively.)15 As in the other studies, the relationships for Importance and Relevance are smaller and attributable to chance.            "
"59","The table also includes a secondary (not planned ex ante) analysis worthy of note: I analyze subjects who favored and opposed Social Security cuts separately. This exploratory analysis was undertaken for two reasons. First, eschewing monetary benefits might require particularly high levels of moral conviction, and far more Social Security proponents (36%) are at the highest level than Social Security opponents (11%). Second, the PCCC is a less prominent and recognizable group than the Tea Party, so Social Security opponents might have weaker mental associations between the group mentioned in the trade‐off dilemma and their Social Security attitudes. The subgroup analysis finds that, among the 933 Social Security proponents, the relationship for Moral Conviction is about twice as large as Extremity, and it is statistically significant (p < .01). Among the much smaller set of respondents who favor cuts, the same coefficient is not significant, though the range of plausible values for the Moral Conviction coefficient in this subsample (95% CI [−0.72, 1.02]) makes it difficult to know whether the disjuncture is real.            "
"60","In sum, Study 3 finds that moral conviction continues to be an important complement to attitude extremity, even when concrete material benefits are at stake. Similar to the other studies, personal importance and relevance play a less clear role. Although rejecting money is not tantamount to opposing compromise per se, one can see how attitudes that resist processing through a cost/benefit framework present a real challenge to the way pluralistic government is hoped to resolve conflicts."
"61","It has been argued that political compromise is hard because so many pressures of winning and holding office collide with the imperative to govern (Gutmann and Thompson 2012). This article lends credence to the idea that electoral pressures work against compromise while showing that the resistance does not arise from extreme attitudes alone. There is no obvious account of when citizens reject proposals from which they could benefit, or when they prefer, in Morris Fiorina's phrasing, to “lose with their candidate than win with a moderate” (quoted in Roberts 2013). I find evidence consistent with the idea that these patterns have a basis in people's moral psychology, which has the potential to baffle cost/benefit calculus and render concession unthinkable. At the same time, I find that attitudes can be intense in ways that nonetheless permit concessions and trade‐offs. (Witness the results for Relevance and, with one exception in Study 1, Importance.)         "
"62","The findings herein come with some limitations. First, they are observational: Aspects of attitude intensity are measured, not manipulated. This leaves the results open to familiar concerns about confounds.16 Future work should employ experimental approaches to manipulate aspects of attitude intensity17 or to examine how attitude intensity moderates treatment effects. Second, the studies herein look separately at dilemmas where the costs of resisting compromise are imminent and concrete (Study 3), versus implied and abstract (Studies 1 and 2). Since the two kinds of scenarios are examined in isolation, one might wonder just how much the specter of a bad outcome can attenuate resistance to compromise. Future work could examine this relationship directly by manipulating the costs associated with opposing compromise. Third, Study 1 presents hypothetical compromises that roughly split the difference between opposing camps. Future work should examine more incremental compromise—perhaps entertaining the hypothesis that extreme attitudes predict resistance to compromises that simply give up too much, whereas morally convicted attitudes predict categorical opposition to all compromise.18"
"63","Beyond these particular limitations, a broader challenge is to attach the findings herein to dynamic conceptions of politics. What causes variation in whether citizens view a political opinion as a matter of right and wrong? Are moral convictions more likely to develop for some issues than others? Do some interest groups have an intrinsic advantage because an issue exhibits one‐sided moralization (cf. Marietta 2012)? Are there conditions under which moral conviction weighs more or less heavily on judgments? Here, I briefly discuss evidence that bears on these questions, and what should be done to make progress.         "
"64","Scholars have investigated what causes moral intuitions to arise and vary in several ways, but the findings are not unified. The research can be sorted under two umbrellas. First, some investigators have entertained the idea that dispositions—both genetic in origin and socialized—make individuals more and less sensitive to certain moral considerations. In this vein, Graham, Haidt, and Nosek (2009) argue that individuals vary with respect to how sensitive they are to six moral considerations (“foundations”). Other scholars point to individual‐level variation in values (Jacoby 2014), mental metaphors (Lakoff 1996), mating strategies (Kurzban, Dukes, and Weeden 2011), intellectual development (Kohlberg, Levine, and Hewer 1983), and more. The research into morally relevant dispositions might help localize the roots of morally charged politics—for instance, if high levels of Graham and Haidt's liberty foundation induced some citizens to adopt rigid, uncompromising issue stances as concerns progressive taxation—though more work should focus squarely on reconciling the many different approaches.         "
"65","Quite apart from dispositions, other research illustrates situational factors that affect whether moral intuitions influence behavior. There are long‐term situational factors: Communities differ with respect to which of four mental frameworks they employ to coordinate social interactions (Rai and Fiske 2011). Other work points to short‐term situational factors, such as incidental disgust (Schnall et al. 2008), the use of absolutist rhetoric (Marietta 2012), affirming a person's moral integrity (Sherman and Cohen 2006), or the priming of specific moral considerations (Clifford and Jerit 2013). One strand of research finds that moralized processing is increased when individuals' evaluative focus is shifted to rules, but decreased when it is shifted to consequences (Bartels 2008, Study 1; Van Bavel et al. 2012). This finding might have particular relevance to politics, since for most issues, political rhetoric can emphasize either consideration (cf. Kreps and Monin 2014; Ryan 2015).         "
"66","There is thus much work to do. The work herein, however, leverages an insight that works in favor of consilience. Following perspectives in philosophy (Moore 1903) and psychology (e.g., Skitka 2010), it takes a crucial distinction—moral or not—as a conceptual primitive, with possible connections to values, socialization, group memberships, and the like as hypotheses to be tested. Adopting such an agnostic perspective can illustrate previously unappreciated texture in terms of which attitudes are moralized, versus which are merely extreme. Adhering to a bottom‐up approach to identifying antecedents to moral conviction allows researchers to be surprised about the origins of moralization in a way they previously could not.         "
"67","To close, it is worth a moment to reflect on the functionality of moral intuitions. Scholars focused on the origins of moral thinking suggest that it is the glue that makes human social life possible (e.g., Smith 2003; Wright 1994). Moral intuitions can evoke altruism and make humans sensitive to fairness considerations. Morality sets clear expectations for how others will behave, and thereby makes it possible for humans to coordinate and cooperate in ways that other species cannot (cf. Tomasello et al. 2005, 685). As Haidt and Kesebir put it (2010, 808), “Moral thinking is for social doing.” In this perspective, moral intuitions might increase the likelihood of compromise, since compromise is crucial to social cooperation. That the evidence suggests quite the opposite highlights the importance of attention to how the psychology scales and interacts with political institutions. Moral intuitions are believed to have evolved in small, homogeneous groups, where potential rules could be subject to negotiation and debate, and where they would constitute public knowledge (DeScioli and Kurzban 2013, 485). Shifting focus from small groups to whole societies, some moral rules that seemed universal (to their beholders) are exposed as provincial (cf. Greene 2013). When these differing views clash, they are a potent force undergirding political intransigence.         "
"68","Is compromise good? Not necessarily. Not always. The argument for compromise rests on its instrumental, not its moral, value. Compromises can be bad or good, and we need not stipulate which ones are which to see that if a political order systematically resists compromise, if its leaders insist that only one outcome can be consistent with ideals, and if every disagreement amounts to an impasse, it is sure to incubate bitterness and resentment. It is part of wisdom to recognize that pluralistic society asks its citizens to put certain political values—tolerance, mutual respect, stability—before commitment to any more provincial view. In this, one finds new prescience in James Q. Wilson's (1967, 45) fear for “the time when politics is seized with the issue [of morality]. Our system of government cannot handle matters of that sort (can any democratic system?) and it may be torn apart by the effort.”         "
