"1","In Section 1 of the “Memorial and Remonstrance,” Madison makes clear that his argument against Patrick Henry's 1784 “Bill for Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion” is rooted in the idea that Virginia could not levy a tax for the support of any religion because government can have no power over the religious conscience of any citizen. According to Madison, every person has a natural right to his conscience that is “unalienable”—it cannot be taken away or given up by him when he “becomes a member of any particular civil society” (“Memorial and Remonstrance,” sec. 1, 30). Because the individual retains power over his conscience, religion is necessarily “exempt from the authority of the Society at large” (sec. 2, 30). As government can receive its powers only from “Society” (“the people”), it cannot have any power that society itself lacks. So government necessarily lacks power to interfere with the rights of religious conscience. According to Madison, one consequence is that government has no power to see or know the religious beliefs or practices of its citizens: “Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance” (sec. 1, 30). As Madison later declared, “[t]he immunity of Religion from civil jurisdiction has always been a favorite principle with me” (to Edward Livingston, July 10, 1822, 787–88).            "
"2","Although “a favorite principle,” noncognizance was not Madison's most fundamental principle; instead, it is the application of the principle of “no agency” to the question of whether government has the power to establish religion—that is, to form or proclaim official religious opinions or to try to cause citizens to form, profess, or practice religious opinions. The principles of noncognizance and “no agency” are complementary in the sense that noncognizance flows from “no agency,” but “no agency” is more fundamental because it is the principle most directly derived from the rights of conscience. To understand why, we must start where interpreters such as McConnell and Muñoz have—with Madison's social contract theory in Section 1 of the “Memorial and Remonstrance.” Specifically, we need to understand exactly what Madison believed is not alienated in the social compact. What are the “rights of conscience” that remain with the individual even after “the institution of Civil society” (sec. 1, 30)? In Section 1 of the “Memorial,” Madison quotes the Virginia Declaration of Rights in saying that religion is “the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it,” which “can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence” (sec. 1, 30). Religious freedom, therefore, means the right to form religious opinions and to act on them for religious purposes within the limits inherent in the rights of conscience itself. But what is our conscience?            "
"3","Madison does not address that question in the “Memorial,” but he does outline an answer in a 1792 essay entitled “Property.”5 This essay suggests that the conscience is what is produced when the mind labors on the question of “the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it” (“Memorial and Remonstrance,” sec. 1, 30). Conscience is, in other words, our “religious opinions” (“Property,” March 29, 1792, 515).6 The mind consults the conscience (i.e., its religious opinions) in order to understand what “profession and practice” is “dictated by them” (“Property,” March 29, 1792, 515). In this respect, conscience “dictates” our religious practices (“Amendment to the Virginia Declaration of Rights,” June 1776, 10). Religious conscience is thus both our opinions about the existence and nature of God and the mind's active employment of those opinions in “discharging” them. The “right of conscience,” therefore, is the “freedom of the mind” to form religious opinions and to act on those opinions for religious purposes (“Detached Memoranda,” 760). When the individual keeps his “religious agency” in the social compact, he retains the power to form and act on religious opinions, subject to limitations that are part of every natural right. This is what government lacks, according to Madison: it has no power to form or act on religious opinions as a government, nor to attempt to cause or prohibit citizens from forming or acting on religious opinions for religious purposes, unless those practices threaten the right of others or the “permanent and aggregate interests of the community” (The Federalist #10, 161). Government has no “religious agency”: it is “no part of the trust delegated to political rulers” (“Detached Memoranda,” 764).            "
"4","We see the principle of “no agency” at work in Madison's reflections on issues of religious establishment that faced the early Republic. For example, he opposed the “law appointing Chaplains” for Congress because it “establishes a religious worship for the national representatives, to be performed by Ministers of religion, elected by a majority of them; and these are to be paid out of the national taxes” (“Detached Memoranda,” 762). Government selection and support of chaplains involves “the principle of a national establishment” not simply because government is cognizing religion but because in its cognizing, government is conducting “religious worship” and thereby asserting the power to be a causal agent of religious practice (“Detached Memoranda,” 762–63). This is the general problem with government cognizance of religion: such cognizance is the necessary first step in trying to cause citizens to form or act on religious opinions. In order to try to affect (or effect) religion, one must first have the power to cognize or see religion. Under almost all circumstances, therefore, attempting to cognize religion implies the power to try to cause it, a power that always rightly remains with the individual. So instead of government creating and paying for chaplains, “public functionaries” should “discharge their religious duties … at their own expense” by making a “small … contribution” with other members to support a minister who would lead them in “voluntary” worship (“Detached Memoranda,” 763; emphasis added). It would thus be the members of Congress “[i]n their individual capacities” who are causing the religious worship to take place (“Detached Memoranda,” 764). This solution, Madison asserts, would be fully in accord with “genius of the Constitution; and the divine right of conscience” because it would respect the principle that “Religion consist[s] in voluntary acts of individuals, singly, or voluntarily associated” (“Detached Memoranda,” 763; emphases added). Madison held that the same is true for chaplains in the army or navy. Soldiers or sailors should provide and pay for their own ministers—or conduct their own religious services—so that there would be “religious instruction & exhortation from a voluntary source” (“Detached Memoranda,” 764). This might make it more difficult for “insulated crews” on a long sea voyage to engage in religious worship, “[b]ut we are always to keep in the mind that it is safer to trust the consequences of a right principle, than reasonings in support of a bad one” (“Detached Memoranda,” 764).            "
"5","Madison believed that the same principle of “no agency” applies to “[r]eligious proclamations by the Executive recommending thanksgivings & fasts,” which “are shoots from the same root” as government chaplains because “[a]ltho’ recommendations only, they imply a religious agency, making no part of the trust delegated to political rulers” (“Detached Memoranda,” 764). Madison did offer such proclamations, but, as Muñoz notes, Madison “never takes personal responsibility for initiating the proclamations,” which he issued only because “he thought ‘it was not proper to refuse compliance [with Congress] all together’” (2009, 42–43). This was especially true in a delicate wartime situation when he could not afford to antagonize Congress. Once “[r]emoved from the exigencies of war … Madison forthrightly revealed that his true position was that religious proclamations by the president violated the Constitution” (43)."
"6","It would be easy to conclude that Madison rejected official religious proclamations because his fundamental principle was noncognizance, but the wording of his proclamations suggests that “no agency” was his deepest principle. Madison knew that even issuing official proclamations about religion violates the idea of noncognizance, but he still took care to phrase his proclamations in such a way as to make it clear that their purpose was merely “to recommend … a day on which all may have an opportunity of voluntarily offering at the same time in their respective religious assemblies their humble adoration to the Great Sovereign of the Universe, of confessing their sins and transgressions, and of strengthening their vows of repentance and amendment” (Presidential Proclamation, November 16, 1814; emphases added). “I was always careful,” he pointed out, “to make the Proclamations absolutely indiscriminate, and merely recommendatory; or rather mere designations of a day on which all who thought proper might unite in consecrating it to religious purposes, according to their own faith & forms” (to Edward Livingston, July 10, 1822, 788; emphasis added). Madison used “designatory” rather than advisory language because in his view, advice is a kind of influence, and influence is a form of agency. This is especially true when a government gives “advice” because government is defined by the fact that it holds legislative, executive, and judicial power—all powers designed to “make people do their duty” (“Speech in the Virginia Ratifying Convention,” June 16, 1788, 389). “An advisory Govt,” Madison declared, “is a contradiction in terms” (“Detached Memoranda,” 764; emphasis original). Thus, governments cannot advise “those subject to their authority” on religious matters without implying that government as such has the power to cause some “effect” in the religious consciences of citizens (“Detached Memoranda,” 764). Hence “a form & language were employed, which were meant to deaden as much as possible any claim of political right to enjoin religious observances by resting these expressly on the voluntary compliance of individuals, and even by limiting the recommending to such as wished simultaneous as well as voluntary performance of a religious act on the occasion (“Detached Memoranda,” 766; emphases added). Under the political necessity to issue proclamations, Madison chose his words as carefully as possible to try to adhere to the principle that government has no power to try to cause citizens to form or practice religious opinions, even if only by recommending that they practice their own.            "
"7","While Madison believed that “no agency” in principle demands noncognizance in all matters of religious establishment, he realized that “no agency” may require a different approach in matters of free exercise of religion. While as a general rule government cannot take cognizance of religion, it can cognize religious belief if necessary to protect the rights of conscience. This situation confronted Madison directly in 1790, when he was a member of the House of Representatives considering a bill to establish a uniform federal militia. In December 1790, Quakers petitioned Congress to exempt them from federal militia duty on the ground that the bill “if enacted into a law, will materially affect us, and our fellow members in general, in the free exercise of conscience.”7 The Quakers’“Memorial” arrived as the House was taking up the question of whether federal law should exempt certain classes of people from militia duty (e.g., students, teachers, seamen, members of Congress). The House then turned to debate whether “conscientious” objectors should be exempt from federal militia service or whether the matter should be left to the states. Some members resisted a federal exemption on federalism grounds and some on grounds of civic duty. Representative William Giles of Virginia, for example, opposed exemptions for Quakers because “protection and personal services result from society; they are due from every individual, and it is a violation of moral duty to withhold this personal service” (Annals of Congress, December 22, 1790, 1872). So Giles proposed that the Quakers do their duty by at least contributing part of their property to the country's defense through payment of an “equivalent,” since it was not against their conscience “to hold and possess property” (Annals of Congress, December 21, 1790, 1872). This prompted Representative James Jackson of Georgia, an even more determined opponent of any exemption, to demand: “Who are to know … what persons were really conscientiously scrupulous? There is no tribunal erected to make them swear to their scruples. If the principle were adopted … very few would be found, if their word was to be taken, not conscientiously scrupulous” (Annals of Congress, December 21, 1790, 1865).            "
"8","On December 22, in the midst of this controversial debate, Madison weighed in with a proposal that there should be a federal exemption for those “conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms” (Annals of Congress, December 22, 1790, 1872). Madison did not propose the Quaker exemption out of a general tendency to support all exemptions. He opposed an exemption for members of Congress on the ground that “the Governors and the governed should feel their mutual relation to each other; on this principle, he thought that no exemption should be allowed, except in cases where an attendance on militia duty was incompatible with the performance of other duties; for these reasons, he wished that the whole clause should be struck out; in cases of difficulty a court‐martial would be competent to doing justice to the parties” (Annals of Congress, December 16, 1790, 1857). But he offered the statutory exemption for conscientious objectors because “[t]he Quakers merit some attention on this delicate point, liberty of conscience” (Annals of Congress, December 22, 1790, 1871). In response, Rep. Jackson repeated his argument of the day before that many people who were not really Quakers might suddenly claim a duty of conscience in not bearing arms. The argument met with some support, and on December 23, Madison changed his amendment to exempt those “religiously scrupulous of bearing arms,” the same wording he had used a year and a half earlier in what became the Second Amendment (Annals of Congress, December 23, 1790, 1874; emphasis added). This change of wording narrowed the issue from a matter of personal moral qualms to one of religious doctrine held by well‐known sects. As one supporter of the exemption (Representative John Vining of Delaware) said: “Quakers … are easily distinguished; everybody knows them” (Annals of Congress, December 22, 1790, 1873). So while Madison started with language that would not violate noncognizance (“conscientiously scrupulous”), he was willing to alter the wording to take cognizance of religious belief if it was necessary to get Congress to grant the Quakers’ request. In response to critics like Rep. Jackson who wondered how anyone could tell who was religiously scrupulous about serving in the militia, Madison further added in his amendment that individuals claiming to be “religiously scrupulous … shall make a declaration of the same before a civil magistrate” and pay an unspecified “penalty” (Annals of Congress, December 23, 1790, 1874). He was willing to make legal and civil cognizance of religious belief an essential part of the law, which directly denies the conclusion that “all forms of religiously based exemptions would fail the Madisonian doctrine” (Muñoz 2009, 185).8"
"9","Political necessity cannot explain why Madison proposed this amendment to the militia law. It was not required for securing support for the Constitution in the states because Congress had already sent out the amendments to the states after the Senate had insisted on deleting the same exemption language from what became the Second Amendment. Nor is there any evidence that Madison believed that the exemptionless amendments needed to be rescued politically by passing a statutory exemption. By December 1790, the 10 amendments that became the Bill of Rights had been ratified by nine states—including North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Maryland—each of which had called for an exemption either in the resolutions of their state ratifying conventions or in their minority reports. Moreover, the failure of the federal statutory exemption did not stop Madison's home state of Virginia from becoming the necessary 11th state to ratify the Bill of Rights in December 1791.            "
"10","Nor was an exemption for Quakers necessary for getting the militia bill through the House of Representatives in 1790–91. In fact, the exemption was highly controversial: Rep. Jackson claimed, for example, that it would divide the country into “two tribes of people” (Annals of Congress, December 22, 1790, 1869). Ultimately, it was defeated in favor of leaving the matter to “the respective States” (Annals of Congress, December 24, 1790, 1875). This means that Madison took the lead in proposing a law that violated noncognizance not out of political necessity but because he thought it was on principle “a question of great magnitude, which I am desirous of having determined” (“Speech in Congress,” December 22, 1790, 479). In Madison's view, it was important for Congress to establish the precedent that the right to free exercise necessarily entails an exemption for religious objectors who had well‐known views and had made a direct request to Congress for an exemption. In that situation, Congress must provide one or the federal government would knowingly be attempting to force the Quakers to act contrary to their religious opinions, which held that “all revenge, animosity, strife, and contention are utterly forbidden by Christ our Lord” (“Address and Memorial of the People called Quakers to Congress,” December 18, 1790). The federal government would be trying to cause them to act against their consciences, which would be an illegitimate assumption of “religious agency.” In such very important situations, the Madisonian understanding of religious liberty requires religious exemptions.9"
"11","Madison's support of the Quaker exemption does not mean, however, that he believed that liberal democratic government must accommodate any and all religious practices. He was not proexemption in every free‐exercise situation. For example, while he supported a militia exemption for Quakers in 1789 and 1790, he denounced Patrick Henry's bill for exempting “Quakers and Mennonists” from the proposed religious assessment in Virginia (“Memorial and Remonstrance,” sec. 4, 31). This is not because, as Hamburger suggests, Madison may have softened his views on exemptions from 1785 to 1789 based on the arguments of dissenters like the Quakers (Hamburger 2002, 106–7). Rather, the two exemptions were based on very different principles. In the “Memorial,” Madison argues that Henry's “Bill violates the equality which ought to be the basis of every law,” not simply because it treats people differently on the basis of their religion, but because it suggests that “the Quakers and Mennonists” are the only sects whose “piety alone [can] be entrusted with the care of public worship” (“Memorial and Remonstrance,” sec. 4, 31–32). In addition, the exemption would endow them “above all others with extraordinary privileges by which proselytes may be enticed from all others” (“Memorial and Remonstrance,” sec. 4, 32). In other words, the Quaker exemption in Henry's bill implied that Virginia had the power of religious agency—both by having the authority to pass laws that entice “proselytes” to a particular religious denomination and by assuming power over the consciences of those in nonexempt denominations, whose “piety alone” could not be “entrusted with the care of public worship” and thus needed government to cause them to support their own church (“Memorial and Remonstrance,” sec. 4, 31–32). In contrast, the 1789–90 exemptions were designed to prevent the federal government from assuming a power of agency over the religious consciences of the Quakers. Thus, to Madison there was no contradiction between his different stances on exemption in the two situations: he supported legal exemptions when the principle of “no agency” required them and opposed them when they violated it.            "
"12","In addition, Madison believed that calling the right of conscience “inalienable” does not mean that government has no power to regulate or limit its “free exercise.” An individual's rightful power of agency over his conscience contains within itself certain important limitations. Religious agency is not simply a fact or natural power of individuals; it is their natural right, which means both that its legitimate exercise cannot be interfered with and also that individuals have no authority to exercise their power in an unjust way. Madison therefore believed that it does not violate the principle of “no agency” for government to refuse to exempt religious actions that are factious—i.e., actions that harm “the rights of other citizens” or “the permanent and aggregate interests of the community” (The Federalist #10, paragraph 2, 161). As he said, the rights of conscience, like all natural rights, do not include the right to “trespass on private rights or the public peace” (to Edward Livingston, July 10, 1822, 788). He regarded this principle as completely consistent with his insistence in the “Memorial” that a person's religious “duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society” (sec. 1, 30). In his view, the moral primacy of conscience does not require government to accommodate every claim of conscience because the natural rights of individuals and the permanent and aggregate interests of the community are derived from “reason” (“Detached Memoranda,” 765), and the principles of justice derived from reason always have the authority to limit religious practices if the two are in conflict.            "
"13","Madison gave moral priority to reason over conflicting claims of revelation because of his debt to the epistemological arguments of John Locke, which Madison studied deeply as a young man and regarded as authoritative.10 According to Locke ([1690] 1975), God can reveal ideas to a person's mind that are consistent with the conclusions of reason or “above reason,” but He cannot (and would not) reveal commands that require human beings to act “contrary to reason” (An Essay Concerning Human Understanding[ECHU], Bk. IV, Ch. XVIII, sec. 11, 696). This is because reason necessarily sets the framework within which religious faith operates. According to Locke, innate ideas do not exist, so human beings acquire ideas (including moral ideas) through sensation and reflection. Reason is “the discovery of the Certainty or Probability of such Propositions or Truths, which the Mind arrives at by Deductions made from such Ideas, which it has got by the use of its natural Faculties, viz. by Sensation or Reflection” (ECHU, Bk. IV, Ch. XVIII, sec. 2, 689; emphasis original). “Faith, on the other side, is the Assent to any Proposition, not thus made out by the Deductions of Reason; but upon the Credit of the Proposer, as coming from God, in some extraordinary way of Communication, [which] we call Revelation” (ECHU, Bk. IV, Ch. XVIII, sec. 2, 689; emphasis original). This means that as a rule, religious faith assumes the ideas supplied by reason. Now of course “we cannot set any Bounds” to the simple ideas that an omnipotent God could give to an individual by “original revelation,” but “no Man inspired by God, can by any Revelation communicate to others any new simple ideas which they had not before from Sensation or Reflexion” (ECHU, Bk. IV, ch. XVIII, sec. 3, 689; emphasis original). The listener would not have the new simple idea received by the prophet, so when the prophet told him the new idea that he had supposedly received from God, the listener could not be bound to believe the revelation or carry it out. He would either have to receive the same direct revelation himself or be allowed to subject it to proofs. Indeed, the prophet himself could not legitimately believe that he had received an idea from God if the idea clearly contradicted one derived from sensation and reflection. As Locke says, “no Proposition can be received for Divine Revelation, or obtain the Assent due to all such, if it be contradictory to our clear intuitive knowledge” derived from reason and sensation (ECHU, Bk. IV, Ch. XVIII, sec. 3, 5; emphasis original). “In all Things, therefore, where we have clear Evidence from our Ideas, and those Principles of Knowledge … Reason is the proper judge; and Revelation, though … it may confirm its Dictates, cannot in such Cases, invalidate its Decrees” (ECHU, Bk. IV, Ch. XVIII, sec. 6, 693–94; emphasis original). This means that “nothing … can, under that Title [of revelation], shake or over‐rule plain Knowledge; or rationally prevail with any Man, to admit it for true, in a direct contradiction to the clear Evidence of his own Understanding” (ECHU, Bk. IV, Ch. XVIII, sec. 5, 691).            "
"14","Applied to questions of morality, Locke's argument means that God does not reveal to a person an idea contrary to the ideas of justice produced by reason. If God is God, then “reason” tells us that He is just, “unless we confound good and evil, God and Satan,” which “very ill suits the Notion of a Deity” ([1693] 1965, The Reasonableness of Christianity[RC], sec. 6, 5; [1690] 2010, A Letter Concerning Toleration[LCT], 15). It would therefore “be hard” for an individual to believe that God would give him a revelation that requires him (or others) to do something that contradicts “the notion we have of justice” (RC, sec. 6, 5). If it clearly violates what reason demonstrates to be just, such a “revelation” could not come from God, who is just. It could legitimately be dismissed as not a “Revelation from God” but a fit of “enthusiasm,” which Locke describes as the “Conceits of a warmed or over‐wheening Brain” that believes or pretends that it has received a revelation from God when in fact it is nothing more than “the ungrounded Fancies of a Man's own Brain” (ECHU, Bk. IV, Ch. XIX, secs. 7 & 3, 699, 698; emphasis original).            "
"15","Madison seems to have embraced this Lockean idea of enthusiasm and its political consequences, at least in setting limits to religious practices. He refers, for example, to the “extravagances” and “excessive excitement” that religion “may run into,” which recede as “reason will gradually regain its ascendancy” (to Jaspar Adams, September 1833 in Sacred Rights, 613). And like Locke, he concludes that government does not violate the rights of conscience when it forbids a person from acting on a “revelation” contrary to “the rights of other citizens” or “the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” The rights of conscience do not include such a right. It is therefore not usurping a person's rightful power of “religious agency” to prohibit him from religious practices that violate principles of justice established by reason.            "
"16","Yet on the question of whether government can punish the holding or professing of any religious opinions, Madison parted ways with Locke by distinguishing between a limited right to religious practices and an unlimited right to form and communicate religious ideas. Locke argues that while “Speculative” religious opinion is beyond the power of government, the magistrate can punish people for holding or professing “Practical” religious opinions that require or imply actions against the “Life or Estate” of other people, or that are, more broadly, “contrary to human society, or to those moral Rules which are necessary to the preservation of Civil Society” (LCT, 44, 50–51). Madison denied the magistrate such power, arguing instead that the “true standard” of religious liberty is Thomas Jefferson's Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom (1984, “Detached Memoranda,” 759), which explicitly declares that “to suffer the magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles, on the supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty … [I]t is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order” (in Sacred Rights, 250).            "
"17","Madison believed in protecting all religious belief and profession because of both principle and prudence. In his view, religious opinions are formed by the “labor” of the mind, which a person owns; thus, “a man has a property in his opinions,” including “a property of peculiar value in his religious opinions” (“Property,” March 29, 1792, 517, 515). So religious opinions on principle deserve protection like any other part of a person's property—indeed, even more so because “Conscience is the most sacred of all property; other property depending in part on positive law, the exercise of that, being a natural and unalienable right” (“Property,” March 29, 1792, 516). Protecting citizens’ property in their conscience includes “an equal, and in the estimation of some, a more valuable property” in the “enjoyment and communication of their opinions” (“Property,” March 29, 1792, 516). This is because one of the rights of individuals is the “free use of their faculties,” and one of the uses of the faculty of the mind is the “communication” of ideas to others (“Property,” March 29, 1792, 516; see also The Federalist #10, paragraph 6, 161). Thus, protection of an individual's “religious agency” includes protecting both his formation of religious ideas and his “profession” of them (“Property,” March 29, 1792, 515).            "
"18","But if government can limit the exercise of a person's conscience by restricting harmful religious practices, why can government not also limit the profession of harmful religious opinions? Madison did not explicitly deny that a person or group might be persuaded to adopt religious opinions that could entail harmful religious practices. But he seemed to believe that prudence dictates that the fundamental right to communicate one's religious opinions should not be restricted by the magistrate “on the supposition of their ill tendency.” This “is a dangerous fallacy … because he being of course the judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own” (“Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom” in Sacred Rights, 250). Even if the magistrate would be unexpectedly impartial and ban only the profession of religious opinions that are demonstrably illiberal, it is too dangerous to give government the power to punish citizens for professing them. Considering “all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity, over error and oppression” through the free communication of ideas (“Report on the Alien and Sedition Acts,” January 7, 1800, 647), the only safe standard is that citizens are able to exercise their religion “unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate, [u]nless the preservation of equal liberty and the existence of the State are manifestly endangered” by their religious practices (“Amendment to the Virginia Declaration of Rights,” June 1776, 10).            "
"19","Madison understood that the principle of “no agency” does not remove all difficult judgments about the extent to which a liberal democratic government must accommodate the free exercise of religion. The right to form religious opinions is absolute and the right to communicate them cannot safely be restricted. But what about the right to practice them? How can citizens and lawmakers decide, for example, if government has the power to ban wearing religious symbols in public schools or if people have a right to practice polygamy as part of their religion?"
"20","While it may not usually be too vexing to determine when someone's religious practice violates the life, liberty, or property of other citizens, it is a matter of careful prudential judgment to know when granting an exemption for religious practices would harm the “permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” On the one hand, there is a burden on a person or group to request an exemption from the relevant legislative (or executive) authority, as the Quakers did in their petition to Congress. On the other hand, there is a burden on the legislative body to remember that while reason gives government the authority to set the political limits on religious practices, government cannot ban a practice simply because it is irrational—it must violate the principles of justice that govern a liberal, republican society."
"21","With these preliminary ideas in mind, we can see that Madison's arguments for the Quaker exemption provide three basic criteria for deciding when granting an exemption for religious practices would harm the “permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” First, citizens and lawmakers should consider requests for exemptions in light of the importance of the nation's interest under consideration. This can be determined by the connection of the asserted interest to the fundamental purpose of the political community—that is, to securing the citizens’ natural rights and those rights “resulting from the social compact” that are “as essential to secure the liberty of the people as any one of the pre‐existent rights of nature” (“Speech in Congress,” June 8, 1789, 445–46). In Madison's view, the Quaker exemption was no threat to the rights of others because the Quakers had proven “by their uniform conduct of moderation” that they were not factious—they knew the “value” of religious freedom and “generously extended it to all men” (“Speech in Congress,” December 22, 1790, 479). As a rule, the farther away that a religious practice is from touching on anyone's life, liberty, or property, the more likely the exemption should be granted."
"22","Second, Madison's argument for the Quaker exemption suggests that lawmakers and citizens need to examine how much harm is done to the nation's interest by exempting certain citizens from the law based on their religious opinions—or at least whether granting an exemption would increase the harm caused by the religious practice. Again, in Madison's view the Quaker exemption passed the test. He always acknowledged that the nation had a vital interest in a well‐functioning federal militia for the “general protection” of the country; indeed, “an Armed and trained militia is the firmest bulwark of Republics” (“Speech in the Virginia Ratifying Convention on the Militia,” June 14, 1788, 385–86; “First Inaugural Address,” March 4, 1809, 682). But he did not believe that exempting religious objectors would “lay the axe to the root of the militia,” as Rep. Jackson claimed (Annals of Congress, December 21, 1790, 1865). The Quakers’ failure to serve would reduce the number of citizens available for militia duty, but trying to force religious objectors into the militia would not solve the manpower problem because they simply could not be made to fight: “By penalties we may oppress them, but by no means hitherto discovered, can you make them undertake the defence of this nation” (“Speech in Congress,” December 22, 1790, 480). As Roger Sherman of Connecticut said in seconding Madison's amendment: “persons conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms could not be compelled to do it; for such persons will rather suffer death than commit moral evil” (Annals of Congress, December 22, 1790, 1872). If the number of Quakers were very large or the country were in imminent danger, perhaps their refusal to serve would threaten the nation's security interest in a federal militia. But, in Madison's view, that simply was not the case in 1790–91. If, however, permitting a religious practice might threaten to undermine the power of government to protect the rights of citizens or otherwise exercise its legitimate powers (e.g., through military organization or law enforcement), government need not grant such an exemption.            "
"23","Finally, lawmakers and citizens should consider whether granting the exemption would constitute an attempt to influence people to adopt or practice a certain religious opinion—if so, the exemption would be an illegitimate assumption of “religious agency.” In the case of the Quakers, Madison argued to Rep. Jackson that Americans would not suddenly swear in front of a civil magistrate that they were religious pacifists simply to avoid militia duty (as Madison's proposal required): “I am persuaded, the gentleman indulged his imagination more than his judgment, when he predicted this effect. He cannot consult his own heart, nor the disposition of his fellow citizens, nor human nature itself, when he supposes either himself or the people of America, or of any nation, would apostatize from their God for reasons so inconsiderable. Would any man consent to put on the mask of hypocrisy in order to avoid a duty which is honorable? I cannot believe that one out of a thousand, nay not a single citizen will be found throughout the United States, who will usurp this privilege by hypocritical pretentions” (“Speech in Congress,” December 22, 1790, 479–80). Madison's indignant protest notwithstanding, his argument suggests that government would have to be careful in granting exemptions from large financial burdens or other costly duties that are not so “honorable” as militia service—exemptions from these might tempt others to become (or at least profess to be) a member of the exempted religious group. But that was not a problem in this case, and so the Quakers’ request for an exemption met all three criteria. Madison therefore concluded that Congress should “indulge these men in the exercise of their religious sentiments” (“Speech in Congress,” December 22, 1790, 479).11"
"24","The evidence from Madison's advocacy of a Quaker exemption in 1790 suggests that scholars have misunderstood his fundamental principle of religious liberty and its implications for government's relation to religion. According to Madison, the rights of conscience (i.e., the rightful power to form and act on religious opinions) always remain with the individual, subject to limitations on religious practice inherent in the right of conscience itself. This means that government cannot have any power of “religious agency.” Because cognition of religious opinion or practice is the necessary first step in trying to cause religion, a general power in government to cognize religion must be rejected because it implies the forbidden power to try to cause religion. When dealing with any question of religious establishment, Madison therefore embraced the doctrine of noncognizance and practiced it as much as possible.12"
"25","In matters of the free exercise of religion, however, Madison believed that government does have a limited power to cognize religious opinion in order to accommodate the consciences of its citizens. In the rare situation where a law tries to require a citizen to carry out an action that he believes to be forbidden by his religious conscience, government must accommodate the citizen's request to be exempted from the law, even if the exemption requires direct cognizance of his religious opinions—provided that the exemption is not “adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” If government does not provide an exemption in that situation, it would knowingly be trying to require a citizen to perform an action contrary to his religious conscience, and thus government would be usurping the rightful power of “religious agency” that always remains with the individual. In such a situation, citizens have given government a limited power to cognize religious opinion for the higher purpose of protecting the exercise of conscience."
"26","The same principle applies to exemptions from laws that prohibit rather than require certain behavior. On the one hand, a general legal prohibition on a particular action is not a form of “religious agency” because it is not directed at religious actions as such—i.e., it does not prohibit an action because it is religious. Thus, government need not preemptively grant a general exemption from a law for anyone whose conscience might require him to do an action prohibited by it. On the other hand, once a specific, direct request for a religious exemption is made to government and lawmakers or officials determine that the requested exemption would not cause harm “to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community,” failure to grant an exemption would be a forbidden form of “religious agency” and thus a “usurpation[] on the rights of conscience” (“Detached Memoranda,” 759).13"
"27","Whether in matters of establishment or free exercise, Madison's deepest allegiance was always to the principle of “no agency,” which he derived directly from the nature of the conscience and the rights of conscience. It was this principle that guided his understanding of the character and limits of religious liberty and thus of government's proper relation to religion in a liberal democracy. And it was Madison's consistent adherence to it that explains his embrace of both noncognizance and religious exemptions at different times and in different situations. So in the case of the Quakers in December 1790, he argued to his fellow lawmakers that Congress should grant them an exemption from militia service, no matter how unpopular such an exemption might be. They must not ignore the demands of justice because “above all, it is the particular glory of this country, to have secured the rights of conscience which in other nations are least understood or most strangely violated” (“Speech in Congress,” December 22, 1790, 479). And, Madison believed, as long as the people understand that “religious agency” is “no part of the trust delegated to political rulers,” such glory would always have the chance to endure (“Detached Memoranda,” 764).
