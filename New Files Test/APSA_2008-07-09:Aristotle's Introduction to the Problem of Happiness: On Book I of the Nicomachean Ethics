"1","My thesis implies that Aristotle's manner of writing is unusually complex and subtle. That Aristotle's procedure is at the least marked by peculiarities, including everything from apparently needless repetition and digression to outright self‐contradiction, is clear even from a glance at the text of Book I.2 On three occasions, for example, and at some length, Aristotle reminds us of the necessary limits to the precision to be demanded of the arguments in question (1094b11–27; 1095a30–1095b14; 1098a20–1098b8); he twice sketches the argument that all our actions and choices necessarily aim at some good, going so far as to indicate that he is repeating himself (1097a24 and context; consider also 1098a26 and context, which refers back to 1094b11–25); and in little more than 20 pages, Aristotle offers three explicit digressions that stray apparently quite far from his stated purpose (consider 1095a14, 1095b14, 1097a15, and contexts). He also contradicts himself by stating, in I.4, for example, that it is certain of “the many” (hoi polloi) who hold honor to be the human good we seek, only to maintain, in the next chapter, that it is “the refined” who do so (compare 1095a20–23 with 1095b22–23); he identifies as “strange” or “absurd” the idea that the dead can be happy, but subsequently accepts that very idea and adds to it that nothing can overturn their happiness (compare 1100a11–14 with, e.g., 1101b5–9); and, finally, he both asserts and denies that knowledge (gnōsis) of the good is essential to our lives, a matter of obviously great importance to his argument as a whole (compare 1094a22–24 with 1095a5–6).         "
"2","These peculiarities could perhaps be dismissed as either textual glitches or even inadvertent lapses, were they not traceable to a cause or causes demanding their use—to a cause or causes, that is, justifying the indirect manner of arguing they amount to. The most obvious cause in question is the authority of the political community. Immediately after sketching the necessity of there being some good in which all our strivings culminate and which thereby justifies them—as the bridle produced by the lowly art of bridle‐making is ultimately for the sake of the good of victory in war, under the guidance of the general's art—Aristotle suggests that such a good “might be held” to belong to the “most authoritative and especially architectonic” science or power. And what “appears,” at least, to be such a thing, to make clear to us the good, i.e., “the human good,” is politics (politikē: 1094a18–28): even the general's art is subordinate to the science or power of politics. The political community, one might say, tries to answer with finality the question of the good life for a human being and hence of the best human type. Every community not on the verge of collapse teaches or habituates its members to accept the ordering of goods it holds to and embodies (consider, e.g., 1099b30–32).         "
"3","Aristotle cannot specify “the human good” in question because the conception of it varies widely from community to community, a fact already indicative of a grave difficulty with every community's claim to have identified correctly the good. The most that Aristotle can do, and what he does do ostentatiously, is bow to the supreme authority of politics by repeating and so appearing to accept the premise on which all communities agree: to secure and preserve the good of the nation or city is “nobler and more divine” than to do so for the individual (1094b7–10; consider also 1097b8–11). The political community regards and wishes to have regarded as settled not only the specific character of the good life for its citizens—be it the life of commerce, piety, or martial courage, for example—but also the superiority of the good of the community to that of any private good.         "
"4","In the present context, Aristotle stresses the extraordinary influence exercised by politics on knowledge or science (epistēmē): it is politics that “ordains what sciences there ought to be in the cities and what kinds each [citizen] in turn ought to learn and up to what point … . Because it makes use of the remaining sciences and, further, because it legislates what one ought to do and what to abstain from, its end would encompass those of the others, with the result that this would be the human good” (1094a28–1094b7). And yet, since Aristotle's own inquiry into the human good is a necessary one, he in fact refuses to accept what the community wishes to be a definitive identification of “the human good”; his own inquiry, too, then, is “a sort of political” inquiry (1094b11), which is to say that it is in competition with the comparable efforts of the political community (consider also 1152b1–3). For example, Aristotle will later raise as an open question whether the virtue of the good citizen is ever the same as that of the good human being, and his answer to it—that the two coincide only in the case of one who shares in ruling in the best regime—implies that the virtue of the citizen in every existing regime falls short of human virtue or excellence simply (1130b26–29; Politics 1276b16–1277b32; 1278a40–1278b5 and context). Because of the awesome power of the political community, which he here describes and defers to, Aristotle is compelled to exercise great caution in exploring the question of the human good, a caution that is most in evidence at the beginning of his inquiry.         "
"5","It is not surprising, then, that the first of Aristotle's three accounts of the apparently necessary limits attending his inquiry follows immediately upon his declaration of the political character of that inquiry (1094b11 and following). These limits are largely (though not entirely) self‐imposed,3 which is to say that the subject matter in question admits of much greater clarity than Aristotle here chooses to admit; each of the three accounts follows the raising of a “sensitive” issue and amounts to a retreat from it. In the present context Aristotle discourages his audience from pressing for precise arguments on the grounds that “the noble things and the just things,” which politics inquires into, admit of much dispute and variability such that they are held by some to exist by convention (nomos) alone rather than by nature; indeed, even the good things are strikingly variable: wealth and courage are sometimes good, sometimes ruinous. In the same spirit, Aristotle here states that “the end is not knowledge but action” (1095a5–6), and although this might seem from the context to apply only to the young or immature, he will subsequently state in his own name that “we are conducting an investigation not so that we may know what virtue is, but so that we may become good” (1103b27–28): not knowledge but noble action is our goal, and since the means to inculcate the characteristic needed so to act is habituation rather than teaching (1095b3–6, 1103a14–18), it seems possible that, to be good, we need little or no knowledge in the strict sense (consider also 1105b2–3).         "
"6","These arguments are striking for several reasons. For example, in order to parry any expectation of precision in the present argument, Aristotle here stresses the variability of things noble and just—a quality they share even with the good things—and alludes to the controversy concerning whether what is noble and just—as distinguished from what is good—exists merely by convention. But this very allusion can serve to remind us that the just things, at least, do admit of more precision than the merely conventional may allow: there is according to Aristotle the just by nature (V.7). What is more, Aristotle had indicated, earlier in Book I, the very great importance of knowledge of the good in order to live well: “with a view to our life, then, is not the knowledge of this of great weight, and would we not, like archers possessing a target, be more inclined to hit upon what is needed?” (1094a22–24; consider also 1095a10–11). And when Aristotle turns in I.7 to “repeat,” for the third time, his argument concerning the limits imposed on him by his subject matter, he adds there a wholly new consideration, according to which it is (also) the purpose of the inquiry that dictates the level of precision to be expected, not, or not only, the subject matter: the geometer and carpenter are equally concerned with a right angle, but given their different purposes, only the geometer need avail himself of precise knowledge of it (1098a26–33). In principle, then, such knowledge is possible in mathematics. Are the matters dealt with in Aristotle's political philosophy too susceptible of such knowledge, if only for the equivalent of the “geometer” as distinguished from the “carpenter”?         "
"7","Here the question of the character of Aristotle's primary audience arises, for, as we have just seen, it bears directly on the precision that Aristotle will permit himself in the inquiry. Aristotle makes clear that that audience is made up of those who are no longer immature in character (1094b27–1095a8) because they have been subject to and hence shaped by the habituation needed to effect good rearing (1095b3–6; 1104b11–13). In the second and therefore central of his statements concerning the limits of his inquiry, Aristotle indicates that such people will “listen” to things noble and just, or to political matters in general, “in an adequate manner,” that is, they will accept the goodness of justice and nobility as self‐evident: they accept the “that” without needing the “why” in addition (1095b4–8).4 At the end of Book I, Aristotle indicates that this capacity to listen and obey—to one's father, for example (1103a3)—is rational only in a very loose sense; strictly speaking, it is a function of the irrational part of the soul that is characterized by desire and appetite (1102b28–1103a3). To put the point in more general terms, Aristotle's primary audience is made up of spoudaioi, of “serious” human beings, who as such accept as their starting point or first principle (archē) the supreme goodness of moral virtue and hence noble action. For them it is enough to yield to the habituation they have been subject to from early childhood and so to accept this first principle (1095b2–6; 1098b4; also 1103b23–25). They need not inquire into the path to that principle but instead proceed from it as a given: to paraphrase Aristotle, the first principle or principles of moral action are “known to them,” but not “known simply,” which amounts to saying that they do not strictly speaking know the archai at all (1095a30–1095b4). Moral virtue, to repeat, is the product of habituation and not of teaching; the morally virtuous, as a result, do not know in the strict sense the principles or starting points of moral virtue.         "
"8","In this important respect, then, Aristotle's insistence on the imprecise character of his inquiry is fully justified, for he cannot make precise what is not known, to those by whom it is not known, at least not without at the same time transforming their understanding of their principles and hence of themselves. And this means, in turn, that Aristotle must to some extent defer in his inquiry not only to the power of the political community but also to the consequences of that power, for the community instills in us deeply held opinions about the human good that we cannot rationally explain or defend because we do not know the matters with which they deal."
"9","As this implies, Aristotle differs from his primary audience in at least one respect: he understands, as they do not, both the fact and the cause—the “that” and the “why”—of the limits attending their “knowledge”; he makes precise the necessity dictating a certain imprecision. In fact he goes further. He occasionally indicates in Book I the possibility of proceeding in the manner of a geometer, that is, as an observer (“contemplator”) of the truth (1098a31–32): deference to the authority of others is indeed good, but “altogether best” is he who “himself understands all things” (1095b10–13, quoting Hesiod, Works and Days 293, 295–97). For the right kind of person, at least, “knowing about these things would be of great profit” (1095a10–11). Aristotle's primary audience, whom he encourages in their inclination simply to take some things for granted, is not necessarily his sole audience, and his subsequent analysis of the problem of happiness must be read in the light of this possibility.5"
"10","Aristotle's analysis of the problem of happiness unfolds gradually. He begins, in I.4–5, with a survey of opinions concerning the chief of the goods bound up with action, the good aimed at by politics or the political art: if it is agreed to by most that this good is “happiness,” nonetheless there is a variety of views as to what might constitute it. More precisely, Aristotle speaks of three things, the possession of which could secure or constitute our happiness, namely pleasure, wealth, and honor. To this he adds a list of three possible ways of life whose connection to the three goods indicated is not entirely clear: the life of pleasure (hedonism), the political life, and the contemplative life. As for the life devoted to pleasure, Aristotle is extraordinarily harsh toward it: to live for the sake of pleasure is to live a slavish life suitable only for fatted cattle (1095b14–16). The harshness of this dismissal is indicative not only of the character of his primary audience, for whom hedonism is beneath contempt because it obviously conflicts with what is noble and good (consider again 1095b4–6), but also of the preliminary character of this discussion. For Aristotle will to some extent rehabilitate pleasure even in Book I—it is a necessary accompaniment of the life of one who loves moral virtue (1099a7–21)—and he will subject pleasure, in Books VII and X, to a subtle and lengthy analysis, in the course of which it is not always clear that he denies it pride of place (consider, e.g., 1153b25–26 and context)."
"11","By taking up honor next, Aristotle violates the order in which he had originally listed it but thereby makes it central (compare 1095a23 with 1095b22–1096a4 and context). The change is reasonable. For although honor seems to be the core of the political life, those who are serious about honor in fact want to be honored for their virtue, and in this way Aristotle is first permitted or compelled to discuss virtue, the subject of the great bulk of the Nicomachean Ethics. Most striking here is the firmness with which Aristotle denies that virtue can be the goal of our striving and hence equivalent to happiness: “even it appears to be rather incomplete, for it is held to be possible for one to possess virtue even while asleep or being inactive throughout life, and, in addition to these, to suffer badly and undergo the greatest misfortunes. And nobody would say that a person living in this way is happy, unless he were defending a thesis” (1095b30–1096a2). Although Aristotle now abruptly cuts off the discussion of virtue, he has made it clear enough that the practice of virtue in no way guarantees the happiness of the virtuous. And finally, since Aristotle declines to speak at present about the contemplative or theoretical life, he turns to dismiss the only life remaining, that of money making. He does so briefly but powerfully by arguing that money is always for the sake of something else and hence cannot be the end we seek.         "
"12","By the end of I.4–5, then, Aristotle has brought us to a dead end. All the most popular opinions about happiness, however refined, lead nowhere, and if “the contemplative life” holds the key to happiness, Aristotle refuses to tell us as much. It might well seem, it is true, that he takes at least a step in this direction in the immediately following chapter (I.6), for he there considers at length the view of certain unnamed friends—presumably the Platonists, if perhaps not Plato himself—according to which the (true) good, the idea of the good, is not “in” any one thing but separate from the several good things here and now and responsible for their goodness. In fact, the exploration of this sophisticated view has less to do with the contemplative life than it does with Aristotle's observation, made in I.4, that when “the many” become aware of their own ignorance, they wonder at or admire those who speak over their heads in lofty terms (1095a25–26): having brought his audience face to face with the inadequacy of the common conceptions of happiness, Aristotle puts before them the kind of doctrine which becomes appealing as a result. Awareness of the elusive character of happiness, in other words, renders us susceptible to fantastic doctrines like that of the Platonic ideas, which holds out the promise of our participating in a separate or “transcendent” and eternal world that is as such free of the limits marring this one. To say the least, in his thorough critique of the idea of the good here, Aristotle throws cold water on any hope of this kind. He even adopts, in I.6, the point of view that may be said to be the contrary of the one that probably guides “the many” in their attraction to the idea of the good: Aristotle here maintains that an eternal good would be no more good than a good lasting a day (1096b3–5).         "
"13","Aristotle begins again in I.7. To do so, he explicitly repeats a line of argument seen in I.1–2, according to which all arts aim at some good. But rather than state immediately, as a given or premise, that “happiness” is the greatest good aimed at, Aristotle instead speaks of happiness only at the conclusion of a fairly lengthy, two‐part argument (compare 1095a18 and context with 1097a15–1097b21, especially 1097a34 and 1097b15–16). In other words, the “repetition” of the earlier argument marks an advance over it inasmuch as Aristotle now explores the idea of happiness itself. He does so first by making explicit our guiding hopes or convictions concerning it. “We say” that what is pursued for its own sake is more complete or perfect than what is pursued for the sake of something else, and, following out the logic of this, the most complete or perfect such good “is held” to be happiness above all. Moreover, “we suppose” that happiness is a state of self‐sufficiency, a self‐sufficiency so great that “it by itself renders life choiceworthy and in need of nothing” (1097b14–15, emphasis added). “So happiness appears to be something complete [perfect] and self‐sufficient, it being an end of the actions” (1097b20–21). Aristotle here makes explicit what we are content to leave mostly implicit or unstated but which guides our lives in fact: we suppose that, by acting in certain ways, we can come to possess for ourselves a good that will truly complete us and so render us in need of “nothing” else. “Happiness,” then, appears to be a kind of perfect self‐sufficiency, for oneself and of course one's immediate family (1097b8–11). The expression of this deepest hope or wish is a turning point in Aristotle's argument, and the rest of Book I is a cautious exploration of this hope for happiness so understood.         "
"14","In the immediate sequel, Aristotle further refines the idea of happiness by asking what the “work” proper to a human being must be, the completion of which will presumably be equivalent to happiness. And although the argument that follows culminates in the famous definition that the “work” of a human being is “an activity of soul in accord with virtue,” Aristotle fails to identify precisely either the activity in question (consider 1099a30) or—the character of the virtue being dependent on the nature of the activity—the relevant virtue (consider 1098a17–18). This line of argument, then, is not as revealing as it is sometimes taken to be. What is more, he adds very briefly a demand or qualification that he will wrestle with for the remainder of Book I: a happy life must be also “a complete life. For one swallow does not make a spring, nor does one day. And in this way, one day or a short time does not make one blessed and happy either” (1098a18–20). As becomes clear when he returns to this same criterion (1100a4–9), Aristotle here alludes to the problem of fortune or chance (tuchē). It is true that he had already spoken of chance in his account, in I.5, of the impotence of virtue to secure our happiness in the face of “the greatest misfortunes” (atuchein ta megista); here he seems to have particularly in mind a premature death or the uncertain timing of the mortality attending us—a fact whose introduction prompts him to state his third account of the limits he will adhere to in his inquiry, in the manner of a carpenter (1098a20 and following).         "
"15","I.1–7 is devoted above all to fleshing out our convictions concerning happiness. The idea of happiness is surprisingly hard to pin down, for almost everyone can agree that it is this that we most want (1095a17–20; 1097b22–23), but no one seems able to state precisely what it might consist in. Aristotle's identification of the leading contenders in that respect (pleasure, honor, virtue, money), and his methodical rejection of each in turn (I.4–5), is surely meant to make clear that none of these goods is sufficient by itself to be the good that we conceive of with the mind's eye, however vaguely, and hope to attain. The first five chapters of Book I at once capture the experience of the elusiveness of happiness and begin, at least, to explain it. From I.7, however, it appears that we have taken the meaning of “happiness” too much for granted, and Aristotle there equates happiness with a perfect or complete good that would render our lives self‐sufficient and hence “in need of nothing.” The most promising path to such happiness now appears to be a certain “work” of the soul “in accord with virtue.” In this way Aristotle reintroduces the connection between virtue and happiness, which he had apparently left behind after his blunt statement of the insufficiency of virtue in I.5. That our dedication to virtue will form the core of the rest of Book I is indication enough of the inadequacy of Aristotle's earlier account of virtue. And by introducing our desire for “a complete life,” immediately after he has put virtue back on the table, Aristotle prompts us to consider the possibility that the dedication to virtue has some connection with that desire. In fact, in the next section, Aristotle will confirm this possibility in the strongest terms: the dedication to virtue will be shown to hold out the promise of our attaining precisely “a complete life,” and “a complete life,” in turn, proves to require not only a bulwark against chance but the overcoming of death itself. At all events, the movement of the argument in I.1–7 as a whole suggests that an adequate analysis of happiness must begin from the concern for virtue—and not, for example, from hedonism, an inherently selfish doctrine whose dismissal in I.4–5 Aristotle saw to immediately.         "
"16","Still, as important as the analysis of our hope for happiness and the continuing relevance of virtue surely are, Aristotle declines, as we have seen, to identify the virtuous “activity of soul” peculiar to human beings. What is more, his indication of the obstacles to fulfilling the promise held out by virtuous activity cannot be dismissed or forgotten: the virtuous too may be made wretched by misfortune, and they too are exposed to a premature death. How then can we secure for ourselves, not merely an ephemeral contentedness, but a happiness that is lasting and secure and complete—a happiness, in short, deserving of the name? In the next section, Aristotle will offer a solution to these difficulties."
"17","The next four chapters (I.8–11) clearly form a unit meant to treat the problem of happiness in general and that of chance or misfortune in particular.6 Aristotle first defends his official logos (“happiness is an activity of soul in accord with virtue”) on the grounds that it is sanctioned by a range of august opinions linking happiness with (among other things) some sort of virtue. Moreover, happiness, which is attainable by engaging in “the best activities,” will be best and most pleasant and noblest, and the active life of virtue will not fall short even in point of pleasure, to say nothing of its goodness and nobility (1099a7–21).         "
"18","But none of this deals with the problem of chance, as Aristotle makes perfectly clear (consider 1099a31–1099b8). Accordingly, he turns, in I.9, to consider how happiness may be acquired, including the extreme possibility that it is due finally to chance. Aristotle contends, to the contrary, that happiness is either a god‐given thing or at least among the most divine things. He thus introduces, for the first time, the question of the existence of gods and their concern for our happiness, and he here leaves open the possibility that happiness is not due to chance because it is due to the intercession of gods. For now, Aristotle is content to argue on his own authority that happiness is, in addition to being available to many or most (1099b18–20), not at all due to chance, for “to entrust the greatest and noblest thing to chance would be excessively harsh” (1099b24–25)."
"19","Yet Aristotle concludes I.9 by repeating and even strengthening the demand that happiness include “a complete life” (1100a4–5; compare 1098a18), this time referring to the legendary sorrows of virtuous Priam. In this way he indicates that nothing he has said thus far deals adequately with the shadow cast on our happiness by chance. The deepest purpose of the immediately following discussion, in I.10, as to whether one can reasonably call a man happy only after he has died, is to make clear the means to solve this problem of chance: one must have recourse to a doctrine of the afterlife, according to which the deceased continues to enjoy at least some awareness (of the lives of his descendants, for example). Aristotle here insists, however, that only one's own virtuous activities determine happiness, that is, the happiness of a virtuous person cannot be affected even if some of his descendants receive in life a lot contrary to what they deserve (1100a25–26). Indeed, in the midst of his own troubles while alive, the virtuous person will bear up “altogether nobly and properly in every way,” and it will be in just such circumstances that his “nobility shines through.” It seems that nothing is so solid or lasting as the virtue and therefore the happiness of the virtuous. Yet, as powerful and attractive as this is, Aristotle immediately backs away from it in one respect, for he now (I.11) characterizes as “excessively opposed to friendship” (or excessively “hateful”: aphilon) and “contrary to the opinions” (1101a22–24) the view that how the living descendants fare in no way affects the deceased. Aristotle therefore revises his position one last time: “It appears, then, that the friends' faring well does make some contribution to [the condition of] those who have passed away, as does, similarly, their faring ill, but a contribution of such a kind and degree as not to make the happy unhappy or anything else of that sort” (1101b5–9). By the end of I.11, Aristotle has adopted a tone quite different from that seen in I.6, where he had treated the concern for eternity unsympathetically, not to say scornfully.7"
"20","Here, then, is Aristotle's official answer in Book I of the Nicomachean Ethics to the problem of happiness: if we engage in the requisite activity of soul that accords with (the best) virtue, we will secure for ourselves here and now a life that is at once best, noblest, and most pleasant, and we will enjoy this life most continuously. We will also earn for ourselves an afterlife in which nothing, not even the awareness we will have of the fate of our descendants, good or bad, can fundamentally disturb the happiness we will enjoy there. Of the two responses to the problem of happiness that Aristotle had sketched at the end of I.8, then—to hold either that happiness is (merely) good fortune, or that it is equivalent to virtue (1099b7–8)—Aristotle here clearly rejects the former because he holds to the latter. Happiness is not due to chance because it is evidently governed by the practice of virtue.         "
"21","The tension at the heart of Aristotle's argument in Book I is now clear. On the one hand, virtue simply cannot guarantee the happiness of the virtuous because it cannot protect them from grave misfortune—witness Priam (1100a8, 1101a8)—and, on the other hand, precisely virtue bestows on those who practice it, probably in this life and certainly in the next, a happiness that can never be transformed into its contrary."
"22","To resolve this tension, we might be tempted to suppose that the first position indicated is merely a preliminary one, a statement of the problem, and that the latter position, which is after all set forth at far greater length, is Aristotle's final answer to it. And yet, attractive though it may be, this suggestion cannot stand. It is crucial to see, to begin with, that Aristotle himself vouches for almost none of the positions he offers in I.8–11 in response to the problem of happiness. For example, the whole of the argument is begun by his turn away from “premises” and “conclusions,” i.e., from arguments properly speaking, and to “the things said about [happiness],” i.e., to opinions (1098b9–11). The opinions that are permitted to exercise most influence there belong to “the ancients” and those of “high repute,” in contrast to “those who philosophize” (compare 1098b12–22 with 1098b22–31, where “the few of high repute” take the place of the philosophers). And since Aristotle does not fail to report a certain contrary opinion conveyed by no less than an inscription at Delos (1099a27–28), perhaps from the very temple of Leto,8 he must select from among the august but contradictory opinions available to him. He does so on the basis of the hunch that “it is reasonable that neither of these two [i.e., the ancients and the few of high repute] be completely wrong in all respects—rather that they be correct in some one respect, at least, or even in most respects” (1098b28–29). Similarly, he rejects the view that happiness is due to chance on the basis of two conditional clauses (1099b20–23) and the thought that to hold otherwise would be “excessively harsh” (1099b24–25), just as he accepts that the dead must be aware of the lives of their surviving descendents (and hence must themselves be alive after death) on the grounds that it would be “excessively opposed to friendship” and “contrary to the opinions” to deny it—as if we could be certain that the most important truths accord with our opinions and preserve the things dear to us, subphilosophic considerations if ever there were any. Aristotle's striking deference to these opinions, and above all to the hopes they reveal, is evidence enough of their great power; no adequate account of happiness could proceed without acknowledging the existence of these opinions, the denial of which is indeed harsh. It is not only the political community's great power and its consequences, then, that guide Aristotle in his exposition, but also the powerful hope in each of us to attain happiness. If the political community habituates us to accept the view that the preservation of its good is “nobler and more divine” than the attainment of our own, it must be said that we are creatures peculiarly open to such habituation; we are by nature “political animals” in part because we can be deeply moved by considerations of what is noble and divine, which is to say that we are creatures capable of conceiving of “happiness.”9"
"23","Once we strip I.8–11 of the assertions that are, if not groundless, then grounded in something other than rational argument, we are permitted to see with greater clarity Aristotle's occasional frankness here. For example, he raises as a rhetorical question whether it is not altogether “absurd” (atopon) to hold that the dead can be happy, especially for those who maintain that happiness is dependent on activity: the dead as such cannot be active, still less happy (1100a12–14). Even in the course of sketching the apparent solution to every problem attending happiness, Aristotle insists on repeating those problems and in effect strengthening the force of them. For example, the problem of chance includes that of our necessary dependence on “external goods” or “equipment,” under which heading he now discusses the premature death of friends and children (I.8: 1099a31–1099b7)10 and he repeats, as we have seen, the requirement of a “complete life” (I.9: 1100a4–9). What is more, in his impressive struggle with the fact of our exposedness to chance, Aristotle resorts to a non sequitur: we may grant that those who are “‘foursquare, without blame’” will bear fortunes “most nobly”—they deal with all fortunes “in a becoming way and always [do] what is noblest given the circumstances” (I.10: 1100b30–31, 1101a1–3)—but we need to know that such human beings will also be, not merely not wretched (1100b34, 1101a6), but happy as a result of their superlative nobility or virtue (compare 1100b9–10 with 20–22, e.g.). This Aristotle finally declines to affirm (1101a6–8). It is impossible to maintain, then, that Aristotle himself equates happiness with virtue—what is, after all, a most extreme position because it denies to chance any empire whatever.         "
"24","But what of someone who is active in accord with complete virtue and who is adequately equipped with external goods in the course of a complete life—someone, that is, who combines virtue with remarkably good fortune (1101a14–16)? Such a combination is surely conceivable. Aristotle's response to this question is as graceful as it is brief: “we will say that those among the living who have and will have available to them the things stated, are blessed—but blessed human beings” (1101a19–21). To understand this all‐important qualification, we must begin from the fact that Aristotle here reminds us of, namely that “the future is immanifest to us” (1101a18). The difficulty is not only that our ignorance of the future helps render things generally good of uncertain goodness in fact or in the event (recall 1094b16–19). The difficulty is also, and more, that we can never be certain of enjoying (genuine) goods tomorrow: awareness of our exposedness to chance must cast a shadow on any possible happiness here and now. One might even say that it makes happiness, as distinguished from a kind of contentedness, impossible. Not just the calamity, but the knowledge of the possibility of it, not just the loss of loved ones, but the knowledge of the possibility of it, not just, finally and above all, the uncertainty of one's own death but rather the knowledge of its eventual certainty—all these contribute to rendering our hope for happiness unrealizable. We can hope to be blessed—but always and merely “blessed human beings,” with the necessary limits attending us as mortals.         "
"25","It now becomes necessary to revisit a premise guiding Book I, according to which the greatest good, “the human good,” is happiness understood as some perfect or complete good that as such conveys to its possessor a thorough self‐sufficiency or freedom from need. In his first formulation of this premise, Aristotle notes that in fact only “most” agree to it: it is clearly joined in by “the many” (hoi polloi) and “the refined,” but not so clearly by the wise (compare 1095a18–20 with 21). (The apparently sharp line Aristotle draws between the many and the refined vanishes when either is compared to “the wise”: the view that honor is the greatest good, characteristic of the refined, is really a view of the many, if not the most vulgar of them [compare 1095b16 and 22–23 with 1095a22–23, where the point of comparison is the wise.]) And, as we have seen, “those who philosophize” are not among the ancients and the reputable who hold various opinions about what happiness consists in (compare again 1098b12–22 with 1098b22–31). Finally, it may make sense to say of the gods that they are happy and blessed, but even the “most divine” of human beings cannot properly be said to be happy (consider 1101b23–25, with the reading of the MSS.).11 The teaching of Book I of the Ethics that is at once most fundamental and least obvious is that “the human good” is not indeed happiness, if that term is understood as it ought to be. The good that we cannot help but seek must be one in which we can have some share (1172b34–35).         "
"26","The last chapter of Book I that deals with virtue in its relation to happiness (I.12) is a curious appendix not obviously related to what has preceded it. Aristotle raises the question of whether happiness belongs among the things praised or among the things honored. The distinction amounts to this: everything praised is inferior to the “good and serious” thing to which our praise refers, whereas everything honored is honored because it is perfect or complete. Accordingly, happiness, the perfect or complete good, must be among the things honored (1102a1). But this means that moral virtue in general, and justice in particular (1101b14 and 26), is to be praised—merely praised—and not honored. The moral virtues, in short, are inferior to happiness. They are praiseworthy only insofar as they contribute to happiness. It is as a result very hard to see why anyone would take moral virtue as seriously as we typically do—or as seriously as Aristotle soon will. For once he makes the transition, effected in I.13, to moral virtue, the theme of the next four books of the Ethics, Aristotle more or less consistently adopts the view that a truly virtuous act will be undertaken only “for the sake of the noble” (e.g., 1115b12–13) or that virtuous acts are done “for their own sakes” (1105a31–32) and not because they contribute to a good greater than moral virtue itself—to one's own happiness, for example (compare 1097b1–4). He will for the most part speak, in other words, as though moral virtue falls among the things honored.         "
"27","The reasons to take virtue very seriously evidently persist at the close of Book I. In Book I, Aristotle explains what “happiness” is and clearly indicates the obstacles to achieving it. He also, of course, indicates a path around them. Those satisfied with Aristotle's account will be all the more eager to learn of the specific demands of moral virtue (1102a5–6), for the meeting of them takes on a new urgency given the risks to which we are exposed and, above all, given the reward that awaits us. But even those dissatisfied with this solution (for which dissatisfaction there is ample justification) cannot be assumed also to have uprooted their hope for happiness in the precise sense. They will therefore remain open to dedicating themselves, if not to moral virtue as an end in itself, then to the peak of virtue as Aristotle presents it, to intellectual virtue, whose objects of concern are distinguished by their nobility and divinity (1177a15)."
"28","Indeed, Aristotle himself will, at the climax of Book X, make intellectual virtue the basis of what might loosely be called divine providence, whose sole function is to secure the happiness of the wise (1179a22–32, considering especially tis epimeleia at 1179a24). And this leads to the thought that Aristotle's contradictory presentation of virtue in its relation to happiness in Book I can be ironed out simply by noting that “virtue” proves to be an ambiguous term in the Ethics: it has two species, intellectual (contemplative) and moral. Indeed, even in the course of Book I, Aristotle points to this ambiguity (consider 1098a16–18 and I.13). Perhaps, then, contemplative virtue can accomplish what moral virtue alone cannot.         "
"29","At all events, only divine providence—whether it looks to the moral or to the intellectual virtue of those it favors—could be adequate to the task of fulfilling our deepest hope for happiness. This is so in the first place because only a divine being could guarantee the benignity of the fortune to which our hopes for happiness are necessarily exposed: no conceivable technological or scientific innovation, for example, will ever be adequate to this task. The premise that happiness is a gift from gods to human beings, then, is the most serious part of Aristotle's official response to the problem of happiness, it being also the necessary premise of the view that the virtuous live on after death and know then a happiness that cannot be undone.12 By carefully tracing out the most powerful opinions about happiness, and by giving full expression to our concern for virtue, Book I of the Nicomachean Ethics indicates that the core of our hope for happiness is a longing for a completion that renders us “in need of nothing.” Our hope for happiness is at bottom the longing to be immortal, a longing that surely only a god could fulfill.         "
"30","Yet Aristotle himself does not simply accept the view that “the god” or gods are finally responsible for our happiness, his willingness to repeat and hence promote it notwithstanding. Aristotle does not in fact assert in Book I that our happiness is god‐sent—this thought rests on the protasis of a conditional sentence that is compatible with the gods giving no gifts whatever to human beings (1099b11–13)—and he immediately entertains the view that happiness is not god‐sent (1099b14–15). As we have seen, Aristotle raises the possibility, at least, that the idea of the dead enjoying happiness is “altogether absurd.” In addition, since Aristotle asserts the impossibility of our knowing the future, he must also deny the worth of those claims to special access to it, through divination and the like. As for his description in Book X of the providence attending the wise, is this “solution” too not problematic? For even if we accept without question the utterly mysterious operation of this providence, which is introduced in a conditional clause, happiness would still be beyond the reach of almost everyone because intellectual virtue is available to exceedingly few. And this is a harsh thought (compare polukoinon[“shared by many” or “common to many”] at 1099b18 and context).         "
"31","What goal or goals, then, govern Aristotle's manifestly complex manner of argument in the first book of the Ethics? It is generally held today that Aristotle's most pious remarks here, those pertaining to the afterlife, for example, cannot be taken to be sincere (see, e.g., n.7). We agree with this judgment. After all, Aristotle declines to include piety in the eleven moral virtues analyzed in the Ethics, and in the Politics he famously declares that the city comes into being “by nature” and not (as this already implies) by the workings of the gods, notwithstanding the claim of many ancient cities to be traceable to divine law (e.g., Plato Laws 624a1–6). The first purpose of such pious statements, tentative as they are, is to lessen the suspicion or ire of the most unphilosophic and censorious in Aristotle's audience—he who wished to give no cause to Athens to sin against philosophy a second time. Yet Aristotle indicates a threefold division among human beings and so among his potential audience: the many, the refined, and the philosophic (or wise). We tentatively suggest that at least some of the refined, properly reared and so correctly dedicated to moral virtue, would nonetheless be among those who see through Aristotle's apparently pious remarks. More sophisticated than most, such readers would remain dedicated to virtue while looking only halfheartedly, or indeed not at all, to gods and to an afterlife to solve the shortcomings of this life; here one may think of Laches and Demosthenes, for example, as they are presented by Plato and Aristophanes respectively13—together with a great many of Aristotle's readers today. Such readers would not blanch at Aristotle's omission of piety in the enumeration of the virtues belonging to a kaloskagathos and would be content to imitate, in the conduct of their own lives or the life of their community, the wholly inward‐looking “activity” of “the god” to whom Aristotle appeals briefly in the Politics, a god who bears no resemblance to Zeus or, for that matter, to the God of Abraham (1323b21–29 and 1325b28–30). Might then an effect, an intended effect, of Aristotle's less‐than‐convincing remarks about the divine here also be to encourage, in just such readers, the conviction that the life of noble action brings with it a completeness or self‐sufficiency that renders reliance on the divine unnecessary? Aristotle's manifest distance from simple orthodoxy and the obviously conditional character of his own assertions here concerning the divine would strengthen this confidence in the sufficiency of moral virtue that characterizes his more refined readers.         "
"32","At the same time, however, Aristotle also points to the ultimately ungrounded character of such confidence. He does so in part by insisting, in Book X, on the decisive superiority of theoretical to moral virtue, in part by drawing attention, in Book I, to the divine and the afterlife as involving questions that must at some point be confronted. The philosophically inclined in his audience, thus prompted to reflect on these questions, will be compelled to wonder whether recourse to the divine is not in fact necessary to the life of moral virtue, if it is to hope to attain the completeness it seeks.         "
"33","Insincere as they may be, then, Aristotle's remarks about the divine in Book I nonetheless serve altogether serious purposes. And if prudential calculation no longer demands that we today pay careful attention to “the divine,” self‐knowledge does demand it: at a time when “happiness” is frequently equated with the experience of ephemeral pleasure, we need to learn or be reminded of the very meaning of “happiness”—of its deepest root, its highest hope, and what would have to be true of the world if happiness properly speaking is to be realized."
"34","The study of Book I of the Nicomachean Ethics is useful today because it deals with a question—the nature of human happiness—whose relevance is obvious. But in dealing with that question, Book I compels us to raise difficulties for ourselves that, far from being obvious, are in danger of being forgotten. It is with a view to combating this danger that the present essay has attempted to explain, and hence been compelled at times to trample on, Aristotle's great delicacy or sensitivity in exploring our hope for happiness. Chief among these difficulties are, first, the true character of our hope for happiness and, ultimately, the necessity of there being a kind of divine providence if that hope is to be realized. Inasmuch as we still long for happiness, we must still undergo the pull of that necessity, however distant it may appear to us to be. In bringing out our deepest concern in this way, the study of the first book of the Ethics also prepares us to become serious students of Aristotle's “philosophy of human matters” as a whole, which is concerned with the reality of the providence indicated because it is concerned with the possibility of philosophy as a way of life.
