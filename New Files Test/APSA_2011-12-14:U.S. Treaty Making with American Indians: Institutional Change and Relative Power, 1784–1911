"1","There are some 2.5 million Native Americans living in the present‐day United States (United States Census 2000) and the U.S. government officially recognizes 565 tribes and Alaska Native peoples (Federal Register 2007). They are concentrated in California, Oklahoma, and the Southwest (United States Census 2002). Though they constitute an ethnic minority of sorts, Native Americans are properly considered nations and are unique in that their relationship with the United States is in part governed by treaties (Wilkins 2007, 45–46). Treating with Native Americans became common soon after first contact with English settlers in the early seventeenth century (Williams 1999). Implicit in these agreements was the assumption that the Indians actually owned the land and were thus able to trade it away (Banner 2005). By Royal Proclamation in 1763, it was declared that only the Imperial government could buy land (private individuals could not do so). This was subsequently confirmed to be true for the U.S. government also, by the Intercourse Act of 1790 and subsequent Supreme Court decisions.4"
"2","The history of treating has been the subject of many accounts, some general (e.g., Deloria and DeMallie 1999; Prucha 1994), others dealing with particular tribes, times, or treaties (e.g., Asher 1999; Calloway 2008; Edmunds 1978; Ethridge 2003; Gibbon 2003; McKee and Schlenker 1980; Miller 1991; O’Brien 2003; St. Germain 2001; White 1991). In terms of trends, Prucha (1994) argues, and others agree, that the end of the War of 1812 allowed a less‐threatened United States to assume a “position of dominance” for subsequent negotiations. Indian removal to west of the Mississippi in the post‐1830 period has been especially well discussed, in part due to the human suffering it entailed (see Akers 2004; Deloria 1985; O’Brien 2003). Exactly what constitutes the “universe” of treaties for analysis is debated. The most famous collection is that of Kappler (1904), though other scholars—especially Deloria and DeMallie (1999)—have disputed and extended that collection substantially. The latter forms the backdrop for our work here. To contribute to the debate on policy evolution, systematically examining and coding every treaty in a social scientific manner is the ideal way to proceed. But it is problematic—there are a large number, and hand coding is likely to be unreliable and expensive.         "
"3","Both legally and conceptually, treaties may be considered contracts, and several scholars have treated them as such (see Mahoney 2007; Miller 2007 for recent examples). At least since the American Revolution, treaties negotiated under Article II of the Constitution are interpreted by the Supreme Court as commitments wholly separate to legislation. Whatever their precise clauses and specifications, contracts are the products of bargaining—albeit perhaps implicitly. Of interest in this article is the changing nature of the “bargain” (in contract terms) both sought and achieved by the United States from Indian tribes.            "
"4","There is, of course, a vast literature in political economy on this topic (introductory accounts can be found in Muthoo 1999; Myerson 1997; Osborne and Rubinstein 1990), and scholars of international relations have been particularly active in applying the insights therein to conflict between nations (see Powell 2002 for an overview, and Fearon 1995; Slantchev 2003; Wagner 2000 for examples). The interest in many such works—where war is treated as an “outside option”—is the way in which the threat of conflict drives the bargaining outcome over territory between states. With that body of work in mind, there are several general predictions vis‐à‐vis the “harshness” of the treaties (contracts) American Indians were forced to sign. In particular, we could expect the extent of Indian concessions to the United States to be (a) increasing in the United States’ relative military capability (i.e., harsher agreements when the United States was more likely to defeat the Indians in a subsequent war, or had just done so) and (b) decreasing in the cost of conflict to the United States (i.e., harsher agreements when war was relatively cheap from the United States’ perspective). This is quite apart from any variation in the payoff to the U.S. actors ultimately responsible for the treaties signed: ultimately, we would expect negotiating with politicians who gain more utility from Indian land seizures to be pernicious for the tribes involved. This latter point may seem almost tautological, but it is worth exploring given an important legal change in 1871.            "
"5","From a strictly constitutional standpoint, treaty making with the United States began during the Revolutionary War (1778) and ended in 1868. There are thus 367 treaties with undisputed status. These were negotiated by the president and ratified by the Senate as is required for treaties under Article II of the Constitution. For the entire period under study, the bargaining “protocol” was essentially a “take‐it‐or‐leave‐it” offer from the government. In part, this was for institutional reasons: by the Intercourse Act of 1790, only the federal government could purchase land (and make treaties) with Native Americans (Banner 2005, 135), and thus there were no competitors for this monopsony role. And there is scant evidence of an open, alternating style of negotiation (in the sense of, say, Rubinstein 1982). Indeed, officials frequently used “force, bribery, deception and threats, among other things, to convince Indian leaders to sign land cession treaties” (Satz 1976, 1).            "
"6","From the 1860s onwards a confluence of several events meant that treaties, and specifically treaties negotiated by the president, would cease to be made. Banner (2005, 236–53) gives a full account, but the outline of the changes is as follows. First, there was the increasing legalistic belief that it made little sense to treat with Indians living within the territory of the United States and already subject to its jurisdiction. That is, such Nations could not be regarded as sovereign entities, and in any case could not ensure compliance among all their peoples to the treaties they did sign. Second was the rise of the (quasi‐racist) contention that Indians were simply not able to comprehend the nature of the treaty process itself, nor give their consent meaningfully. White humanitarians similarly turned their back on treaties, believing them increasingly likely to be cynically designed and abrogated whenever suited the government. Finally, the fact that the president alone could negotiate treaties, but that the funds relating to these negotiations (including payments to nations) were supplied by Congress meant that the House was routinely forced to agree to appropriations over which it had no control.            "
"7","Primarily due to this latter pressure, in 1871 by a complex series of maneuvers (see Deloria and DeMallie 1999, 233–38; Gibbon 2003, 139–57), Congress removed the presidential power to treat.5 After this point, ratified “agreements” became the norm for documenting the relationship between the tribes and the government. Wilkins (2007) and others argue that this arrangement—and the self‐confident Congress that came with it—ushered in an aggressive new regime of conquest and ruin for Native peoples. In part, such reasoning arises from the different incentives that members of the House had relative to the president. Not only were congressmen the only directly elected legislators at this time, but also they often represented the precise areas from which Indian reservations were to be carved, thus denying white pioneers the lands they sought to settle (Banner 2005, 249).6 Given that whites voted and Indians did not, the electoral incentives (especially in states like California—see Deloria and DeMallie 1999, 745) were such that we might imagine these House members would be keen to ensure that future land exchanges were as deleterious as possible to Indian holdings. On the other hand, some scholars have claimed that the substitute institutions were essentially identical in practical effect, if not legal detail (Banner 2005, 252). Political scientists have long argued for the importance of studying seemingly subtle rules and their changes (e.g., Riker 1980, 1986), so there is much cross‐discipline interest in investigating the linguistic and empirical implications of the changed procedures in this case.            "
"8","While the new institutional arrangement suggests a relatively clean “break point” in harshness terms, a more gradual worsening of terms might be seen via changes in the general bargaining power of the United States. Scholars have argued explicitly, for example, that the increasing military and industrial might of the United States made enforcing “harsher” deals easier as time went on; using qualitative methods, Keohane (1996, chap. 4, 5–6), talks of a “power relationship” between settlers and Indians that had “fundamentally changed” by the middle of the nineteenth century, not least due to overwhelming differences in population size. Satz (1976, 6) argues that a presidential intent to forcibly move the Indians was a constant since the founding of the Republic, but that by the 1820s the costs of such a threat—should it have been realized—became easier to bear as public and intellectual opinion shifted.            "
"9","In some senses, these are competing theories worthy of investigation: on the one hand, we have sudden institutional variation, and on the other we have a more general trending variable. We now discuss the relevant data and methods, before opining on the plausibility of each account, and some associated findings therein."
"10","Our universe of treaties and agreements is those signed between Indians and the U.S. government between the end of the Revolutionary War and 1911. This means our data are a proper subset of that reported by Deloria and DeMallie (1999) for these two sets of actors, but, in practice, the differences are very slight.7 First, we do not include those few treaties signed with the United States before it had won the war since, up to that point, its authority over its territory was still in some doubt. Hence, our data begin in 1784. Second, we do not include a final document signed sometime after all the others (i.e., 1911) in the data—in particular, we drop the 1954 agreement with the Cheyenne River Sioux. Third, we drop some “miscellaneous” treaties that appear as (a) “additional ratified treaties” (Deloria and DeMallie 1999, 204) which are absent from Kappler (1904) and not included in the State Department files and (b) some so‐called “Conventions” with the Indians (Deloria and DeMallie 1999, 253), signed between 1825 and 1836. Our plan is thus to steer a “middle way” in data terms: using the Deloria and DeMallie (1999) corrections to the gross errors of Kappler (1904), while staying true to the general use of the terms “treaty” and “agreement” in the literature.8 All told, we have 595 documents of interest—all scanned or rewritten as plain text files (UTF‐8)—which may be broken down into several legal categories. First, there are those which are Valid and Operable (365 texts): beginning after the Revolution with the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1784 signed with the six nations, and ending with a treaty signed with the Nez Perce in 1868, these treaties have been ratified under Article II. Second, Ratified Agreements (77): these documents originate in 1871 after the purported “end” of treaty making and were ratified in statute form. Third, Rejected by Congress (85): this class of documents exemplifies the “broken” treaties in the sense that this term is used to refer to deals that were particularly cavalier regarding Indian rights (Deloria and DeMallie 1999, 745) and is the sum total of those that were submitted to the Senate, but not ratified. Finally, Unratified Treaties (68): this class of documents includes all the treaties signed before 1868 (and thus potentially includable in the first category above) yet never submitted for Senate ratification in the usual way. As noted earlier, we wish to know how these legal groups differ in practice, and over time.         "
"11","We contend that treaties are contracts. Further examining this substantive speculation requires that we identify the empirical number and meaning of the “dimensions” of the texts (if any exist).9 Thus, the first task here is to scale the documents onto some continuum (or set of continua) before more detailed inspection. In order to remain a priori agnostic about the actual nature of the dimensions,10 an “unsupervised” approach seems reasonable. That is, we will not proceed by assuming a particular treaty (or subset of treaties) is an example of a specific prior‐defined phenomenon of interest; rather, we will interpret the scaling after it is created by the algorithm at hand.11"
"12","A very common approach to analyzing texts in this way begins by creating a “term document matrix” (TDM) which simply records a count, or proportion, or binary presence, of each word (the TDM columns) in a given document (the TDM rows). Typically there is some preprocessing: popular operations include “stemming”—erasing word suffixes to obtain the “root” of the word—and the removal of “stop” words. The latter are tokens that appear in high frequencies in many documents, and thus their presence conveys little information (e.g., “the,”“to,”“and”). A helpful consequence of such operations is that the number of relevant features is reduced to more manageable dimensions. We might then factorize this matrix down to its “key” components before describing and interpreting the positions of the observations (the documents) relative to one another. For our particular case, however, working with TDMs may not be ideal. In particular, any information about word order is essentially jettisoned. That is, from the perspective of a “stopped” TDM—one in which commonly occurring words thought not to discriminate between texts are dropped—a document consisting of the phrase “no peace between us” is identical to one constructed of the phrase “peace between us.”         "
"13","One way to preserve word order is to use “string kernels” in the sense of Lodhi et al. (2002). As a running example, suppose our document was the single word “apartment.” A substring of “apartment” is an ordered, contiguous subset of its letters (of length at least 1), so “part,”“par,”“art,”“me,” and “men” would all be examples—as would “p,”“ar,”“rtm,” and “tme,” though they are not actual words. We say that the ‐spectrum of a document is simply the frequency distribution of the substrings of length  within it. The inner product of two documents  and  is then just the number of ‐length substrings they have in common. An example is instructive: let the first document be apartment and the second be treatment, part 1. These documents have three 4‐strings—part,ment and tmen—in common. Thus ,which is then normalized to account for differing document lengths. The idea is that similarly consecutive characters are an important component of document nearness: texts that share “war ends” will be closer in space than two which contain “war ends” and “ends war,” respectively. Thus, word‐order information is included in the metric.12 Once all the inner products of all the document pairs in the corpus have been calculated, we have the ‘kernel matrix’ and scaling can begin. In practice, we use kernel PCA (Scholkopf, Smola, and Muller 1998) for this last stage, which projects the observations via principal components of the data which are themselves possibly nonlinearly related to the original variables. To implement kernel PCA for our string kernels, we utilized kernlab (Karatzoglou et al. 2004) for the R language and environment (R Development Core Team 2009), and our choice of string length was five for what follows.13"
"14","The first requirement is to investigate model fit, that is, to determine the number of dimensions that best describe the texts at hand. In Figure 1 we plot the eigenvalues—a measure of variance explained—for a ten (principal) component fit. The scree test (Figure 1) does not show an obvious “elbow,” suggesting there is some variation of substantive interest in a fitted model of up to seven dimensions. Nonetheless, the drop‐off in fit after the first component is considerable, and we focus on that “main” dimension in what follows.14"
"15","Model Fit: Eigenvalues for 1 through 10 (Kernel) Principal Components"
"16","Determining what the uncovered dimension “represents” substantively is not a trivial task. Here, we proceed by treating the derived scaling as a continuous outcome to be predicted by the various frequencies of the words in the documents. The goal is to discover what types of words, and what types of phrases, appear to be associated with the relative position of the texts on the unit interval. For now, we focus on the 442 documents which were ratified under Article II or are post‐1871 agreements and thus had a direct impact on Indian welfare in and of themselves. Specifically, our approach is as follows: First, we construct a stemmed (in the sense that different variants of the same word are grouped together) term document matrix  with “stop” words and punctuation removed.15 Each cell is calculated as the term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf‐idf) of the word. Recall that this measure is increasing with the frequency with which a particular word is used in a treaty, but then down‐weighted according the frequency of its use in all the treaties put together. We then remove “sparse” terms that are not present in at least 90% of the documents (leaving a total of 597 individual stems). We take the transpose of , denoted, as a model matrix in the sense that each row corresponds to a treaty and each column a different stem. We perform a (linear) detrending of the scale to ensure that localized (in time terms) shifts in language can be properly accounted for.16 Finally, we “regress” the one‐dimensional detrended scale  on  using a “random forest” (in the sense of Breiman 2001) machine learning algorithm. The advantage to using the random forest procedure—as opposed to more conventional approaches—is that we can obtain a measure of variable importance despite the fact that the number of columns of  (stems) far exceeds the number of observations (treaties).17Figure 2 reports the 35 most important stems for our data. As can be seen there, the stems land,tract and reserv are apparently helpful for discriminating the treaties’ scaled locations, as are the terms relinquish,friendship,dollar, and boundari."
"17","Thirty‐Five “Most Important” Stems for Predicting Operable Treaty and Agreement Scaling"
"18","To ease the interpretation of this plot, Table 1 reports some of these important stems–and some other interesting terms—and the most common way that they actually appear as words, and in frequent contexts, in the treaties. We sort the entries by the correlation between the frequency (the tf‐idf) of the stem and the treaties’ positions on the scaled interval. Thus, for example, the stem “boundari” appears most commonly as the word “boundary” and in the sentence fragment “the tract of land included within the following boundaries.”         "
"19","Studying the table and the correlations, it seems that conciliatory language—speaking of “friendship,”“peace,” and “mutually”—is associated with more positive values on the treaty scale. By contrast, talk of “land” and the need to “relinquish” property and “reservations” are correlated with low values on the treaty scale. The latter set of terms is surely indicative of more aggressive treaty writing relative to the agreeable tone of the former. This result is not an artifact of the restricted sample; though we do not report them here, the direction of the correlations for the words in Table 1 for the full data set (thus including rejected treaties and those that were never submitted) is as previously described: the words pertaining to consent and mutualism are associated with higher (detrended) scale scores, whereas the words dealing with land deals, removal, and the surrendering of rights are associated with lower scores.         "
"20","To see this variation in practice, consider Figure 3. Here, we plot the rescaled positions of each document in our data set over time. The term “rescaled” in the context simply means that the original kernel PCA (one‐dimensional) scores are compressed on a zero to one interval, with no loss of generality. The date for each is as given by Deloria and DeMallie (1999) and corresponds to the signing—not necessarily the ratification—of the treaty in question. As noted in the plot legend, [green] circles are valid treaties and agreements, i.e., the first two parts of the data set as discussed in the third section, while [red] triangles are “rejected” treaties, and [purple] squares are those that were never submitted for ratification. The broken black line demarcates the purported “end” of treaty making after which, as readers can readily see, most of the treaties are scaled below the 0.5 point on the ‐axis. The solid, undulating black line moving left to right is simply a weighted moving average (a lowess) of the scaled points, to give a sense of the general movement over time. More formally, a (nonparametric) Spearman rank correlation test yields a  () for the time series, suggesting that the data are indeed generally declining in value over time. If we accept that this scale represents a declining bargaining advantage for the Indians—as we argued above—we thus have prima facie evidence that the treaties impose harsher resource‐transfer conditions over time.         "
"21","Scaled Location of All Treaties, by Year of Signing"
"22","Note: Treaties and agreements that are “valid” are [green] circles, rejected treaties are [red] triangles, and treaties that were never submitted and thus unratified are [purple] squares. The broken line corresponds to 1871 and purported “end” of treaty making.                     "
"23","With some evidence that the measurement strategy is valid, we will turn to the question of institutional change in 1871 momentarily. Before doing so, we examine another empirical implication of the bargaining framework which should help to shed light on the merits of our strategy here."
"24","One of our informal, intuitive predictions from the second section was that a relatively (to Indian forces) strong U.S. military would enable the government to impose harsher terms in subsequent treaties. By exploring whether or not that was indeed the case in terms of the “main” dimension of treaties above, we can comment further on the reasonableness of contract bargaining as a structure for understanding U.S.‐Indian relations."
"25","Before embarking on this effort in more depth, two issues are worthy of note. First, only some of the Indian wars involved pitched battles, ascribable combatants, identifiable outcomes, and obvious start and finish dates. In this way, those cases are similar to the interstate conflicts studied by students of international relations. An example would be Red Cloud’s War (1865–68) in which the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and others were able to defeat U.S. government forces and obtain a relatively favorable outcome in postwar negotiation. Conversely, the Third Seminole War (1855–58) involved very small numbers of Indian warriors (perhaps no more than 200 men), with the conflict itself little more than sporadic raiding attacks on Florida settlers, followed by U.S. state militia attempts to capture the rebel tribe members. Second, related to this contrast, the extent to which we have a “paper trail” of treaties pertaining to the resolution of the conflicts is variable: for example, the peace terms of Red Cloud’s War are located in the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), but we have no similar physical documentation for the Modoc War (1872–73), Snake War (1866–68), or the various Seminole campaigns."
"26","With the above inconsistencies in mind, we proceed as follows. We use Axelrod’s (1993) Chronicle of the Indian Wars to define the universe of cases of wars between Indians and the United States, including (approximate) beginning and end dates. For each (primary) tribe involved in (at least one) war, we calculate their “prewar” score as the mean of the scaled treaties to which they were signatories before the onset of the (last) conflict they were parties to. We calculate their “postwar” score as the scaled treaty to which they were signatories after the (last) conflict they were parties to. Our “control group” are those tribes who are never involved in war. For any given war onset, we take the mean of the control group’s treaties in the four years preceding that date as the control “prewar” measurement. Conversely, the control “postwar” measurement is the average treaty scores for these tribes in the succeeding three years after the conflict ends.18"
"27","The essence of this scheme is that we have a (mean) difference in treaty scores for tribes involved in wars and a (mean) difference for nations that were never at war. For example, the Shawnees had a prewar average of 0.561 (on the zero to one interval), which decreased to 0.192 after their conflicts. By contrast, in the rest of the contemporaneous sample, the mean for this period began at 0.541 and actually increased to 0.803. In general, tribes involved in wars were worse off after they fought than contemporaneously treating tribes that were not directly involved in conflict. This pattern becomes more obvious in Figure 4, where we plot the treaty scores on either side of a tribal war (for those cases where the tribes actually signed treaties on both sides). Broadly, we see that the tribes fighting wars (the solid [red] lines) find themselves worse off in the postwar period relative to the way they began them (the solid lines slope downward). When war is associated with a period of welfare improvement, as in the case of the Potawatomi or the Creek, nonwarring tribes see their own welfare improve more over the same period. Finally, when nonwar tribes see their welfare decreasing—as is the case when compared to the Apache or Cheyenne—it is worth noting that their treaties become harsher at a slower rate than those fighting wars in the same periods. The mean difference in differences is statistically significant () via a ‐test, and a Wilcoxon‐signed rank test yields congruent results (). In short then, defeat in war is associated with more deleterious treaty terms for Indians. This is consistent with our intuitions above: after defeat, the Indians are weaker and must accept the pernicious treaty demands that subsequently arise. Having now established further validity of our construction and interpretation of the “main” dimension, we now return to the main theme of the article. In particular, we want to know whether the removal of the right to treat by the president affected the qualitative nature of the subsequent agreements that emerged in bargaining terms and how that fits within a general historical trajectory of increasing (relative) U.S. military power.            "
"28","Pre‐ and postwar Treaties for (Complete) Cases"
"29","Note: The ‐axis in every case is the zero–one interval. The solid [red] line connects mean score for war tribe treaties, either side of war. The broken [black] line connects mean score for nonwar tribe treaties, either side of war.                        "
"30","Are the post‐1871 agreements “different” from the treaties that preceded them? One way to investigate this notion is simply to compare the distribution (or the relevant moments of that distribution) for the rejected treaties relative to the others. With Figure 3 in mind, however, a straightforward problem emerges: by definition, the agreements were much later than the treaties. If we believe there is some general time trend—as the previous subsection contends—then a comparison of this type may be inappropriate. In short, it will assign a difference to agreements when, in fact, the difference is an aggregate one affecting all documents signed later (wherein it so happens that there are only agreements). Indeed, the scaled locations of the valid treaties and ratified agreements certainly differ () according to a ‐test (alternative hypothesis being inequality of means), a Wilcoxon‐signed ranked test (alternative: true location shift not zero) and a Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test (alternative being two sided). In order to compare like with like then, we first detrend the data. That is, we re‐represent each scaled treaty as a deviation from the linear regression mean at that point. For this detrended data, we cannot reject the null that the treaties and agreements are similar; to the extent that we take general shifts over time into account, there is not linguistic evidence of an “end” to treaty making in 1871. As a second check, we compared the raw scores (not detrended) of treaties immediately around the purported change point around 1871: in particular, we compared the 10 treaties prior and post, then the 20 treaties, then 30. In every case, for each test as above, we could not reject the null that the two types of document were not different from one another. Taken together, we regard this as prima facie evidence against the notion of a “sudden” change to terms due to the constitutional developments of 1871; we return to this notion with more precise tests in the section below.            "
"31","In passing, we also examined the proposed “differentness” of the treaties rejected by Congress (which might be described as “broken” in nature). To deal with this question, we first detrend the time series as above. Second, we “match” each rejected treaty with the closest (in date terms) nonrejected one and compare the vector of scales for these two groups. Thus, the rejected Wabash treaty signed on September 27, 1792, is paired with the valid and operable Cherokee treaty signed six months earlier. Meanwhile, the rejected treaty signed with the Creeks in January 1899 is paired with the ratified agreement signed with the Crow in June of the same year. In every case, we cannot reject the null hypothesis () that the rejected treaties are similar to those that were not rejected. In short, we find no evidence of the rejected treaties being different in linguistic terms from those signed in contemporary periods.            "
"32","To explore the evolution of treaties a little more, we consider possible “change points” in the time series of treaties (see Greene 2002, 116–47, for an overview). If the institutional developments of 1871 represent a new fate for Indians, we ought to see that time identified as a noticeable break in the data.            "
"33","Since every document has a single associated score on a continuum, we treat the data‐generating process as continuous and consider possible instability of coefficients in a classical linear regression sense. Using the method derived by Bai and Perron (2003), implemented by Zeileis et al. (2002), the best‐fitting model (selected via BIC) has three breaks.19 These change points correspond to observations in 1825, 1853, and 1866. In Figure 5, we plot the break points and moving average lines for each (resulting) segment. Notice that, in every case, the mean scale of the treaties is falling. Pre‐1825 it is around 0.6, but by the last period (post‐1866), it is just 0.224 on average.            "
"34","Breakpoints in Treaty Making"
"35","Note: Thick, black vertical lines are segments implied by Bai and Perron test. Means of segments (in terms of PCA scale) are text at bottom of segment. The [red] lines descending left to right are lowess moving averages for specific segments.                        "
"36","From an empirical perspective, it seems plausible that the first break corresponds to the events leading up to the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Although well known, the act is often misrepresented as providing authority for the president to remove tribes to west of the Mississippi. In fact, that power was not new; the key to this legislation is that it provided specific financial assistance for the movement (Banner 2005, 217). Either way though, scholars have certainly seen this period as a shift in U.S. treatment of Indians—after which policy became more aggressive and the benefits from land deals were increasingly one‐sided (e.g., Deloria 1985). Satz (1976, 1–6,14–18) argues that, for President Jackson, war with the Indian nations, should it have been required, was much less politically costly than for his predecessors, not least due to the efforts of Thomas L. McKenney, who was charged with the task of swaying public opinion. Furthermore, recall that our discussion in the second section requires the government to make credible threats that it might win a conflict (i.e, the Indians must believe that the United States is sufficiently powerful that they must acquiesce to a “harsh” treaty). In the decade succeeding this break, the United States defeated Indian tribes in the Old Northwest (including those lead by Tecumseh and Black Hawk), the Deep South (the Creek War), and the Southeast (First Seminole War).20 In view of this threat of force from the United States, Indians were increasingly unable to resist pernicious treaties that offered the government much but the tribes very little.21"
"37","The period immediately preceding the Civil War sees a drop‐off in treaty generosity. In terms of specific “causes,”Keohane (1996) discusses the explosion in the U.S. population around this time, and the insatiable search for western lands. As part of this expansion, the 1850s corresponds with a new way of “doing business” for the United States: specifically, the start of the “Reservation System” (Trennert 1975) wherein the government both purchased land as it had long done, but then, in addition, carved out a particular parcel within that expanse in which the Indians were expected to live. Exactly why the federal government chose this course of action is the subject of some debate, but part of the argument appears to be humanitarian in nature; it was thought that reservations would offer a safe haven as far afield as possible from rapacious frontiersmen, while Indians would also be more secure in their property and more likely to take on white cultural norms (Banner 2005, 232–33). The final slump in treaty terms comes after the Civil War as the United States could, once again, turn its attention to the “Indian question.” In particular, this period sees the beginning and then intensification of military efforts against the Sioux of the Black Hills: the mean treaty value falls from 0.37 down to 0.22.            "
"38","All told, we do not see an 1871‐specific break. This is consistent with our claims regarding the lack of “differentness” of these agreements in the section above. Otherwise put: the story about the varying relative power of the United States seems to fit better with our data than the notion of institutional change as a driver of treating relations."
"39","In passing, it is worth noting that Prucha’s (1994) hypothesis of a break around 1812 in treaty terms is partly supported by our data. It is certainly true that, on average, treaties are worse for Indians after the 1812–15 war, though that event does not (of itself) appear to be a break date. In practice, the surge in treaty scores around that time in part results from a series of hurried “peace” treaties between the United States and friendly tribes (such as the Wyandots and Delawares) in an attempt to ally against the British. Logically, this was when those Indians were at their most powerful in terms of bargaining and treaty making.            "
"40","Native American treaties and agreements signed with the U.S. government provide an extraordinarily detailed record of the developing relationship between a rising superpower and a people that now suffer from disproportionate social deprivation and lack of opportunities. This is of interest to political scientists, historians, lawyers, and public policy makers, and it is surely difficult to gainsay the profound practical consequence of this collection of documents. Here, for the first time, we took the universe of almost 600 observations of these texts and subjected them to systematic statistical analysis. Our primary concern was to investigate the consequences of an institutional change in 1871, by which the president was stripped of the right to treat by an exigent Congress. By extracting a “main” dimension of treaty making, we found strong evidence—statistical and substantive—that treaties became harsher over time, though it was not obvious that the 1871 alteration in bargaining rights made much difference in itself. Instead, we noted that the mid‐1820s, and then the middle years of the nineteenth century, correspond to a marked shift in the nature of treaty making. We showed how this behavior corresponds to our theoretical priors about bargaining between parties as circumstances change: as the United States became more powerful in the middle of the nineteenth century, it was able to drive harsher bargains with enervated tribes. As an aside, we found little evidence that the “broken” treaties form their own distinct group in the data. We also showed that war was associated with deleterious treaty outcomes for Indians: this may well be because the United States felt morally and militarily able to impose harsher terms ex post. More generally, this article showed the usefulness of utilizing texts as data: systematic inferences may be made that allow for the testing of theories from different fields."
"41","To derive our results, we used kernel methods that allow scholars to take word‐order information into account when looking for patterns in textual data. International treaties would be an interesting area to extend this analysis: for example, how has the language in treaties between the United States and Russia and between the United States and China changed over time? And does it correspond to the relative power of the parties during these periods? In that application, of course, countries are not typically bargaining over land as were the Indians and the U.S. government. Nonetheless, one could certainly assess the dimensionality of the texts via the scree plot technique mentioned above, and then interpret their nature using the TDM in the way discussed in the fifth section."
"42","Doubtless, there is much work left to do on Indian treaties. If the “broken” treaties are not obviously different, then a more subtle model and story is required: understanding why certain members of Congress chose not to ratify is certainly of interest. Fortunately, we have good data on their roll‐call decisions, and so future efforts might profitably consider their motivations and actions. In addition, now that the treaties are digitized and fully machine readable, further content analysis is possible: it might be particularly interesting to examine the precise parameters of the land (and other deals) offered by the parties to get a better sense of the evolving economics of contracts between the United States and Indian tribes. In this way, the treaties represent an intriguing testing ground for theories of bargaining discussed and extended in the burgeoning literatures of economics and international relations."
