"1","There are three players in the model: a higher court H, a lower court L, and a potential whistleblower (henceforth simply “whistleblower”) W. L represents a majority bloc of judges, who we assume behave as a unitary actor. W represents an actor outside this majority who has the potential to issue a costly signal in the form of a dissent. W can represent a single judge on a three‐judge panel, with L representing a two‐judge majority. W can also represent an interest group filing an amicus brief or the solicitor general requesting the Court to hear a case. For ease of exposition, when there is a potential for pronoun confusion, we refer to H as “he,” L as “they,” and W as “she.”               "
"2","The play of the game determines the outcome of a case. The facts of the case map onto a unidimensional space X that determines the degree to which the liberal outcome is more appropriate; x denotes the case's location on X. Facts that fall to the right are more “liberal.” The court makes either a “liberal” or “conservative” decision, denoted by lib and con, respectively. For example, Cameron, Segal, and Songer (2000), Lax (2003), and Kastellec (2007) all describe the case space in terms of search‐and‐seizure cases. In those models, the case space represents the degree of intrusiveness of a search, where cases that fall to the right are more intrusive. In terms of outcomes, a search is either held reasonable (the “conservative” outcome) or unreasonable (the “liberal” outcome).               "
"3","The players care about case outcomes, and their preferences are described by an indifference point in the case space. With slight abuse of notation, we denote the players' indifference points by L, W, and H. Each player prefers that all cases that map to the right of this indifference point receive the liberal outcome, and all to the left receive the conservative outcome. A player derives linear utility from the dispositional outcome: Each receives  from a ruling of  and  from a ruling of , where i denotes each player's respective indifference points. Thus, when , the player prefers a ruling of ; when , the player prefers . The loss from an incorrect decision is . An indifference point can be thought of as a description of the player's ideal legal outcome for every case.2 To simplify the presentation, we assume throughout that L and H are located within [0, 1], and in addition that the lower court is more liberal than the higher court (i.e., ). However, the results are symmetric: they continue to hold if one makes L more conservative than H and then transposes “liberal” for “conservative.”               "
"4","Nature first randomly draws a set of case facts x distributed according to the cumulative distribution function .  is assumed to be uniformly distributed on , where . L and W then observe x, which is revealed to the lower court judges and interested parties as the case is presented in briefs and oral arguments. L decides whether to rule liberally or conservatively. After observing this choice, W decides whether to blow the whistle in the form of a public signal of cost . For ease of exposition, we refer to this signal as a “dissent” from this point forward; readers should bear in mind we mean dissent to encompass all types of fire alarms, including those from non‐judges. Both L and W know the higher court's preferences H, but they do not know how much it would cost H to review L's decision.               "
"5","The case then moves to H, who does not initially observe the case facts. However, he updates his prior beliefs based on the observable actions of L and W—specifically, L's disposition of the case, and whether W issued a dissent. This captures the informational asymmetry between a lower court that actually hears a case, and a higher court with a discretionary docket that initially has only limited information. H then decides whether to review and potentially reverse L's ruling. Since a review entails rehearing the case, we assume that H learns the case facts x upon review and, in addition, pays a cost k. This cost captures both the time and resources a higher court must put into reviewing a case and the opportunity cost of hearing that case. Upon observing x, the higher court then makes a final decision of whether to uphold or reverse L's ruling.               "
"6","H's cost of review k is assumed to be probabilistic and distributed according to a CDF , where  is a uniform distribution over  with . This cost is known to H when he decides whether to review, but it is initially unknown to both L and W. Substantively, L and W are uncertain about exactly how much H cares about getting the right disposition relative to the costs of hearing the case. Thus, they always entertain the possibility that H will choose not to review simply because his costs are too high. This uncertainty creates the possibility that L may rule noncompliantly despite knowing that she will trigger a dissent and raise the risk of review. We also allow  to vary, thus allowing L and W to be more or less unsure of the cost to H of taking the case. Thus, paired with H's initial uncertainty over x, we assume a two‐way informational asymmetry.               "
"7","Finally, we assume that costs accrue to L and W if L's initial ruling is reversed by H. If a reversal occurs, then L suffers a sanctioning cost . This cost could capture, for example, the reputational penalty that a judge incurs when he is reversed. When L is reversed, W is also assumed to suffer a cost . Informally, α captures the extent to which W's fate is linked to L's. On a three‐judge panel where W represents a single judge, we argue that α is positive due to the fact that some costs of reversal fall on the entire court. Such costs include the cost of having to rehear a case on remand, and the court's general reputational cost. For third parties like litigants and interest groups, α could be low or even 0.3 Thus, to dissent, W must be sufficiently opposed to the disposition to be willing to bear the costs of both dissenting and of being linked to L's reversal.               "
"8","In this section, we begin characterizing perfect Bayesian equilibria of the model. In our analysis, we restrict attention to equilibria where a costly signal by the whistleblower increases the probability of review because it informs the higher court that relatively more severe noncompliance occurred. For clarity, in the remainder of the article we refer to this class of equilibria as simply the “equilibria.”4"
"9","At the most general level, W creates a potential problem for L and a potential benefit for H (though there are certain scenarios, as we discuss, where the presence of W does not materially affect the play of the game). L must worry about whether W will dissent from a noncompliant decision. H, in turn, can use both the presence of a dissent, and the incentives created by the threat therein, to update his beliefs both about the likelihood that L is not complying and the severity of the possible noncompliance.         "
"10","Before moving to the analysis, we foreshadow the general form of the equilibria. In theory, the form of each player's strategy could be complex; L must choose a ruling for every possible case fact, W must choose whether to dissent for every potential case fact and ruling, and H must decide whether to review following every observable history of rulings and dissents. However, despite this potential complexity, all equilibria (in the class we consider) take the following simple and easily interpretable form. All proofs are gathered in the supporting information.            "
"11","Lemma 1.All equilibria can be described by cutpoints , where  and . Each of L's and W's actions in equilibrium depend on whether the case facts fall to the left or right of their respective cutpoints. H's action—his choice of whether to review—depends on whether his cost of review falls above or below some threshold, the value of which is determined by whether or not W dissents. Specifically,                  "
"12","The form of the equilibria is depicted in Figure 1; for reference, we label the four key regions and refer to them below in the text. The structure of every equilibrium is summarized by four quantities . The lower court L rules conservatively when the facts are sufficiently conservative (Region 1, where ) and liberally otherwise (Regions 2–4, where ). When  (Region 1), their policy preferences would lead them to rule liberally, but they choose to comply with the higher court's preferences and rule conservatively. When  (Regions 2 and 3), they choose to rule liberally, thus issuing a noncompliant decision.         "
"13","In those noncompliant rulings where the facts are most conservative (Region 2, where ), the whistleblower dissents. This informs the higher court that noncompliance has occurred and provides some information about its severity, thereby incentivizing him to review whenever the cost of review k is less than the threshold . Finally, for the remainder of rulings where the noncompliance is less severe , the whistleblower does not report it. This silence leaves H uncertain about whether the ruling involved less severe noncompliance (i.e., the case is in Region 3) or was actually compliant (i.e., the case is in Region 4). He thus reviews only when the cost k is below some lower threshold .         "
"14","Before proceeding with the analysis, we emphasize that a player's strategy should not be interpreted as “choosing a cutpoint.” Rather, at the moment that each player makes their decision, they choose an optimal action given the observable history and their expectations about the other players' actions. The fact that these actions can be described by cutpoints is a consequence of equilibrium, not an assumption about the strategy space. For example, the whistleblower decides whether to dissent after observing the realization of the case facts x and L's ruling of  or . She does so based on her fixed expectations about the probability that dissenting will trigger a review, derived from the higher court's strategy. These incentives imply that her best responses can be described by a cutpoint  separating the liberal rulings on which she would dissent from those on which she would not.         "
"15","To characterize how these equilibrium cutpoints are jointly determined, we proceed as follows. In the remainder of this section, we characterize each player's best responses as a function of the others' strategies; this provides intuition for the basic incentives underlying equilibrium. In the subsequent section, we characterize equilibria, discuss important properties, and present our main results."
"16","We begin by examining the higher court's review decision conditional on L's and W's strategies and actions. H assesses the value of review by observing the ruling and whether W dissented, and then he updates his beliefs about the case facts based on L's and W's strategies and actions. In equilibrium, his review cutpoints  and  must equal these assessments.            "
"17","For strategy profiles of the form in Lemma 1, H's assessment of the benefit of reviewing a conservative ruling is straightforward to compute: there is none. Since L is more liberal than H, any case on which L is willing to rule conservatively  is also one for which H would prefer a conservative ruling . This is the “Nixon goes to China” result established in Cameron, Segal, and Songer (2000)—if a more extreme lower court reaches a conclusion that goes against the direction of their (relative) ideological bias, the higher court can be sure he would rule the same. Thus, H's best response is to not review any conservative rulings. Recall that the results are symmetric: a more liberal H responds identically to liberal decisions by a more conservative L.               "
"18","While H always agrees with L's conservative decisions, he may not always agree with L's liberal decisions. After liberal decisions, H's inferences are as follows. Consider first when L makes a liberal ruling that is accompanied by a dissent from W. In this circumstance, H can infer that the case facts are in .5 Intuitively, H knows that noncompliance occurred and that it was relatively severe, but he does not know the precise severity. Were he to review the case and learn the facts, he expects he would reverse the decision for sure and gain utility  (recall that the utility from an incorrect decision is  and from a correct one is ). His expected utility gain from review is therefore                  "
"19","When L rules liberally but W does not dissent, H must consider both the possibility that less severe noncompliance occurred  and that the case facts were sufficiently liberal that the ruling was actually compliant . If L indeed failed to comply, then as before H's gain from review is , since he would discover the noncompliance upon review and reverse the ruling. However, if the ruling was actually compliant, then upon review H would make no change to the disposition; the gain from review would be 0 but he would have paid the cost k of reviewing. His expected utility gain from review is therefore:                  "
"20","The effect of dissent on the higher court's beliefs is both to raise the probability that noncompliance occurred from  to 1, and to shift the possible case facts to the left from the interval  to the interval . Together, these updates increase the court's expected gain to review from  to . However, because the higher court's opportunity cost of review is probabilistic and unknown to L and W, this increase does not generate review with certainty. Instead, it increases the likelihood of review from  to ; in particular, when , H will only review if there is a dissent. Moreover, although dissent always increases the probability of review, the exact increase depends on the frequency of dissent (i.e. the location of ) via its influence on H's beliefs about the expected gain from review.               "
"21","An important feature of the model is that dissenting on a larger set of cases (i.e., a higher ) reduces the likelihood of review following a dissent. The reason is this: although W dissents only when noncompliance has actually occurred, she could be dissenting on a wider set of cases, including some with relatively mild noncompliance, or only on a narrow set of cases with relatively severe noncompliance. When W dissents more, the higher court's expected gain from review following dissent  is lower because the additional cases on which W is dissenting are those for which the noncompliance is least severe. This translates into a lower equilibrium probability of review following dissent. We summarize these results in the following lemma:                  "
"22","Lemma 2.In a best response, the higher court                        "
"23","Moreover, the higher court's probability of review following a dissent  is strictly decreasing in the whistleblower's dissent cutpoint .                     "
"24","We now consider the incentives of the whistleblower. In our model, the whistleblower dissents to persuade the higher court to review and reverse a noncompliant liberal ruling. Consequently, she will never dissent from a liberal ruling on cases  where the higher court also prefers the liberal disposition, since he will never reverse them. On cases where the higher court would reverse a liberal ruling upon review (), the whistleblower would realize a net gain of  if she succeeded in inducing a review; this is the utility gain from reversing a noncompliant liberal disposition, less W's share of the sanctioning cost that falls on the lower court upon reversal. W's dissent will succeed in inducing a review that would otherwise have not occurred when , that is, when the higher court's cost of review falls between his threshold for reviewing a liberal ruling absent a dissent and with a dissent. Thus, W will find it worthwhile to dissent when               "
"25","Lemma 3.When , the whistleblower's best response is to dissent if and only if , where                     "
"26","The whistleblower's dissent behavior in a best response therefore takes the form of a cutpoint  that has intuitive properties. First, it increases (i.e., leads to more dissents) both as W becomes more conservative and as the probability that dissent is pivotal  increases. Second, it decreases (i.e., leads to fewer dissents) both as W 's share of the reversal sanction α rises, and as the cost of dissent d grows.            "
"27","Finally, we examine the calculus of the lower court. For L, the benefit of noncompliance on a case  is obtaining the liberal outcome. The cost is the risk of review, which reverses this outcome and generates a sanction of cost ε. A key component of their decision is therefore the likelihood of review. If this were some fixed probability q, then the gain from noncompliance would be  (the probability of no review times the gain from a liberal ruling), and the cost would be  (the probability of review times the sanctioning cost). In a best response, L would rule noncompliantly whenever x is greater than               "
"28","However, the probability of review of a liberal disposition is not fixed; it is determined by the whistleblower's dissent behavior. Specifically, the probability of review is  on those cases where the whistleblower would dissent (), and  on those cases where the whistleblower would not dissent (). Hence, from the perspective of the lower court, the case space can be divided into three regions, as shown in Figure 2:            "
"29","               "
"30","The middle region (Region B) comprises the set of cases on which the whistleblower's threat of dissent can induce compliance by L. Outside of this region, the lower court prefers to either comply (Region A) or risk reversal (Region C) regardless of whether the whistleblower will dissent. Consequently, the lower court's best‐response behavior is as follows.               "
"31","Lemma 4.In a best response, the lower court L uses the cutpoint 8                                          "
"32","We now characterize equilibria of the model and present our main results. Formally, an equilibrium requires that the higher court, whistleblower, and lower court be jointly best‐responding to each other's strategies. That is,            "
"33","Lemma 5.Cutpoints  are an equilibrium i.f.f. they satisfy Lemmas 2–4.               "
"34","In the remainder of this section, we provide a more precise characterization of the equilibria by solving for cutpoints that jointly satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions. In doing so, we describe equilibrium patterns of behavior and derive comparative statics. To identify these cutpoints, we proceed in two steps. First, we fix the whistleblower's cutpoint  and characterize how that fixed level of dissent affects the equilibrium incentives of the lower and higher courts. Formally, we characterize the unique partial equilibrium level of compliance by the lower court  when it and the higher court are jointly best‐responding to each other and to . Second, we use this characterization to solve for equilibrium values of the whistleblower's dissent cutpoint .         "
"35","To characterize how the whistleblower's cutpoint  affects the lower court's equilibrium level of compliance , we employ two benchmark results. Both benchmarks consider a two‐player game played only between the lower and higher courts. In the first, the higher court has no information about the case facts (as in the main model). In the second, the higher court has complete information about the case facts. Since the function of the whistleblower is to provide the higher court with information about the case facts, these benchmarks allow us to understand her contribution to the informational and strategic environment.            "
"36","In the no information benchmark, H reviews solely on the basis of his beliefs about how much the lower court is complying with his preferences. In this game (as in the main model), L complies if and only if the case facts fall below some equilibrium cutpoint, which we denote . This cutpoint is defined by the equality  because the higher court's beliefs about the benefits of review absent the whistleblower are equal to what her beliefs  would be in the presence of a whistleblower who never dissents.            "
"37","In the complete information benchmark, the higher court already knows the case facts and does not need to review to learn them; thus, the only purpose of review is to provide the opportunity to reverse a ruling known to be noncompliant. Again, L's decision to comply is based on an equilibrium cutpoint, which we denote . This cutpoint is defined by the equality , because when the whistleblower uses cutpoint , a dissent perfectly reveals that the case facts are exactly at .            "
"38","We can now use these two benchmarks to identify the whistleblower's contribution to the strategic environment in the following proposition:               "
"39","Proposition 1.The lower and higher court's joint best‐response behavior as a function of the whistleblower's dissent cutpoint  is characterized by three nonempty regions defined by the cutpoints , which are both strictly interior to .                     "
"40","The three panels in Figure 3 depict the effect of the whistleblower's dissent cutpoint  on equilibrium levels of compliance, dissent, and review behavior. Specifically, Figure 3A shows its effect on L's equilibrium compliance ; Figure 3B shows its effect on W's probability of dissent ; and Figure 3C depicts its effect on H's probability of review after dissent .            "
"41","The Effect of the Whistleblower's Dissent Cutpoint cW on (A) Compliance, (B) Dissenting, and (C) Review Behavior                        "
"42","Note: In each panel, Regions I and II are separated by , which is the cutpoint that the lower court would use if the higher court had no information about the case facts (in a game played just between L and H), and Regions II and III are separated by , which is the cutpoint the lower court would use if the higher court were fully informed about the case facts.                        "
"43","There are three key regions, separated by the cutpoints  and  from the two benchmarks. Beginning with L's compliance behavior, in the leftmost region (Region I, ) there are no whistleblower effects on compliance by the lower court—it complies to the same degree it would absent the whistleblower in the no information benchmark. The reason is that all cases on which the whistleblower would dissent  are also ones where the lower court would comply absent the threat of dissent . Consequently, in this region the probability of dissent is zero and the probability of review after a dissent is constant.10"
"44","In sharp contrast, the middle region (Region II, ) exhibits full whistleblower effects. Here, the lower court avoids dissent by complying exactly on those cases  on which the whistleblower would dissent. Thus, L's compliance is increasing in the whistleblower's cutpoint, whereas the probability of review after a dissent is decreasing. The probability of dissent remains zero, and no actual dissents are observed in equilibrium.            "
"45","The rightmost region (Region III, ) exhibits partial and diminishing whistleblower effects. Here, the threat of dissent still induces the lower court to comply more than it would absent the threat —this can be seen by comparing compliance in Regions I and III. However, on some cases for which L values the liberal ruling sufficiently highly , it chooses not to comply even knowing that a dissent will be triggered. Thus, dissents are observed in equilibrium, and the probability of a dissent is increasing in the whistleblower's cutpoint. More interestingly, within this region, more dissenting by W (i.e., a greater ) has the counterproductive effect of diminishing W's influence on the lower court and generating even less compliance (i.e., a lower ). This demonstrates that there is a “limit to dissent” as a tool for effectuating compliance by a lower court.            "
"46","The preceding observations have surprising implications for how a whistleblower's behavior affects compliance by a lower court.               "
"47","Corollary 1.When the lower and higher courts are jointly best‐responding, the whistleblowing cutpoint  that maximizes the lower court's compliance is equal to .                  "
"48","Why is reporting of noncompliance on cases beyond  not only ineffective for inducing additional compliance, but also increasingly counterproductive? Because there is always a chance that the cost of review will be too high for the higher court to review, there is an upper bound on how much the lower court can ever be induced to comply—this upper bound is , or the cutpoint from the complete information benchmark. For cases to the right of this cutpoint, the lower court would risk escaping reversal by the higher court even if H had complete information about the case facts, because of the possibility that review would be too costly to be worthwhile. When W dissents on cases to the right of this cutpoint (i.e., when , L simply cannot be pushed to comply more. As a result, the only effect of this additional dissenting is to diminish the informational value of dissent by lumping more severe instances of noncompliance together with less severe instances. As characterized in the next subsection, this lowers H's equilibrium beliefs about the expected severity of noncompliance upon observing a dissent (i.e., a lower ), which causes H to respond to dissents less (i.e., a lower ) and ultimately results in less compliance by the lower court in equilibrium (i.e., a lower ).            "
"49","The fact that frequent dissenters are less effective is well understood by members of the judiciary—for example, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has warned of the “danger of crying wolf too often” (Ginsburg 1990, 142), and Justice Harlan Stone wrote to Karl Lewellyn, “If I should write in every case where I do not agree with some of the views expressed in the opinions, you and all my other friends would stop reading them” (Murphy 1964, 62). Our model, however, demonstrates a previously unidentified implication of this effect; excessively frequent dissenting can actually reduce compliance by a lower court. The reason is that whistleblowers have both an ex ante and ex post effect on judicial outcomes. Ex post, their dissents increase the probability of review. Ex ante, the threat of their dissents increases the lower court's incentive to comply. If a whistleblower excessively “squander[s] the ammunition of dissent” (Llewellyn, Gewirtz, and Ansaldi 1988, 1000, fn. 10), she can dilute the effectiveness of that ammunition so much that a lower court is more willing to rule noncompliantly and risk review. Formally, increasing the whistleblowing cutpoint above  (i.e., to the right in our model) leads to a concomitant shift in  toward less compliance (i.e., to the left). Substantively, when “friends” (i.e., judges with similar preferences) stop reading dissents, “enemies” will be able to ignore whistleblowers' threats.            "
"50","Having characterized how the whistleblower's dissent behavior affects the lower court's equilibrium level of compliance , we now complete the analysis. Specifically, we first characterize equilibrium values of the whistleblower's dissent cutpoint , then describe when the whistleblower's presence will affect the lower court's equilibrium compliance behavior, and finally derive comparative statics in the whistleblower's parameters.               "
"51","Proposition 2.Equilibria always exist and satisfy the following:                     "
"52","A pair of cutpoints  are an equilibrium i.f.f.  and                              "
"53","There exists an equilibrium that exhibits whistleblower effects  i.f.f.                              "
"54","Proposition 2 does not rule out multiple equilibria, which complicates deriving comparative statics. Intuitively, the reason is that dissenting beyond the limit to compliance  can be self‐reinforcing; by decreasing the lower court's compliance, such dissents also increase the higher court's responsiveness to dissent, and consequently the whistleblower's willingness to dissent. However, because our emphasis is on how much compliance can be achieved, for the remaining analysis we select the equilibrium in which the maximum level of compliance is sustained; we denote this quantity .12 This selection reflects a broader normative interest in institutional arrangements that align the rulings of lower courts with the preferences of higher courts.               "
"55","We now describe how maximum equilibrium compliance changes as a function of the parameters directly affecting the whistleblower's willingness to dissent.                  "
"56","Lemma 6.Maximum equilibrium compliance  exhibits three consecutive regions as a function of the three parameters that directly affect the whistleblower's willingness to dissent: her conservatism W, the cost of dissent d, and her share of the reversal sanction α. These regions mirror the regions associated with  in Proposition 1.                     "
"57","Thus, the effects of W, d, and α on maximum equilibrium compliance  are essentially identical to the effect of the whistleblower's cutpoint  on partial equilibrium compliance . The comparative statics all exhibit three consecutive regions: one with no whistleblower effects, followed by a region with full whistleblower effects, followed by a region with partial and diminishing whistleblower effects. These results are illustrated in Figure 4, which is based on a numerical example with , , , , , , and . Figure 4A depicts how the maximum equilibrium compliance varies as W becomes more conservative. Initially, W has no effect on L 's cutpoint, and thus there are no whistleblower effects (i.e., ). Then a more conservative whistleblower increases compliance until it reaches the compliance limit (), at which point increasing W lowers . Figures 4B and 4C depict a similar effect of increasing either the cost of dissent (d) or the whistleblower's share of the reversal sanction (α). Note that the order of the regions is reversed for the share of the sanction and the cost of dissent, since increasing either decreases the whistleblower's willingness to dissent.               "
"58","The Maximum Level of Compliance, as a Function of (A) the Whistleblower's Conservatism, (B) the Cost of Dissent, and (C) W's Share of the Reversal Sanction                           "
"59","Note: We assume , , , , , , and , except we allow the latter three to vary in their respective plots. The dashed horizontal lines depict  and .                           "
"60","To conclude our analysis, we consider the ideal whistleblower from the perspective of the higher court. An influential organizing idea in the study of principal‐agent relationships is the ally principle, which states that “a principal is made best off by appointing as his or her agent the individual whose preferences over outcomes are most similar to those of the principal” (Gailmard and Patty 2012, 367). In our model, the ally principle clearly applies to the relationship between the higher court and the lower court—an L who is identical to H would always comply. However, we show in this subsection that it does not generally hold with respect to the relationship between the higher court and whistleblowers.            "
"61","To understand what type of whistleblower the higher court would want in terms of preferences (i.e., W), we must first examine the higher court's preferences over the whistleblower's cutpoint (i.e., ). These preferences are determined by two factors—his desire for accurate information about the severity of noncompliance (to minimize wasteful reviews), and his desire for the threat of dissent to induce compliance. However, Proposition 1 implies that these two considerations are at odds: when the whistleblower's cutpoint is above the limit to compliance (i.e., ), better information about the severity of noncompliance comes at the cost of further reducing the effectiveness of dissent for inducing compliance. This trade‐off generates the following result about the higher court's preferences over the whistleblower's dissent cutpoint.               "
"62","Lemma 7.When the lower and higher courts are jointly best‐responding, the whistleblowing cutpoint  that maximizes the higher court's expected utility is strictly less than H and weakly greater than .                  "
"63","The higher court thus never prefers that the whistleblower fully report all instances of noncompliance. For many parameter values (including our numerical examples), the negative effect of whistleblowing beyond  on the lower court's compliance is so severe that the higher court actually prefers the whistleblower to report noncompliance only up to .            "
"64","What type of whistleblower would engage in such optimal intermediate whistleblowing? In general, it is not a perfect ally of the higher court, in the sense of preferences. Why? Unlike in many setting where costs are shared between principals and agents, in the judicial setting whistleblowers have the following three properties. First, they alone pay the costs of issuing dissents. Second, they also may suffer some of the reversal costs that fall on the lower court. And third, they are spared the higher court's cost of wasteful reviews. For example, a whistleblower who shares H's preferences but for whom dissent is cheap will generally dissent too much because she does not suffer H's costs of review.            "
"65","More surprisingly, however, the ally principle fails in our model even when the whistleblower's and higher court's costs and benefits are perfectly aligned.               "
"66","Lemma 8.When dissent and reversal are costless for the whistleblower, and the whistleblower internalizes the higher court's cost of review, the higher court's expected utility is maximized by a whistleblower whose preferences are strictly less than H.                  "
"67","As described above, judges themselves do indicate a concern with the broader consequences of dissenting too much. However, it is unclear whether they can mitigate their incentives to do so by “tying their own hands.” Although outside the scope of our model, the repeated interactions that occur between higher courts and potential whistleblowers may provide one solution to this problem: judges may be able to develop a reputation for only whistleblowing in egregious instances of noncompliance.            "
"68","Like all hierarchical organizations, the judicial hierarchy is replete with informational asymmetries. Our model puts these asymmetries front and center to understand how judges and external actors can simultaneously help higher courts with limited resources decide which cases to review ex post, and affect compliance by a lower court ex ante. Our main insights are twofold. First, we show that informativeness of a fire alarm to a higher court is decreasing in its frequency; intuitively, the signal of a whistleblower who saves her warnings for more egregious instances of noncompliance will be more useful to a higher court, ex post, because it seeks information that helps it conserve scarce resources. Second, we show that the decreasing impact of whistleblowing, ex post, can eventually result in less compliance by a lower court ex ante. Our results thus illustrate the importance of identifying and connecting the ex ante and ex post effects of potential whistleblowers. This observation surely applies to organizations more generally, and further theoretical and empirical analysis would add to our understanding of how whistleblowers influence decision making in hierarchical institutions.         "
"69","Once we consider the fact that higher courts oversee a number of lower courts and potential whistleblowers with varying preferences and incentives, our model helps us to understand a set of key empirical regularities about the federal judicial hierarchy. First, considering judges themselves as potential whistleblowers, our model illustrates how ideological heterogeneity and the institution of dissent interact to create panel effects on the Court of Appeals. In particular, the model provides an internally consistent explanation for why potential dissenters can sometimes change the votes of their colleagues, but other times fail to do so and must act on their threat to dissent."
"70","Second, when dissents or other whistles are blown, they do increase the likelihood of discretionary review, but review is far from guaranteed. For instance, the presence of a dissent or amicus brief increases the likelihood that the Supreme Court will review a case, but many such cases are nevertheless not reviewed. This, too, is consistent with our model—even when the higher court is sure that it disagrees with a decision, in some cases it will not find it worthwhile to review the decision."
"71","Third, the effectiveness of the threat of dissent is a function of how often a potential whistleblower is actually willing to dissent. Thus, our model also illuminates why interest groups and the solicitor general are more effective at getting the Supreme Court to review lower court cases, relative to judges themselves. Because both interest groups' amici briefs at the certiorari stage and petitions by the solicitor general are relatively rare (compared to the hundreds of dissents issued by Courts of Appeals judges in any given year), such signals are likely to be highly informative to the Supreme Court.13"
"72","Fourth, our model provides a rationale for the relative differences in the cost of sounding a fire alarm across legal actors. In the supporting information (section SI‐2), we present an institutional design analysis in which we characterize how the parameters in the whistleblower's utility function—including the cost of dissent and its share of the reversal sanction—would be chosen to maximize the impact of whistleblowing on compliance. We show that preserving the informational quality of dissents from external whistleblowers who do not suffer any reversal sanction requires higher dissent costs than preserving the informational quality of internal whistleblowers who do suffer such costs. This result helps us to understand why sounding fire alarms is costlier for actors who are not judges, such as interest groups filing amici briefs, than for judges themselves (i.e., to write dissents)."
"73","Finally, taking a step back, most decisions by lower courts are not accompanied by fire alarms. For example, the dissent rate on the Courts of Appeals is usually less than 10%. Our model suggests an explanation for this—fire alarms are only observed when the whistleblower's excessive willingness to sound them diminishes their effectiveness so thoroughly that a lower court is willing to risk triggering them.         "
"74","In addition to unifying existing empirical patterns, our model also generates nonobvious empirical implications about the relationship between judicial preferences, dissents, and higher court review. Existing work on strategic dissents on the Courts of Appeals theorizes that the likelihood of a dissent on a three‐judge panel should be an increasing function of the distance between the potential whistleblower and the reviewing court; a perfect ally should be most likely to dissent (Blackstone and Collins 2011; Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek 2004). However, as seen in Figure 3B, our model predicts that the likelihood of a dissent should continue to increase as the whistleblower becomes even further away from the lower court majority than the higher court, ceteris paribus. These divergent predictions could be adjudicated with existing databases of judicial decision making (e.g., the Songer database) and current measures of judicial ideology (e.g., Giles‐Hettinger‐Peppers [2001] scores).         "
"75","With respect to higher court review, the related empirical prediction is that the likelihood of higher court review following a dissent should be decreasing in the preference extremity of a whistleblower, ceteris paribus (see Figure 3C). In other words, a conservative higher court should be more likely to review a liberal decision accompanied by a dissent from a more liberal judge than from a more conservative judge. While existing studies of discretionary review have emphasized the importance of dissent (see, e.g., Caldeira, Wright, and Zorn 1999; Perry 1991), the importance of who is doing the dissenting has been under appreciated. Empirical tests along these lines would add more to our understanding of how the influence of whistleblowing extends throughout the judicial hierarchy.         "
"76","Finally, our predictions about the relationship between the preferences of a whistleblower and compliance are quite subtle. As seen in Figure 4A, there is a non‐monotonic relationship between the ideology of a potential whistleblower and lower court compliance. While measuring compliance is difficult, our model can be tested using the votes of a lower court (combined with measures of preferences of judges across the hierarchy). Our model suggests that as a whistleblower moves further away from the lower court majority in the direction of a more conservative (liberal) higher court, the likelihood of a conservative (liberal) vote by the majority should first increase, but then eventually decrease. It is unlikely that this prediction would emerge outside a formal analysis of whistleblowing in the judicial hierarchy.         "
