"1","Given the myriad political contests and complex issues in politics, it is no surprise that many voters try to free ride and use the information gathered by their more politically engaged friends. Even the engaged will learn about various candidates from their associates (Katz 1957). Individuals receive information from the media and reach conclusions about the state of the economy, the competency of candidates, and other factors that influence vote decisions. These evaluations serve as their judgmental priors that are then updated based on the messages they receive from their discussion networks. The final judgment, therefore, is a combination of the messages individuals receive from the media and from their discussion partners (Barabas 2004).         "
"2","Several formal models are helpful for understanding how individuals should incorporate socially acquired information (e.g., Jackman and Sniderman 2006; Lupia and McCubbins 1998). Since discussion does not affect the benefits candidates will offer voters, political discussion is a form of cheap talk, and information is best trusted when both members of a discussion dyad share preferences (Crawford and Sobel 1982). The best informant will report the same information the individual would have reported if the roles had been reversed. This is most likely under the condition of shared preferences. Further, informants with different preferences have an incentive to provide information that is not only skewed, but also intentionally inaccurate (Boudreau 2009). Even if they are not purposefully dissembling to gain a strategic advantage, information from partisan discussion partners may reflect their own partisan biases (Bartels 2002). These models imply a proposition about the source of information to which individuals are receptive:         "
"3","            "
"4","H1 (In‐party message acceptance hypothesis): When an individual makes a vote choice, she incorporates only information sent by a member of her own party.                  "
"5","How the biases affect an individual listener will depend on the expertise of the listener. An informed listener does not need social information to make a correct decision. The informed should have enough information to vote correctly, and additional information can only harm the process (Lupia and McCubbins 1998). The truly uninformed are the most in need of social information, but they are also the most vulnerable to voting against their interests (Jackman and Sniderman 2006). It is paramount, therefore, that the uninformed identify a speaker's biases and incorporate only information from those with similar biases.2 This leads to the following proposition:         "
"6","            "
"7","H2 (Uninformed are aided hypothesis): When making a vote choice, a poorly informed individual benefits from social information, but only if the information is from a member of his own party (or in the case of an independent, from another independent).                  "
"8","The previously discussed models treat political discussion as a purely dyadic process, but social information is not typically sent in isolation as each person receives messages from several different people. From a strict rational choice perspective, this should not matter as each message could be evaluated on a case‐by‐case basis and the listener could still reject any messages sent by someone with different political viewpoints. This further assumes, however, that a listener chooses which messages to accept and reject based on who sent the messages."
"9","I argue that individuals do not behave as the formal models would suggest—i.e., they do not evaluate incoming messages based on the messenger's biases and incentives. Instead, listeners choose which messages to accept and reject based on the content of the messages. For this reason, this article differs from previous models and makes an important distinction between dyadic interactions and discussion with a larger social network. According to an autoregressive influence theory (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004), individuals accept messages when those messages are in accord with other messages that are received. Individuals, therefore, should be most likely to support the candidate favored by the majority of the people with whom they discuss politics even if those people support a different party.         "
"10","Why would subjects accept messages from multiple opposing partisans and ignore messages from a single member of the other party? Many individuals will view two or more people providing similar information to be verification of those messages. If information sources are largely unbiased, then this would be a rational strategy. However, if social messages are biased and both discussion partners have the same preferences, then a biased message is “verified” by a source with the same bias.3 Thus, it is not really verified at all, but it may be incorporated into the posterior judgments because it has been corroborated by another source—albeit an untrustworthy source. The individual should ignore this social information, but may believe the messages because they all suggest the same vote. This suggests a proposition contrary to the in‐party message acceptance hypothesis:         "
"11","            "
"12","H3 (Autoregressive influence hypothesis): An individual is more likely to vote incorrectly when she receives social information primarily from members of a different party than when she receives information primarily from fellow partisans.                  "
"13","This hypothesis implicitly suggests that the formal models are correct in explaining how voters should respond to social communication. Voters do not act, however, as the formal models suggest. Because of this, discussion may decrease the probability that a person votes correctly.         "
"14","Research related to discussion and “correct” voting has been limited in part because of the method typically used to study voting behavior—analysis of survey data. It is difficult for a researcher examining real‐world political behavior to determine whether someone made a “correct vote” choice because the researcher cannot objectively determine whom a voter should have supported. Lau and Redlawsk (1997; see also Lau, Andersen, and Redlawsk 2008) developed a creative means for using surveys to determine correct voting based on the following three factors: (1) whether the voter chose the candidate with similar issue positions, (2) whether the voter chose the candidate who is more closely linked to the voter's social group, and (3) the mean job performance rating of the incumbent if there is an incumbent.         "
"15","Using Lau and Redlawsk's (1997) method, Sokhey and McClurg (n.d.) conclude that people are more likely to vote correctly if they speak exclusively with like‐minded individuals.4 The cross‐sectional nature of their data, however, makes it difficult for them to show the persuasion process (Kenny 1998). They do not observe who the voters would have chosen in the absence of discussion, and they cannot evaluate whom the discussion helped and whom it hurt.         "
"16","When voting correctly is defined as voting for the candidate with similar issue positions, then partisans should almost always vote for the candidate from their party. However, Stokes (1963) recognizes that candidates can provide two types of benefits to voters: global benefits on valence issues and partisan benefits on positional issues. Valence issues are consensual issues in which all voters desire the same outcome—e.g., a government that is not corrupt and provides peace and prosperity.5 Positional issues are divisive issues for which voters have different preferred policies. If a candidate lacks the competency to provide for the general social welfare (i.e., offers low global benefits), even a strong partisan with very similar issue positions might vote for the candidate from the other party.         "
"17","This article defines correct voting as voting for the candidate who offers the greater total benefit, taking into account both valence and position issues. This definition of correct voting rests on several simplifying assumptions. First, it assumes that a candidate provides an objective valence benefit. In fact, it may be that the valence benefit is based on voter values and is subjective as well (Gerber and Green 1999). For example, one voter may value providing the best average welfare while another may care more about raising the lowest level of welfare experienced in the society. These differences in values, however, should be captured by differences in position benefits.         "
"18","Second, this definition of correct voting assumes that voters have true, fixed issue positions—potentially including indifference. In reality, voters may change their opinion in the course of a campaign. Even if they hold the same issue positions throughout the campaign, they may reevaluate which issues are important, which may change the value of the benefits offered on positional issues. This also could change which members of the social network have similar preferences to the voter (Baldassarri and Bearman 2007). This assumption, however, is necessary to evaluate a correct vote. Without this assumption, it is impossible to tell when a voter was duped into voting in favor of someone else's interests instead of her own and when she rationally updated her opinions.         "
"19","The specific hypotheses proposed here are best tested through an experimental research design for four reasons. First, there is no way to measure objectively the valence benefit that candidates will offer in real‐world politics. Second, one has to see whom a voter would have chosen in the absence of discussion to determine whether and how that discussion influenced his vote choice. Third, the researcher needs to observe what social information the voter received and who sent those messages. Fourth, an experiment allows for assignment to social networks answering the common critique that contextual results are simply selection effects (Achen and Shivley 1995).         "
"20","To test the effects of interpersonal communication on correct voting, I employ a small group experiment in which subjects in a treatment group receive private information about two computer‐generated “candidates” and then share information with other subjects before voting for one of the two. The subjects—135 in all—were recruited from undergraduate political science courses at the University of California, Davis. A follow‐up experiment—to be described later—yields a control group by giving 81 subjects private information but not allowing any communication among them.6 Subjects in both experiments received a $10 show‐up fee plus whatever earnings they accrued during the experiment. The experiments were programmed using zTree—software for designing experiments in behavioral economics (Fischbacher 2007).7"
"21","Parties and Candidates The experimental design randomly assigns subjects their partisan affiliation: party A, party B, or independent. Subjects attempt to determine the benefits offered by computer‐generated “candidates” of the parties—named Adams and Bates, respectively—in a mock election. There are nine subjects participating in each experimental session: three in A, three in B, and three independents. In each session, subjects participate in multiple periods, each of which is a unique election with different global benefits and partisan payoffs. The subjects’ characteristics—e.g., their partisanship and information levels—do not change.            "
"22","At the end of each experimental period, each subject is told to vote for the candidate she believes will provide her with the larger payoff. Typically, this will be a candidate from the subject's party, but on occasion a subject will receive a larger payoff from the other party's candidate."
"23","Global Benefits Much like candidates in a real election, the candidates offer subjects two types of benefits. First, candidates provide a global benefit that is the same for all subjects and can be conceived as the benefit a candidate provides on valence issues. The global benefit provided by each candidate is independently and randomly drawn from a uniform distribution with a lower bound of 20 Experimental Currency Units (ECUs) and an upper bound of 100 ECUs.8 Subjects receive the global benefit offered by the candidate who received the most votes from the nine subjects.            "
"24","Partisan Payoffs In addition to the global benefits, subjects in parties A and B receive either a party bonus or penalty depending on the outcome of the election. These are akin to the benefits candidates provide on positional issues. If Adams wins the election, members of party A receive a bonus while B partisans receive a penalty—vice versa if Bates wins the election. The magnitude of both an individual's partisan bonus and her partisan penalty is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution with a minimum of 10 ECUs and a maximum of 20 ECUs. On average, (1) subjects in party A are better off if Adams is elected and subjects in party B are better off if Bates is elected, and (2) independents are indifferent between Adams and Bates.9"
"25","Timeline of the Experiment Each subject is aware of the distribution from which each candidate's global benefit is drawn and of her individual party payoff, but she does not know any candidate's global benefit in a particular election. The subjects must use private and social information to estimate the candidates’ global benefits. The experiment proceeds over the following four stages:            "
"26","Stage 1 (Private Information Stage): Each subject receives private information about each candidate's global benefit and then makes an initial estimate of the candidates’ global benefits.            "
"27","Stage 2 (First Social Information Stage): Subjects send messages about the size of candidates’ global benefits to one another. They update their estimates of the candidates’ global benefits.            "
"28","Stage 3 (Second Social Information Stage): Subjects again send messages about the size of candidates’ global benefits to one another. They again update their estimates of the candidates’ global benefits.            "
"29","Stage 4 (Voting and Payoffs): Each of the nine subjects then votes for a candidate, and the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner. Subjects are then paid based on the benefits offered by the candidate who receives the most votes. Although subjects are not paid based on whether they voted correctly, a correct vote increases the probability that a subject will be paid more.            "
"30","Stage 1 (Private Information Stage): As displayed in Table 1A, subjects are randomly assigned to one of five different information conditions, each defined by the number of signals (or pieces of information) subjects receive about the candidates, where a signal consists of information about both candidates. Therefore, if a subject receives two signals that means the subject sees two signals about Adams’ benefit and two signals about Bates’ benefit. The subjects remain in the same information condition throughout the experiment.            "
"31","In each condition, one subject receives four signals, and the other eight subjects are evenly divided over the four remaining information levels: three signals, two signals, one signal, or zero. The top row of the table identifies the subjects by their partisan status—A, B, or independent (I)—and a unique participant identification number (1 through 9). Each column displays the number of signals a participant receives in each of the information conditions."
"32","For each signal, the computer screen displays, “Candidate Adams/Bates says his benefit is:” and then an integer value. The integer values are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution centered on the candidate's true benefit and extending 25 ECUs above and below that benefit.10 Thus, on average, the private information received by subjects reflects candidates’ true global benefits, but the information is noisy.            "
"33","After receiving private information, each subject is asked to estimate the global benefit that each candidate provides. These estimates measure subjects’ beliefs prior to social communication."
"34","Stage 2 (Social Information Stage): Next, each subject sends a message conveying information about the candidates to three other subjects: one from party A, one from party B, and one independent. Once again, the messages are integer values asserting the size of the global benefit each candidate offers. No other communication is allowed. Subjects are told that they do not have to make identical assertions to each subject, but they are not encouraged to misrepresent their beliefs. Subjects may make assertions strategically, however, because they know the private information level and partisanship of each subject.11"
"35","Subjects receive social information from the networks listed in Table 1B. Networks in this experiment take on one of three types: heterogeneous, homogeneous A, and homogeneous B. In heterogeneous networks, there is one member of each party and one independent. In homogeneous networks, there are two members of either party A or party B and an independent. Partisan subjects, therefore, may receive messages from a majority of like‐minded subjects (an ingroup network), a heterogeneous network, or a network without any subjects who share their biases (an outgroup network).12"
"36","After receiving social information, subjects again estimate the candidates’ benefits. They are reminded of their previous estimates of Adams’ and Bates’ global benefits, thus permitting subjects to update their estimates based on the new information they received."
"37","Stage 3 (Second Social Information Stage): Subjects convey new assertions about candidates’ global benefits to the same three subjects to whom they previously provided information. This allows individuals to incorporate information they received through social communication in addition to the private information they initially received. Subjects are reminded of their previous estimates of global benefits and asked to make a final estimate of the benefit each candidate provides.            "
"38","Stage 4 (Voting and Payoffs): After making this final estimate, subjects vote for their preferred candidate. The outcome of the election is revealed to the subjects, as is the true global benefit of each candidate. The global benefit of the winning candidate is awarded to each subject (partisan or independent). In addition, each member of the winning candidate's party is awarded her previously established partisan bonus, and similarly, each member of the losing candidate's party is docked his penalty amount.            "
"39","Subjects then participate in a new campaign with new, randomly drawn candidate benefits. The subjects’ parties, partisan pay, information levels, and networks remain the same throughout the experiment. Subjects participate in as many elections as they can complete within one hour.13"
"40","The Control Group After completing the main treatment, a follow‐up experiment was conducted to create a control group. The experimental software was programmed based on the randomly drawn benefits and signals from the treatment session. Therefore, subjects in this control group participate in elections with candidates offering the same benefits and sending the exact same signals as in the initial experiment.14 The subjects in the control group, however, receive private information, estimate the candidates’ benefits, and then vote without ever exchanging messages with their fellow subjects. Hence, for each of the treatment subjects, there is a control subject who received the exact same private information and then voted based solely on that information. The votes of these treatment and control subjects can be directly compared to assess the value of the social information.            "
"41","Treatment subjects vary on two main dimensions: the amount of private information they possess and the partisanship of the network that provides social information. For simplification, I divide subjects into the uninformed (those who receive zero signals) and the informed (those who receive at least one signal) because the marginal value of additional information after the first signal is small.15 Subjects’ networks can be characterized as ingroup, outgroup, or heterogeneous based on the partisanship of the subject and the network.         "
"42","The design allows for both between‐subjects and within‐subjects tests of the hypotheses. The between‐subjects tests compare the votes of the main treatment group to the votes of the control group. The subjects in both control and treatment groups have the same private information. Hence, differences in vote decisions between the control and treatment group should capture the effect of social communication.         "
"43","The within‐subjects tests involve the treatment subjects’ initial estimates of the global benefits. I assume that if subjects had voted after receiving private information but before receiving any social information, each subject would have chosen the candidate that maximized her payoff based on her known party pay and her beliefs about the global benefits. This yields an implied vote in the absence of social information for each subject, which can be compared to the subject's actual vote to determine the effect of social information on her decision.16"
"44","            "
"45","H1 (In‐party message acceptance hypothesis). If this hypothesis is supported, then control and treatment subjects should vote for the same candidates except when the treatment subject receives messages from someone in their party. In the within‐subjects analyses, the only subjects who should have final votes different from implied votes are those who received messages from someone in their party.                  "
"46","H2 (Uninformed are aided hypothesis). Based on this hypothesis, uninformed treatment subjects who receive social information predominantly from members of their own party should vote correctly more often than uninformed control subjects. In within‐subjects analyses of those who are uninformed and receive social information from a member of their own party, the percentage of actual votes that are correct should be greater than the percentage of implied votes that are correct.                  "
"47","H3 (Autoregressive influence hypothesis): This hypothesis implies that treatment subjects in heterogeneous and outgroup networks should vote correctly less often than control subjects. Also, these treatment subjects’ implied votes should be correct more frequently than their actual votes.                  "
"48","If social information serves as a useful information short‐cut, then subjects in the treatment group (those who received social information) should vote correctly more frequently than subjects in the control group (those who did not receive social information). One might expect that uninformed subjects would benefit the most from social information. Informed subjects should already be voting correctly at high levels, making it less likely that they would improve their level of correct voting."
"49","Figure 1 compares the percentage of correct votes in the control and treatment groups by information level and network partisanship. The light‐colored bars in Figure 1 show the proportion of correct votes in the control group. The darker bars show the percentage of correct votes in the treatment group. Control group subjects are not located in networks as they did not receive social information. Thus, for control groups, the networks refer to the network of the paired treatment subject who received the same private information.         "
"50","                Percentage of Correct Votes for Control and Treatment Groups by Information Level and Network Partisanship. Error Bars Display 95% Confidence Intervals with Standard Errors Corrected for Clustering on Subjects"
"51","The results support the uninformed are aided hypothesis (H2), but only for independents. As the left panel in Figure 1B shows, 46% of uninformed independents vote correctly in the control group. The percent of uninformed independents who vote correctly rises to 69% in the treatment group. A t‐test comparing those percentages shows a statistically significant difference (t = 3.45; p = .002).17"
"52","There is no statistically significant improvement for uninformed partisans overall or for uninformed partisans in particular networks. Overall, uninformed partisans voted correctly more frequently in the treatment group—78% compared to 67% in the control group—but this difference is not statistically significant (t = 1.56; p = .129). Uninformed partisans had more information to help them choose between the candidates than uninformed independents. Uninformed partisans could always vote for the candidate from their party and be correct most of the time.         "
"53","Interestingly, informed partisans and independents voted correctly at very similar rates in both the treatment and control groups. Informed subjects voted correctly about 80% of the time in all cases except for partisans in outgroup networks. About 75% of votes cast by both treatment partisans in outgroup networks and their control group counterparts were correct. Yet this percentage of correct votes among outgroup subjects is not statistically different from informed subjects in the other groups."
"54","The results in Figure 1 suggest that social information has little effect on how individuals voted, with the exception of uninformed independents. However, the results in Table 2—in which the unit of analysis is a subject pair—convey a different story. Recall that each treatment group subject is paired with a control group subject who had the same party, had the same party benefit, and received the same private information about the candidates. The dependent variable takes on one of four categories: (1) if both subjects voted for the same candidate and that was a correct vote; (2) if both subjects voted for the same candidate and that was an incorrect vote; (3) if the subjects voted for different candidates and the treatment subject voted correctly and thus was helped by social communication; (4) if the subjects voted for different candidates and the control group subject voted correctly and thus social information hurt the treatment subject.         "
"55","As Table 2 shows, most of the time the treatment and control group subjects chose the same candidate. When social information influenced a treatment subject, however, it had different effects for uninformed and informed subjects. The uninformed are aided because when the treatment and control subjects vote for different candidates, the social information tended to be helpful. This table shows that many partisans who lacked information benefited from the social communication. For informed subjects, however, the social information was often helpful, but just as frequently the social information led the subject to make an incorrect vote.         "
"56","The in‐party message acceptance hypothesis (H1) would suggest treatment and control subjects should vote for the same candidates unless the treatment subject is located in an ingroup network. The results in Table 2 show that this is clearly not the case. Treatment and control partisans vote for different candidates more than one‐third of the time when the treatment partisans receive social information from out‐partisans. Clearly, the treatment subjects were updating their evaluations of the candidates based on social information even if that information came from informants with conflicting preferences. Hence, the treatment subjects were not evaluating the incoming messages in the manner that the formal models would predict.         "
"57","Informed partisans deserve special attention. These subjects should see the least updating based on social information. As partisans, they have strong ex ante reasons to prefer a particular candidate. As informed subjects, they do not need social information and have reasons to be skeptical about any social information that contradicts their previous beliefs. And yet, the subjects behaved differently based on who was providing the information according to the F statistic, which is statistically significant at the .10 level. Another way of evaluating this is to examine the frequency with which the control and treatment subjects voted for different candidates. When the treatment subject received information from in‐partisans or a heterogeneous network, then the treatment and control subjects chose different candidates 23% of the time. When the treatment subject received information from out‐partisans, then the treatment and control subjects chose different candidates a statistically different 38% of the time (t = 3.04; p = .003).         "
"58","These results lend partial support to the autoregressive influence hypothesis (H3). The treatment subjects were persuaded by members of the outgroup. In the aggregate, however, this did not have a negative effect on correct voting because the information was just as likely to be helpful as harmful.         "
"59","Another way of testing the hypotheses is to look at how treatment subjects updated their voting decisions based on social information. The analysis in Figure 2 does this by comparing the implied votes based on the subjects’ initial estimates to their actual votes. Remember, the initial estimates are based solely on private information. Hence, they can be used to determine how the subjects would have voted without social information.         "
"60","                Comparing the Percentage of Actual Correct Votes to the Percentage of Initial, Implied Votes That Were Correct. Error Bars Display 95% Confidence Intervals with Standard Errors Corrected for Clustering on Subjects"
"61","Once again, these results support the uninformed are aided hypothesis (H2), but only for independents. This time the difference between uninformed partisans and independents is even more striking. Uninformed independents were twice as likely to vote correctly following social information.18 For uninformed partisans, social information appears to have made little difference on average; they were just as likely to vote correctly prior to social information as they were after receiving social information.         "
"62","The within‐subjects analysis makes the strongest statements about the in‐party message acceptance hypothesis (H1) and the autoregressive influence hypothesis (H3). The in‐party message acceptance hypothesis is clearly rejected as informed subjects updated their vote decisions based on social information regardless of the partisanship of the subjects providing information. The ingroup networks actually showed the least amount of updating. These subjects planned on voting for their party's candidate prior to social information and the messages they received only confirmed that decision.         "
"63","These results, on the other hand, offer strong support for the autoregressive influence hypothesis (H3). The implied vote of informed partisans in heterogeneous networks was correct 89% of the time. These subjects’ actual vote was correct only 80% of the time, a statistically significant difference at the .10 level (t = 2.04; p = .053). The difference is even more striking for informed partisans in outgroup networks, as they vote correctly only 74% of the time (t = 3.52; p = .002). Uninformed independents were helped by social information, but informed independents were slightly hurt.19 The implied vote of informed independents was correct 91% of the time. There was a statistically significant seven percentage point drop in correct votes following social information (t = 2.81; p = .008). Hence, all types of informed subjects were harmed by social information, with the exception of those who received messages predominantly from members of their own party.         "
"64","Taken together, the within‐subjects results cast doubt on the efficacy of political discussion. A small segment of the subjects—uninformed independents—were aided by social information. Informed subjects, on the other hand, were hurt by social information. This was especially the case for partisans who spoke with members of the other party."
"65","Social networks harmed correct voting among the informed because the subjects sent biased social messages. This is shown by the OLS models in Table 3A. They regress the bias in the messages sent by subjects on the partisanship of the message sender and receiver. Bias here is measured by subtracting the message sent from the sender's initial estimate of the candidate's global benefit. Therefore, a positive value would indicate that the sender was saying the candidate provides a larger benefit than the sender believes and the opposite for a negative value. As the predicted values in Table 3B show, partisans send messages that assert that the other party's candidate will offer a smaller benefit than the sender believes. Partisans also exaggerate the benefit offered by their candidate, but this effect is not as pronounced. The typical bias is less than five ECUs, meaning that the assertions reflect the sender's true beliefs to some extent. Subjects may have believed they were more likely to persuade others by slanting the truth rather than through complete distortion.         "
"66","Partisans in outgroup networks tend to vote incorrectly because the messages they receive are biased in favor of the other party's candidate. This increases the number of situations in which that candidate appears as a plausible choice and increases the probability that the subject will defect—i.e., vote for the candidate from the other party. In expectation, defection is a correct decision for partisans only 20% of the time. In this experiment, half of the subjects who defected were making a mistake. Subjects in outgroup networks were more likely to defect and hence they were more likely to vote incorrectly.20"
"67","This article uses an experimental design to test three hypotheses about social information and correct voting. Both the between‐subjects and within‐subjects analysis showed that social communication is an effective information shortcut for uninformed independents, but is less useful for uninformed partisans. Many uninformed partisans benefited from social information, but the effect was too small to be statistically discernible. The between‐subjects results showed that informed subjects used social information even when the messages came from a member of another party. Economic models of discussion suggest that this is a mistake (Downs 1957), an argument supported by the within‐subjects analysis. Informed subjects voted incorrectly more often following social information when they received messages from members of another party.         "
"68","These results call into question standard communication theories that view discussion as a dyadic process (e.g., Crawford and Sobel 1982; Jackman and Sniderman 2006; Lupia and McCubbins 1998). In this experiment, outgroup subjects changed their votes because they received several messages from members of another party. In other experiments, subjects did not take into account the message sent from a single subject with conflicting preferences (Ahn, Huckfeldt, and Ryan 2010; Lupia and McCubbins 1998). From a rational choice standpoint, subjects should not have viewed messages from two biased sources as more compelling than a message from a single biased source. It appears, however, that subjects were often persuaded to vote as their social network was voting. This suggests modelers need to take into account imitation (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Schlag 1999) and group conformity (Asch 1958; Granovetter 1978; Rolfe 2005) when attempting to understand the effects of social communication. Future experiments could attempt to intensify the level of partisan identity perhaps by having the subjects meet fellow partisans face‐to‐face or choose subjects based on their affiliation with outside groups. This could cause subjects to react with greater skepticism to messages from subjects who are not members of their party because it increases the salience of the partisan conflict.         "
"69","The experimental results also speak to the ongoing debate about the efficacy of deliberation and group decision making. Deliberation is promoted because it exposes individuals to other points of view and helps inform their judgments (e.g., Chambers 2003; Fishkin 1991). Others have noted that deliberation may result in certain individuals or groups dominating discussion (e.g., Sanders 1997). There is virtue in engaging with opposing viewpoints, but this can also lead individuals to become ambivalent and withdraw from politics (Mutz 2006). Further, according to the results presented here, deliberation causes people to support the interests of those dominating discussion and potentially voting against their own interests.         "
