"1","Two office‐motivated parties, denoted by  compete for votes in an election. For the sake of tractability, the policy space is restricted to three dimensions: Each voter is concerned by up to three issues . The electoral game has three stages: (1) Each party drafts a platform with proposals for each issue. A proposal is identified by its quality, . The platform of party P is a vector of qualities: . (2) Given the two parties' platforms, each party decides how much communication time  to allocate to each issue.6 (3) On Election Day, each voter casts her ballot for the party that proposes the highest weighted average quality.7 As detailed below, the weights used to compute average quality are given by each voter's salience weights .8"
"2","Our setup contrasts with the classical Downsian approach to political competition. In a Downsian context, party choices would be driven by the party's preferences over issues and by the divisiveness of each issue .9 We voluntarily abstract from these ideological cleavages to focus on policy innovations. Put differently, we focus on the common value (vertical differentiation) rather than on the ideological divisiveness (horizontal differentiation) dimension of policies (the conclusion discusses how the model could be extended to incorporate ideology). Finally, our setup assumes symmetric information and full commitment: All policy qualities are observable at the election stage, and, once elected, a party actually implements the policies developed at Stage 1. In this way, we reduce the gap between pre‐ and post‐electoral considerations.10"
"3","Both parties simultaneously invest resources to produce policy innovations that increase their proposals' quality on each issue, .11 The investment cost of delivering a proposal of quality  is quadratic in quality and decreasing in the party'sreputation on the issue, :                  "
"4","Party reputation  reflects, among other things, the expertise of the party staff and members of Congress accumulated in the past, as in Petrocik (1996). In our model, this expertise increases the party's ability to develop novel proposals that voters will value. However, what matters for the upcoming campaign is not only the past. At the time of the election, voters will compare the quality  of the parties' actual proposals (see below). Quality is thus the key variable to determine issue ownership at the end of the campaign. Delivering high quality is costly, but this cost is lower for the party with better expertise on the issue.               "
"5","We assume that  and : Party A enjoys a reputation advantage à la Petrocik on issue a and party B on issue b. We also assume that : Both parties are equally good at tackling issue c.12 Throughout, we focus on the symmetric case, in which , , and  Notice that we do not make any assumption on the value of , which can be 0 (in which case, this issue disappears from the election), larger or smaller than 1, and larger or smaller than θ.               "
"6","We refer to issue specialization as the case in which the parties' quality provisions mirror their reputation advantages.Issue stealing is the complementary situation:                  "
"7","Definition 1.There is “issue specialization” if  and  with probability 1, given the equilibrium strategy played by the parties. Conversely, there is “issue stealing” if at least one of these inequalities is violated with strictly positive probability.                     "
"8","Parties allocate their communication time to induce voters to focus more on the issue(s) of their choosing. Let  denote the amount of time (or the value of the advertisements) that party P devotes to campaigning on issue k. Throughout the campaign, the total amount of campaigning time devoted to issue k is                  "
"9","The role of the communication campaign is to influence the voters' salience weights. The more parties communicate on issue k, the more this issue will weigh on the voters' decision at Stage 3. The process through which communication affects the salience of an issue has been termed priming by political psychologists. In the context of an electoral campaign, priming effects imply that voters attach larger salience to the issues that are emphasized more.14 Our contribution in this respect is to offer a tractable, functional form for the effects of priming on issue salience, in which the parties' communication strategy influences the salience weights , but voters perfectly observe proposal qualities .               "
"10","Formally, prior to the electoral campaign, each voter has initial issue weights , with . At the end of the campaign, these weights become                  "
"11","The salience weight  is thus a convex combination of the (party‐controlled) campaigning times  and of the voter's prior weights . In that convex combination, β is the relative influence of the electoral campaign and  that of the initial weights. The parameter β thus captures priming effectiveness, that is, the parties' capacity to manipulate voters.15 To fix ideas, Bartels (1996) finds that priming can increase issue salience by 40% to 100%. If a voter's initial weights are , this yields an estimate of β that lies between 0.2 and 0.5.16"
"12","At the beginning of Stage 3, voters observe the quality of all party proposals and the communication campaign of the two parties. A voter i is characterized by the salience weight  she assigns to issue k, with . To identify which party she will support, voter i compares the relative merits of each party's proposal on each issue. She votes for party A iff                  "
"13","Each party thus has six control variables (three quality choices and three campaigning time choices) to maximize its probability of winning net of investment costs:                  "
"14","The indicator function  has value 1 when the pivotal voter prefers A to B in (2) and 0 otherwise.               "
"15","We assume a uniform distribution of the pivotal voter's ex ante salience weights over the simplex of admissible preferences:                  "
"16","The density of ex ante weights within that simplex is therefore , . Figure 1 illustrates this graphically.               "
"17","Ex Ante Distribution of the Pivotal Voter's Salience Weights"
"18","Note: The expected location of the pivotal voter is given by the intersection between all the barycentric coordinates of the simplex.                           "
"19","However, as explained above, voters are primed by the parties' communication campaign (see Equation 1). From Equation 5, one can derive the set of admissible final salience weights, :                  "
"20","Ex Post Distribution of the Pivotal Voter's Salience Weights"
"21","Note: The expected position of the pivotal voter changes, and the simplex shrinks.                           "
"22","At the time of the election, the density of the pivotal voter's weights has thus increased to  over a smaller set .               "
"23","We focus on the subgame perfect equilibria of this game: At Stage 3, voters cast their ballot on the party that maximizes their utility, given salience weights . The winning party is the one preferred by the pivotal voter. At Stage 2, each party chooses the communication strategy that maximizes its probability of winning given the vector of qualities realized at Stage 1. At Stage 1, parties choose the vector of qualities that maximize Equation 3 given expected advertisement strategy at Stage 2 and voting behavior at Stage 3.               "
"24","Given the voters' decision rule (Equation 2), we can compute the winning probabilities of each party at Stage 3. These depend on the parties' proposal qualities. There are three cases to consider: In Case A, party A dominates B in all issues. In Case B, B dominates. In case U, for Undominated, none of the parties dominates in all issues.         "
"25","Case A. Party A proposes a higher quality on all issues:            "
"26","Case B. Party A proposes a lower quality on all issues:            "
"27","Case U. None of the parties proposes higher quality on all issues:            "
"28","In that case, a voter who assigns salience weight 1 to the former issue strictly prefers B to A, and conversely for a voter who assigns weight 1 to the latter issue.         "
"29","Let us focus for the time being on the most intuitive situation, in which A's quality advantage is positive and strongest in a, and that of B is positive and strongest in b: . By Equation 2, voter i prefers A to B if, given her weighting of issues , she prefers A's platform: . These are the voters who value issue a sufficiently more than issue b. Indeed, exploiting the fact that , Equation 2 can be rewritten as            "
"30","In other words, A and B voters are separated by a cutoff line. Importantly, parties can influence both the position of this cutoff line—by varying their qualities—and the distribution of the voters, salience weights—by varying their advertisement times:         "
"31","            "
"32","Winning Probability of Party A and Party B"
"33","Note: The solid line, depicted for  and , determines the winning probability of party A and B. In panel a, the dashed line describes the effect of an increase in  In panel b, the dashed line describes the effect of an increase in "
"34","Change in Voters' Salience Weights Distribution"
"35","Note: The black (gray) point identifies the expected location of the pivotal voter after (before) the communication stage.                     "
"36","Combining these two effects, A's winning probability can be computed as            "
"37","Remark 1.If they invest the same (strictly positive) amount in each issue, parties maintain their initial advantage. On issue a, for instance, party A delivers strictly higher policy quality than B if both invest the same amount in that issue. Conversely, a party must invest strictly more resources than its competitor to “steal” an issue.               "
"38","Remark 2.The voters who support party A in (6) would actually turn to supporting party B if quality differentials were reversed: The zones A and B in Figure 3 would be swapped. Expressed differently, if salience weights can be interpreted as the voters' proximity to parties, the base for a party actually depends on the proposals set out by each party in each issue.               "
"39","At Stage 2, investment costs are already sunk. Parties observe qualities and choose a vector of campaigning times ; they “prime” voters. Since investment costs are already sunk, they exclusively focus on their winning probability (results extend directly to the case in which parties must allocate an endogenous advertising budget across issues; the online supporting information). Here, we focus on the problem of party A in Case U defined above; in the other cases, communication does not affect vote shares. The analysis is symmetric for party B.         "
"40","Since , voters will be exposed to as many arguments from party A as from party B. Consider the problem of party A: It chooses a vector  to maximize the winning probability given (a) the vector qualities  resulting from Stage 1 and (b) the communication time constraint,  That is,            "
"41","Remember that the communication strategy is meant to attract the voters' attention toward specific issue(s); see Equation 1. It is straightforward to check that each party maximizes its winning probability by concentrating all its campaigning time on a single issue, the one in which its quality advantage is maximal:            "
"42","Proposition 1.Suppose we are in Case U. Then, for any β, each party concentrates all its campaigning time on the issue in which it has the largest quality advantage. That is,                  "
"43","To illustrate this result, imagine first that both A and B invested the same amount  in all three issues, which implies that A (respectively B) has higher quality on a (respectively b):  and . This also implies that they tie on issue c: . Expressed in terms of quality differentials, we have . From the first line in Equation 8, party A wants to communicate only on issue a, and party B only on issue b. None of the parties brings up c, simply because both of them can attract more votes by emphasizing another issue.         "
"44","Good illustrations of this case might be the U.S. presidential campaigns of 1992 and 2008: In both campaigns, the Democratic candidate campaigned on domestic issues (Clinton emphasized his proposals for a new covenant to America and for reducing the gap between rich and poor; Obama campaigned on his plans for a better social safety net), whereas both Republican candidates Bush and McCain campaigned on foreign issues (their higher ability to combat foreign threats).18 In parallel, a historically relevant campaign issue was muted during each of these campaigns: drugs in 1992 and immigration in 2008. In both cases, the reason for muting this issue is that none of the candidates could build a strong enough quality advantage on it before the election. Beyond such anecdotal evidence, Damore (2004) shows that neutral issues typically represent between 0% and 2% of the total campaigning time.         "
"45","Conversely, imagine that A invested enough in b to steal this issue from B: . The ranking of quality differentials is now . In this case, A still communicates on a, since this is its strongest issue, but B's best response is modified; it should communicate only about issue c, since it is now its best option to contain vote losses. This is the second line in Equation 8. One concrete campaign can illustrate this case: President Clinton had built a strong reputation on policies such as social security, education, and health care. Yet the Republicans reacted by drafting new proposals to address such issues. In particular, concerning social security, they proposed to allow people to put a portion of their social security payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts that would be invested in private stocks and bonds. This proposal allowed the Republicans to recover dominance in this issue. (According to Gallup polls, only 35% of respondents said Republicans were better able to handle social security in February 1999. This percentage had increased to 65% at the time of the campaign.) In line with Proposition 1, Democrats drastically reduced their communication on social security; while it was central to their 1996 campaign (Iyengar and Valentino 2000, 116), only 25% of social security ads were aired by Democrats during the 2000 campaign (Falk 2001, 23).         "
"46","Considering each possible (set of) case(s), and discarding the nongeneric outcomes in which Δ is equal across two or more issues, shows that only the three communication outcomes of Proposition 1 may emerge. Which is this issue depends on the parties' relative qualities, which in turn depend on both the parties' comparative advantages and the amount each party has invested in each issue. This result contrasts with the literature, which assumes that parties cannot control how much they invest in each issue. In that case, only history and past reputation may define a party's strong and weak issues in the current election. In our model, instead, policy quality and issue ownership are endogenous. The equilibrium outcomes in terms of policy quality are analyzed in the next section.         "
"47","We can now check how parties prepare their manifestos in anticipation of the campaign. We turn to the first stage of the game, in which parties simultaneously select how much they invest in policy innovations to increase their platform quality."
"48","There are up to three cases to consider: Case A is when , . In this case, A's winning probability is 1.19 Case B is when , , and A's winning probability is 0.20 Case U is when none of the parties dominates on all issues, and their winning probabilities take some value between 0 and 1. We focus on Case U for the time being, and show that it yields a unique potential equilibrium in pure strategies. Cases A and B represent possible deviations. They are analyzed in the next sections, where we also analyze the equilibrium in mixed strategies.         "
"49","In Case U, there is at least one issue k in which A proposes a strictly better policy than B (i.e., ) and at least one issue  in which B's proposals are better than A's (i.e., ). We focus for now on the intuitive case in which A's quality advantage is positive and highest in a, and that of B is positive and highest in b:  and . We detail only the problem of party A; the analysis is symmetric for party B.         "
"50","Party A chooses the vector of policy qualities that maximize its objective function (Equation 3) given the anticipated equilibrium communication strategy of Stage 2, , as identified in Proposition 1, and the voting behavior (Equation 7) that results. That is, it chooses a vector  such that            "
"51","This maximization problem is potentially intricate since the party must take into account how first‐period quality choices influence the second‐period allocation of campaigning times. Yet the nature of the best responses at the second stage simplifies this problem; the values  were shown to be constant within each of the three cases identified in Proposition 1. We can thus focus on the simpler problem:            "
"52","As already detailed, A's probability of winning is the probability that, given her weighting of the three issues, the pivotal voter values A's set of proposals more than B's: , where  denotes the quality differential in issue k; see Equation 7. This implies that a marginal increase in quality by party A or by party B has exactly opposite effects on the parties' electoral performance. Hence, the two parties face equal marginal benefits of quality provision.         "
"53","The difference between the parties stems only from their different marginal costs, which depend on their reputation advantage. The next proposition shows that, whenever a pure strategy equilibrium exists, party A must propose higher‐quality policies than party B in issue a and conversely in issue b:            "
"54","Proposition 2.In a pure strategy, equilibrium, we must have that , , and  Therefore,                  "
"55","By Proposition 1, this also implies that, in a pure strategy equilibrium, party A wants to allocate all its campaigning time on issue a and party B on issue b:            "
"56","Since issue c is muted at the communication stage, the salience of that issue is reduced. In contrast, the salience of the other two issues, a and b, is increased. We shall see that this effect induces parties to soften competition on the neutral issue, which increases their rents. We call this phenomenon the attention‐shifting effect of the campaign. This is exactly the parties' purpose: Parties want voters to focus on their main strengths (a or b) and disregard their weaknesses (c). Thus, the attention‐shifting effect induces each party to increase investment in the issue he owns and decrease investment in the neutral issue.            "
"57","On the other hand, there is a second, unintended, consequence of the campaign. We call it the homogenization effect of the campaign. As the campaign evolves, and because of priming at the second stage, the support of the distribution of the pivotal voter becomes smaller. As a result, a marginal quality increase in any issue has a larger impact on the party's chances of winning the election. This makes competition tougher in all issues. Thus, the homogenization effect induces each party to increase investment in all issues. Lemma 1 isolates the homogenization effect of quality provision by considering the out‐of‐equilibrium campaign in which all issues are emphasized equally.               "
"58","Lemma 1.For an exogenously set communication campaign  all equilibrium qualities are monotonically increasing in priming effectiveness, β.                  "
"59","Thus, the more parties can prime voters, the stiffer competition becomes, yielding higher‐quality proposals on all issues. Yet, in equilibrium, only issues a and b are emphasized, which triggers the attention‐shifting effect. This further increases the parties' incentives to provide high‐quality proposals on issues a and b, but it reduces incentives in issue c. Together, the attention‐shifting and homogenization effects have a clear impact on quality provision for the owned issues a and b, but an ambiguous impact on quality provision for the neutral issue, c.            "
"60","How do these two effects eventually shape quality provision in the first stage? Together, Proposition 3 and Corollary 1 show that the attention‐shifting effect dominates the homogenization effect on issue c:               "
"61","Proposition 3.There is a unique potential pure strategy equilibrium (PSE), in which quality levels are                     "
"62","A PSE is thus necessarily symmetric, and such that all quality levels are strictly positive, unless .                  "
"63","Hence, there is a unique and symmetric potential pure strategy equilibrium, which necessarily yields to Case U. As detailed above, this implies issue specialization. On top of this, Proposition 3 also allows us to assess the intensity of the parties' ownership of “their” in such an equilibrium. Indeed, the equilibrium quality differentials turn out to be               "
"64","Corollary 1.In a symmetric pure strategy equilibrium,                     "
"65","Let us detail the last effect identified in Corollary 1. From Proposition 3, it is immediate to see that stronger reputation advantages (higher θ) reduce quality provision in both a party's “weak” and “neutral” issues:  and  are strictly decreasing in θ. On the other hand, the effect on a party's strong issue is ambiguous. When θ is close to 1 (comparative advantages are small), competition is very stiff, since the two parties are almost interchangeable. Slightly increasing θ, parties invest less in all three issues: Competition is softened at the expense of voters. But when θ becomes sufficiently large (larger than 2 in Figure 5), each party can actually provide higher‐quality policies at comparatively low cost. In that case, quality provision is increasing in θ. Figure 5 illustrates these effects for  and .            "
"66","Policy Quality Provided by Party A"
"67","Note: Party A's equilibrium quality in each issue, for β=1/3 and θc =1/2.                        "
"68","Another interesting implication of Proposition 3 and Corollary 1 is that voter welfare may well be increasing in priming effectiveness. Indeed, welfare is increasing in platform quality, and we just saw that priming effectiveness drives a quality increase in issues a and b by both parties. Yet, a complete welfare analysis is beyond the scope of our analysis; voter payoffs are indeed endogenous to the campaign, because priming influences salience weights. This makes it impossible to identify the exact welfare function after the campaign, when priming effects may partially fade out. Still, there is a case in which the welfare analysis is unambiguous: When the neutral issue has little importance ( is small), policy quality is necessarily low in that issue, and overall qualities must therefore be strictly increasing in priming effectiveness.            "
"69","The above shows that there is a unique potential pure strategy equilibrium. Yet, to check whether these strategies are indeed an equilibrium, we must consider two additional deviations. We focus on party A: First, it may be tempted to steal all issues from party B and deviate toward Case A. Second, party A may wish to deviate by cutting down investment in all issues and reach Case B. A necessary condition for the potential equilibrium of Proposition 3 to exist is therefore that it provides higher payoffs than any of these two deviations.            "
"70","Lemmas 3 and 4 in the appendix establish that we only need to consider exactly one potential deviation toward each case; Either party A proposes slightly higher quality levels than what party B provides in the pure strategy equilibrium, or it provides 0 qualities for all issues. We denote the quality levels in the first case with a superscript IS, for Issue Stealing; party A then dominates party B in all issues. We denote the quality levels in the latter case by the vector . The quality levels in the potential pure strategy equilibrium are denoted  and , and we define "
"71","In this section, we focus on the incentive of party A to engage in issue stealing, and pick qualities . The payoff of party A when it plays along the strategy derived in Proposition 3 is               "
"72","Conversely, the payoff of party A when it deviates to  is               "
"73","Note that the probability of election is 1/2 in the former case and 1 in the latter. The No issue stealing condition identifies when the former payoff is at least as large as the latter:               "
"74","Proposition 4.No Issue Stealing Condition (NISC). A necessary condition for the existence of a pure strategy equilibrium is that the parties' reputation advantage θ be sufficiently large and/or that priming is sufficiently effective (β large):                     "
"75","               "
"76","Proof.Immediate from Equation 9 and 10."
"77","When condition (11) is not satisfied, for example, because parties are insufficiently differentiated (θ is too close to 1), parties start competing “à la Bertrand” by trying to steal all issues from their competitor. To represent this graphically, Figure 6 sets  so that  in any equilibrium. The point PSE represents the quality levels for party A in the pure strategy equilibrium, and the point NISC the optimal quality for party B in the same equilibrium. The latter point also represents the quality levels that party A must surpass to steal all issues from party B, and thereby reach the area denoted  at minimum cost; by Lemma 3, locating just to the right of NISC dominates any other point in that area. The no issue stealing condition is satisfied in Figure 6a because the parties' reputation advantage is large () and priming effects are moderate (). Heuristically, the points PSE and NISC are located sufficiently apart from one another. Deviating from PSE to NISC is then too costly: The pure strategy equilibrium exists and is the unique equilibrium. In Figure 6b, the parties' reputation advantage is small (; β is still 0.4). Thus, quality differentials are small in the pure strategy equilibrium, and issue stealing becomes cheap. In this case, there exists no PSE.            "
"78","No Issue Stealing Condition for a Pure Strategy Equilibrium"
"79","Note: In both panels, we fix , and  In panel a, the reputation advantage is high, and deviations from the pure strategy equilibrium qualities (PSE) are too costly. In panel b, the reputation advantage is low and parties optimally deviate from PSE strategy.                        "
"80","These graphs also shed some light on why the 2000 presidential election campaign in the United States appears as an outlier in traditional issue ownership theories (see, e.g., Petrocik, Benoit, and Hansen. 2004). In that campaign, Bush's single most advertised issue was education, despite the Democratic Party's dominance on the issue since 1945. The magnitude of the Democratic advantage was very strong in 1996 (in October polls, NBC News and Gallup, respectively, identify a 23‐ and 29‐point advantage for the Democrats on that issue). By contrast, in 1999, that is, prior to the beginning of the campaign, this advantage had fallen to 12%. This corresponds to a shift from θ large in 1996 (Figure 6a) to θ small in 2000 (Figure 6b). Republicans thus had a chance to revert their handicap by engineering a new proposal, which is what Bush's No Child Left Behind proposal achieved. According to October 2000 Gallup polls, 48% of voters clearly supported Bush's proposals on education, against 44% for Al Gore. Accordingly, Bush campaigned more than Gore on education (Falk 2001, 22, shows that Republicans aired 40% more ads mentioning education than the Democrats).            "
"81","Whenever condition (11) is violated, there exists no equilibrium in pure strategy. Yet the fact that payoffs are bounded and that payoff discontinuities are confined to a one‐dimensional set of actions ensures equilibrium existence:"
"82","               "
"83","Proposition 5.An equilibrium always exists. Hence, whenever condition (11) is violated, the equilibrium is in nondegenerate mixed strategies.                  "
"84","               "
"85","Proof.The first stage of our model features continuous payoffs almost everywhere; payoffs are continuous for any quality vectors . Glicksberg (1952) proves equilibrium existence when payoffs are continuous. Hence, the question of equilibrium existence only arises because of discontinuities at the points in which . To see this, fix  For , we have , for  Yet, for any  and any issue k, a deviation toward  yields a winning probability of 0 (Case B). Conversely, a deviation towards  yields a winning probability of 1 (Case A). Dasgupta and Maskin (1986, Theorem 5b) and Simon (1987) show that an equilibrium necessarily exists in games with such payoff structures. "
"86","While fully characterizing this equilibrium in mixed strategies is beyond the scope of this article,21 we can easily illustrate its main properties through a simpler, discrete version of the model. Consider the case of a discrete quality space, in which party A can choose only one out of three quality levels:               "
"87","That is, if it provides 0 quality, party A wins with probability 1/2 only if party B also provides zero effort. Otherwise, it loses. If it provides the PSE quality levels, party A entails cost  and wins (a) with probability 1 if party B plays 0, (b) with probability 1/2 if B provides the PSE qualities, and (c) with probability 0 if party B steals issue a from A. Finally, if A plays  to steal issue b, it entails cost  It wins with probability 1 if party B either supplies 0 or PSE qualities, and with probability 1/2 if party B also engages in issue stealing.            "
"88","In this simplified game, there is a unique pure strategy equilibrium in which  if and only if (1)  and (2) the following equivalent to the no issue stealing condition holds:               "
"89","Proposition 6.In the discrete‐choice version of the model, whenever condition (12) is violated and for ,22 the equilibrium is unique such that                     "
"90","Hence, whenever condition (12) is violated, the equilibrium is in nondegenerate mixed strategies and implies issue stealing."
"91","In words, if the cost of issue stealing is not too high—that is, when condition (12) is violated—there exists no pure strategy equilibrium. If party B were to choose the PSE quality levels, party A would prefer to engage in issue stealing, at the cost of higher investment in platform quality. Yet party B does not want to choose the PSE quality levels in that case; since it loses for sure, it would gain from cutting its investment costs and supplying 0 qualities in all issues. Next, if party B sets 0 quality in all issues, party A can still win with probability 1 by cutting down investment costs and selecting the PSE quality levels. In turn, if party A chooses  with probability 1, party B prefers issue stealing, and so on. The unique equilibrium is thus in nondegenerate mixed strategies, implying that there is a strictly positive probability that either party steals all issues from the other.            "
"92","Extending this logic to a continuous strategy space, whenever condition (11) is violated, both parties must strictly mix over quality levels and may end up dominating the other party on any one, any two, or all issues with strictly positive probability. Thus, issue stealing (i.e., party A offering higher quality than party B on issue b or conversely on issue a) happens with strictly positive probability and need not entail complete dominance by one party.            "
"93","The continuous version of the model also has the advantage of showing why and when condition (11) tends to be violated: The gap between  and  depends both on the parties' reputation advantages and on priming effectiveness. Strong reputation advantages reduce the cost  and increase the cost , allowing for the pure strategy equilibrium to survive. Conversely, the two parties become indistinguishable when θ approaches 1. In that case,  and  converge toward one another, which triggers issue stealing.            "
"94","Yet we also saw that the cost  must remain smaller than 1/2 for either the PSE to exist or the deviation toward issue stealing to be profitable. Another effect of θ approaching 1 is that both costs increase. As we show in the next section, this increases the incentive to reduce platform quality.            "
"95","We just studied the parties' temptation to deviate toward stealing all issues from each other. The second deviation to consider is whether party A prefers to stop investing in its platform and let party B dominate on all issues. This also leads to issue stealing, although for the opposite reason: It is party A's decision to abandon issue a to party B that allows the latter to dominate.            "
"96","When party A reduces quality levels to 0 in all issues, it wins with probability 0 at cost 0. Its payoff is thus nil. The temptation to deviate from  to 0 is thus identical to checking the parties' participation constraint in the PSE. A second necessary condition for the pure strategy equilibrium to exist is that the payoff in (Equation 9) is positive, or:               "
"97","Proposition 7.Participation Constraint (PC): A necessary condition for the pure strategy equilibrium to exist is that comparative advantages θ be large and priming effectiveness β be small: , iff                     "
"98","Proposition 7 sheds a new light on the effects of priming on political competition. It shows that the overall effect of priming can work against the parties' objective of securing a safer position. Within the pure strategy equilibrium, higher priming effectiveness forces both parties to invest more in quality. This is the homogenization effect identified above. Party rents thus decrease and, by Proposition 7, the incentive to deviate from the PSE by pulling out of the race increases. As in the previous case, since an equilibrium must exist, it must be in nondegenerate mixed strategies.23"
"99","Importantly, the incentive to pull out does not imply that competition gets soft in that equilibrium; if a party pulls out, the other party can dominate in all issues with very low policy qualities. In turn, this implies that the former party now also has an incentive to increase policy quality above its competitor's. This induces the other party to also increase quality, and so on up until the quality levels become so costly to reach that their participation constraint becomes binding."
"100","Figure 7 illustrates the combined effects of the two conditions (11) and (13), when . The two conditions are represented by the curves NISC and PC, respectively. The PSE exists when comparative advantages are sufficiently large and priming effects are not too strong. Graphically, this is represented by the white area above both the NISC and PC curves, where θ is large and β takes intermediate values. For such parameter values, parties are sufficiently differentiated (reputation advantages are large) to render issue stealing too costly, and parties do not need to invest lots of resources to ensure a 50% probability of winning, which ensures that their participation constraint is met. Competition is thus relatively soft in this area, leaving parties with strictly positive rents.            "
"101","In the bottom‐left area of the graph, that is, when party differences fade away (i.e., ) and priming effectiveness is sufficiently small, the temptation to engage in issue stealing becomes too strong for the pure strategy equilibrium to survive. As seen above, both parties then adopt a nondegenerate mixed strategy, which produces issue stealing with strictly positive probability. In the bottom‐right area, the participation constraint is violated; the combination of low party differentiation and high priming effectiveness would force the two parties to engage in very costly investments to meet the PSE quality levels. They then also adopt a nondegenerate mixed strategy, again with the possibility of observing issue stealing.            "
"102","Finally, the participation constraint shifts up when parties become abler at handling the unbiased issue (i.e., if  increases). In other words, issue stealing should be more frequent when issues in which no party has a reputational advantage become more relevant in the political debate.            "
"103","We proposed a model of endogenous issue ownership in which parties can compensate for a prior reputation disadvantage by investing in policy innovation. This contrasts with the standard approach on issue ownership; while lesser competence makes it costly to dominate on an issue, costs need not be prohibitive. Our contribution is precisely to identify under which circumstances a party chooses to maintain its reputational advantage and focus on its historically strong issues, or instead try to steal the opponent's issues."
"104","We show that two parameters are central to distinguishing these two cases: the magnitude of the initial reputation advantage and the effectiveness of the communication campaign. In contrast to common intuition, we find that elections become more competitive when the effectiveness of the communication campaign is higher, that is, when priming has a stronger influence on voters. This is also when the incentive to engage in issue stealing increases. In other words, the parties' initial reputation (dis)advantage over each issue matters less when political advertisement becomes very effective. This result helps explain why issue ownership may have become less stable than traditionally perceived. Two additional and empirically testable results emerge from our analysis. First, the stronger is party reputation on key issues, the less competitive the election becomes, and the less likely is issue stealing. Second, stiff competition and issue stealing become more likely when parties face lower investment costs to providing innovative policies on “neutral” issues (issue c in the model).         "
"105","The relationships we identify between policy quality and the communication campaign also impact on voter welfare. Voter welfare is unambiguously increasing in policy quality. Yet we found that more effective political advertisement affects policy quality differently across issues. For instance, in a pure strategy equilibrium, higher priming effectiveness leads to higher quality in the issues that are advertised and lower quality in the muted issue. Welfare can thus be said to increase in priming effectiveness if quality is already close to zero for the muted issue. For the other cases, one must be cautious; the weighting rule that voters use when casting their ballot is manipulable and can thus not be treated as a welfare function. Similarly, in a mixed strategy equilibrium, realized qualities can be high or low, and which issues will be brought up during the campaign remains uncertain ex ante. Future research is thus needed to fully assess the welfare implications of such equilibrium behavior."
"106","Note also that our model focuses only on valence issues. In our setup, voters only compare the relative quality of the two parties' proposals and vote for the platform with the highest weighted‐average quality. This neglects ideology and issue divisiveness. However, we want to argue that our approach (1) is robust to the introduction of some ideology in the voters' decision and (2) usefully complements the analysis of divisive issues by, for example, Colomer and Llavador (2011), Glazer and Lohmann (1989), and Morelli and Van Weelden (2011, 2013).         "
"107","We indeed could incorporate an ideological position attached to each voter and party. Introducing ideology would mean that the voters' tipping points in favor of one or another party would differ across voters, depending on the ideological distance between the party and their own bliss point. Thus, a party “dominating” on an issue would no longer swing all voters at once, but rather a fraction of the electorate that would be increasing smoothly in the quality advantage. In this way, a party's winning probability would increase steadily in its relative quality, and decrease in its ideological distance from the “average voter.” On the one hand, this would make the analysis of mixed strategy equilibria simpler (since there would no longer be payoff discontinuities). In the spirit of the analyses by Krasa and Polborn (2010, 2014), it would also make it possible to analyze the question of why and when parties polarize, but this is beyond the scope of this article. On the other hand, it would imply carrying over an additional expected ideological distance parameter (and its distribution) in all equations and conditions. Thus, while it would make the model a lot more realistic, this would be at the expense of substantial added complexity. In order to maintain the simple analysis, we have decided not to pursue this research line at this stage.         "
"108","Regarding issue divisiveness, note that the above‐referenced analyses do not study the feedback effects between the advertisement campaign and equilibrium platform quality. Clearly, a model that combines the intuitions of both approaches would be richer, but again at the expense of a significant increase in computational complexity. We also want to argue that divisive and valence issues coexist in electoral campaigns and target different audiences. Divisive issues are likely to more intensely affect the vote of partisan voters rather than independent voters. In contrast, swing voters and centrist voters are more sensitive to arguments about which policies will bring them a higher return. For instance: How to create more jobs? Which is the policy most likely to increase my disposable income? Which is the policy that will provide me with the best protection against criminal activities? These swing voters are the ones we have in mind in our model, and we believe that our model is well suited to explain the sometimes significant electoral swings that are observed across elections. As our examples illustrate, many of these swings happened after a party acquired a “valence advantage” in some important issue. Interestingly, our model implicitly predicts that each voter will tend to remain more attached to a party if issue ownership remains stable across elections. The study of the relationship between partisanship and issue stealing is, however, left for future research."
"109","Another potential avenue for future research is to go beyond the symmetric cases studied in this article. Allowing for asymmetric comparative advantages for parties or a multiplication of issues would produce richer results. However, they would still stem from the same trade‐offs as those identified in the symmetric case. Similarly, relaxing the assumption of a uniform distribution of the voters' initial issue salience might make equilibrium results fit additional stylized facts. For example, one could think that exogenous shocks increase or reduce the salience weight of some issues. Then the campaign would again become asymmetric, depending on which party has a reputation advantage on the “shocked” issue."
"110","Finally, the selection of issues during electoral campaigns also requires further research concerning the threat of entry by single‐issue parties. This would provide a useful starting point to better analyze proportional elections."
