"1","We consider choice from a finite collection of K alternatives (or policies), X, and a finite collection of n individuals (or voters) N. We assume that K ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2. Individual i's preferences are represented by a strict, transitive, and complete binary relation Pi. The notation xPiy implies that i strictly prefers x to y. If x*iPiy for all , then x*i is referred to as i's most‐preferred policy or ideal point.         "
"2","Throughout, ρ= (P1, … ,Pn) denotes an n‐dimensional preference profile describing the preferences of all individuals, and we let x*i(ρ) denote i's ideal point at profile ρ. The notation  represents the collection of all n‐dimensional profiles of strict orders on X. Any nonempty set  is referred to as a preference domain, and when  is a strict subset of  then  is referred to as a restricted domain. We discuss restricted domains in more detail in a following section. For any preference profile  denotes the restriction of ρ to the set of alternatives S ⊆ X. Similarly, for any individual preference  denotes the restriction of i's preference relation to the set S. For any preference profile  and pair of alternatives (x, y) ∈ X2, the notation P(x, y; ρ) ≡{i ∈ N: x Piy} denotes the set of individuals who strictly prefer x to y under ρ.         "
"3","A collective choice function, or choice function, is any function,  that maps any strict profile of orderings over alternatives into the policy space X. Throughout, we will assume that φ has full range: for any x ∈ X, there exists a  such that φ(ρ) = x. In words, the notation φ(ρ) = x means that the choice function φ chooses outcome x ∈ X when the profile of individuals' preferences is given by ρ.            "
"4","While we require choice functions to map any strict profile into a social outcome, we do not require individuals' true preference orderings to be drawn from the full set . This is because we are interested in the (possibly insincere) behavior induced by a choice function when true individual preferences are drawn from a restricted domain. We call the preference domain of a choice function , while the ballot domain of all choice functions is assumed to be . In other words, while true individual preferences may come from a restricted set of orderings, individual behavior is only required to appear individually rational, in the sense of being rationalizable by a transitive binary relation. Throughout, we will use the notation (P′i, ρ− i) to denote a ballot profile in which i submits ballot P′i, and all others submit ballots as in profile ρ. More generally, the notation (ρ′L, ρ− L) denotes a ballot profile in which all members i ∈ L ⊆ N submit ballots as under ρ′, and all individuals not in L submit ballots as under ρ.            "
"5","The following definitions characterize several properties of collective choice functions."

"10","Definition 5 (Coalitionally Strategy‐Proof [CSP]). A collective choice function φ is coalitionally manipulable if, for some and L ⊆ N there exists a such that"
"11","Note that individual manipulability of social choice functions implies coalitional manipulability (for a coalition of one); equivalently, coalitional strategy‐proofness implies strategy‐proofness. The converse is not generally true; there may be instances in which a social choice function may be manipulable by a sufficiently large coalition, but not by an individual. However, when , then individual strategy‐proofness implies coalitional strategy‐proofness, because it implies dictatorship. Thus, in a setting with unrestricted domain, individual and coalitional manipulability and nonmanipulability are equivalent.            "
"12","In this section, we define the domain of single‐peaked preferences. This domain has attracted the interest of many scholars because it has been shown to lead to the existence of nondictatorial Arrovian preference aggregation rules and, when ballots are required to be single‐peaked, to nonmanipulable, nondictatorial collective choice functions. Our interest is less about existence, and more about the characterization of choice functions on this restricted domain."
"13","Single‐Peaked Preferences. A preference profile is single‐peaked if there exists a way of ordering the collection of alternatives along a left‐right scale so that each individual's ranking of the alternatives decreases as one moves away from his ideal point (Austen‐Smith and Banks 1999, 93). We denote the single‐peaked preference domain by . We will at times denote by Qρ a particular ordering of alternatives with respect to which profile  is single‐peaked. When referring to an ordering Q, if alternative x is above y with respect to Q we write xQ y.            "
"14","While the single‐peaked preference restriction is widely utilized and intuitively quite simple, Ballester and Haeringer (2011) prove that the set  is completely characterized by two conditions, worst‐restriction11 and α‐restriction, each of which is defined below. Prior to that, however, it is important to emphasize that the domain  is the set of all single‐peaked preference profiles. In other words, in a priori terms, any ordering of the alternatives is possible.12"
"15","Definition 6 (Worst‐restriction). A profile ρ is worst‐restricted if, for every triple of alternatives, (x, y, z) ∈ X3, there exists an a ∈{x, y, z} such that for each i ∈ N, aPibi for some bi∈{x, y, z}∖{a}.            "
"16","In words, a profile is worst‐restricted if for every triple (x, y, z) ∈ X3, there is some element of that triple that no individual ranks last relative to the other two elements of the triple.            "

"21","Theorem 1 (Ballester and Haeringer 2011). A preference profile ρ is single‐peaked——if and only if it satisfies worst‐restriction and α‐restriction.            "
"22","Ubeda (2003) has recently used a different domain restriction, the two‐free triple domain (),13 to demonstrate that on any domain satisfying this restriction, any weakly Paretian and IIA aggregation rule must be neutral, where neutrality characterizes those aggregation rules that disregard the labeling of alternatives when making pairwise comparisons. Because our article is concerned with collective choice rules and not preference aggregation rules per se, we omit the technical details of Ubeda's result and our previously published Theorem 2 below. The key distinction between Ubeda's result and ours is that the two‐free triple domain and the single‐peaked domain are not nested. In other words, satisfaction of either the two‐free triple restriction or single‐peakedness does not imply satisfaction of the other. We provide Theorem 2 below because it demonstrates the implications of Arrow's axioms on the single‐peaked domain and thus is substantively linked to our results that follow concerning manipulation on this domain. In the third section, we will more explicitly discuss how the implications of single‐peakedness for Arrow's result differ from the implications for the Gibbard‐Satterthwaite theorem.            "
"23","Theorem 2 (Gailmard, Patty, and Penn 2008). Let F be a weakly Paretian and IIA preference aggregation rule. If , then F is neutral.            "
"24","In this section, with the primitives from the previous section in hand, we state and prove our main results. First we prove that single‐peakedness is not sufficient to ensure that groups of individuals cannot be made better off by submitting insincere ballots; in other words, any nondictatorial collective choice function is necessarily manipulable by a coalition at a single‐peaked profile of preferences. Then we show that a collective choice function being manipulable by a coalition implies that it cannot be a dominant strategy equilibrium for all individuals to truthfully reveal their preferences. Thus, when a nondictatorial institution is required to consider all possible collections of ballots as potential inputs, truth telling can never be a dominant strategy for all individuals, even when preferences are single‐peaked."
"25","To prove that coalitional strategy‐proofness implies dictatorship on preference domain , we utilize the following lemmas and theorem.            "
"26","Lemma 1. Let φ be a coalitionally strategy‐proof collective choice function with full range. If , then φ is weakly Paretian.            "
"27","Proof: Consider a  such that for all i ∈ N, x Piy, but φ(ρ) = y. By full range,  with φ(ρ′) = x. Then φ(ρ′)Piφ(ρ) for all i ∈ N, and φ is manipulable by coalition N. It follows that  if φ is CSP.     "
"28","Lemma 2. Let φ be a coalitionally strategy‐proof collective choice function with full range. If , then φ is monotonic.            "
"29","Proof: Suppose that ρ and ρ′ are single‐peaked, but violate monotonicity, with φ(ρ) = x, φ(ρ′) = y, and P(x, y; ρ) ⊆ P(x, y; ρ′). We will show that this implies φ is not CSP on . Throughout the proof, let P(x, y; ρ) = A and P(y, x; ρ′) = B. We know that A ∩ B =∅.            "
"30","First, to simplify notation, change ρ so that for all i ∈ A, Pi is replaced by a new preference ordering PA. We construct PA so that x is top ranked and y is as high in the PA ranking as possible while maintaining PA single‐peaked with respect to Qρ. It is easy to verify that such an ordering exists.            "
"31","Similarly, change ρ′ so that for all j ∈ B, P′j is replaced by a new preference ordering P′B that is constructed so that y is top ranked and x is as high as possible in the P′B ordering while maintaining that P′B is single‐peaked with respect to . CSP implies that for each of these new profiles (which in an abuse of notation we will still call ρ and ρ′), φ(ρ) = x and φ(ρ′) = y.            "
"32","Consider the triple, x, y, z ∈ X, with z arbitrary.  imply that for each profile, one of these elements cannot be lowest ranked by any individual. If at profile ρ the two remaining elements are a, b, we say that (a, b) is lowest ranked for ρ|{a,b,z}.            "
"33","Construct a new profile  in which P*i= PA for i ∈ A, and P*j= P′B for j ∈ B. Note that rankings are unspecified for , if N∖{A ∪ B}≠∅. These individuals' rankings can be arbitrarily assigned. Also note that ρ* may not be single‐peaked; our choice function is still required to produce an outcome at this profile, however. Then it must be the case that , else either coalition N∖A could manipulate ρ with ρ*, or N∖B could manipulate ρ′ with ρ*. Thus, φ(ρ*) = z.            "
"34","Note that in constructing ρ (and ρ*) above, we have ensured that the only instances in which zPAy are those in which z lies between x and y under the ordering Qρ (i.e., x QρzQρy, or the reverse). This is because, while maintaining both single‐peakedness and x as top ranked for PA, y is ranked as high as possible for PA. Similarly, z P′Bx implies that z lies between x and y according to .            "
"35","Case 1: (x, y) is lowest ranked for either ρ|{x,y,z} or for ρ′|{x,y,z}. Without loss of generality, assume that (x, y) is lowest ranked for ρ|{x,y,z}. This implies that for all individuals . Thus, φ is manipulable at ρ by coalition N∖A submitting ballots as in ρ*; these individuals can guarantee themselves the outcome z, which they all prefer to x. It follows that φ is not CSP.            "
"36","Case 2: z is a lowest ranked element of both ρ|{x,y,z} and ρ′|{x,y,z}. Note that by the construction of ρ and ρ′ above, yPAz and xP′Bz.14"
"37","To recap, we have that all members of A (resp. B) have the same preference ordering over all alternatives and that this ordering ranks xPAy PAz (resp. yP′BxP′Bz). Note also that x, y, z need not appear consecutively in these individuals' rankings. Furthermore, ρ* as constructed above still yields z as its choice. However, now members of coalition N∖A (resp. N∖B) may rank z last relative to x and y and may not have an incentive to manipulate φ by submitting ballots as in ρ*.            "
"38","We will now construct a new  and show that φ CSP for ρ implies that φ not CSP for ρo, thus establishing a contradiction. This will take several intermediate steps. First, consider the ordering over alternatives induced by the preferences of individuals in A under ρ; we will call this ordering QA, and we know that under this ordering x QAy QAz. Construct a new profile  where  for all i ∈ A. Clearly this  is single‐peaked with respect to the ordering QA, as it is this ordering. For all , assign each member of j an identical preference ordering  that ranks y at the top of the ballot, ranks , and is single‐peaked with respect to QA. Such an ordering exists because y lies between z and x according to QA. Thus, .            "
"39","We know that coalition N∖A can submit ballots as in ρ* and receive z as an outcome, which they prefer to x. Thus, . Furthermore, , by weak Pareto, because for all . And by CSP of , because then ρ would be manipulable by coalition N∖A submitting ballots as in . Thus, if |X| = 3, the proof is complete. If not, it follows that , with all members j ∈ N∖A ranking . However, this implies that for all i ∈ A, wPAy, otherwise  would be manipulable by coalition A submitting ballots identical to those for N∖A, and ensuring an outcome of y by weak Pareto. Thus, QA ranks the alternatives x QAw QAy QAz.            "
"40","Now consider a new profile  in which everyone in A ranks the alternatives as in . For all j ∈ N∖A, assign each j an identical preference ordering that ranks y at the top, ranks , and is single‐peaked with respect to QA. Again, such an ordering exists given that QA ranks the alternatives x QAw QAy QAz. Thus, . Using the same logic as above, we get that  (else N∖A manipulates with ρ* to get z), that  by Pareto efficiency, and that  by CSP of our original ρ. If |X| = 4, the proof is complete. Otherwise, , with individuals j ∈ N∖A ranking . Again, it follows that for all  ranks ; otherwise this coalition would manipulate  in order to get y as the outcome. Thus, QA ranks the alternatives x QA {w1, w}QAy QAz (the w1, w ranking need not be specified in the proof, although by coalition N∖A's preferences, the ranking must respect w QAw1).            "
"41","Repeat the above steps for k = 2, … , |X| − 4 by choosing a new  with  for all j ∈ N∖A, and  for i ∈ A. Such a  can be constructed so as to always remain single‐peaked with respect to QA because it must always be the case that the social choice at each stage, wk, is ranked between x and y for all i ∈ A. We ultimately get that QA ranks the alternatives x QA {w, w1, w2, … wK−4} QAy QAz. At this point, construct ρo so that Poj is such that y Pojz Poj{w, w1, … , w|X|−4}Pojx for all j ∈ N∖A and Poi = PA. Again, ρo is single‐peaked with respect to QA. CSP requires φ(ρo)Pojz for all j ∈ N∖A; otherwise this coalition would manipulate with ballots as in ρ*. CSP of φ at ρ requires . And these two statements imply a contradiction. Thus, φ is not CSP. It follows that φ CSP implies φ monotonic when . "
"42","For the next lemma, we will need the following two definitions:"
"43","Definition 8 (Blocking coalition for (x, y)). A coalition L ⊆ N is a blocking coalition for (x, y) if for all such that x Piy for all i ∈ L and yPjx for all .            "

"46","Proof: Let ρ be such that x Piy for all i ∈ L and yPjx for all  and φ(ρ) = x. We will first show that L is blocking for (x, y), and then that L is a blocking coalition.            "
"47","Suppose that L is not blocking for (x, y), so that there exists a  with x P′iy for all i ∈ L and yP′jx for all  and φ(ρ′) = y. By monotonicity, this implies that , a contradiction. Thus, L is blocking for (x, y).            "
"48","We will now show that L blocking for (x, y) implies that for any  is blocking for (x, a) and for (a, y). Consider any  where i ∈ L rank the alternatives  rank them y Pja Pjx, and all k ∈ N have c Pkd when c ∈{a, x, y} and . Then φ(ρ) = x, by L blocking for (x, y) and by weak Pareto. Thus, L is blocking for (x, a).            "
"49","Now construct a  with P′j= Pj for  and with i ∈ L having a Pix Piy and c Pid when c ∈{a, x, y} and . In this case φ(ρ′) = a, again by L blocking for (x, y) and by weak Pareto. Thus, L is blocking for (a, y).            "
"50","Because a was chosen at random, the above argument proves that L is also blocking for any distinct pair (c, d): L blocking for (x, y) implies L blocking for (c, y), and this implies L blocking for (c, d), for any .            "
"51","Last, by monotonicity, we will show that L blocking for all (a, b) implies that at any profile  in which a Pib for all i ∈ L, then . Suppose not; suppose that φ(ρ) = b. Let Q be the ordering that ρ is single‐peaked with respect to. Now consider a ρ′ that is also single‐peaked with respect to Q, in which P′i= PI for all i ∈ L, and for each  is replaced by a P′j in which b is top ranked for P′j. By monotonicity, φ(ρ′) = b. However, under ρ′ we have a Pib for all i ∈ L and b Pja for all  contradicts L blocking for (a, b). Thus, L is a blocking coalition.     "

"53","Proof: Consider three profiles  in which the alternatives x, y, z are at the top of each person's preference ordering, and all other alternatives are ordered according to a fixed ordering Q−{xyz}.

"54","Let L ⊆ N be a “minimal” blocking coalition. Thus, for any i ∈ L, the set L∖{i} is not a blocking coalition. Such a coalition exists because, by Pareto, we know that the collection of blocking coalitions is nonempty. Define {x, y, z} rankings under ρ1, ρ2, ρ3 as follows:            "

These last two statements are consequences of Lemma 3.            "
"57","Condensing the above paragraph, we now know that φ(ρ1) = x or z, that φ(ρ2) = x, and that φ(ρ3) = x or y.            "
"58","Case 1: First, suppose that φ(ρ1) = z. This implies that φ(ρ3) = y, because (x, z) preferences are identical across ρ1 and ρ3. Thus, φ(ρ3) = x would violate monotonicity."

"60","We know that ; otherwise ρ1, ρ2, or ρ3 would be manipulable by an individual or a coalition submitting ballots as in :  manipulates  manipulates ρ2, and  manipulates ρ3.            "

"62","Now, construct a new profile  with the preferences of all  identical to those given by . Player i's new preferences rank d highest, with i's rankings over all  unchanged. This profile is single‐peaked according to the ordering specified by i's preferences, which can be verified by considering α‐ and worst‐restriction. Since all players have identical orderings over alternatives not in {d, x, y, z}, moving d to the top of i's ranking cannot break worst‐restriction (as all other players have the same ranking of d and any other alternative ), and cannot break α‐restriction, as only player i has preferences over a triple that are the reverse of another player's preferences, and i is the unique player with d at the top of his ballot. , otherwise  would be manipulable by i submitting a ballot as in . But, by Lemma 3, this implies that i is a blocking coalition, because all other players prefer x, y, and z to d. Thus, i is a dictator on .            "

"65","When n = 3, Theorem 3 can be strengthened to say that if φ is a strategy‐proof collective choice function and , then φ is dictatorial. However, we cannot weaken coalitional strategy‐proofness to strategy‐proofness when n ≥ 5. This point, along with what strategy‐proofness and coalitional strategy‐proofness imply about dominant strategy and Nash implementation, is explored in the next section.            "
"66","It is important to note that on a restricted preference domain and unrestricted ballot domain, strategy‐proofness of a choice function is no longer equivalent to that choice function being truthfully implementable in dominant strategies by a direct mechanism. Strategy‐proofness simply tells us that at any truthful profile of ballots, no individual can submit an insincere ballot and strictly benefit from that insincerity. It says nothing about whether individuals may benefit from insincerity at profiles of ballots in which other individuals are also being insincere. When the ballot domain and preference domain are equivalent, the definition of strategy‐proofness implies dominant strategy implementability, because every possible strategy (or ballot) profile is also a preference profile. However, in the setting we consider, the unrestricted domain of ballot profiles (or strategy profiles) is larger than the collection of single‐peaked preference profiles.            "
"67","In the next theorem, we will leverage our previous result on coalitional strategy‐proofness to show that, when considering an unrestricted ballot domain, there exists no nondictatorial choice function that is implementable in dominant strategies when true preferences are single‐peaked. When preferences are single‐peaked, there do, however, exist strategy‐proof collective choice functions, or choice functions truthfully implementable in Nash equilibrium. These results highlight the fact that on the single‐peaked domain we consider, the typical equivalence between coalitional strategy‐proofness and strategy‐proofness does not hold. The only coalitionally strategy‐proof choice function on  is dictatorial. However, in Theorem 5, we provide an example of a nondictatorial choice function that is strategy‐proof on . It is not, however, dominant strategy implementable. Prior to presenting and discussing these results, however, we must introduce some notation.            "

"84","We cannot weaken coalitional strategy‐proofness to strategy‐proofness when n ≥ 5, and therefore, in this situation we can design a mechanism in which the truthful revelation of preferences is a Nash equilibrium. This is because with four or more voters and a single person submitting an insincere ballot, the set of potential manipulators can be narrowed to two or fewer individuals in any situation in which the submitted profile of ballots is not single‐peaked.16 In the absence of a core alternative in the submitted profile of ballots, removing these individuals would yield a profile admitting a nonempty core, and even if the resulting core is multivalued, the individual can never profit from having his ballot dropped.17"

"89","Proof. Fix n ≥ 5 and let Q represent any ordering of the k alternatives in X, with Q ordering the k alternatives x1, … , xk. Let ρ− L be the ballot profile generated by dropping the ballots of all individuals in L ⊂ N and retaining all other ballots.

"96","If |W| = n, then φ(ρ) = x1.                           "
"97","We will consider two cases: the case in which a ballot profile is single‐peaked, and the case in which it is not. Let  be a sincere preference profile, with φ(ρ*) = x*, and throughout, let ≻ρ denote the strict majority preference relation induced by a profile ρ.            "
"98","First, suppose that i can profitably manipulate φ at profile ρ* with ballot P′i, and that (P′i, ρ*− i) is single‐peaked. Assuming that n is odd, this implies that x = C(P′i, ρ*− i) ≠ C(ρ*), and that x Pix*. However, we know that , and, because xPix*, that , contradicting the fact that x is the core of (P′i, ρ*− i). If n is even, this same logic holds, with p* replaced by p*−{1}.            "
"99","Second, suppose that (P′i, ρ*− i) is not single‐peaked. Since i is the sole person submitting an insincere ballot, it follows that i ∈ W. It may also be the case that there exists one other j ∈ W; however, if , then |W| ≤ 2.18 First, suppose n is odd. Then for this manipulation to be profitable for i, we know that x =φ(P′i, ρ*− i) ∈ C(ρ− W), and that x Pix*. Let W ={i} or W ={i, j}. Because , then  also, and regardless of whether W contains one or two individuals. Either one or two supporters of x are removed and so x* is still majority‐preferred to x, or a supporter of x and a supporter of x* are removed, thus canceling each other out. In either case, , contradicting x ∈ C(ρ− W). Supposing now that n is even, the same argument holds, replacing ρ* with ρ*−{1} as appropriate.            "
"100","Finally, having shown that this choice function is strategy‐proof is equivalent to having shown that everyone submitting a sincere ballot, or σ*i= Pi for all i, is a Nash equilibrium of the game , for all . Thus, φ is truthfully implementable in Nash equilibrium.            "

"102","In this section, we consider two applications that illustrate the broader implications of our findings. The first example, discussed next, demonstrates a feature of our results that may not be apparent from the theoretical sections of this article, and that is important to note. As discussed in the introduction, domain restrictions pose different challenges when considering Arrow's theorem versus when one considers the Gibbard‐Satterthwaite theorem. While coalitional strategy‐proofness implies dictatorship of choice functions on , IIA and weak Pareto only imply neutrality of preference aggregation rules on .         "
"103","We first offer an explicit illustration of this distinction between Arrow and Gibbard‐Satterthwaite in the domain of single‐peaked preferences by considering a canonical example of a generally nonneutral institution—the amendment voting tree—that happens to be neutral on , that satisfies IIA and weak Pareto on , and that is also manipulable on . Following that, we present a simplification of the argument we use in our main theorem, Theorem 3. It demonstrates that the incentive to manipulate will manifest itself as an individual or a coalition either attempting to make the policy space appear multidimensional or attempting to manipulate the true dimension of conflict. We then discuss the implications of the argument for recent work on deliberative democracy.         "
"104","In this section, we briefly consider an institution that has received much attention in formal models of politics: the amendment agenda. Under an amendment agenda, alternatives are voted upon in an ordered sequence of pairwise votes. It is well known that in the absence of a Condorcet winner, these agenda procedures are highly manipulable, with any alternative in the top cycle being attainable as a policy outcome depending on the sequence of votes taken. Thus, amendment agendas are, in general, not neutral, because they privilege alternatives appearing later on in the agenda.19 It is also well known that in the presence of a Condorcet winner, any sequence of voting will yield the Condorcet winner as an outcome, regardless of whether all individuals vote sincerely or all vote sophisticatedly.20 Thus, over the domain , amendment agendas are neutral: if the collection of ballots an amendment agenda is given is single‐peaked, then so is any relabeling of that collection, and the outcome of voting will be the Condorcet winner (and the relabeled Condorcet winner) of each ballot profile.            "
"105","What is perhaps less well known is that amendment agendas are highly manipulable at sincere profiles of ballots, even in the presence of a Condorcet winner.21 In this section, we consider amendment agendas to be choice functions, φA, in which an individual's ballot dictates how that individual will vote on any pair of alternatives.            "
"106","In the presence of a Condorcet winner, assuming that all individuals vote either sincerely or sophisticatedly yields the same outcome. However, the sequence of votes that individuals cast will differ, and at a sincere profile of ballots, or sequence of votes, an amendment agenda is manipulable. To see this, consider the amendment agenda pictured in Figure 1, in which alternatives x and y are first put to a vote via majority rule, and the winner is then pitted against z in order to determine the final outcome. Suppose that there are three individuals with the following preferences: x P1yP1z, yP2zP2x, and z P3y P3x. This preference profile is single‐peaked and is pictured graphically in Figure 2; it yields y as a Condorcet winner.            "

"108","                A Single‐Peaked Preference Profile"
"109","Under a truthful collection of ballots, the amendment agenda pictured in Figure 1 yields y as an outcome: y defeats x at the first stage of voting by the votes of Players 2 and 3, and y defeats z at the second stage by Players 1 and 2. Now consider a collection of ballots in which Players 1 and 2 truthfully reveal their preferences over alternatives, but Player 3 claims to have the preference ordering z P′3x P′3y. Under this ballot profile, our amendment agenda now yields z as the winner: x defeats y at Stage 1 by the (sincere) vote of Player 1 and the (insincere) vote of Player 3, and z defeats x at Stage 2 by the sincere votes of both Players 2 and 3. Furthermore, this is a beneficial manipulation by Player 3, as it enables him to attain his ideal point as the policy outcome.            "
"110","Clearly the insincere ballot of Player 3 is not single‐peaked with respect to the underlying ordering of alternatives. However, without a priori restricting how people can cast votes, manipulation is endemic to this form of agenda, even when the majority will is clearly well defined. And we know of no real‐world institution that restricts how pairwise votes may be cast. At the same time, when handed a truthful profile of ballots, the amendment agenda produces outcomes and sequences of votes that are consistent with pairwise majority voting. Thus, contrary to the argument forwarded by Dryzek and List (2003), satisfying Arrow's conditions does not “by easy implication” imply satisfaction of the conditions of Gibbard‐Satterthwaite on single‐peaked domains. Pairwise majority voting is transitive, weakly Paretian and IIA (and thus, neutral) when a collection of preferences is single‐peaked, and produces outcomes consistent with those produced by an amendment agenda “choice function” φA. Amendment agendas, and in general any choice function representing the outcome of a binary voting process, are not strategy‐proof.            "
"111","Deliberation within democratic governance has attracted a great deal of attention in the past two decades. This attention has focused primarily on the potential impact of deliberation on the quality of democratic decision making, broadly construed. For example, deliberative democracy has been forwarded as a means of divining the “best” choice (Estlund 1997; Estlund et al. 1989) as a legitimating device (e.g., Cohen 1989; Manin 1987), and as a means by which individuals' preferences may be brought more in line with each other (e.g., Miller 1992). In addition, some have argued that deliberation is in and of itself a good thing (e.g., Shapiro 2002).22"
"112","Dryzek and List (2003) have recently extended such arguments and explored the linkages between deliberative democracy and social choice theory. In many respects, their arguments provide hope for deliberative democrats in spite of the generally negative conclusions about the coexistence of collective rationality and democratic collective choice. The heart of their argument is that deliberative decision making may allow individuals within a group to leverage the underlying common structure of their individual preferences to choose an outcome that satisfies desirable normative (e.g., democratic) properties. The principle example of such a structure is single‐peakedness. Dryzek and List link single‐peakedness with agreement at a meta‐level, a notion loosely describing the agreement by participants “on a common dimension in terms of which the alternatives are to be conceptualized” (Dryzek and List 2003, 14).            "
"113","A key conclusion for Dryzek and List's purposes is that preference structuration can eliminate the incentive for a deliberator to misrepresent his or her preferences at the point at which the collective is faced with making a final decision. Claims that structuration may be produced through deliberation have been forwarded by many scholars, and some empirical evidence supports this claim.23 Our arguments in this article provide some insight into the conditions that one must impose on the structuration process to guarantee that it offers no benefit from misrepresentation and show that these conditions are very restrictive. Indeed, the conditions are far more restrictive than has been claimed elsewhere.24 Specifically, we have shown that a nondictatorial decision‐making institution can be ensured to offer no benefit from misrepresentation by a person or coalition only if the details of the structure of the individuals' preferences are written into the rules of the institution itself (i.e., the institution can utilize the underlying ordering of alternatives). This is akin to saying that if we wish to design a deliberative institution that will give individuals the incentive to participate in a process of collective preference structuration, the institution must have a priori knowledge of the true structure of preferences; it must know the true left‐right ordering of the alternative space before the deliberative process begins.            "
"114","The following table illustrates exactly why individuals with single‐peaked preferences may not want the true “dimension of conflict” revealed. It depicts three different preference profiles that are all single‐peaked. Because each profile is single‐peaked and there are three individuals, each profile yields a unique Condorcet winner, or policy that is the median voter's ideal point. Consider a choice function that yields a Condorcet winner whenever a Condorcet winner exists (presumably, the benefit of preference structuration is the existence of such a policy). Thus, for ρ1 it yields z as the outcome, and so on.            "
"115","What does this choice function yield when it receives a collection of ballots that does not admit a Condorcet winner? The table shows that regardless of which outcome the choice function chooses, the function is always manipulable by someone at a single‐peaked profile of preferences. For example, if the choice function chooses x as the outcome when it receives a cyclic profile of ballots, then the function is manipulable by Person 1 at the (sincere) profile ρ1. In particular, Person 1 has an incentive to report that his preferences are x ≻ y ≻ z, when they are truly x ≻ z ≻ y. By misrepresenting his preferences this way, he switches the outcome from z (the median voter's ideal point) to x (his own ideal point).            "
"116","In each case, for manipulation to occur, an individual must submit a ballot that is not single‐peaked with respect to the true ordering of alternatives. In this sense, if individuals are not constrained to choose only from the set of ballots that are single‐peaked with respect to precisely the ordering that the deliberative process was intending to uncover, we cannot guarantee that an individual will have no incentive to lie about what he believes the true dimension of conflict to be, or to claim that the policy space is two‐dimensional, or more complex than it truly is. In other words, even if we begin with a situation in which preferences are already structured in a desirable way, we cannot design an institution that is guaranteed to truthfully elicit those preferences."
"117","               "
"118","Theorems 2 and 3 imply that one must be careful in interpreting collective will in any real‐world policymaking institution even when preferences are presumed to be single‐peaked. This point is highly relevant for those scholars who insist that majority rule cycles are infrequent or untroubling (e.g., Mackie 2003). Our results directly imply that—even if preferences are known to be single‐peaked and accordingly admit no cycles—any nondictatorial and full‐range choice institution will necessarily in some situations provide one or more groups of individuals with the ability to profit by claiming that preferences are cyclic. It then follows that appeals to aggregate outcomes as empirical indicators of the collective will are not necessarily well founded even when the majority will is assumed to exist. Put another way, the normative and descriptive issues raised by Arrow's theorem and the Gibbard‐Satterthwaite theorem are more than “logical exercises,”“abstract limit cases,” or “mathematical curiosities” dreamed up for the purpose of scholarly debate, as claimed by some.25 Single‐peakedness does not solve the problems raised by Arrow's theorem in the real world because policymaking institutions are generally not neutral. Finally, and in very practical terms, single‐peakedness does not eliminate the possibility of gains through strategic manipulation within real‐world institutions, because few (if any) policymaking institutions are dictatorial, and few (if any) policymaking institutions limit the preferences that individuals and groups can claim to have.
