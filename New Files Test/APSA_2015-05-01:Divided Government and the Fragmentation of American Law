"1","We first advance a conceptually clear definition of fragmentation. We discern in the literature a number of distinct, while clearly interrelated, dimensions of the concept of fragmentation that we wish to integrate. First, more fragmented policy implementation designs rely upon a larger number of distinct actors and entities—such as boards, commissions, secretaries, separate administrative officers, judges, and litigants—to carry a law into effect (Jordana and Sancho 2004; Kagan 1999, 2001; Wilson 1989). On this view, the sheer volume of actors and entities playing a role in implementation contributes to its fragmented character.         "
"2","Second, power can be fragmented by dividing it over multiple distinctive sources of institutional authority, each of which has a significant measure of autonomy and independence. This vein of work, as applied to the United States, has largely focused on the distribution of implementation power across separate administrative agencies (Biber 2012; Bradley 2011; Buzbee 2005; Freeman and Rossi 2012; Gersen 2006). This concept is distinct from the number of separate actors and entities since the sheer number does not register whether such actors and entities are located within a single agency or across multiple agencies. The literature suggests, and it is sensible to expect, that dividing power across multiple agencies raises distinct challenges of coordination because separate agencies can have different—even conflicting—policy goals, priorities, and ideologies (Clinton and Lewis 2008).         "
"3","Third, a distinctive form of fragmentation arises when legislators not only empower multiple actors and/or agencies to implement policy, but also give them authority and responsibility to perform the same functions with respect to the same statutory provisions, such as empowering two different administrators to make rules on the same subject (Bradley 2011; Freeman and Rossi 2012; Gersen 2006; Marisam 2011; Ting 2003). Scholars have characterized this form of fragmentation as “redundant,” “duplicative,” or “overlapping” by design, potentially instigating “turf wars.” This scenario is distinct from assigning multiple actors and/or agencies separate functions to be performed in concert, each with exclusive jurisdiction over its delegated function. Drawing these threads together, we characterize a design as highly fragmented if it relies upon many actors and numerous agencies and if it contains frequent episodes of overlapping jurisdiction. Below, we propose measures of each of these three forms of fragmentation and a composite measure that taps the underlying concept that unites them.         "
"4","Scholars working from multiple perspectives have long regarded fragmentation's consequences as vitally important, though they have reached radically different conclusions about its effects. One line of analysis emphasizes that fragmentation imposes great costs on American society by producing a structurally ramshackle and operationally dysfunctional state. It makes government inefficient, ineffective, unresponsive, and incoherent, and it produces legal uncertainty, indeterminacy, and contradiction (Kagan 2001, 1999; Lewis 2003; Marisam 2011; Moe 1999, 1989; Schuck 1992). Because fragmentation weakens control over policymaking by elected officials, it erodes the democratic accountability of policy makers (Lewis 2003, 3; Moe 1999, 1989; O'Connell and Farber 2006). It renders law and policymaking excessively complex and opaque, biasing outcomes in favor of elites endowed with legal and political resources needed to navigate it, thus delegitimizing the state in the eyes of the wider public (Schuck 1992).         "
"5","However, a different theoretical account of fragmentation has grown in recent years, emphasizing its potential virtues. On this view, delegation to more actors and institutions can produce competition and innovation that advance state efficiency and effectiveness, cultivate the creation and use of valuable information and expertise, productively leverage distinctive forms of institutional capacity, and foster the representation of a wider range of groups and interests in the policymaking process (Biber 2012; Busch, Kirp, and Schoenholz 1999; Gersen 2006; Landau 1969; Stephenson 2011; Ting 2003). It can also insulate agencies from capture because of the added difficulty associated with capturing many implementers (Bradley 2011, 778). It can aid congressional monitoring of implementers by creating a system of interagency “fire alarms,” with some implementers incentivized to surveil and report on others to Congress, thus enhancing democratic control and accountability (Freeman and Rossi 2012, 1138).         "
"6","Debates over the consequences of fragmentation are empirically and normatively complex. They are also unsettled. These debates are all the more salient amid increasingly fragmented regulatory designs in the contemporary era, which we document below, and which may explain the proliferation of work on fragmentation in recent years. An article seeking to shed new light on the causes of fragmentation cannot adjudicate among contending perspectives on its consequences. However, the rich debate over the consequences of fragmentation for American governance and democracy highlights the importance of understanding where it comes from and how it has changed over time."
"7","Divided government creates incentives for Congress to fragment implementation power, and the postwar growth in the conditions of divided government has importantly contributed to the material increase of fragmentation in federal regulatory policymaking. Divided party government contributes to fragmentation through the mechanism of legislative‐executive conflict over control of bureaucracy. Legislators and the interest groups that influence them are aware that presidents possess considerable capacity to influence agency behavior, and they design laws to guard against that influence (Epstein and O'Halloran 1999; Huber and Shipan 2002; Lewis 2003; Moe 1999, 1990). Divided government greatly increases an enacting coalition's attention to designing frameworks of policy implementation meant to achieve its own policy goals while insulating it from executive subversion.         "
"8","Huber and Shipan (2002) find that divided government leads to more detailed laws, with detail measured by a law's word count. Epstein and O'Halloran (1999) find that divided government leads Congress to delegate less discretion to the bureaucracy, with lower degrees of discretion measured by higher levels of formal structural constraints on administrative action (e.g., appropriations limits, reporting requirements, or sunset provisions) relative to the magnitude of the tasks delegated. Lewis (2003) finds that when creating new agencies under divided government, Congress is more likely to structurally insulate the agency from presidential influence through mechanisms such as imposing qualifications on whom the president can appoint, fixing the duration of their service, and placing agencies at a greater remove from presidential control. This body of work amply demonstrates that legislative coalitions facing an ideologically opposed executive branch strategically design legislation with the goal of guarding against policy shifting away from the enacting legislative coalition's preferences.         "
"9","We stress that none of the foregoing studies examined whether divided government is associated with fragmentation as we have defined it: division of implementation authority over a larger number of distinct actors, over a larger number of different agencies, and giving multiple actors the authority to perform the same function with respect to the same statutory provisions. Nothing can be inferred about fragmentation, so defined, from the dependent variables in this earlier work. As a logical matter, it is possible that laws can be very detailed as measured by Huber and Shipan (2002), delegate little discretion as measured by Epstein and O'Halloran (1999), and create highly insulating agency structures as measured by Lewis (2003), while lodging all power to implement a law in a single institutional actor (such as a secretary or a board), sitting within a single agency, with no episodes of overlapping jurisdiction. Conversely, a vague statute, with few express constraints on bureaucratic discretion, and few attributes of structural agency insulation, could spread implementation over numerous institutional actors and numerous agencies and contain many episodes of overlapping jurisdiction. Below, we compare our measure of fragmentation to Lewis's measure of insulation and find that the two are unrelated as an empirical matter.1"
"10","Fragmentation of an implementation framework can serve the enacting coalition's goal of constraining implementers from subverting its preferences, contributing to the “stickiness” of the status quo. This feature of fragmentation will be more attractive to coalitions under divided government. Increasing the number of actors and agencies that must be coordinated to accomplish decisive action can, on balance, make significant departures from the policy status quo more difficult. It creates “coordination challenges” (Freeman and Rossi 2012, 1138) and “a system of checks and balances” (Jordana and Sancho 2004, 302) that will limit presidential influence on implementation of the policy in question (see also Lewis 2003; Moe 1999; Williamson 2003). For this reason, presidents have consistently favored more unified, centralized, hierarchical administrative designs, which give them more power over implementation (Lewis 2003; Moe 1999; O'Connell 2006, 1704).            "
"11","Of course, a fragmented implementation design will also constrain the enacting coalition itself if it seeks to manage “bureaucratic drift” arising from bureaucrats' own preferences, interests, and objectives, which can be quite different from their legislative or executive principals (McNollgast 1987; Moe 1999). However, despite this reduction in control by the enacting coalition, there are several reasons why the calculus will still often favor fragmentation under divided government. First, ideologically distant presidents with hierarchical control pose a greater threat to the enacting coalition's preferences than bureaucratic drift arising from other sources (Lewis 2003; Moe 1999; Moe and Howell 1999). Presidents in American government are held distinctively responsible by their support coalition for the output of federal policymaking institutions. They also possess unique institutional capacity for unilateral action that Congress has difficulty countering. Thus, when presidents have distant policy preferences and are armed with robust, hierarchical instruments of control, they will have both strong political incentives and potent institutional capacity to depart from the enacting coalition's preferences. Under these conditions, hostile presidents are rightly regarded by enacting coalitions as the most “fearsome” threat of subversion on the American political landscape (Moe 1999, 281).            "
"12","Second, when Congress uses fragmentation to guard against subversion by distant presidents, it is not left without means to manage bureaucratic drift arising from bureaucrats' own preferences. It can use administrative procedures and constraints to control bureaucracy, such as spending limits, time limits, public hearing requirements, legislative vetoes, and appeals procedures (Epstein and O'Halloran 1999, 99–101; McCubbins and Schwartz 1984; Wilson 1989, 243). Decisions about agency funding through appropriations bills provide another particularly potent mechanism of controlling bureaucratic drift arising from bureaucrats' own preferences (Davidson and Oleszek 2006, 357–58; Eskridge et al. 2014, 1009–10; Headrick , Serra, and Twobley 2002). The use of public hearings and investigations can also “subject recalcitrant bureaucrats to public humiliation that devastates their careers” (Davidson and Oleszek 2006, 355; McNollgast 1987, 249). Thus, while it is surely true that fragmentation, ceteris paribus, can limit the enacting coalition's ability to use hierarchical controls to manage bureaucratic drift, it can still be a sensible strategy under divided government. This is because (1) ideologically distant presidents with strong instruments of hierarchical control pose a distinctively worrisome threat and (2) the enacting coalition has other means at its disposal to address the problem, albeit imperfectly.            "
"13","Moreover, an old but recently burgeoning line of work emphasizes that, in addition to simply hobbling presidential control of the bureaucracy, fragmentation may serve a number of additional legislative goals. As discussed above, this work argues that placing multiple actors in the same policy space can engender productive competition and innovation, produce better information, and harness distinctive forms of institutional capacity (Biber 2012; Busch, Kirp, and Schoenholz 1999; Gersen 2006; Landau 1969; Stephenson 2011; Ting 2003). It can mitigate the risk of agency capture by interest groups hostile to the enacting coalition's preferences because it is more difficult to capture many implementers (Bradley 2011, 778). It can contribute to congressional capacity to monitor implementers by creating interagency “fire alarms,” with some implementers monitoring and reporting upon others to Congress (Freeman and Rossi 2012, 1138). The use of such institutional design strategies to induce bureaucratic behavior consistent with the enacting coalitions' preferences will be more attractive when it sees the executive as an enemy, prone to lead the bureaucracy in the wrong direction. Moreover, this point is related to the cost that Congress faces when it fragments, thereby weakening its own capacity for hierarchical control. The notion that fragmentation may induce desired bureaucratic behavior suggests that it may thereby reduce the need for congressional supervision through hierarchical control.            "
"14","In sum, fragmentation imposes added burdens of inter‐ and intra‐agency coordination on a president from the opposing party seeking to control policy implementation. It can also affirmatively induce implementation behavior desired by Congress when a distant president threatens to subvert. Thus, we predict that divided government will be associated with higher levels of fragmentation."
"15","Divided Government Hypothesis: Under conditions of divided government, Congress will be more likely to fragment implementation power.            "
"16","Existing literature suggests a number of other political‐institutional theories to explain fragmentation. An adequate empirical model of the relationship between divided government and fragmentation must incorporate these theories, and given that they have not previously been tested, they are of considerable interest in themselves."
"17","It has been argued that fragmentation in implementation arises from political compromise, with fragmentation being used to buy the support of political opposition (King 1997; Lewis 2003; Moe 1999; Ting 2003; see also Maltzman and Shipan 2008). To achieve passage of legislation amid partisan conflict, winning legislative coalitions must usually compromise with the losing group when making decisions about bureaucratic structure, and the losing group is dedicated to curtailing agency powers and gaining influence over agency decisions in whatever ways it can. Thus, the losing group will pressure for fragmented authority with the goal of constraining administrators and hampering vigorous implementation by the opposing party (Moe 1999, 326). This institutional bargaining logic suggests two testable hypotheses. First, the greater the divisiveness and opposition in the legislative politics surrounding a bill, the more likely that fragmentation will be used as a strategy to buy the support of political opposition.               "
"18","Divisiveness Hypothesis: As the legislative divisiveness surrounding a legislative proposal increases, it will be more likely to fragment implementation power.               "
"19","Second, legislative majorities governing by thin margins of control will be more likely to fragment implementation power than will majorities who govern by wide margins of control. The thinner a majority's margin of control, the greater will be its need to compromise in implementation design in order to achieve passage."
"20","Margin of Control Hypothesis: As the majority's margin of control becomes thinner, it will be more likely to fragment implementation power.               "
"21","Moe (1999) argues that current legislative coalitions are mindful of the prospects of electoral defeat and the possibility that future legislative coalitions will seek to guide implementation in an undesirable direction. This is the problem of “coalition drift.” Congress thus enacts formal rules and structures calculated to limit bureaucratic discretion, with the goal of insulating policy from future legislative coalitions. This strategy of insulation can be effective in the American separation‐of‐powers system because the many impediments that the system presents to enacting laws (particularly its many veto points) often apply with even greater force to repealing an existing law, around which vested interests may already have formed (Moe 1999). This institutional logic for constraining bureaucracy operates as an incentive to fragment implementation power. As Oliver Williamson characterized this cause of fragmented bureaucratic design, “incumbent politicians who create and design bureaus are aware that the opposition can be expected to win and take control in the future,” and thus “a farsighted majority party will … design some degree of (apparent) inefficiency into the agency at the outset … to frustrate the efforts of successors … to reshape the purpose served by the agency” (1993, 107). According to this logic, greater concern about loss of power by the majority party will make an enacting coalition more likely to fragment.               "
"22","Electoral Uncertainty Hypothesis: As the risk of losing power through elections increases for the majority party, it will be more likely to fragment implementation power.               "
"23","In order to build a data set of laws to investigate the fragmentation of implementation power, we start with the 366 federal statutes, passed between 1947 and 2008, that were identified by David Mayhew (1991) as highly significant.2 We study implementation power in the context of domestic regulation. Coders read all of the Mayhew laws in order to identify those containing domestic regulatory commands. Regulatory, as used here, refers to “any governmental effort to control behavior by other entities, including … business firms, subordinate levels of government, or individuals” (Foreman 2001, 12982). A regulatory “command” is a mandatory proscription of actions that the legislation seeks to prevent (e.g., an employer must not discriminate based upon race), or a mandatory requirement that the regulated population engage in required conduct (e.g., a lender must disclose required information to a borrower). Using this broad conceptualization of regulatory commands, we included all laws that contained any civil regulatory commands directed at behavior within the United States.            "
"24","We emphasize the breadth of our concept of “regulatory” policy. In addition to traditional regulatory policy, our data include commands that are a part of welfare state policy, as with, for example, commands meant to regulate Medicaid fraud and the use of food stamps. The data set also includes commands aimed at controlling the expenditure of federal funds for wide‐ranging purposes, including transfer programs, infrastructure building, and economic development. Our choice to limit the study to regulatory policy, so defined, was guided by the judgment that it would allow us to achieve a consistent measure of fragmentation. Theoretically, any mandatory command implicates a comparable range of implementation options and thus is susceptible to the same menu of types of delegations. Further, and critically to our design, this limitation allows a consistent measure of the magnitude of the intervention, which we regard as a critical control. We address this further below when we describe the data and how they were coded. In the conclusion, we consider the prospects for extending the article's insights into other broad policy types."
"25","Of Mayhew's 366 significant statutes, 218 contained domestic regulatory commands. The average page length of the 218 laws was 110 pages, and thus the federal statutory law that is the basis of the analysis that follows spanned approximately 23,980 pages of the Statutes at Large. Each law was read in full in order to code the variables described below, which demanded identification of detailed substantive information about the policy content of each statute, as well as detailed information about the provisions governing implementation of the statute's regulatory commands."
"26","We counted each discrete named actor/entity in each law that was empowered to implement a law's regulatory command by executing one or more core regulatory functions, which we define as (1) holding adjudications, (2) making administrative rules, (3) imposing some type of administrative sanction or order, or (4) prosecuting enforcement actions. Common actors delegated administrative implementation authority are secretaries, administrators, boards, offices, commissions, commissioners, or directors working within a federal administrative body. In addition to administrative actors, we counted judges as actors when the law relied in part on direct enforcement through lawsuits, and we counted private prosecutors as actors if the law contained a private right of action. Federal courts and private litigants are fundamentally important parts of the implementation of federal statutes (Farhang 2010), and they have been incorporated into important conceptualizations of fragmentation in American policy implementation (Kagan 1999; Moe 1999, 276; Wilson 1989, 299‐300).               "
"27","We counted the number of different federal agencies delegated some authority to carry out a core regulatory function to implement regulatory commands in the law. Included in the agencies count are executive branch agencies, independent administrative agencies, agencies of the legislative branch, and federally created for‐profit corporations that served the role of implementing the act's regulatory commands."
"28","We counted the number of times that multiple actors were simultaneously given the authority to perform the same regulatory implementation function in order to implement the same regulatory commands of a law, such as where two administrators are empowered to make rules on the meaning of the same commands or to prosecute lawsuits alleging violation of the same commands. This applies narrowly to actors implementing the same regulatory commands of a law, and not simply to actors given the same type of functional authority to be exercised over different regulatory commands. We provide examples of overlapping functions from our data in the online supporting information."
"29","Table 1 contains examples of the application of our coding protocol to portions of laws in our data. The implementation provisions appear on the left side of the table, and the corresponding counts for actors, agencies, and overlapping functions appear on the right side of the table. In the supporting information, we provide further discussion of how we coded these examples.               "
"30","Each of the above measures taps a different dimension of fragmentation. A variable that combines information from each is superior to any one measure standing alone. The dependent variable of fragmentation is, for each law, the mean of the standardized measures for actors, agencies, and overlapping functions. To test the validity of this scale, we first computed Cronbach's alpha, which measures the internal consistency of a scale, or the extent to which multiple items in a scale measure the same underlying concept or construct. The Cronbach's alpha for these variables was .9, which is considered to be excellent validity (DeVellis 2014; Kline 2000).               "
"31","We also used principal components factor analysis with orthogonal rotation to compute a factor score for each law based upon the three measures. The variables loaded heavily on one factor, rendering an eigenvalue of 2.5 for the first factor. The factor loadings on the first factor for the three items range between .85 and .96, showing that all three items are strongly associated with the underlying factor, and at a roughly comparable level. The second largest eigenvalue was only .4. The very strong single‐factor outcome was clearly confirmed by examining a scree plot. The fact that all three items load heavily on one factor again shows, consistent with the Cronbach's alpha, that the three items composing our fragmentation scale are measuring the same underlying construct in an internally consistent and reliable fashion (DeVellis 2012).               "
"32","The factor score generated was correlated with the unweighted mean of the standardized variables at .999 and performed virtually identically in the models presented below, with no meaningful differences in statistical or substantive significance. Consequently, in our main analysis, we display and discuss the simpler and more transparent approach of the unweighted mean of the standardized variables. We display parallel models using the factor score as our dependent variable in Table A1 of the supporting information."
"33","Figure 1 displays lowess plots of the composite measure of fragmentation from 1947 to 2008, as well as for each of the three underlying fragmentation measures. The composite fragmentation measure reveals that fragmentation in significant federal statutes was relatively flat during the first two decades of the series, grew significantly beginning in the 1960s, roughly plateaued in the mid‐1980s, and experienced further growth over the last decade of the series. All three underlying fragmentation measures followed a similar developmental path. This clear commonality over time is consistent with the excellent Cochran's alpha score and the heavy loading on a single factor, further reinforcing the internal consistency of the composite measure. Actors, agencies, and overlapping functions all cohere in tapping a single underlying dimension of fragmentation in legislative design.               "
"34","In order to compare our fragmentation variable to important existing work on legislative strategies of agency constraint, we examine Lewis's (2003) agency insulation data.3 We constructed an additive index from his six measures of agency design attributes calculated to insulate from presidential control. The correlation of the average annual values of our fragmentation index and the index of Lewis's insulation measures is .012; the index of Lewis's insulation measures does not have a positive (or negative) time trend, and the movement of the two measures over time appears unrelated; and there is no statistically significant relationship between them. Details of the comparison are provided in the supporting information. The comparison makes clear that our fragmentation measure taps something different than agency designs using express structural limits on presidential influence.               "
"35","Divided government is 0 when the president's party controls both chambers of Congress, and 1 otherwise. Figure 2 shows differences in the mean values of the composite fragmentation scale, and the three underlying measures, under divided versus unified government. With respect to all four, there is a clearly higher mean value under divided government. Relative to its value under unified government, the fragmentation scale increases by 38% under divided government. To test the theory that more divided congresses will be more likely to engage in bargaining that leads to fragmentation, we include both law‐level and Congress‐level measures of congressional divisions. To test the divisiveness hypothesis, we include a law‐level partisan divisiveness variable. Following Harbridge's (2015) approach to measuring partisanship in roll‐call voting, we subtracted the percentage of Republicans voting yea (0–100) from the percentage of Democrats voting yea (0–100). This yields a variable ranging from –100 to 100, with –100 indicating a vote on which no Democrats voted yea and all Republicans voted yea, and 100 indicating a vote on which all Democrats voted yea and no Republicans voted yea. We then took the absolute value. Thus, the variable is 0 when the identical percentage of Democrats and Republicans voted yea, indicating perfect bipartisanship. It is 100 when there is perfect party line voting, or the greatest degree of partisanship in voting. From 0 to 100, there is a continuous movement from complete bipartisanship to complete partisanship.4"
"36","At the Congress level, to test the margin of control hypothesis, we include margin of control, which is defined in each chamber as the number of seats held by the majority party minus the number of seats held by the minority party, divided by the total number of seats, averaged across the two chambers. To facilitate an interaction discussed below, we invert the variable's direction by subtracting it from 1. Thus, higher values reflect more narrowly divided congresses, which theory predicts will be associated with higher levels of fragmentation.            "
"37","To test the hypothesis that Congress will be more likely to fragment implementation power in the face of electoral uncertainty, we measure close races in the last round of elections, defined as the percent of total seats in the last national election that were won by 5 percentage points or fewer. We believe that having had more tight races in the prior election cycle, as compared to fewer, is associated with higher levels of perceived electoral vulnerability. Because uncertainty is difficult to measure, as a robustness check we also utilize an alternative variable measuring actual seat share losses in the next election, defined as the percentage of seats in each chamber, relative to total seats, lost by the majority party, averaged across the two chambers. Seat share losses for the majority party takes on positive values when the majority loses seats, and negative values when it gains seats.            "
"38","Further, we model the possibility that the effects of electoral uncertainty on fragmentation will be conditional upon margin of control. Uncertainty among the majority coalition about how it will fare in the next election may be especially worrisome to a party holding on to power by a thin majority, when the loss of only a small number of seats would move them to minority status, and this will heighten their incentive to insure against future loss of power by inducing status quo bias. On the other hand, when holding power by a wide margin of control, signs of electoral uncertainty may be, by comparison, less likely to induce efforts to insure against loss of power. Thus, the interaction of the electoral uncertainty variables defined above and margin of control captures uncertainty about remaining in the majority. The electoral uncertainty variables and margin of control were centered on their mean to facilitate interpretation of the interaction.            "
"39","We also account for the possibility that partisan preferences are associated with fragmentation. It is commonly believed that liberalism in American politics is, other things equal, associated with greater support for centralized state control, whereas conservatism is associated with greater skepticism of a centralized, hierarchically organized national government. To control for the possibility that Republican congresses will be more likely to fragment implementation power than Democratic congresses, we include partisan seat share, which is positive when Democrats control Congress and reflects their margin of total seats over Republicans in each chamber, divided by total seats in each chamber, averaged across the chambers. It is negative when Republicans control Congress and reflects their margin over Democrats.            "
"40","The nature of policy areas regulated in a statute may be associated with our fragmentation measures, given, for example, their degree of complexity. We assign each law a policy code and include a set of 14 policy area dummy variables."
"41","We control for the magnitude or scope of the regulatory interventions undertaken in a law since more extensive regulatory interventions may require more actors and agencies and thus present more opportunities for overlapping functions. To measure the extensiveness of a statute's intervention, scholars have developed a protocol for counting a statute's “major provisions” (Franchino 2007, 109; see also Epstein and O'Halloran 1999, 275). We adapt this approach to the task of counting regulatory commands in each law. The core idea is to count each separate regulatory command, resulting in a sum of the number of regulatory commands, or the requirements and prohibitions imposed upon regulated entities. The regulatory commands measure does not count material amplifying upon the meaning of the command, such as definitions, exceptions, rules of application, or rules of construction. Such information concerns a law's level of detail, not the scope of its intervention. The regulatory commands measure also does not count portions of the statute allocating and defining authority delegated to implementing actors. Such information importantly affects our dependent variable, which is based upon counts of delegated authority. Rather, based upon content analysis of each law, regulatory commands isolates and measures the number of discrete commands of substantive regulatory policy undertaken in the law.               "
"42","Growth in policy complexity has been identified by some as an explanation for the growth in fragmentation of administrative power (Barnes 2004, 35; Schuck 1992). That is, the intrinsic complexity of some policy issues leads to more fragmented implementation designs. One approach in the literature to measuring statutory policy complexity is to use the length of statutes in pages or words (Franchino 2000; Maltzman and Shipan 2008). Maltzman and Shipan theorize that policy complexity is associated with laws touching upon a larger number of issues, and they use page length as a proxy for this. To a considerable extent, this idea of complexity overlaps our regulatory commands variable, which is a more direct and targeted measure of the number of issues regulated. However, there may be aspects of the complexity of a regulatory law's intervention other than number of issues regulated, and thus we incorporate page length as well.               "
"43","An additional approach to measuring policy complexity focuses on the nature of the issues regulated rather than the scope or number of issues regulated. Franchino (2007, 145) measures complexity of legislative subject matter based upon whether legislation contains a rulemaking delegation, arguing that rulemaking delegations are associated with the legislature wishing to avoid the investment of time necessary to make policy in complex areas, instead leveraging administrative capacity. With respect to each regulatory command, we recorded whether an administrator was delegated substantive rulemaking authority covering that part of the law. Generally, such rulemaking authority exists only if it is specifically delegated (Pierce 2010, 408–09). We then constructed rulemaking ratio, which is the number of regulatory commands in each law governed by delegated substantive rulemaking authority, divided by the total number of regulatory commands in each law. Higher values are associated with greater reliance on agency rulemaking.               "
"44","Time trends, and the potentially dynamic nature of fragmentation in the postwar United States, must be addressed for several reasons. Figure 1 reflects that fragmentation grew strongly in the 1960s, roughly plateaued in the mid‐1980s, and grew again at the end of the series. Over the same period, divided government became more frequent. Thus, we must account in the model for the broad growth trend in fragmentation in order to confidently isolate the effects of divided government. Further, as a theoretical matter, it is possible that choices by Congress concerning fragmentation at a given point in time will be affected by fragmentation levels in earlier periods. Past levels of fragmentation may encourage choices to fragment in subsequent periods by increasing the number of already existing actors who may receive delegations. Fragmentation may also beget fragmentation to the extent that it reflects changing norms of regulating in Congress. When coalitions draft laws, they may be influenced by recent models of implementation designs, whether unitary or fragmented.            "
"45","We incorporate a measure of general growth in the administrative state over time. The sheer growth in executive branch size may be associated with growth in the number of potential recipients of delegations, and thus opportunities to fragment implementation.

"46","In one set of model specifications, we include year, which is a simple linear time trend to model the growth of fragmentation over time. In alternative specifications, we model the nonlinear growth and development of fragmentation using standard cubic spline functions with knots to fit the shape of changes in fragmentation over time.6 When using nonlinear splines to model a time trend, it is appropriate to place knots in the series at points of inflection (Eubank 1999, 297–98), and we rely upon the representation of the data in Figure 1 to identify them. The points of inflection are at 1960, 1985, and 1998. The temporal function created by the procedure is defined as a continuous smooth function that is linear before the first knot, is a piecewise cubic polynomial between successive knots, and is again linear after the last knot. The procedure always creates one fewer variable than knots (Calcagno, Hu, and Kanigel 2013). This estimation strategy allows us to explicitly model the pattern of growth of our composite measure of fragmentation over time.            "
"47","Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2. Our dependent variable measuring fragmentation is continuous, and thus we analyze it using ordinary least squares regression. In each of the models below, we cluster standard errors by congress to allow for correlation within congresses in our data. Model A in Table 3 presents a sparse model with only our independent variables testing the institutional hypotheses, along with the linear time trend. Model B adds other control variables. Model C substitutes the cubic spline for the linear time trend. The key results are consistent across all three models.         "
"48","Divided government is significant with the expected sign in all three models, and the magnitude of the effect is somewhat reduced by inclusion of the controls. To put the magnitude of the effect in perspective, consider that the mean value of our fragmentation scale under unified government is 1.07. The coefficient on divided government in the full model indicates that conditions of divided government are associated with an increase in the fragmentation scale of .38, or 36% over its mean under unified government. In Model C, the increase is 33% over the mean under unified government.         "
"49","Partisan divisiveness is insignificant, suggesting that the extent of partisan divisiveness over a law is not associated with higher levels of fragmentation. We also considered, as an alternative operationalization of divisiveness, the share of total votes that were nay, averaged across the chambers. This proved insignificant as well. It is possible that this lack of a divisiveness effect arises from the fact that concessions making a law more fragmented also have the intended effect of achieving a more consensual vote, whereas divisive votes occur where the majority coalition made the fewest concessions to the minority.7"
"50","Even if this dynamic were at play in roll‐call behavior, the margin of control hypothesis would still predict that congresses with majority parties governing with thinner margins of control would pass laws with more fragmented implementation. While the evidence would not exist at the individual roll‐call level, the fragmentation‐enlarging concessions made to achieve more consensual votes would be increasingly necessary in more closely divided congresses. However, the main effect of margin of control is also insignificant in all three models, indicating that the margin by which the majority party controls Congress is not associated with higher levels of fragmentation. The main effect of close races is insignificant as well, indicating that the percent of close races in the last round of elections was not associated with fragmentation. Because margin of control and close races are centered on 0 and interacted, the coefficient and standard error on each variable reflect the result only when the other variable is at its mean.8"
"51","However, the interaction of margin of control and close races is significant in all three models, with the magnitude of the effect somewhat reduced by inclusion of the controls. This variable captures electoral uncertainty not just in terms of the number of competitive races in the last round of elections, but also conditional upon the majority party's margin of control, with low values associated with wide margins of control and few competitive races, and high values capturing thin margins of control and many competitive races. In the full model with a linear time trend (Model B), an increase of one standard deviation in the interaction is associated with a .16 unit increase in fragmentation. This is an increase of 12% over the mean value of the fragmentation index in the data (which is 1.3). Figure 3 presents a plot of this interaction term's effect on fragmentation with 95% confidence bands. The figure reveals a clear upward trend, consistent with the theory that under higher levels of uncertainty about remaining in power, Congress will be more likely to rely upon fragmented design for policy implementation. We note that above the value of about .0025 on the interaction, denoted by the vertical line, the lower confidence band reflects that the upward slope cannot be distinguished from a zero slope at the 95% confidence level. However, 90% of our data fall below that level. The portion of the figure above .0025 is very sparsely populated with data, resulting in uncertain estimates. In the region below .0025, where 90% of our data lie, the effect is clearly positive and statistically significant. In the spline model, the effect of a one standard deviation increase in the interaction is also associated with an increase of 12% in fragmentation over the mean value of the fragmentation index.         "
"52","In order to test the robustness of the electoral uncertainty finding, we substitute seat share losses for close races and rerun all three models. The results are presented in Table 4. The main effect of seat share losses is significant in every model with the expected sign. An increase of one standard deviation in seat share losses is associated with a .09 increase in fragmentation, or an increase of 7% over the mean value of the fragmentation index, in both the full model with the linear time trend (Model B), and the spline specification (Model C). The interaction of seat share losses and margin of control is insignificant in all three models. Despite this inconsistency in the conditionality of the alternative measures of electoral uncertainty upon margin of control, in both cases we observed quite differently constructed measures of electoral uncertainty to be significantly and positively associated with fragmentation. With the alternative uncertainty measure in the linear model (Model B), divided government is associated with a 26% increase in fragmentation relative to its mean value under unified government. The increase is 24% in the spline model (Model C).         "
"53","Partisan seat share is insignificant. Higher levels of Republican control of Congress are not associated with more fragmented implementation powers. Executive branch size is also insignificant, such that the sheer size of the executive branch is not associated with the legislative choice to fragment power. Regulatory commands, measuring the scope of the regulatory intervention, is highly significant with a large effect. Across all models with this control in Tables 3 and 4, a one standard deviation increase is associated with an increase of .32 in fragmentation, or 25% over its mean. Page length and rulemaking ratio are insignificant.         "
"54","Finally, in the supporting information, we present models with individual counts of actors, agencies, and overlapping functions as dependent variables. With respect to all three individual dependent variables, the results on the divided government, divisiveness, margin of control, and electoral uncertainty hypotheses are consistent with those in the composite model. While we view the composite measure as clearly superior in characterizing fragmented legislative design, the findings are robust to specifications with the individual components of fragmentation.         "
"55","A generation of scholars has debated the causes and consequences of the fragmented character of the American state's infrastructure for implementing public policy, with its many participants in competition and conflict. This rich and important literature has lacked an adequate empirical measure of fragmentation to subject theories to systematic evaluation, or even to map its development over time. In this article, we have advanced a conceptually clear definition of fragmentation; developed a novel empirical measure of this facet of the American state spanning the postwar period; and applied it to a body of important regulatory laws, requiring detailed content analysis of about 24,000 pages of the United States Statutes at Large."
"56","Our analysis of this measure reveals robust, consistent evidence that under conditions of divided government, Congress is more likely to fragment regulatory implementation power. The barroom brawl of American policy implementation has grown larger and more intense since the 1960s, and the persistent condition of divided party government has been a critical variable contributing to this escalating fragmentation. American presidents wishing to pursue their own policy missions have inherited structures that are, from their point of view, more and more cumbersome, unwieldy, and hard to manage. They were, in part, intended to be so. Congresses wishing to check subversion of legislative preferences by hostile executives have denied them effective and efficient means to go their own way. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the fragmented structures thereby created are highly durable. Political scientists have emphasized that legislation can create benefits that mobilize beneficiaries in favor of maintaining a policy in the face of attempts to change it (Pierson 1994; Weir and Skocpol 1985). The multiplicity of newly powerful secretaries, boards, committees, interest groups, lawyers, and litigants can be expected to defend their piece of implementation power from consolidation under centralized control.         "
"57","Our results also shed light on the character of the American state in cross‐national perspective. In describing American policy implementation, lamentably, as a barroom brawl, Wilson (1989) contrasted it with the relatively more centralized and hierarchal structures typical of other economically developed democratic states, which he thought were more effective. Partly in response to Wilson, Moe (1989, 240–41) suggested that this facet of the American state was a function of the American separation‐of‐powers system, as contrasted with parliamentary arrangements. Owing to the much closer identity of legislative and executive preferences and interests in parliamentary regimes, legislators are less prone to design implementation structures with the goal of constraining executive power, and thus they are less likely to fragment. Consistent with Moe's insights, this article's main result ties American constitutional separation‐of‐powers structures to the distinctively fragmented character of American policy implementation in cross‐national context.         "
"58","Our data and models also provided the opportunity for the first systematic tests of some long‐standing theories about fragmentation. Using two quite different measurement approaches, we find that fragmentation is associated with higher uncertainty about remaining in power, with fragmentation used to insulate against coalition drift. We did not find support for the theory, which appears repeatedly in the literature, that divisiveness over the passage of laws incentivizes Congress to fragment implementation power as a strategy to buy support. Nor did we find support for the related hypothesis that thin margins of control by the majority party, by necessitating bargaining to achieve passage, independently lead to fragmentation."
"59","Finally, our novel measure of regulatory fragmentation points the way toward studying fragmentation in the implementation of other types of policy. Another major policy type ripe for inquiry is spending laws, in which the federal government appropriates large amounts of funds to be administered and distributed by governmental and private non‐governmental entities to implement programs to deliver social benefits, economic development, infrastructure building, and scientific and technological innovation. We believe that something like our measurement strategy could be ported to this policy context, though it would require clearly conceptualizing and operationalizing the menu of delegations from which Congress draws when it constructs an implementation scheme to distribute funds. This would be a productive avenue for future research."
