"1","During 1998–1999 we interviewed 254 members of these six chambers. In each chamber we found incumbents who committed impressive amounts of resources toward their constituencies. These efforts include frequent weekend and recess visits to their electorates,2 the fielding of numerous constituent communications, the production of periodical newsletters and fax or e‐mail communiqués, and the allocation of staff time toward constituency concerns.         "
"2","Why do legislators engage in so much constituency effort? Any such expenditure necessarily reduces resources potentially directed toward other areas such as producing legislative policy, garnering a party leadership role, or enjoying leisure. While all the incumbents we interviewed engage in some constituency effort, we found large amounts of variation both within and across the chambers. Is the variation solely a matter of preference? Perhaps some legislators simply enjoy interacting with their constituents while others prefer different activities. While difficult to reliably measure, such differences likely explain some variation in constituency effort. However, as we discuss, legislators face important constraints, and these constraints significantly influence constituency effort."
"3","While most legislators likely seek to achieve multiple goals (see, e.g., Fenno 1978), and while legislators surely differ in their inclination toward different legislative roles (Searing 1994), virtually all legislators face reelection. Since gaining reelection is a necessary condition to achieving other legislative goals—such as attaining a ministerial position—legislator goals are likely ordered in a hierarchical fashion such that lower‐ordered goals require the highest priority; after these are realized, extensive resources can flow to the higher‐ordered goals (Strøm 1997). Consequently, a natural conjecture holds that the tenor and level of legislator interactions with constituents is affected by the member's particular reelection context. (See Mayhew [1974] and Fiorina [1977] for some of the formative theoretical arguments on this point.)         "
"4","Reelection contexts vary in relation to a variety of different factors. These include influences internal to a system such as a parliamentarian's relative electoral safety, as well as factors that vary across systems—most notably the rules of electoral systems themselves. In most cases, obtaining party reselection is a necessary condition for gaining success in the general election, and success in both reselection and reelection is necessary for achieving (or maintaining) party positions, legislative offices, or policy influence. Given some uncertainty about achieving any or all of their goals, legislators “may think of their strategic choices as trade‐offs under risk” (Strøm 1997, 161).         "
"5","In a real sense the necessity of reelection is simply a constraint. Protecting one's chances of staying in parliament may require the direction of resources away from what an MP wants to do most. After all, few, if any, legislators are in office simply for the sake of getting reelected, ad nauseam. They run for office because they have policy concerns, leadership ambitions, or a desire to lessen the difficulties faced by constituents. Presumably, if the constraints were lifted—that is, if an MP was guaranteed reelection—then the result is a policy‐oriented MP who directs most of his resources to policy, a leadership‐oriented MP who directs most of her resources to climbing the “greasy pole,” or a constituency‐oriented MP who directs most of his resources to playing the ombudsman. Since few if any MPs ever reach the level of absolute safety, some (or many) resources must necessarily go to reelection even if the MP prefers to distribute resources differently. Thus the approach taken here does not necessarily contradict other perspectives, most notably Searing's (1994).         "
"6","The amount and nature of resources actually distributed to reselection, reelection, and other goals depends on the particular institutional context of each. Reselection rules vary by electoral system and often by party within a particular nation's electoral system (Norris et al. 1990). Likewise, resource allocation to reelection is directly affected by the incumbent's prospects for reelection. In some cases, such as closed‐list PR systems, reelection is dictated mainly by successful reselection (i.e., receiving a high list placement). In some cases reelection is not possible or relevant, such as with the triggering of term limits or voluntary retirement (Strøm 1997).         "
"7","All legislators have resources available to them for constituency effort, but even two legislators with similar preferences who are in exactly the same electoral circumstances and who have exactly the same overall “supply” of resources may, nevertheless, have different levels of effort. This is because a variety of different “push‐pull” factors interact with the calculus of reselection and reelection to affect effort. Push factors are those that increase constituency effort while pull factors decrease it. For example, important institutional or party responsibilities, such as a ministerial position, are pull factors.         "
"8","The five nations in our study share a common political origin and each remains broadly representative of the Westminster model. Nonetheless these nations elect their legislators using different electoral systems, and Australia uses different systems for its upper and lower houses.3 (Table 1 provides summary information about the six chambers and Table 2 presents information about our samples. Details regarding our interviews, sampling techniques, etc., are in the appendix.) Each chamber utilizes a different method to elect its members, with the range extending from classic single‐member plurality to closed‐list proportional. To provide necessary context for our subsequent analysis, below we provide brief descriptions of the election procedures for the six chambers.         "
"9","First Past the Post Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand employ single‐member district, plurality voting (SMP)—or a “first‐past‐the‐post” system—to elect MPs to their lower houses. Prior to 1996, New Zealand used SMP to elect its complete unicameral parliament. Commencing with the 1996 elections, New Zealand began using Mixed Member Proportional (MMP). At the time of our interviews, New Zealand's MMP system featured sixty‐five MPs elected from districts, with five of the 65 set aside for Maori voters. The remaining 55 MPs were elected from closed‐party lists.               "
"10","The Alternative Vote Australia's lower chamber uses the single‐member district majority‐preferential, or alternative vote (AV) system. Voters indicate their preferred ranking of candidates. If no candidate garners a majority of first‐preference votes cast, the candidate receiving the fewest first‐preference votes is removed from the contest. The second preferences of the discarded candidate's ballots are then distributed to the other candidates. This process continues until a candidate gains a majority (Bennett 1996).               "
"11","Single Transferable Vote Members from the Australian Senate and the Dáil Éireann are elected by the Single Transferable Vote (STV). In Ireland voters ordinally rank candidates running in multimember districts that have magnitudes ranging from three to five. To be elected each candidate must obtain a quota of votes—determined by the amount of votes cast and the district's magnitude (Taagepera and Shugart 1989, 27). The excess ballots of the candidates elected on the first count are redistributed among the other candidates, and then the last‐place‐finishing candidate (whose ballots are also redistributed) is eliminated. This process continues until the necessary number of candidates reaches the quota (Taagepera and Shugart 1989, 27).               "
"12","In Australia, each state has 12 senators. Because of staggered terms, district magnitude typically is six.4 Voters may opt to ordinally rank all candidates—as with regular STV—but they have the alternative of simply checking the box of their preferred party. By doing the latter, voters vote for the party's preferred ordinal ranking of candidates (sometimes called “group ticket voting”[GTV]). GTV is the equivalent to casting a vote for a closed‐party list. Though there is some variation by state (Reilly and Maley 2000, 52), this simpler option of voting “above‐the‐line” (because this option is listed on the top half of the ballot) is chosen by the overwhelming majority of voters (Bennett 1996, 56).               "
"13","Closed‐Party List As discussed above, New Zealand now uses an MMP system. In the 1996 election, 55 MPs were elected from national closed‐party lists. Voters thus cast a ballot for a district candidate and then another for their favored party. A party's proportion of the House is determined by the party‐list voting, with the stipulation that the party must receive at least 5% of the vote or win at least one district. Victories in the district races are included in the count toward the party's allowable proportion (calculated from the list results) of the overall composition (Johnston and Vowles 1997).               "
"14","We first examine factors that influence an MP's focus on his constituency. By beginning with the SMD MPs, we address only limited variation in electoral system; rather, the emphasis is more on the factors that vary within each chamber in the study—factors including reelection pressures, as well as other push and pull factors that might influence an MP's focus. Thus far our discussion of what constitutes constituency effort has been mainly at the conceptual level. There are many ways to measure constituency effort—for example, by counting MP trips to the district, the amount of staff allocated to the constituency, or perhaps the proportion of financial resources devoted to constituency mailings. These and other measures, alone and in combination, can give us insights into constituency effort. Yet, devising comparable measures across all our chambers is challenging because of differences in sitting schedules, for example.5"
"15","Our approach in this article is to rely on the stated focus of the MPs. In each country we asked the MP to rank her professional priorities—be they serving the constituency, serving party interests, policy interests, or attaining a leadership position. An MP received the highest value for constituency focus if she ranked serving the constituency as the sole highest priority, a lower value if this priority was tied with another for the top spot, and the lowest scoring if another priority was ranked above a constituency focus. Such a variable gets at our concern with constituency effort by using a subjective measure that reflects a stated attitude rather than an observed behavior. This gives us a window into the personal prioritization of an MP's time in each chamber in the study. Of course, our measure does not include the more tangible and objective resources of staff and other office allowances, as mentioned above. Other than the ease of cross‐national comparisons, the measure we use provides some unique insight into what MPs believe their focus ought to be within the context of their own situation. In addition, parliamentary systems are typically characterized by very low staff levels—especially relative to the U.S. Congress—making an MP's personal time the main resource she can use in serving the district.6 However, our measure has its drawbacks in that it sidesteps other resources MPs might bring to bear on district demands and implicitly assumes such resources are either fairly fixed across MPs, or that they at least do not vary systematically with other factors.7"
"16","Recalling Strøm's emphasis on a hierarchy of goals, we can start to consider the factors that might explain constituency focus. If a legislator's ultimate goals are only realized after ensuring reelection, then an MP's electoral context should have a strong influence on his level of constituency focus. Since SMD MPs are dependent on their local constituents for electoral support—and since local constituents expect some level of MP attentiveness—MPs with marginal seats must pay more attention to the local district while safe MPs will have more flexibility to pursue other goals."
"17","All of the countries in this study feature a high level of party voting when compared, for example, to the United States. As a consequence, opportunities for developing a personal vote are necessarily more limited in these countries, even for SMD MPs. However, it does not follow that few incentives exist in such systems for constituency work. In one sense, MPs have stronger reasons for throwing themselves into district‐oriented work since these parliamentary chambers rarely provide opportunities to claim individual credit for legislative work (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987, 90, 215); in addition, they have little control over the reputation of the party and its leaders and thus might focus more intensely on the one thing they can control: their own reputation (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987, 182). While we will address the personal vote more directly in future work, virtually all of our interviewed SMD MPs claimed that some amount of personal vote, however modest, was possible and thus important for an MP facing a close election. In addition, many of our MPs stressed the specter of punishment for failing to do enough constituency work; obviously the punishment effect should more directly concern marginal MPs.8 Finally, by focusing on the district—an activity over which they have total and personal control—they also can establish a bank of local credit that may be less oriented to voters generally than to local party activists (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987, 90). These activists often provide the energy and labor for district activities and are also the likely breeding ground for reselection challenges if the sitting MP is insufficiently attentive to his or her base.            "
"18","MPs who have served for many years may build a base of constituency goodwill after having established a reputation for district attentiveness. Therefore, an MP who is a relative newcomer may have to work harder to convince his constituents of his attentiveness than does a more senior MP, even if both are in similar electoral circumstances. We thus expect that both electoral safety and years served in parliament will negatively vary with MP constituency focus."
"19","While electoral context and newcomer status may effectively push the MP to be more attentive to the local district, other factors may pull the MP away from doing so. First, other responsibilities—especially any that require personal time of the MP away from her district—should diminish constituency attentiveness. The most obvious possibility would be policy or party responsibilities that keep the MP in the capital or traveling in other parts of the country. Of course, many MPs have such responsibilities—from having policy portfolios for their party to chairing parliamentary committees, or perhaps fulfilling other party responsibilities (e.g., whip) that might require additional personal time away from the constituency. Therefore, we expect that MPs with extra party or parliamentary demands will be less attentive to their constituencies."
"20","In addition, other obstacles may exist to pursuing a constituency focus. In each of the countries in this study, many MPs have serious practical constraints on the time they devote to their constituency. In particular, many districts in Australia and Canada are geographically very large, very far from the capital, or both. Some MPs face additional travel constraints if their districts (or some portions of them) are not easily accessed via major modes of transportation. Even in the smallest country—New Zealand—some electorates in the South Island are very sparsely populated or include natural characteristics that pose additional travel challenges. Therefore, we try to account for these difficulties by including a measure for the amount of time it takes an MP to travel back to his district. Intuitively, we might expect higher travel times to decrease the attention an MP provides the district; however, other studies have found the opposite relationship. For example, Wood and Young (1997, 226) find this result in Ireland and the United Kingdom. They suggest that more outlying areas (e.g., Wales, Scotland, and the West of Ireland) have higher expectations for an MP to be “here, among us” than constituents in the more accessible areas. In addition, these areas often have additional geographic obstacles to travel (e.g., islands and scattered villages) requiring additional personal time.            "
"21","If, in the hierarchy of goals, an MP must first secure her electoral fortunes, then differences in electoral mechanisms should strongly affect the focus of an MP. This is especially true to the extent that different systems rely on different decision makers for electoral success. Of course, while multimember district (MMD) systems vary somewhat in the exact criteria and methods for list selection and placement, they all share common features. First, all MMD systems, by definition, involve geographic overlap among legislators. No MP in such a system has a constituency for which she is uniquely responsible. This generally presents fewer clear electoral incentives for cultivating a personal relationship with a set of constituents in any one geographic area. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, list MPs must please some subset of party activists to ensure ballot access and high list placement. For closed‐list incumbents—in our cases, the New Zealand list MPs and (potentially) Australian Senators—high list placement is paramount for election and thus general constituency work contributes little to reelection. SMD‐elected MPs must rely on a relatively diverse set of general election voters in their districts to ensure reelection, which helps promote a constituency focus."
"22","It is not a foregone conclusion, however, that MMD MPs will necessarily ignore constituency work. First, some do have geographic constituencies. For example, Australian Senators represent states. For the New Zealand list MPs, one could argue that the whole country is their constituency. However, the list MPs do have geographic constituency responsibilities that are narrower. Most parties have assigned each of their list MPs one or more “duty electorates.” That is, the list MP is the designated elected representative of the party in that geographic constituency; almost all of these MPs have office space and staff in these constituencies (although sometimes shared with another MP), and they are expected to deal with casework requests. They are also often called upon to represent the party at events in that electorate. Note that, for the most part, these assignments are made only to electorates whose district‐elected MP is from another party. Thus, many of the list MPs are indeed asked to carry out geographically concentrated constituency work—especially for constituents who, for whatever reason, do not want to approach their district MP."
"23","Second, MPs in these list systems may have some electoral incentives to engage in geographically concentrated constituency work. For Australian Senators, the below‐the‐line (open‐list) aspect of the ballot provides incentives to cultivate a personal vote, something that might be done via casework. A Senator who is not highly placed by his or her party may hope that a reputation for constituency work will yield below‐the‐line votes, resulting in higher rankings. However, such a strategy faces two key limitations. First, a vast majority of Australians vote above‐the‐line (Bennett 1996). Second, openly encouraging below‐the‐line voting risks alienating the party leadership and, as a consequence, risks a lower ranking (or even ballot exclusion) at the next election. In the New Zealand system, incentives are a bit different. In interviews with list MPs, it became clear that many would prefer to be electorate MPs. Indeed, MMP contracted the number of districts; therefore, some sitting MPs had to “settle” for getting elected via the list. While some of these MPs were resigned to (if also unsettled by) their new list role, a few were trying to regain a district seat. Engaging in high levels of constituency work in a given electorate is a reasonable strategy for achieving this goal.            "
"24","Third, in the Australian Senate and Irish Dáil cases, candidates for parliament compete not just against members of opposing parties, but also against members of their own party. While the closed‐list option on the Australian ballot gives senators limited recourse, in the Irish case this intraparty competition sets up a very real incentive for cultivating a personal vote (Carey and Shugart 1995). All the Australian senators we interviewed denied overt attempts to encourage below‐the‐line voting. The Irish deputies, in contrast, readily recognized the need for a personal following as a fact of Irish political life.            "
"25","While closed‐list MPs in each system have the opportunity to engage in constituency work—as well as some incentives to do so—the basic mechanisms of accountability in the MMD versus SMD systems differ significantly. For the closed‐list MPs, their best hope for election still depends on pleasing party elites, not a geographic constituency. Since the demands of these two groups are often at odds, we expect that closed‐list MPs will have to focus most of their attention on party work and much less on constituency work. We thus expect to see strong electoral system effects, with SMD MPs pursuing more constituency activities than the closed‐list MPs. As for the other type of list MPs—the Irish deputies—we expect high levels of constituency effort, perhaps as high or higher than the SMD MPs, on average."
"26","Given the many demands made on an MP's time and resources, he must put his resources and attention into the activities that are best suited to secure his proximate goals—that of retaining his seat in the legislature. Therefore, by running our analysis for all MPs—while differentiating among them based on the electoral system in which they were elected—we should find strong electoral system results."
"27","We first examine factors that influence an MP's focus on the constituency by looking at the district‐elected MPs separately. By beginning with the SMD MPs only, we are not addressing extensive variations in electoral system; rather, the focus is more on factors that vary within each chamber in the study—factors that still address the above‐mentioned push‐and‐pull factors that might influence an MP's focus on constituency. As stated earlier, the dependent variable measures the MP's stated focus on constituency, party, or policy activities. This is a polytomous variable coded “3” for MPs who ranked constituency as their primary focus, “2” for MPs for whom constituency was tied with one other priority for the top ranking, and “1” for MPs who ranked constituency below any of the remaining priorities. (See Table 3 for a breakdown of this variable by election system type and by chamber.) The independent variables include: Electoral Safety (exact coding explained in the appendix); Travel Time (the number of hours needed to travel from the parliamentary office to the constituency); Portfolio Responsibilities (ranging from 0 to 4—see appendix for detail); and Years Served.            "
"28","Given that our dependent variable has three ordinally ranked values (1, 2, 3), using a common procedure, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or binary probit, is inappropriate. The preferable procedure for this type of data is ordered probit (Greene 2000, 875–79; McKelvey and Zavoina 1975). Ordered probit results resemble those for binary probit. One difference is that ordered probit estimates the location of thresholds (or cut points) between each value of the dependent variable. Thus in our case, where the dependent variables takes on three values, two thresholds are estimated. These are labeled Cut 1 and Cut 2 in the results that follow. In the program we use (Stata 8.0), the cut points replace the constant but are not of substantive interest.            "
"29"," Table 4 presents ordered probit estimates of constituency focus for SMD MPs. Electoral Safety is negative and statistically significant, thus suggesting that marginal MPs have a stronger constituency focus. As parliamentary obligations (Portfolio Responsibilities) increase, constituency focus declines. The same negative relationship holds for length of time an MP spends in office (Years Served), though the effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels. We find that the amount of time it takes for an MP to travel to her/his constituency is positively associated with constituency focus at a statistically significant level. Finally, after accounting for the variables of interest, are there still country specific effects? We scored dummy variables for Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, leaving Australia as the baseline. Only New Zealand is statistically significant.            "
"30","As with binary probit, the actual substantive effects of the variables must be estimated conditional on the values of the other variables in model. Where in binary probit, one estimates the probability of y = 1 (or 0) given set values for the independent variables, in our ordered probit estimates the calculation is for the probability of y = 1, y = 2, and y = 3 given set values for the independent variables of interest (Greene 2000).            "
"31"," Table 5 presents data on the substantive effects. Setting all the independent variables to their mean yields a .54 probability that an MP has a high constituency focus. This ranges down to a .18 probability that an MP has a low constituency focus. Table 5 also presents estimates for varying levels of the statistically significant independent variables. Holding all other independent variables at their means, we varied the Electoral Safety variable across its minimum and maximum values. The results are striking. A marginal MP—one who is at the minimum level of electoral safety—is very likely (.71) to have a high constituency focus. Such an MP is very unlikely (.08) to have a low focus. Yet, the opposite does not quite hold. Very safe MPs—those with electoral safety set at maximum—are slightly more likely to hold either a high (.23) or medium (.29) constituency focus than a low one (.48). This closely fits our argument about electoral safety as a constraint. Constrained by a marginal seat, an MP must focus on the constituency, largely irrespective of how much the MP actually prefers or enjoys such a focus. A safe seat lessens this constraint and gives the MP more freedom to follow her preferences, thus resulting in more variety of focus.            "
"32","As Portfolio Responsibilities track upward, constituency focus probability marches steadily downward. Indeed, moving from no portfolio responsibilities to ministerial duties decreases the probability of a high constituency focus from .68 to .20. For the Travel Time variable we see a mixed effect. MPs with the least travel time are roughly as likely to have a high, medium, or low constituency focus (.37, .31, .31, respectively). However, the MPs with the most travel time are very likely (.94) to have a high constituency focus. This is consistent with Wood and Young's (1997) results for junior legislators in Ireland and the United Kingdom. They suggested that MPs who have the hardest time reaching their electorates are very likely to place their constituencies first—an indication, perhaps, of a center‐periphery cultural effect. Alternatively, perhaps once an MP has expended much of her time traveling to the constituency, he is more likely to focus exclusively on those activities, having already expended sunk costs to get there. Similarly, it might also simply reflect the more difficult task that MPs with far‐flung constituencies face. Some have to spend so much time traveling to their constituencies that this high “hassle” factor gets picked up in our questions about focus.            "
"33"," Table 5 also suggests a substantial New Zealand effect. Given the model's controls, New Zealand electorate MPs are very likely (.92) to prioritize constituency the highest. Ad hoc explanations for the national differences are readily available, but theoretically informed explanations are more difficult to produce. For example, there are at least four explanations for the New Zealand effect: (1) the transition to MMP increased electorate sizes dramatically, thus forcing incumbent electorate MPs to heighten their constituency presence; (2) the introduction of MMP helped accelerate the fragmentation of the party system (Vowles 1998) and increased electoral uncertainty, thus encouraging an increased constituency focus;9 (3) the presence in their districts of rival list MPs, some of whom operate competing electorate offices, places pressure on the New Zealand electorate MPs to focus more on their constituency (see also Ward 1998); and (4) New Zealand electorates are smaller and generally more rural than Australian, Canadian, and U.K. electorates, thus encouraging a closer MP‐constituency relationship.            "
"34","Here we use the same dependent variable as in the SMD analysis. We add a dummy variable for the electoral system under which the MP was elected (Election Type: 1 = MMD, 0 = SMD). We exclude the variable for travel time because New Zealand list MPs do not have a single identifiable geographic constituency (short of the nation). In addition, with one exception we exclude the country dummies here since their inclusion would conflate electoral system and country effects. The exception is Ireland, which is a necessary inclusion since the expectations from Ireland differ dramatically from the expectations for other MMDs.            "
"35"," Table 6 presents the results for all MPs. Not surprisingly, the coefficient for Election Type is negative and statistically significant. MPs elected from MMDs are less likely to focus on constituency than SMD MPs. Though measured somewhat differently (see Appendix) Electoral Safety remains negative and statistically significant. Portfolio Responsibilities remains negative but loses statistical significance. In the SMD‐only model (Table 4), Years Served was negative but not significant. Adding the MMD chambers keeps the variable negative and raises it to statistical significance. Finally, as expected, the control for Ireland is positive and statistically significant. Relative to other MMDs, Irish TDs are more likely to focus on constituency.            "
"36","As for substantive effects, the “all‐at‐mean” estimates in Table 7 show that adding MMD MPs drops the probability of a high focus and increases the probability of a low focus, relative to the SMD results in Table 5. Indeed, Table 7 shows a large effect for MMD MPs versus SMD MPs. MMD MPs only have about a one‐in‐ten (.11) probability for a high focus and only about a one‐in‐three (.31) chance of either a high or medium focus. Not surprisingly SMD are much more likely to have a high focus (.60) or at least a medium focus (.84).            "
"37","Our measure of Electoral Safety for this analysis is a three‐point scale—Marginal, Competitive, and Safe. The substantive effect persists for Electoral Safety though it is not as vivid in this estimate since it includes MMD MPs. This makes sense since electoral marginality will not necessarily induce MMD MPs—at least those from Australia and New Zealand who rely most heavily on party‐determined list placement—into pursuing more constituency work. As for the Years Served variable, MPs with the least amount of time spent in parliament are more likely (.47) to have a high focus than MPs with the most experience (.24). MPs with the least amount of time spent in parliament are less likely (.26) to have a low focus than MPs with the most experience (.51). Thus there does seem to be a career path effect away from constituency focus. Finally, as we argued earlier, we expect the Irish TDs to exhibit high constituency priorities. This is borne out. Irish TDs are more likely than non‐Irish MPs to rank constituency the highest (.56 compared to .19).            "
"38","Our examination of MPs from six national chambers demonstrates that even strong party systems—often presented as places where legislators do not heavily “work the district”—are actually home to many MPs who highly prioritize constituency activity. Although these systems vary significantly from others—most notably, the United States—it is not unreasonable to suggest that scholars can consider them part of one continuum of legislatures rather than totally different species. Earlier in the article, we identify various incentives faced by MPs in these systems that can result in an MP ranking district work above party or policy activity; motivations include, for example, a lack of input into policy and the resulting lack of influence over their party's popularity, building a bank of local credit and/or boosting morale of local activists, possible voter punishment for inattention, or the need to compete with other local legislators. In terms of constructing theoretical reasons for constituency work, perhaps it thus makes more sense to group legislatures along dimensions such as the relative input of backbenchers into policy, institutional professionalization, and local competition for seats."
"39","In our study, most reasons for a constituency focus stem from electoral considerations that must, by necessity, undergird many legislators' decision calculus.10 MPs more dependent on local constituent support relative to others—i.e., relative to safer or more senior SMD MPs, or relative to MPs elected in a list system with a different set of electoral incentives—are more oriented toward constituency. As one Canadian MP put it, “If you want to be in this job for … a long time … then you make sure you do your riding right” (Personal interview, 1998). Our finding that SMD MPs have more of a constituency focus than MMD MPs is not a surprise. However, we do demonstrate that many MMD MPs focus on constituency work to a relatively high degree. Half of Irish TDs and New Zealand list MPs rank constituency focus at least at the medium rank.         "
"40","Finally, our findings about marginality and SMD/MMD differences suggest something tentative, but potentially important, about overall representation. Specifically, we should expect to see predictable policy implications when policy leaders are unrepresentative of the backbench rank‐and‐file.11 For example, if marginal MPs are obliged to pour more resources into constituency work, they are left with fewer resources to allocate in other ways, such as pursuing advancement to the leadership.12 Similarly, closed‐list MPs, relatively free of constituent demand, have more leeway to allocate resources elsewhere. For pure SMD systems, this implies an advantage to safe MPs for leadership advancement and developing policy expertise—MPs who are unlikely to represent the ideological middle or moderate wing of the party. For mixed systems (in our case New Zealand), it suggests the possibility that list MPs will have a similar advantage over SMD MPs, especially over those from marginal seats.13 Such differential constraints could affect the overall composition of party and policy leadership, and thus affect the nature of policy outputs produced by the parliament in ways that need further scholarly exploration. Interestingly, while mixed systems are often proposed with explicit consideration of the representational effects, the indirect policy effects from district MPs and list MPs being overrepresented in policy formation have not been directly evaluated and deserve further study.         "
