"1","Political behavior research on the United States has produced models of attitude change that are a useful starting point for generating hypotheses about political persuasion in new democracies. I first present a general model of voter attitude change during campaigns and then use this model to derive specific hypotheses about voter persuadability in new democracies. Due to its particular characteristics, as I argue below, Mexico provides a difficult and nuanced test of the persuasion hypotheses."
"2","Information‐processing approaches conceptualize voters’ attitudes as the result of exposure to a politically charged information environment that individuals mediate in two ways (Converse 1962; McGuire 1979; Zaller 1992). First, voters may discount new information relative to their existing stores of politically relevant information. The lower is this “inertial resistance,” the more susceptible voters are to changing their attitudes in the face of an unbalanced information environment. Second, voters experience the information environment through a partisan lens (i.e., with partisan bias). Thus, while independents receive the messages of opposing candidates more or less equally, in‐party partisans amplify the message associated with their preferred candidate and out‐party partisans resist or discount the messages associated with this same candidate.         "
"3","Modeling this process helps generate more specific propositions about the role of partisanship in an unbalanced information environment (Bartels 2002; Zaller 1992). In the presence of elite communications that include a dominant message D associated with candidate D and a contrary message C associated with candidate C about a political object d that represents an evaluation of some attribute of candidate D, voter i's evaluation of d at time t is            "
"4","            "
"5","Proposition 1—The Weight of Prior Information. The lower is inertial resistance (λi), the more evaluations of dt rely on information acquired between time t‐1 and time t.                  "
"6","Proposition 2—The Information Environment. Holding inertial resistance (λi) and partisan bias (πi) constant, the higher the ratio of D to C messages, the more voters’ evaluations of dt favor party D.                  "
"7","Proposition 3—Partisan Bias. Holding the information environment constant, partisan bias (πi) regulates the magnitude of change from dt−1 to dt. As a baseline, consider independents who have πi≈ 1 −πi and thus do not mediate the objective information environment. In comparison, partisans of D who have πi > 1 −πi will amplify D compared to C messages and will thus increase dt more than if they were independents. Partisans of C who have πi < 1 −πi will diminish D compared to C messages and will thus decrease dt more than if they were independents.5"
"8","Thus, where one candidate dominates the information environment, voters should be more persuaded to support him, and the degree of persuasion is greatly amplified where partisan identification is weak and voters have less politically relevant information before the campaigns begin. Yet these propositions say nothing about what determines the balance of persuasive messages in the information environment, the weight of prior information, and partisan bias. I argue that these key parameters differ between new and established democracies as well as among types of new democracies. I discuss each in turn to set up specific hypotheses about Mexico."
"9","Voters are more likely to experience an unbalanced information environment in new rather than established democracies, even in major national elections, for at least three reasons. First, where candidates lack tried‐and‐true campaign strategies, they may experiment with advertising methods as distinct as high‐tech media market segmentation that can reach broader groups of voters and low‐tech rallies and word‐of‐mouth campaigns that mainly target loyalists. Earned media scarcely equalizes the information asymmetries created by different campaign techniques because, unlike in the established democracies in richer countries, new democracies typically lack 24‐hour television news outlets, broad Internet access, and high newspaper circulation rates. Thus, even if news organizations cover campaign events in a nonpartisan manner—by no means a given (Lawson and McCann 2005)—then most voters can only absorb news if they happen to tune in at fixed times during the day.         "
"10","Second, unlike in established democracies where major parties typically respond to the electoral marketplace by organizing in electorally efficient ways (Wright 1971), even major parties in new democracies may accommodate themselves to the electoral environment at different rates following democratization. Whereas some quickly become electoral‐professional organizations, others persist as niche parties that were created to fight for democracy rather than to compete in elections. Niche parties can remain doggedly tied to limited core constituencies even once competition is fully open and spatial incentives predict that they would organize in electorally efficient ways (Greene 2007; Hunter 2010).         "
"11","Finally, some parties and candidates may enjoy extra resources that yield advertising advantages. In particular, rightist parties may have a fundraising advantage because they appeal to richer core constituencies (Gibson 1996). Without the equalizing measures that many new democracies lack, including professional fundraisers, public financing, and strict campaign finance regulations, such resource asymmetries can create asymmetries in the volume of campaign communications across competitors.         "
"12","The effect of an unbalanced information environment is also magnified in new compared to established democracies for two reasons. First, voters’ stores of relevant political information are likely to be low (i.e., λi≪ 1 −λi), thus providing weak inertial resistance to persuasive communications. Extended periods without open partisan competition made acquiring such political knowledge of little practical use. Parties’ limited public reputations also diminish the usefulness of party labels that voters in established democracies use as shortcuts in evaluating candidates’ issue positions (Downs 1957), issue ownership (Petrocik 1996), and traits (Hayes 2005). Second, partisan bias is also likely to be weak in new democracies (i.e., πi≈ 1 −πi) (Converse 1969). Since fully open party competition is new or renewed, most voters have weak affect for or attachment to parties. If party identification is a psychological attachment that crystallizes in early adulthood (Campbell et al. 1960), then few voters would have been socialized over the first few democratic elections. If party identification is a running tally of preferences (Fiorina 1981), then limited knowledge of parties’ platforms makes voters less able to align their policy preferences with the available options.         "
"13","Although voters are likely to be more vulnerable to campaign persuasion, on average, in new compared to established democracies, we might expect variation among three main types of new democracies. Introducing the two polar types helps frame Mexico's more nuanced situation."
"14","First, redemocratization after a relatively brief hiatus—perhaps less than one generation—in which old party labels are resuscitated or partisan competition revolves around issues that were salient in the prior democratic regime will enhance the relevance of previously accumulated political knowledge and rekindle prior partisan attachments. For instance, Chile's competitive party democracy was interrupted for 17 years by military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet from 1973 to 1990. Following redemocratization, many prior party labels reemerged and voting patterns implied a resuscitation of prior partisanship (Scully and Valenzuela 1993). Compared to other new democracies, voters in this context will be the most resistant to persuasive campaign messages (i.e., λi and πi should be relatively high).         "
"15","Second, democratization following long‐term fully closed authoritarian rule without party competition creates excessively weak party identification and thin relevant political knowledge. For instance, in democratic Russia and East Europe, all but the communist successor parties were new, as was the concept of partisan identification itself (Brader and Tucker 2001; Miller and Klobucar 2000). Voters in these systems should be the most vulnerable to persuasive campaign messages because λi and πi are relatively low.         "
"16","Finally, where democracy emerges after an elongated period of competitive authoritarianism (Levitsky and Way 2010; Schedler 2002), as occurred in Mexico (Greene 2007; Magaloni 2006), voters should be of two classes. The majority will have very limited stores of relevant information and weak party identification (i.e., λi and πi should be relatively low), like their counterparts in new democracies following long periods of fully closed authoritarian rule. Identification with the incumbent party (or the postdemocratization party most closely associated with the prior authoritarian regime) will be hollow for most since it can no longer dole out the jobs, political favors, and freedom from harassment that underwrote identification with it in the predemocracy period (Greene 2007). Many who identify with former opposition parties will do so without much knowledge of their platforms since fully open campaigning is essentially new. At the same time, a very small minority of voters will have high levels of political information and very strong partisan attachments (i.e., λi and πi should be relatively high), like their counterparts in cases of redemocratization. Strong identifiers with former opposition parties either supported them before democratization despite the higher costs of doing so or worked hard in the immediate postdemocratization period to acquire information about them. The minority of voters who strongly identify with the incumbent party do so in rearguard support for its authoritarian project (Domínguez and McCann 1996). This narrow slice of the electorate thus feels psychologically and programmatically close to its chosen party.         "
"17","As a former competitive authoritarian regime, Mexico thus presents a hard and nuanced test of the persuasion hypotheses. In the presence of unbalanced campaign information, we should observe more persuasion than in established democracies, but this persuasion should have differential effects across levels of partisanship. Specifically, we should observe (1) powerful persuasion effects among most voters who are exposed to an unbalanced media environment even when they profess weak or moderate partisan attachments, and (2) resistance to persuasive campaigns only among the small minority of strong partisans. Before testing these predictions, the next section shows that the campaigns did strongly affect vote choices.         "
"18","The outcome of Mexico's hard‐fought and consequential 2006 presidential election could not have been forecasted ahead of time. It pitted promarket Felipe Calderón of the National Action Party (PAN) against Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) who vociferously criticized free trade, privatization, and the market's ability to deliver social justice. The consequences of electing one or the other meant either joining the ranks of the rising Latin American left or continuing as the standard‐bearer of the “Washington Consensus.” In the battle between these two front‐runners—a battle narrowly won by Calderón—Roberto Madrazo of the formerly dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) was reduced to an also‐ran."
"19","In this section, I show that vote intentions changed substantially during the 2006 campaigns and that the campaigns did not simply reinforce voters’ preferences or help them choose in‐line with their precampaign dispositions but rather converted many voters away from their “natural” candidate to vote for another. Demonstrating the extent of the campaigns’ effects on vote choices is a necessary prelude to explaining these effects in the following section."
"20","The poll of polls in Figure 1 shows that vote intentions for Calderón rose steadily until May and then declined somewhat in the final two months before the July 2 election. Support for López Obrador was on the upswing until mid‐February and then declined steadily until May, when he began to recover slightly. Support for Madrazo was low and continued a shallow fall throughout the campaign. The figure also illustrates the virtual tie between the two leading candidates at the end of June, after which polls could not be published legally.         "

"22","Note: Lines represent locally weighted regression (“lowess”) estimates of 40 national sample surveys from November 5, 2005, to June 23, 2006, from El Universal, GEA‐ISA, Ipsos‐Bimsa, Marketing Político, Consulta Mitofsky, Parametría, Reforma newspaper, and Zogby (see Flores‐Macías 2009).                     "
"23","Although cross‐sectional surveys give a useful overall picture of movement in vote intentions, only panel data can illuminate the dynamics of individual‐level change. I use public opinion data from the Mexico 2006 Panel Study.6 The three‐wave national sample is roughly comparable in scope to the American National Elections Study and includes interviews in October 2005, May 2006, and just after the July 2, 2006, elections. During the nine months of the campaign captured in the panel study, a striking 33.5% of the entire electorate changed its vote choice at least once. Another 3.8% of voters who were initially undecided also settled on one of the candidates. Thus, at least 37.3% of the electorate was in some sense up for grabs.7 The magnitude of this vote swing dwarfs the changes measured in similar studies conducted in established democracies (Finkel 1993; Johnston et al. 1992).         "
"24","During the campaign season, votes generally flowed to Calderón from the other candidates and undecided voters. Table 1 details the source of votes won or lost by each candidate. Panel A shows the percent of the total electorate that intended to vote for each candidate in May, given October vote intentions. Panel B shows the corollary for reported vote choices in July, given May vote intentions. If we sum across these two panels to produce total flows between the candidates, Calderón added a whopping 16.7% of the electorate, netting more votes from October to May (9.4%) than in the last two months of the campaign (7.3%). His votes came more or less evenly from López Obrador (8.0%) and Madrazo (7.7%), as well as from initially undecided voters (7.2%), where he won more votes than all other candidates combined. In sharp contrast, López Obrador lost nearly as many votes as he won, netting just 0.1% of the electorate by July. He fared worse from October to May when he lost 1.8% than in the final two months when he began to climb back by winning 1.9%. In both periods, most of the votes he lost went to Calderón. Madrazo suffered the most during the campaigns by losing 4.1% of the electorate. Most of his votes also flowed directly to Calderón, and his losses accelerated after May. Overall, Table 1 shows a continuous flow of votes to Calderón during the campaigns.         "
"25","The vote swing documented thus far tells us little about how the campaigns affected vote choices in relation to voters’ precampaign dispositions. Without knowing voters’ dispositions before the campaigns, we cannot know whether observed shifts during the campaigns reflect a relatively benign process where voters flirt with another candidate but ultimately choose the candidate associated with their precampaign dispositions or a deeper process where voters are converted away from their “natural” choices. Determining the type and degree of campaign effects requires modeling final vote choices as the product of precampaign attitudes and preferences (measured in October) as well as changes in these independent variables during the campaigns from October to July (hereafter called change scores)."
"26","The vote choice model I present is used exclusively to document the magnitude of campaign effects, and it contains five sets of standard explanatory variables: party identification; an additive index of retrospective evaluations of the outgoing Fox administration that combines presidential approval and both pocketbook and sociotropic measures of economic well‐being;8 an index of positional economic issues that combines preferences over privatization of the electricity sector, commercial relations with the United States, poverty reduction, and the extent of the social safety net; an additive index of competence ratings concerning the candidates’ ability to manage the economy, tackle corruption, enhance public security, and reduce poverty;9 and voters’ assessments of the trailing PRI candidate's probability of winning to measure strategic defection. For all variables, I also include change scores between October and subsequent panel waves.10"
"27","If the campaigns meaningfully affected voters’ choices, then the change scores should be statistically significant and postmodel simulations should show that the campaigns converted many voters away from the candidate associated with their precampaign dispositions to eventually choose another candidate. I estimate the final vote choice model using multinomial logit and present the results in Table 2 (Dow and Endersby 2004). Twelve of the change scores are statistically significant, indicating that changes in voters’ attitudes and preferences during the campaigns shifted their vote choices.         "
"28","The models can be used to generate deeper insights about campaign effects in two ways. First, to assess the magnitude of the campaigns’ effects on vote choices, I calculated predicted probabilities for choosing each candidate from three model‐based simulations. One simulation sets all change scores to zero and thus generates predictions as if voters had not experienced the campaigns at all. The other two simulations use the change scores to measure the effects of having experienced the campaigns just through May or all the way through election day in July (Finkel 1993). As far as the model can discern, the campaigns from October to May caused Calderón to gain 17% of the electorate, López Obrador to lose 19.4%, and Madrazo to gain a modest 2.4%, yielding an overall shift of 19.4 percentage points in the vote margin (i.e., one‐half the votes that shifted among the candidates). The campaigns from May to July shifted another 0.4% of the vote (Calderón gained 0.7%, López Obrador gained 0.3%, and Madrazo lost 0.7%). Thus, overall, the campaigns moved 20.1% of the electorate. This far surpasses estimates that presidential campaigns in the United States shift margins by just two percentage points. This analysis also underscores the finding above that most of the campaign‐related vote swing occurred from October to May rather than in the campaigns’ final two months.11"
"29","Second, the model can also be used to discern how the campaigns moved the vote. Expanding on prior typologies, I describe a fivefold hierarchy of campaign‐related influences. The strongest influence, relative to others discussed here, creates conversion away from a vote intention that is consistent with precampaign dispositions to a vote choice that is inconsistent. The next strongest influence yields partial conversion that makes initially undecided voters vote against their precampaign dispositions.12 Conversion home results from a somewhat weaker influence that shifts voters from an intention that is inconsistent with their precampaign dispositions to a vote choice that is consistent. Activation is weaker still because it makes initially undecided voters come home to the candidate associated with their precampaign dispositions. Finally, reinforcement of initial dispositions connotes the weakest of the campaign influences discussed here. Campaigns that reinforce and activate, as they do in the United States (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Finkel 1993; Lazarsfeld et al. 1948), have small effects. Campaigns that convert do more. Campaigns that convert away can truly transform elections.         "
"30","To assess the type of campaign effects present in Mexico's 2006 election, I compare each voter's predicted choice based on her October precampaign dispositions from the model in Table 2 (i.e., the predicted vote when all change scores are set to zero) to her self‐reported October vote intention and July vote choice (Finkel 1993; Lazarsfeld et al. 1948).13 Thus, Table 3 presents a cross‐tabulation to operationalize the typology above. Voters whose October vote intentions and July vote choices were the same and therefore either both consistent with or both inconsistent with their precampaign dispositions are said to have experienced reinforcement. From October to May, the campaigns reinforced the vote choices of 69.7% of the electorate (i.e., 59.2% plus 10.5% from Table 3). Just 6.4% of voters were undecided in October but then activated to vote in accordance with their initial dispositions. Most strikingly, 23.9% of the electorate experienced some type of conversion, including 10.7% of voters who were converted away from their October vote intention that was consistent with their precampaign dispositions to a July vote choice that was inconsistent. Including the effects of the campaigns through July yields the same overall level of conversion but an even higher level of conversion away at 12.8%.         "
"31","The overall level of conversion in Mexico almost doubles the level observed in U.S. elections and the level of conversion away dwarfs findings on the 1940 and 1980 U.S. elections, where just 2% and 2.6% of the electorate was converted away, respectively (Finkel 1993, 15; Lazarsfeld et al. 1948, 102).14 Thus, unlike in the United States, Mexico's 2006 presidential campaigns appear to have deeply affected voters by pushing them away from their “natural” candidate to vote for another. Among voters who were converted away, 69.1% cast their vote for Calderón when both their precampaign dispositions and October intentions indicated a vote for another candidate, whereas just 21.8% converted to López Obrador and 9.1% to Madrazo, implying that conversion away played a major role in Calderón's victory.         "
"32","What, then, caused so much conversion during Mexico's 2006 presidential election? In this section, I show that most voters were vulnerable to persuasive campaign communications while only a small minority possessed partisan identities strong enough to resist being persuaded."
"33","Among the various ways that campaigns attempt to convert voters, persuading them to change their attitudes is perhaps the most difficult. Altering tastes represents such a deep manipulation of individual psychology that research on the United States (Bartels 2006) and Britain (Norris 2006) has only detected persuasion in small quantities and only under specialized circumstances (Zaller 1996). But where voters have weak resistance to persuasive messages, as many do in new democracies, asymmetric campaign information can create substantial persuasion. I adopt Bartels’s definition of persuasion as a “systematic change in prospective voters’ electorally relevant attitudes and perceptions” (2006, 82). One way to detect persuasion in sample survey data is by observing systematic shifts in explanatory variables and vote choices that are attributable to an external stimulus such as campaign advertising. The prior section dealt with the first half of this puzzle by showing that vote choices changed in response to campaign stimuli. After showing that Calderón dominated the information environment, this section demonstrates that these changes in vote choices owe to persuasion.15"
"34","Calderón and López Obrador made their campaigns into an extended argument about their capacity to deliver the highest level of well‐being to the most citizens through their distinct plans for achieving economic growth and job creation.16 Indeed, nearly 60% of the 871 mentions of candidate traits in 97 campaign spots focused on the same questions of capacity captured in the candidate competence index created above: ability to manage the economy, handle corruption, and reduce crime and poverty.17"
"35","The major candidates saturated the media environment with 167,499 television spots, averaging 1,034 paid advertisements per day from mid‐January to the legal end of the campaigns in late June.18 These messages appear to have penetrated deep into the electorate. Over 90% of Mexicans report watching television daily (Lawson and McCann 2005, 6), and in 2006 they absorbed specific campaign knowledge. At the campaigns' start, voters had trouble identifying the candidates’ main messages. By their end, voters correctly perceived that the Calderón and López Obrador campaigns focused on economic themes.            "
"36","Despite the amazingly large quantity of campaign advertising and its penetration into the electorate, the candidates’ campaign investments betray distinct strategies. While Calderón broadcasted his message through the megaphone of the mass media, López Obrador packed plazas in hometown rallies across the country. An analysis of daily newspapers shows that López Obrador visited 229 municipalities while Calderón and Madrazo visited just 135 and 143, respectively (Langston and Benton 2007, 18). Figure 2 illustrates the opposite for media presence: Calderón and his PAN party occupied 66.1% of the three candidates’ paid television advertising time during the campaign season, whereas López Obrador and his PRD party had just 26% and Madrazo and his PRI party trailed with 7.9%.19 Using the number of television spots yields almost the same proportions.20 Why the candidates pursued distinct strategies is beyond the scope of this article, but they are likely rooted in the parties’ different organizational forms and the left‐wing party's preference for mass mobilization over mass advertising, a common trait across Latin America's new democracies (Greene 2007; Hunter 2010).            "
"37","                                Leading Presidential Candidates’ Paid Television Advertising Time                                       "
"38","Note: PAN is Calderón's party, PRD is López Obrador's party, and PRI is Madrazo's party. Party‐based advertising refers to generic party spots that often included the party's presidential candidate's likeness and did not refer to candidates for other offices. Data include national and local advertising at any time of day. Pre‐January advertising accounted for just 1.1% of all campaign‐season advertising.                        "
"39","If voters possessed large stores of politically relevant information and strong partisan attachments, then the unbalanced information environment would have had minimal effects on the election. However, as I show below, many voters’ weak resistance to persuasive messages amplified the effects of Calderón's media advantage and created persuasion among all but the strongest partisans.21 I focus on candidate competence evaluations because the media campaigns explicitly attempted to manipulate these images and because the vote choice model in Table 2 above shows that campaign‐season changes in these variables had the largest effects on vote choices.22 Compared to retrospective evaluations of the outgoing PAN administration—the second most influential variables—changes in competence evaluations increased the probability of voting for Calderón by 42.4 percentage points and of voting for López Obrador by 53.1 percentage points.            "
"40","For two reasons, I focus the analysis on campaign‐related persuasion for the seven months between October and May rather than during the final two months of the campaigns from May to July. First, Table 3 shows that the campaign from October to May converted 23.9% of voters away from the candidate associated with their precampaign dispositions and including the effect of the campaign from May to July does not increase the overall level of conversion. Second, perceptions of candidate competence—the variables about which voters appear to have been persuaded—could not be measured validly after the election. The Mexico 2006 Panel Survey's July post‐election wave includes just one item related to candidate competence—perceptions of the candidates’ honesty. Because the left‐wing candidate, López Obrador, claimed fraud and sparked massive and sustained protests following the election, voters’ perceptions of the candidates’ honesty in July reflect their views of the immediate political situation rather than their reactions to the campaigns (see the online “Supporting Information” for details).            "
"41","Perceptions of candidate competence played a major role in final vote choices, and evidence shows that voters’ evaluations of the main competitors changed substantially during the campaign season. Voters agreed that economic problems such as poverty and unemployment were the most pressing national issues, but they disagreed about which candidate was most capable of addressing these problems. Figure 3 shows that from October to May, evaluations of Calderón's competence increased across all partisan groups whereas López Obrador suffered the opposite fate. The winds favored Calderón so much that even PRD identifiers increased their ratings of him and decreased ratings of López Obrador. The observed shifts are particularly notable for PRI identifiers and independents because these large groups of voters were not initially aligned with a front‐runner and were thus key for winning the election. Both groups rated López Obrador higher in October but Calderón higher in May. Figure 3 thus gives the strong impression that voters experienced the equivalent of a campaign‐related U‐turn.            "
"42","                Candidate Competence Ratings by Partisan Identification"
"43","Descriptively, these trends are consistent with the idea that Calderón's advertising advantage persuaded voters; however, an inferential model using panel data can yield much more convincing evidence by controlling for prior attitudes and levels of partisanship. If the predictions about Mexico's new democracy presented in the first section hold, then three findings should be evident. First, consistent with Proposition 2, Calderón's mass media dominance should have persuaded many voters to increase their evaluations of his competence and decrease evaluations of López Obrador, conditional on their reception of campaign messages. I refer to this as the campaign reception effect, which can be demonstrated with a straightforward regression model.            "
"44","Second, there should be clear evidence of partisan bias. As suggested in Proposition 3, in‐party partisans should increase their evaluations of their preferred candidate and out‐party partisans should decrease their evaluations of this same candidate more than they would have absent their partisan leanings. Thus, PAN identifiers should amplify the effect of Calderón's message by increasing evaluations of him more than they would have if they had been independents without partisan bias. At the same time, PRD and PRI identifiers’ evaluations of Calderón should fall below where they would have had they experienced the information environment as independents. Further, independent voters should be persuaded to favor Calderón because, although they weigh information about the candidates equally, Calderón dominated the airwaves. Evaluations of López Obrador should follow a similar pattern for in‐party and out‐party partisans, and independents should be dissuaded from supporting him. The degree of partisan bias can be demonstrated by comparing observed changes in competence evaluations that naturally contain partisan bias to predicted changes that are stripped of partisan bias using a regression model that controls for partisanship.            "
"45","Finally, and most importantly, the degree of partisan bias across levels of partisan intensity should vary so dramatically that we should observe two principal groups: a small group of strong partisans whose partisanship immunizes it against persuasion as it does in the established democracies, and a large group of weak and moderate partisans who profess a partisan attachment but are in fact persuadable. To show this, I rescale partisan bias to express the amount of bias among weak and moderate partisans compared to the bias of strong partisans. I call this measure relative partisan bias.23"
"46","To begin the analysis, I construct models of candidate competence evaluations in May using October competence evaluations, partisan intensity, reception of campaign messages, and the interaction of reception and partisanship. The empirical model takes the general form of the theoretical model introduced in (1) above.               "
"47","I use an inventory of answers to factual questions to measure voters’ reception of campaign communications. Existing literature about politics in the United States argues that this approach is superior to self‐reports of campaign exposure for two reasons. First, some voters may overreport exposure to the campaigns, thus biasing inferential models that include such reports as an explanatory variable (Vavreck 2007). Second, Price and Zaller (1993) argue that analysts should not simply measure voters’ exposure to campaign messages, but their ability to comprehend their partisan meaning, which they refer to as reception. To measure reception, I use open‐ended questions in May that asked which presidents nationalized the oil industry and created two well‐advertised poverty‐alleviation programs, the National Solidarity Program known as PRONASOL (1988–94) and Progresa (1994–2000). I also used an open‐ended question in July that asked respondents to name the three branches of government. I averaged across the two waves to create a single index of factual political knowledge.            "
"48","I measure partisanship through dummy variables for weak, moderate, and strong attachment to each of the three main parties. These measures combine partisan intensity and stability during the first two waves of the panel survey. Strong partisans are those who reported a strong attachment to a party in October or May and at least a somewhat strong attachment to the same party in the other survey wave. Moderate partisans were somewhat strongly attached to the same party at both waves. Weak partisans had some attachment to a party in one wave but identified as independent or with another party in the other wave. Using this measure, 20% of voters in the sample were pure independents, 49.7% were weak partisans (18.8% PAN, 13.3% PRD, and 17.6% PRI), 12.8% were moderate partisans (4.8% PAN, 4.0% PRD, and 4.0% PRI), and 17.7% were strong partisans (3.3% PAN, 5.5% PRD, and 8.9% PRI).24"
"49","I ran OLS regression models of candidate competence ratings on five multiply imputed data sets that were created to account for missing data.25 Results appear in Table 4. The fairly low continuity coefficients for both candidates’ October competence ratings indicate that, consistent with Proposition 1, inertia only weakly anchored voters’ assessments during the campaigns. As a result, competence ratings shifted in response to campaign reception. Assessing the campaign reception effect, partisan bias, and relative partisan bias requires more elaborate interpretations of the model, as described above.            "
"50","Table 5 demonstrates the campaign reception effect and clear evidence of persuasion in favor of Calderón. Entries show the effect, expressed as a percentage shift over the range of candidate evaluations, of changing campaign reception from its minimum to its maximum for each partisan group while holding all other variables constant. This exercise reveals three main findings. First, consistent with Proposition 2, the greater number of positive statistically significant shifts in competence evaluations of Calderón due to campaign reception means that the campaigns affected individual voters’ evaluations of him much more than of López Obrador. Second, these individual‐level effects also translate into important aggregate shifts in competence evaluations. Using competence rating changes across all groups to simulate vote choices from the model in Table 2 indicates that persuasion alone accounts for more than half of the 20.1 percentage point shift in the vote due to the campaigns from October to May. Independents and weak PRI identifiers were particularly relevant for generating this effect because they were the two largest groups in the electorate. As individuals in these groups received more persuasive campaign communications, they raised their evaluations of Calderón's competence by nearly 10 percentage points, but reception had no discernible effect on evaluations of López Obrador. These findings clearly support the argument that Calderón's larger investment in mass media advertising worked to his advantage.            "
"51","Finally, Table 5 shows that after receiving campaign messages, partisans increased ratings of their favored candidate and decreased ratings of their principal rival. This last finding is consistent with Proposition 3 and implies that partisanship biased voters’ reception of campaign messages. But how much partisan bias is present?            "
"52","To assess partisan bias, I compare the observed changes in competence evaluations from October to May that appear in Figure 3 and naturally contain partisan bias to the predicted May evaluations for each group once they are stripped of partisan bias (Bartels 2002). The predicted values are generated using the regression models in Table 4 by constraining the partisanship variables to zero. The observed change (O) in competence evaluations for voter i from time t‐1 to time t is O = Eval (dit) − Eval (dit−1). The predicted change (P) without partisan bias is . Thus, the difference between observed and predicted change over time can be expressed as a percentage shift where .            "
"53","Table 5 shows that partisan bias among independents is low for both candidates, as we would expect. A positive difference indicates that partisan bias moved evaluations above what we would expect if voters had no perceptual filter at all. Thus, consistent with Proposition 3, all PAN identifiers evaluated Calderón higher in May than they would have without partisan bias, and the magnitude of the deviation increases with partisan intensity. The same holds for PRD identifiers’ evaluations of López Obrador. Conversely, out‐party evaluations move in the opposite direction: PRD and PRI evaluations of Calderón and PAN and PRI evaluations of López Obrador are lower than we would expect in the absence of partisan bias, and increasing partisanship moves evaluations further below their respective predictions. Note that negative shifts in the difference do not indicate declining ratings, but rather a decrease relative to the expected ratings if partisanship did not mediate perceptions of the information environment.            "
"54","Finally, to show that partisan bias falls into two clearly identifiable camps, consisting of a small minority of strong partisans who resist persuasion and a large majority who cannot, I compare the partisan bias of weak and moderate identifiers to that of strong identifiers. This relative partisan bias is represented graphically in Figure 4. If partisan bias operated consistently across groups, relative partisan bias would rise linearly with partisan intensity. Yet Figure 4 shows a marked curvilinear pattern: relative bias is similar for weak and moderate identifiers and then arcs up dramatically for strong identifiers. Strong PRI identifiers’ evaluations of Calderón are nearly twice as biased as those of their evenly matched weak and moderate copartisans. Among PRD evaluators of Calderón, strong partisans are more than twice as biased as are weak PRD identifiers and nearly three times more biased than moderate identifiers. The curvilinear pattern is even more marked for evaluations of López Obrador. Strong PAN partisans are more than 12 times more biased in their assessments than their equally biased weak and moderate co‐partisans. The difference in partisan bias between moderate and weak PRI identifiers is tiny, but the difference between strong and weak partisans is over three times as great.26"
"55","                Relative Partisan Bias in Candidate Competence Evaluations, October 2005 to May 2006"
"56","While all groups demonstrate some partisan bias, there are clearly two camps: strong partisans and everyone else. Strong partisans are much more resistant to contrary political messages, whereas moderate and weak partisans are substantially and similarly susceptible to persuasion. As a result, large groups of voters were vulnerable to the messages deployed by the Calderón campaign between October and May and converted to him either by coming home or, more impressively, by converting away from their “natural” candidate and vote intention."
"57","The curvilinear relationship between partisan intensity and the partisan effect are not likely artifacts of survey design or my measurement strategy. The findings would be less convincing if my measures of partisanship involved a large conceptual leap between moderate and strong partisans, thereby artificially decreasing the partisan effect among moderate identifiers; however, the only distinguishing criterion between them is that whereas moderate partisans maintained a somewhat strong attachment to their chosen party during both waves, strong partisans expressed a strong attachment during at least one wave."
"58","The findings would also be less meaningful if my measurement strategy overestimated the partisan effect among weak identifiers. Since the survey questionnaire did not explicitly ask respondents if they considered themselves to be independent, the low partisanship category may include some true independents. Yet, since Table 5 shows less partisan bias for independents than weak identifiers, contamination would bias results against my hypothesis.            "
"59","A final possible challenge to my findings is more general. Partisan groups might hold fundamentally different concepts of what candidate competence means (Green and Gerber 1999). If true, then differences in competence evaluations might reflect underlying values rather than partisan filtering of media messages. I tested for this possibility with separate models of May candidate competence ratings using all the explanatory variables noted in Table 4 as well as age, religiosity, gender, and the economic policy preference index described above (see “Supporting Information” for details). I chose these variables because demographics often cleave the voting public into partisan camps and because the candidates’ polarized rhetoric on economic issues was a centerpiece of the campaigns. Only age reached statistical significance and had a negligible substantive impact. All other explanatory variables appear as in the models without value orientations. Thus, the curvilinear relationship between partisan intensity and partisan bias likely represents the true nature of how partisan groups receive persuasive communications.            "
"60","Existing research puts little faith in the power of election campaigns to persuade significant numbers of voters. Scholars of comparative politics tend to think of voters’ preferences as tied to their class, workplace, or ethnic identities, or that voting decisions are guided by the state of the objective economy. As a result, voters’ preferences are believed to respond only glacially to broad trends that campaigns can scarcely manipulate. Scholars of American politics provide a strong theoretical rationale for campaign effects, but research dating back 60 years shows that the real power of presidential campaigns to move electorates is small because voters’ existing stores of political information and partisan attachments immunize them against new and contrary information. As a result, victories are rarely made by campaigns."
"61","In new democracies, however, voters’ defenses against persuasive messages are less well developed. The absence of fully open party competition for extended periods leaves most voters with less relevant political information and without the prerequisites for party identification. If the myth of the independent voter in the United States is that true partisanship lurks even when voters claim independence (Keith et al. 1992), then Mexico's new democracy evidences something akin to the myth of the partisan voter: many voters who claim partisan attachments have sufficiently weak partisan biases that they can be swayed by persuasive messages.         "
"62","Weak partisan identities mean that campaigns in new democracies can have far‐reaching effects in at least four ways. First, election outcomes are more difficult to forecast before campaigns begin and substantial volatility in voters’ preferences during campaigns may produce come‐from‐behind winners more regularly."
"63","Second, persuasion can affect the content of mandates and thus the issues about which voters can hold elected officials accountable. In Mexico's 2006 presidential race, voters were persuaded to choose Calderón over López Obrador based on a valence issue rather than a set of positional issues about national policy. Thus, even though voters ended up choosing a conservative over a leftist with all the public policy differences that those labels imply, they did so mainly on the basis of the candidates’ perceived images. A mandate based on valence is murky at best and gives victorious candidates more leeway either to institute unexpected policies or to engage in the kind of policy switches that have plagued new democracies (Stokes 2001).         "
"64","Third, if voters are susceptible to persuasion, then campaign strategy is paramount. Persuadability puts a premium on communicating with swing voters rather than core constituencies and on mass media messaging instead of packing plazas with legions of the converted. Many parties in new democracies, but perhaps especially parties of the unreformed left, rely on electoral niches and dense but uneven local networks. Based in part on the notion that the left had a structural advantage in developing countries, the premier scholars of democratization argued that leftist parties would crush the right at the polls and cause instability in nascent democracies (O’Donnell and Schmitter 1986, 62–63). Clearly, there are many deficits that campaigns cannot overcome, including scandals, dismal performance by incumbents, and voter realignment due to shifts in their underlying policy preferences.27 But where voters have weak partisan identities, parties that use modern mass media campaigns may be able to overcome seemingly severe disadvantages.         "
"65","Finally, voters’ susceptibility to persuasive campaign communications in new democracies also highlights the potential importance of campaign finance regulations. Well‐crafted and enforceable rules for campaign spending limits, public financing, and measures that balance access to the mass media can level the playing field between competitors with asymmetric resources and thus help make elections into contests over national priorities and policies rather than image management contests. It was with this intent that Mexico instituted a dramatic campaign finance reform in 2007 that prohibits private financing of mass media advertising for political offices, proscribes the campaign period, and uses a formula to distribute publicly funded media expenditures across the competitors."
"66","Perhaps the most tantalizing reason to study campaigns in new democracies is to deepen our understanding of what partisanship means in these contexts. For the small group of strong party identifiers in Mexico, partisanship operates as a real perceptual filter that mediates the political world. But the vast majority has not acquired this perceptual filter. Will this weakly aligned majority come to adopt stronger partisan identities? Can campaigns create partisanship and, if so, will newly created partisanship also function as a perceptual filter or will it function as a running tally of voters’ preferences and attitudes toward political actors?"
"67","In examining the presidential campaign in Mexico, this article varied the parameters that limit campaign effects in the United States and other established democracies. Gaining more variation by studying campaigns in other new democracies with different regime legacies, social cleavage structures, and mass media systems will further help generalize and refine a heretofore fairly parochial campaigns literature."
